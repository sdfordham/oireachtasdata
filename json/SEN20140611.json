It seems alarming that the Taoiseach has chosen to tamper with the democratic process in such a way.  The Curtin inquiry, of which older and younger Members will recall, did its work in an exemplary non-partisan fashion.  The DIRT inquiry into the non-payment of the tax by the banks over the years is another example of where the late Deputy, Jim Mitchell, and his colleagues did an exemplary job in a non-partisan fashion.  One must wonder then about the necessity for the Taoiseach to tamper with the political process in such a dictatorial and authoritarian manner.  Whether it is a case that the Taoiseach dropped the ball with loose language yesterday or if it is in fact an underhanded sinister attempt to manipulate the democratic process, the public is entitled to an explanation.  This House is an appropriate forum for such an explanation.<\/p><p>It is also important we get the Labour Party&rsquo;s perspective on this.  While there is a leadership struggle going on within the party, the public is entitled to know if it stands over such tampering with the democratic process, particularly considering it was party to the legislation establishing the banking inquiry and the procedures and rules that govern it.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach stated he intends to change that process because, as he said, &ldquo;I do not know what your Members would do&rdquo;.  That is the profound insinuation that he must have a majority on the inquiry to ensure his terms of reference are those that are followed, not those as intended under the Act by the democratically elected Oireachtas.<\/p><p>We feel this is the most serious of matters.  It requires the Taoiseach&rsquo;s clear explanation.

I say this in light of the Cooke report and the fact that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, with or without that report, has been structurally damaged.  Garda morale is at a very low ebb.  The relationship that existed, and still exists, between the Department of Justice and Equality and GSOC leaves much to be desired.  The whistleblowers had no faith in GSOC and the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, treated them with disdain.

This is the appropriate Chamber in which to have the debate and if there is no progress in it within the next week or two I will raise it by way of amendment to the Order of Business.  While I will not table such an amendment today because I want to give the Minister a chance, she should come here before the House goes into recess in a few weeks' time and have a full debate on law and order and her plans to restore confidence in the Garda, GSOC and her Department.

Could the Leader arrange a debate on rent control, particularly on what needs to be done legislatively to bring about better security of tenure for people in the rented sector?

Some 4,438 new companies set up in the first quarter of this year, a 21% increase on the past five years, and one fifth of them chose to locate in Dublin 1, 2 or 4, including the \"Silicon Docks\" area of Dublin 1.

Some 18 months ago, I tabled an Adjournment debate matter seeking a third Taxing Master.  It would be the solution to the problem as it is cost neutral.

In our amendments, we propose the introduction of regulations to ensure that particular skin types are adequately catered for.  The Irish Cancer Society has promoted the identification of skin types and that people with specific skin types that are more vulnerable would not be permitted to use sunbeds on sunbed premises.  We also provide that a person must have a certificate from a medical practitioner that certifies that his or her skin type has been assessed in accordance with the Fitzpatrick skin photo type.  <br \/>I have no need to tell the Minister, who is a doctor, that the incidence of cancer is rising and is a threat to society.  My own mother, who is no longer with us, had skin cancer on three different occasions.  She had sallow skin.  It would be wise to embrace what the Irish Cancer Society is promoting.

During the Second Stage debate, Members from Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Independent groupings put on record their support for the Bill.  This is a very important Bill and I thank the Minister again for coming in to take the amendments today.<\/p><p>The Minister might recall that there was some discussion on the smoking ban that was introduced by the previous Government, which has worked effectively and no doubt will result in the reduction of the incidence of cancer.  No half measures were taken.  We can criticise the previous Government for the things it did wrong, but in the case of the smoking ban, it did what was necessary to do.  It faced strong lobbying from the Licensed Vintners Association and from the tobacco industry and vested interests and held firm and went for a full ban on smoking.  I think that was the right thing to do.  I wish to draw a comparison to what is happening here today.  The Minister is introducing an important Bill that will have a significant impact in reducing cancer levels by regulating the use of sunbeds, but the Bill does not go far enough.  <\/p><p>The amendments are fairly straightforward.  They provide that a person who wishes to use a sunbed must provide the owner, manager or employee with a certificate from a medical practitioner stating that the Fitzpatrick skin photo type classification system was used to assess his or her skin type.<\/p><p>The amendments seek to prohibit people with fair skin, and I fall into that category and perhaps the Minister would fall into the same category, people with type 1 or type 2 skin types from using sunbeds.<\/p><p>During the debate on Second Stage we all agreed that skin cancer is on the rise in Ireland and that far too many are suffering from skin cancer.  Skin cancer is the most common cancer in Ireland.  In 2010, 9,450 people were diagnosed with skin cancer and of these 896 were diagnosed with melanoma, which is the most serious form of skin cancer.  It is projected that by 2040, the number will double.  We have a responsibility to do the right thing and put people's health first.  There are, in my view, people who are misguided on the use of sunbeds.  Some might argue that they have a right to use them and that it is a matter of personal choice.  We have a duty of care to people's heath.  We have tabled the amendments in good faith and I hope the Minister will support them.  If he does not support them, I have no doubt that we will initiate another Bill to amend this legislation.  <\/p><p>Should the Minister have a problem with the amendments, will he explain the problems and the reason he is unable to accept them and whether he will be able to deal with them at a future point.  Regardless of whether the amendments are accepted, I will be supporting the Bill.  I noted on Second Stage that the Minister also introduced legislation on smoking, which I support.

Any tanning is evidence of damage to the skin.  They would not want to give a certificate to anybody in their full health to say they were fit to smoke cigarettes.  Senator Cullinane's point was there were no half measure when the smoking ban was introduced.  They did not ban the sale of cigarettes.  They did ban the sale of cigarettes to people with chronic obstructive airways disease, asthma or cystic fibrosis.  We live in a free country.  Adults are entitled to exercise freedom of choice.<\/p> <p>We must be very clear in raising awareness so that people have the full information when they exercise their right to choose to smoke, to use a sunbed or to eat foods with a certain calorie content.  I believe the consumer is free to make a choice.  We live in a democracy.  We do not live in a nanny state.<\/p><p>I will try to explain this in the least controversial or confrontational way that I can.  I think the public is with us on these things in a major way.  Some 80% of people supported the smoking ban and support what we are doing in relation to plain packaging.  I was pleased to get that proposal through the Cabinet yesterday.  If we are seen to go too far, in terms of interfering with people's freedoms, we will lose them.  If we are overly zealous, and we insist on removing people's rights in certain areas, I think we will get ourselves into trouble.  I am not in favour of interfering with the right of people to exercise choice.  People need to make informed decisions and to be sensible.  We need to continue to raise awareness.<\/p><p>Senator MacSharry's reference to his mother's sallow skin illustrates the difficulty that would be associated with basing a prohibition on skin type.  Sallow skin would not necessarily be categorised as skin type 1 or 2.  Aside from all the administrative and other problems that would be caused by the measure that is proposed, as a doctor I do not believe I have the right to tell a patient what he or she can or cannot do.  I can advise them of what the consequences of different actions would be if they were to choose them.  I can hope they are sensible enough to take that advice.  As a politician and as a democrat, I do not believe we should go into that area.<\/p><p>I would like to express my gratitude to all the Members who have tabled amendments.  I thank them for showing an interest in the Bill and expressing general support for it.  I think it shows that the Oireachtas as a whole can and does work, that it has people's public health at heart, that it is trying to protect citizens from harm and, most importantly, that it is prepared to fight to protect our children's health.  As part of our duty of care to our children, we must take actions to protect them.  When they are old enough to make their own decisions as adults, that is another day's work.  Cigarettes are very different in this regard.  If a person is already addicted to them by the time he or she reaches the age of 18, can he or she choose to exercise one's judgment at that stage?  He or she is already addicted.<\/p><p>On that basis, I cannot accept either amendment.  I hope the Senators will understand that.  I thank them for their expressions of support for the Bill before the House, notwithstanding the Irish Cancer Society's proposed amendment.  I rarely find myself at odds with the Irish Cancer Society.  On this occasion, I think that what it is seeking might represent a step too far.  Ten, 20, or 30 years from now, perhaps society will have changed and we will have a much more paternalistic approach to life, for lack of a better word, than we do at present.

There were 400 newly diagnosed cases of malignant melanoma in Ireland in 1998.  That number had increased dramatically to 800 by 2008 and to 1,100 by 2010.  Other kinds of skin cancer which are less life-threatening, but are still life-threatening and can certainly be disfiguring, and the treatment of which can pose health consequences, are also increasing.  There is a critical need for us to tackle this problem, for example by means of an aggressive education campaign targeted at those who are most vulnerable.<br \/>I would like to explain why I support this Bill.  I acknowledge that people have a right to make bad choices about their own health.  People have the right to sit in the sun and sizzle and burn if they wish.  However, we have an obligation to inform them off the foolhardiness of that position.  Adults have the right to go tanning parlours if they wish.  However, no one has the right to profit commercially from deliberately causing someone else to be exposed to a carcinogenic influence.  This is the fundamental logic we have used in our attempt to get Governments in Europe to commit to a long-term policy of criminalising the for-profit commercial sale of tobacco products, or indeed any commerce in such products.  No civil or human right to engage in such activity exists.  If one wants to grow tobacco in one's back garden and roll it up for one's own use, that is fine.<br \/>No one has a God-given or constitutional right, or any kind of right, to profit from giving someone an addictive carcinogen.  I believe the same logic applies in this case.  No business has a right to do something which is clearly without health benefit and is clearly very dangerous for someone who is very vulnerable.  To approach it from a psychological perspective, there is a literature which suggests the possibility that there is a low level of addiction to suntanning.  There are people who suspend their own logical faculties and make bad decisions because they have become addicted to something that somebody else encouraged them to use for their own profit.<br \/>At the moment, the only professional interaction that a foolhardy, bad, poorly, pale-skinned, red-haired and freckled Irish person has when he or she is deciding whether to go to a tanning parlour is the advice that he or she receives from the fellow who is flogging the time on the bed and therefore has a dog in the fight.  This legislation would at least impose an obligation on such a person to see a doctor and get medical advice about it.  One of the best ways of dealing with this is for people who have had melanoma to start suing tanning parlours.  That is the way to do it.  I hope people will start doing that some day.  If someone has a note from his or her doctor saying that he or she has been cautioned explicitly about the specific and quantifiable risks to health associated with doing something as foolish as this for somebody else's profit, that might well provide a degree of indemnity and immunity against prosecution.  It is something I believe the industry should embrace.<br \/>I will support this amendment eagerly.  I suggest to my colleagues that they should press it today because it is important.  I believe it enhances a good Bill.  As the Minister knows, I am not sure where the Bill was for a while.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment two terms ago because I feel very strongly about it.  I see an awful lot of malignant melanoma in my practice.  I see an awful lot of unbelievable tragedies that result from this disease, which disproportionately affects young people and young middle-aged people.  We need to do everything in our power to eliminate it.  This is a step along the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100010#K00200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1402486500,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I am disappointed that the Minister cannot accept these amendments.  While we will support this Bill, we will also press the amendments.  I agree that in his capacity as a doctor, the Minister should not prescribe how people act - what they can or cannot do.  All he can do is advise them.  However, he is in this Chamber in his capacity as a Government Minister who is responsible for determining regulations and for legislating.  There are many examples of areas in which the Oireachtas has legislated to provide regulations to protect people's health and discourage them from particular activities.<br \/>The Minister said in response to Senator Cullinane that the smoking ban was not a final solution to the cigarette problem because we did not ban the sale of cigarettes to various groups of people, such as those with cystic fibrosis.  We did not ban tobacco from the country.  If we knew many years ago what we know now about tobacco, we would not have let it into the country.  If it was a new invention, we would not permit it.  That is a fact.  I am sure we could say the same thing about many other products.  It is a fact that certain people should not use sunbeds.  If the wording of this amendment is a problem, the Minister's officials in his Department should come up with a form of wording that will work better.  The fact is that these people should not be using sunbeds.<br \/>The Oireachtas has a responsibility to provide guidelines and regulations to society, within which free will still exists.  If I wanted to buy six Ventolin inhalers in a chemist shop tomorrow, I could not do so because it is against the law.  If I consumed the contents of six inhalers, I would do damage to myself.  I might want to use my free will to expose myself to six Ventolin inhalers, but it is prescribed in law that I may not do so.  I am sure many other drugs and various things are regulated in such ways.  It is right that one cannot get certain drugs without a prescription.  We are seeking to provide for the same thing in this case.  Certain people should be allowed to use sunbeds.<\/p> <p>I agree that no doctor would want to certify anyone to use a sunbed any more than he or she would want to certify a person to abuse alcohol or, as the Minister has rightly said, to smoke cigarettes.  Excellent work is being done today and we could finish it off with these suggestions.  The Irish Cancer Society has no vested interest other than the protection of people and preventing them from having to go to Senator John Crown's practice or to the practices of other cancer specialists.  The motives behind the legislation are noble, whereas the motive of the tanning bar proprietor - one cannot blame him or her - is cash.  Anyone in such a business is not going to say to a prospective customer that his or her complexion is very pale, which would give rise to concerns about the impact of a sunbed on the person and that he or she should spend his or her money somewhere else.  That will not happen.  It will be a case of the customer coming in, telling them what they want, their turning it up high for 15 minutes, and telling the customer they should definitely go for it and that they will look great on their wedding day.  There is no reason for us not to do that.  We will press the amendments on that basis.  We will support the Bill but we will press both amendments to a vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100010#K00300","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402487100,"counter":56,"content":"<p>My intention was not to disagree strongly with the Minister because we support the substance of the Bill, but I take exception to his response to the amendments.  He has entirely missed the point.  I do not agree with the Minister's analysis or the analogies he gave.  Senator Crown hit the nail on the head when he spoke about people who would profit from the provision of sunbeds for commercial use.  The wording of the amendments refers to the owner, manager or employee of a sunbed business and outlines that a person shall not sell or hire or offer for sale or hire, or permit to be sold or hired or offered for sale or hire, a sunbed.  The amendments seek to prevent those who allow people to use sunbeds for profit to expose people unnecessarily to cancer.  We seek to prevent those who are most at risk from using a sunbed.<\/p><p>The Minister said he did not want the legislation to appear to be indicative of a nanny state.  He referred also to democracy and freedom of choice.  If he were to follow through on the logic he would allow a person to drink and drive, smoke in a bar and, as Senator MacSharry said, to get any amount of medicine without the use of prescription.  We introduce such restrictions to protect people.  One is asked a series of questions by a chemist before one is allowed to purchase Nurofen or other medications which were previously freely available.  The situation advances all the time and we take measures not out of any sense of the nanny state but because it is the right thing to do.  It is not a question of democracy.  It is genuinely democratic if we as Oireachtas Members take a decision to protect the most vulnerable people from using sunbeds.  I refer to people with type 1 and type 2 skin.<\/p><p>There is a flaw in the Minister&rsquo;s argument when he said that no GP would want to prescribe the use of a sunbed.  That is not what would be asked of a GP if the amendments were accepted.  We simply require that either a GP or other qualified person would carry out a skin assessment test to determine a person&rsquo;s skin type.  As legislators we would then prohibit people who are most at risk from using sunbeds.  That is the change we seek to make.  To describe the amendments as being in some way silly, suggestive of a nanny state or undemocratic is fundamentally flawed.  If the Minister were to follow the same logic, we would not do a lot of things.  I hope the Minister is wrong and that if we have a new Minister for Health or a new Government eventually, they will go a step further and ensure we protect people with certain skin types from the use of sunbeds that would unnecessarily expose them to cancer.

We would perhaps not accept the amendments in any event on the grounds of constitutionality.

Our concern is to protect them from the harmful effects of sunbeds and from getting addicted to cigarettes before they are 18 years of age.  When they are old enough, however, they can make those choices for themselves.  Until then we must protect them, which is what this Bill is about.  These amendments, on the other hand, are about telling adults they cannot engage in a particular practice.  The reality, however, is that they have a right under our Constitution to do so.

We must continually drive home the message regarding the harmful effects of sunbed usage.  We have included a prohibition in the Bill on claims being made by sunbed operators that their use has a health benefit by, for instance, providing vitamin D.  We are insisting that all operators go through a form with customers to ensure they understand the risks.  We have stipulated that all premises containing tanning equipment must display warning signs that it is against the law to allow a person aged under 18 to use a sunbed on those premises or to hire or sell a sunbed to such persons, and that sunbed use will increase the risk of cancer, damage the skin and possibly damage the eyesight.  There will be plenty of warnings to people about the risks involved.  However, in this country, as in most right-thinking democracies, we do not remove people's right to exercise their own choice, regardless of whether their choice is harmful to them.<br \/>We have had a very good debate on this issue and it will be a pity to divide on these amendments.  I hope the message goes out that the Oireachtas is absolutely committed to protecting people's health, particularly children's health, but we will not interfere with the constitutional rights of citizens.  Senator Cullinane asked whether we can legislate for certain things.  The answer is that we can legislate for anything, but some things, if we introduce them in legislation, are very likely to be struck down by the courts.  Moreover, why introduce a law that would risk losing much of the goodwill that exists towards the initiatives we are taking in the interests of public health?<br \/>The Senators are aware of my view, as Minister for Health and as a doctor, that we must stop paying lip service to prevention and begin actually paying for it.  That is what we are seeking to do with this Bill, the tobacco Bill and the Bills to come on the sale of alcohol and, if needs be, to make the display of calorie information a legal requirement.  In the latter case, I would much prefer to see that happen by way of a voluntary code.  Indeed, moves in that direction are starting to gather pace.  I congratulate the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on its MenuCal initiative, which is a world first.  Its website, <i>menucal.ie<\/i>, explains very simply how to calculate the number of calories in a meal one has prepared.  It is a useful tool for small restaurant and caf&eacute; owners who are concerned about the cost of providing calorie information to customers.<br \/>All I want is for people to be able to make an informed choice.

We know that by 2040 there will be a doubling of the incidence of cancer in this country.  That is an absolute reality.  These amendments are seeking to minimise that increase by protecting people who are most at risk of skin cancer.  It is not about singling people out for the sake of it.  It is a fact that people with a certain skin type are more vulnerable to developing skin cancer as a result of using sunbeds.  The question we must ask ourselves is whether the provisions we have proposed in these amendments would save lives and result in lower cancer rates.  If the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;, then accepting the amendments is the right thing to do.  If the Bill is passed without these amendments, we will have better regulation and some degree of improvement on the current situation.

A person with light skin, red hair and freckles can sit in the sun if he or she wishes and nobody is stopping him or her from doing so.

This should mean that former prisoners are excluded but the Bill specifically states that sentences must have expired.

I am sure the Minister is well aware of the concerns about full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and all the commitments made heretofore.  We have been quite vocal on the fact that a number of political events have taken place in the North in recent months that have brought into question the full commitment to implementing the Good Friday Agreement and the position of some of the former combatants in the North and in the Troubles.  It is important to copperfasten the position of the former combatants and the former prisoners in the legislation and, therefore, that is the reason we are pushing this amendment.

As I said on Second Stage, it is excellent that we are at this point in respect of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill.  We have to ensure the legislation is on the Statute Book.  There is an EU directive, the terms of which we have to meet by 1 December.  I am aware this amendment was tabled on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il where a good discussion took place and my predecessor explained the reasons he was not prepared to accept it.  I do not intend to accept the amendment either but I would like to reiterate the reasoning here to deal with some of the concerns outlined.<\/p><p>The first point is that the former offenders' regime in sections 33 and 34 is not a blanket provision covering all persons who fall within the ambit of the definition of former offenders in section 33.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have to identify individuals who are covered by section 33 and in respect of whom a Garda not below the rank of superintendent is satisfied that &quot;it is in the interests of the protection of society, and it is desirable for the purpose of assisting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigation of offences, to have a sample under [section 34] taken from the person&quot; for the purpose of generating and uploading the person's DNA profile to the DNA database. This is the first consideration before a request is made to a person to provide a sample.<\/p><p>There are also a number of further safeguards.  In the event that the person fails to comply with the request, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may apply to the District Court for authorisation to send a notice to the person requiring him or her to attend for the taking of a sample.  Ultimately, if the person still refuses to co-operate, he or she cannot be forced to provide a sample, although the Bill does provide that he or she may be prosecuted for failing to comply with a notice to attend to have the sample taken, but that is all.<\/p><p>The former offender provisions, which are relevant to the points the Senator has made, are also subject to the ten year rule contained in section 33(3). Broadly speaking, under that rule a former offender may only be requested to provide a sample up to ten years after the sentence for the relevant offence concerned expired.  The likelihood is that most so-called former offenders covered by the Good Friday Agreement would be covered by this ten year rule, given the passage of time since their release, although I appreciate there may be some exceptions to that.<\/p><p>That is the position from a practical perspective.  From a strictly legal standpoint, it would not be possible to make the amendment the Senators propose as it would result in the unequal treatment of two similarly situated individuals and, as a result, may be unconstitutional.  This contention is supported by the manner in which prisoners were released in this jurisdiction under the Good Friday Agreement.  While the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act 1998 established a Commission to advise the Minister regarding the release of prisoners by reference to that Agreement, no new power of release was provided in the Act.  Rather it enabled the Minister and the Government to treat the release of qualifying prisoners in the same way as the generality of the prison population.  I do not believe, therefore, there is any particular reason for treating persons released under the Good Friday Agreement differently from other former prisoners in the context of the Bill.  It is consistent with the approach that has already been taken in the State.<\/p><p>I believe that few, if any, of the group of former offenders with whom the Senators are concerned are covered by the provisions of sections 33 and 34 and, even if they are, they cannot be compelled to provide a DNA sample.  I do not propose to accept this amendment but I hope that my response will enable Senators understand the reason I am taking this approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100017#R00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1402489800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to her new role and I appreciate that she is picking up where her predecessor left off.

I understand that the amendment seeks to ensure there are appropriate safeguards with regard to such transfers.  I assure the Senator that insofar as the amendment purports to address mutual assistance such safeguards do exist and in fact go further than what has been proposed.  In regard to subsection (1), I understand the amendment would apply to persons acquitted of an offence in this State where a sample or profile is sought by another state for the purpose of investigating or prosecuting the person for the offence for which he or she have already been acquitted.  I am stating this as the wording of the amendment does not make that clear.  I draw the Senator's attention to section 132 of the Bill, which amends section 79 of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008.  Section 79 of the 2008 Act sets out the action to be taken when a request for identification evidence is received by the State.  Among other matters, a request can only be complied with where the evidence sought could be obtained if the investigation or proceedings in question was conducted here.  The request cannot go outside of Irish law.  There may be concern that a country could make a request that is not permissible under Irish law but the aforementioned section is clear in that regard.<br \/>In the circumstances put forward by the Senator relating to a person who has been acquitted, the prohibition against double jeopardy ensures that a person cannot be prosecuted in this State for an offence for which he or she have been previously acquitted.  Consequently, it would not be in accordance with section 79(1) to transfer the evidence for similar purposes.  To put it simply, if evidence cannot be sought for a particular purpose in this State, it will not be provided for a similar purpose to another state.  That is an important safeguard.<br \/>Subsection (2) of the amendment proposes to limit the transfer of DNA samples or profiles to other jurisdictions with which the Irish State has extradition treaties in place.  The basis on which this State engages with other states for the purpose of mutual assistance is the Mutual Assistance Act 2008 and prior to that the Criminal Justice Act 1994.  As the matter stands, assistance in the provision of identification evidence, which will include DNA profiles, is only available if the evidence is in the possession of the Garda.  If the evidence is not in the possession of the Garda, the person from whom the evidence is sought must consent to it being taken and transferred.  However, on foot of the Prum Council decision, to which the Bill is giving effect, the Mutual Assistance Act is also being amended to provide assistance to another EU state where the request relates to a DNA profile which is not in the possession of the Garda.  Under article 7 of that decision, we will be required to obtain from a person a sample with a view to generating a DNA profile and transmitting that profile to the requesting state.  To provide for this requirement, sections 133 to 135 of the Bill insert new sections, 79A to 79C, into the Mutual Assistance Act.  These sections set out in detail the steps which must be taken in the State in relation to obtaining a DNA sample from a person who does not consent to the taking of that sample, including obtaining a court order for the taking of the sample.  However, as these provisions arise from an EU instrument, they apply only to EU member states.<br \/>Subsection (3) of the amendment concerns the obtaining of a guarantee that samples or profiles will be destroyed within six months of being transferred.  Again, however, the Bill amends the Mutual Assistance Act to ensure the necessary safeguards and destruction provisions are in place.  Section 132, paragraph (<i>g<\/i>) of the Bill, amends section 79(10) of the Mutual Assistance Act.  This subsection requires the Minister to receive an assurance from the requesting state that the evidence and records relating to it will be destroyed when no longer required.  Evidence must also be destroyed within three months of the date on which 12 months have passed since the taking of the sample and proceedings have not commenced.  Evidence must also be destroyed within three months of an acquittal, dismissal or discontinuation of the proceedings.  Destruction of evidence is also required within three months following proceedings which concluded with an order corresponding to a probation order or where subsequently a conviction is quashed or declared a miscarriage of justice.  I am entirely satisfied with these safeguards and the many other safeguards contained in the Bill and for these reasons will not be accepting the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100018#S00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402490400,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402490400,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Sections 110 to 172, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402491000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Schedules 1 to 4, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402491000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402491000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment and received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402491000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill do now pass.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1402491000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>This is landmark legislation and I wish to take the opportunity to thank Senators for their support for it.

I expect that this speech will be a lot shorter - closer to ten minutes perhaps.  If Members have any questions on it, I will try to respond to it, but it is straightforward legislation that I suspect needs no amendment. <br \/>I am pleased to introduce the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Bill 2014.  The scope of the Bill is narrow and involves minor technical amendments to existing legislation on the use and disposal of land on the Johnstown Castle estate.  Its primary purpose is to enable Teagasc to develop part of the estate comprising the castle and gardens as a visitor attraction and to permit the sale of a small area of land to the local community for a burial ground.  That involves two acres of land. <br \/>Johnstown Castle estate was gifted to the nation by private owners under the terms of the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College Act 1945.  The estate extends to some 980 acres and has been variously an agricultural college and a research centre.  The castle is now vacant following Teagasc's transfer to modern offices in another part of the estate.  The gardens and grounds have been maintained and open to the public since 1969 and the Irish Agricultural Museum operates a museum on the estate displaying agricultural artefacts.  Both the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the EPA have office accommodation adjoining the estate.<br \/>The bequest of the estate had certain user conditions in the form of a conveyance which provided that the property would be used by the State exclusively for the purposes of a &quot;Lay Agricultural College&quot;.  In January 1960, following commencement of the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Act 1959, use of the estate was extended to the conduct of agricultural research, and ownership transferred from the Minister for Agriculture to An Foras Tal&uacute;ntais.  The Act of 1959 also included a provision preventing An Foras Tal&uacute;ntais disposing of any part of the estate.  During the 1990s, it was found that the statutory prohibition on any disposal of estate land was overly restrictive and provision was made for the disposal of up to 5% of the estate for &quot;environmental, heritage, amenity or recreational purposes&quot; under the terms of the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Act 1996. The estate transferred to Teagasc in 1988 and is used for farming and agricultural research.  Teagasc is exploring the possibility of transforming part of the estate comprising the castle and gardens, which is no longer used for agricultural education or research, into a visitor attraction for the south east.  There is potential to develop the castle and gardens into a valuable tourism facility for the people of Wexford and the south-east region generally.  The estate currently attracts some 35,000 visitors annually, which is considerably less than might be expected considering its location and proximity to Rosslare port.<br \/>Teagasc has produced a number of reports which demonstrate that the estate has potential to attract visitors to the area.  However, this potential cannot be capitalised on due to the restrictions contained within the Johnstown Castle Act 1945 and the successive amendment Acts, which require that all 980 acres of the estate including the castle and gardens be used for agricultural education and research purposes. This is one of the reasons that I am bringing forward the Bill.<br \/>Separately, the local community in Murrintown urgently requires land for a burial ground and has identified 2.8 acres on the estate that would be suitable.  Teagasc wishes to facilitate the request but the existing legislation prevents it from doing so.  Again, a change in legislation is required to permit Teagasc to dispose of land for burial purposes.  Following examination of the existing legislation governing the estate, the Office of the Attorney General confirmed that enabling legislation can be introduced to extend use of the castle and gardens and to facilitate the transfer of land for a burial ground.<br \/>The Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Bill 2014 has six sections.  Section 1 provides for a definition of the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Act 1959, which is the Act being amended in the Bill.  <br \/>Section 2 amends section 1 of the 1959 Act to define Teagasc and the Act establishing Teagasc.  It also defines the map detailing that portion of the estate known as the castle and gardens for which change of use is sought.  This map was deposited with Ordnance Survey Ireland on 12 May 2014, where it is available for public inspection.  It is also available on the website of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  <br \/>Section 3 incorporates a number of amendments to section 3 of the 1959 Act.  Paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) of subsection (2) provides for the inclusion of burial ground in the list of specific purposes for which land may be disposed of on the estate.  There is no change to the existing 5% limit on land disposals.  Teagasc has already accommodated local interests by providing small land parcels for amenity purposes, as already permitted under the 1959 Act, as amended.  Paragraph (<i>b<\/i>) is an entirely new provision which provides that the part of the estate delineated on a map and comprising the castle and gardens may be used for &quot;heritage, tourism, amenity or recreational&quot; purposes.  This provision provides a statutory basis for the development of the castle and gardens as a visitor attraction.  They are largely of no use in their current state and it is recognised that preservation for future generations requires Teagasc to find alternative uses outside the agricultural sphere.  There are also significant maintenance costs of &euro;300,000 per annum which are not covered by admission charges to the estate - in other words, it is a very expensive asset to upkeep even though we have a responsibility to do so because it was gifted to the state.  Teagasc is preparing an &quot;outline plan&quot; to precisely define the project scope and estimate the full cost of transforming the castle and gardens into a visitor attraction.  It is being assisted by the Office of Public Works and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to leverage their experience and expertise in developing heritage and conservation projects.  The plan will be subject to a full capital appraisal in accordance with Government guidelines before any expenditure takes place.<br \/>Paragraph (<i>c<\/i>) permits Teagasc, subject to the consent of the Minister, to lease the castle and gardens or any portion of that part for &quot;heritage, tourism, amenity or recreational&quot; purposes.  This is another new provision permitting Teagasc to lease the castle and gardens or part thereof to another organisation to manage it as a visitor destination on behalf of Teagasc if it deems it the most appropriate and efficient way in which to operate the property as a visitor destination.  Any lease will be subject to the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In other words, it is not Teagasc's core business to run a tourism location or a leisure facility.  I suspect that, if it is developed for that, it may well be leased to a professional operator of such a business.  Paragraph (<i>d<\/i>) is a re-enactment of the existing provisions.  Subsection (3) prevents change of use of the estate from anything other than the purposes set out in subsection (2).<br \/>Section 4 inserts a new section 3A into the 1959 Act to set out the provisions in relation to the map showing the area of the castle and gardens for which change of use is being made in order to separate it from the rest of the estate.  It provides for depositing of the map in the Central Office of the High Court and the Circuit Court Office for the County of Wexford after the passing of the Bill.  It also provides for retention of the map in the office of Ordnance Survey Ireland and that it will be available there for inspection free of charge.<\/p> <p> Section 5 inserts a new subsection in section 4 of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advisory) Act 1988 which outlines the principal functions of Teagasc who own and operate the estate.  As currently constructed, the existing provisions do not allow Teagasc to operate and develop the estate as a visitor destination.  This amendment provides that, in addition to its other functions in providing research, advisory and education services to the agricultural sector, Teagasc may develop and operate the castle and gardens in the estate for heritage, tourism, amenity or recreational purposes, if it is appropriate for it to do so.  Section 6 provides for the short title and collective citation of this Act.<\/p><p>The Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Bill 2014 brings legal certainty to the future use of Johnstown Castle estate.  It is sufficiently restrictive to ensure that the spirit of the gift of the estate to the nation is respected.  Teagasc has informed the descendents of the original donors about the Bill and they have not raised any objections in relation to the planned change of use or burial ground proposals.  The Bill does not interfere with existing sporting rights and rights of way reserved in perpetuity to the donors.  The estate will remain in State ownership and continue to be vested in Teagasc.<\/p><p>The Bill provides a statutory basis for the long-term care, conservation and management of the castle and gardens for the benefit of the south east region.  Any such development can be expected to generate positive economic spin offs by enhancing the attractiveness of the area and sustaining jobs in the local economy through increased visitor numbers and so on.  Any proposed development will not affect the existing agricultural and farming research that takes place and will continue to take place on the estate.<\/p><p>There is no direct cost to the Exchequer on enactment of the Bill.  It is purely an enabling provision to allow the castle and gardens to be developed for tourism purposes and to permit the sale of 2.8 acres to the local community at a market rate.  I view the Bill as an opportunity to permit Teagasc to explore the potential of an under-utilised asset and permit the local community purchase land for a burial ground and so I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p><p>The local community in the area and Teagasc requested that I do this.  The upkeep of this property is very expensive.  Teagasc spends approximately &euro;300,000 per annum on the upkeep of the estate and the gardens.  This is a sensible proposal to try to create an economic return from that asset, to maintain the asset into the future, as I believe we have a responsibility to do, given its history and also to create something positive for the broader community both in Wexford and the south east.  I hope people will support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100021#W00600","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402492200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Request to move Adjournment of Seanad under Standing Order 30","time":1402492200,"counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100022#X00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1402492200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I have notice from Senator Crown regarding a motion he wishes to raise under Standing Order 30.

I am very happy to support the Bill that he has brought before us.  Johnstown Castle is an amenity in our area and as the Minister pointed out the community has enjoyed this amenity for many decades.  It also has been an amenity in the Wexford area as far back as the invasion of the Normans in 1169.  It also has a connection with history during the Cromwellian years up to Independence.  The demesne spans a period of time.<br \/>We should acknowledge the benevolence of the people who held many of the fine houses and parkland that are now public parks and gifted them to the State.  This was one such demesne that was gifted to the State in 1945.  I remember in my courting days, which is not today or yesterday, going with the lady who is now my wife to Johnstown Castle.  I was surprised when the Minister mentioned 1969, as I would have thought it was before that.  We are glad to have such an amenity in our locality.  I would like to recognise, as I am sure my colleague, Senator Michael D'Arcy would as well, the agricultural museum, which was started by Dr. Austin O'Sullivan, who was inspired to do this in the 1970s<b>.<\/b>He has preserved the materials and machinery that was used in the past and has built on it in the past decades, highlighting what rural life was like in Ireland in bygone days.  The museum was opened in 1979 by President Hillery and now occupies in excess of 1,600 sq. m.  I also agree with the proposal to make available to the Murrintown parish the 2.8 acres for a burial ground.  It has been seeking that for some time.  It started back in the time we were in government.<br \/>I hope the commitment from the State will remain strong and it will not relieve itself of the burden of the cost of upkeep of &euro;300,000 to maintain both the house and the estate.  The lands are extensive and the gardens, which include a lake, have been in public use by the people of Wexford and its hinterland.  It is important that would remain so.  The house has only been available on special occasions, when there were receptions.  It is a very fine house.  I would certainly welcome the development of the house as a visitor attraction to add to a number of other visitor attractions in the area.<br \/>I had thought of raising the issue of leasing the property.  The promotion and marketing of the estate will be essential.<\/p> <p>We also have the JFK Arboretum in County Wexford.  It is adjacent to where I live.  The arboretum's extensive grounds are used by many local people for walking and for bringing their children to the playground.  There has been great criticism over many decades that this facility has suffered from a kind of marketing deficit.  We have been unable to get any joy in this regard.  The arboretum and memorial park could be an amenity for the local people who are aware of them and they could act as an additional attraction for tourists coming to the area.  I refer to those visiting the area for short-term day trips and also to those spending a longer period in the locality.  It could become a much greater contributor to the economic foundations of our particular area.  I would hate to think we might leave Johnstown Castle with a similar marketing deficit.<\/p><p>I would like to suggest to the Minister that he could usefully look at utilising Wexford County Council in this context.  I do not know whether this has been considered.  The council has been to the fore in supporting, both from a human resources and a financial perspective, a number of projects that have emerged in County Wexford.  The county has built up an attractive base of good tourist attractions in recent decades, particularly in the last decade or two.  The Irish National Heritage Park, for example, attracts between 60,000 and 70,000 visitors each year.  It is being successfully operated by a company that is run under Wexford County Council, which initiated and developed the park on land that was vacated as a consequence of road development in the area.  I think the land in question, which is on the banks of the River Slaney, has been put to very good use.  The council has also developed Duncannon Fort, which is operated by another company established by the council.  A similar arrangement is in place at Fethard Castle.  This package of very good projects could usefully be combined with Johnstown Castle.  I suggest that should be considered.<\/p><p>I have a query about the development and operation of the castle and gardens &quot;for heritage, tourism, amenity or recreational purposes&quot;, as provided for in this legislation.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify the matter in his reply.  I note that there will be no direct cost to the Exchequer on enactment of the Bill.  This concerns me because I am wondering who will pay for the development of the castle.  Given that we will be competing with other such projects in the south east and elsewhere, I suspect there will be a requirement to spend a certain amount of money - on the capital side, in the first instance - to ensure the castle is as attractive an amenity as possible.  A little innovative thinking needs to be done before a decision is made on what the contents of the castle will be.  People will be eager to visit the castle.  It will be something of a jewel in the crown of local tourist attractions.  The Minister spoke about leasing the castle.  Has there been any fleshing out of the type of body that might be considered in that regard?  Maybe it is too early for that.  I suggest that consideration be given to a body like Wexford County Council, which has good experience in this area.  I would like to think that Teagasc would make some contribution towards the marketing budget, just as the OPW should be contributing to the promotion of John F. Kennedy Memorial Park, which is really not being promoted at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100022#X01800","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402492800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Suspension of Standing Orders: Motion","time":1402492800,"counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100023#Y00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1402492800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator Michael D'Arcy, I understand that Senator Crown is seeking the suspension of Standing Orders for today's sitting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100023#Y00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1402492800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I move: \"That Standing Orders for today's sitting be suspended.\"<\/p><p>I apologise to the Minister again for the interruption.

Everyone recognises that obesity is clearly the second leading cause, after smoking, of preventable premature death and ill health in this country.  It is also a colossal drain on the Exchequer.  This subject should be of interest to the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  It has been shown that in extreme cases where conservative measures do not work, this life-saving surgery adds years to the lives of people who have dangerous levels of morbid obesity.  The saved health costs associated with looking after people whose diabetes has been prevented or ameliorated - I refer to the avoidance of heart attacks, chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease and gangrenous legs, etc. - mean that this form of surgery repays all of the costs associated with it within three years.<\/p><p>In the history of bad and stupid decisions, this must be the worst and most stupid decision I have ever heard of.  The national centre that does most of this surgery in the country was finally opened in October as part of the Minister's much-trumpeted reorganisation of hospital services into groups.  Within a few months of the opening of the centre at St. Vincent's Hospital, having moved from St. Colmcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown, a memorandum has been sent by e-mail this week from the administration of the hospital to the surgeon in charge, giving no excuse for the decision to suspend the service immediately other than to say that sufficient money is not available to retain it.  Those costs will now be found mounting in kidney dialysis, heart attack and other units.  This outrageous decision needs to be dealt with urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100023#Y01000","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1402492800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Is there a seconder for the motion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100023#Y01100","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1402492800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I am happy to second the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100023#Y01200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1402492800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Does the Leader have anything to add?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100023#Y01300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1402492800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>No.  Given that the matter was covered in this morning's newspapers, it could have been raised on the Order of Business.

Some of the statistics the Minister gave us are interesting such as 35,000 visitors attending Johnstown castle each year.  However, this is nothing to what it should be; it should be ten times that number.  The Johnstown Estate comprises 1,000 acres, almost 2 sq. m.  I support the provision of a burial area and graveyard for the community of Murrintown.  It has been on the agenda for some time and I am glad this matter will be concluded for once and for all.<\/p><p>I have been critical of this and previous Governments for the lack of investment in facilities that could create jobs in my county, Wexford.<\/p> <p>The most recent statistics I received indicate there are 12 IDA Ireland-backed companies in County Wexford.  In 2011, they employed 2,060 people out of 160,000.  Wexford is not a small county but we have a very small percentage, some 1.3%, of IDA Ireland foreign direct investment jobs.  However, we are very good in some areas, one of which is tourism.  We are not the best in the country but we are good and we are improving.  The proposal will be a benefit to tourism in the county, but it will not just be a benefit in terms of this single stand-alone project in that there will be a synergy with other tourism facilities.  Senator Walsh referred to some of them.  They include Tintern Abbey, Ferns Castle, Dunbrody, the Kennedy Homestead and the National Heritage Park.  A marketing plan is required for all of them rather than for one or two individual sites.  Synergy is essential between all the sites.<\/p><p>The castle could be used for recreation but it could also be used for civil ceremonies for weddings.  Depending on the usage of the funds allocated in the 2014 budget, I would be hopeful the &euro;2.5 million would be used to the best possible extent without displacement.  If civil ceremonies take place, I hope hotels in the area would not be displaced by the provision of competition.  I would not like catering companies to be involved in providing full wedding facilities at the castle.  Other companies and individuals have invested in their corporate entities, be they hotels or other facilities for civil ceremonies, and after-wedding celebrations and I would not like Johnstown Castle to come into competition with them because there would be no competition.<\/p><p>The farm machinery museum is located at Johnstown Castle.  Much of the machinery would have been lost otherwise, which would have been a loss to County Wexford&rsquo;s heritage as a lot of it was built in the county at a time when the construction of agricultural machinery was common.  The Pierce Ironwork Foundry in Wexford town was a major company in that regard.<\/p><p>It is important that we support the areas we are good at.  Some counties are good at protecting heritage.  We have national heritage in the southern part of the county and a different version of tourism in the northern part of the county but that is a different debate which comes within the scope of another Minister.  There are other ways in which we must support tourism in order that we can employ people and get them back to work.  My colleagues from Waterford have beaten the drum for their area.  It is a catastrophe for people who lose jobs.  I am not indifferent to the 200 people in Bausch and Lomb who will potentially lose their jobs and the others who are faced with a 20% cut in their salary.  However, we must be proactive in other areas and ensure that the State can step up to the mark.  The State is stepping up to the mark with this facility which is badly under-utilised.  I hope we can use it in a better way.  I fully support the measure.  I doubt anyone from County Wexford would be against it.<\/p><p>I echo Senator Barrett in saying that a cost-benefit analysis must be carried out.  We cannot just throw money at the project, hold our breath and hope to God it will work and is a good idea.  It is a good idea, but synergy with other tourism facilities is required.  I hope that a potential marketing campaign for Tintern Abbey, Dunbrody, the Kennedy Homestead, the National Heritage Park and others will ensure we can bring more people to County Wexford and they will leave money behind and have a good tourism experience in the county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100025#AA00300","speaker":"1160","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402494000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>We will not keep the Minister ten hours as he reminded us we did on the previous occasion he was in the House for a debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100026#BB00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1402494000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I wish to dissociate myself from Senator Barrett&rsquo;s remark.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100026#BB00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1402494000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Senator Barrett should be allowed to speak without interruption, le do thoil.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100026#BB00400","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1402494000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  It is a very fine project.  I agree with what Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy and Senator Walsh - the Wexford Senators - have said but I have one caveat.  I know of cases where the terms of benefactions and bequests were altered and the new uses were unacceptable to the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland because they were felt not to accord with the wishes of the donors.  One was the change of use a building and the other was the change of an educational endowment for a different purpose.<\/p><p>It is a magnificent gift of 980 acres.  It is probably worth about &euro;10 million.  Did the Lakin family and the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests of Ireland agree with the change because the point was strongly made in both the Minister&rsquo;s speech and the notes that were supplied that the land was given exclusively for agricultural purposes?

Anybody who knows Johnstown Castle knows how extraordinarily beautiful it is and what a generous gift it was all those years ago.  The family is very happy to acquiesce to this new use of the facility and to see a way in which the place can be used for agricultural purposes as well as to continue the valuable work done by Teagasc, but also to have another capability, which is to give pleasure to visitors both local and international in addition to being able to provide a recreational facility, as Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy suggested, perhaps for weddings and other events.<\/p><p>In the scoping of the options we must take care not to throw the baby out with the bath water and ensure that Johnstown Castle remains a beautiful place to visit and that those people who take it on will be the right people.  I have no doubt that will happen.  There is no urgency that everything would be done by tomorrow morning which gives time to ensure that the right people would be employed to seek to bring value to the historical dimension of the castle which is what people are increasingly interested in, and that would fit with the museum that already exists there.  In Castlebar, there is great interest in the Museum of Country Life and matters from the past.<\/p><p>While we have this week wrestled with some of the dilemmas and dark secrets of the past, it is good to be able to celebrate some of our rural heritage and to see how that might be entwined into something we can celebrate and appreciate and share with our children and future generations while generating revenue in order to keep the castle standing.

The Bill amends the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Act 1959 and the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988 to include reference to a map delineating the castle and its gardens from the rest of the estate, extend the purpose for which land from the estate can be disposed of, and extend the purpose for which the estate can be used.  However, the existing limit of 5% in respect of land disposal remains in place.<\/p><p>Johnstown Castle is located close to Wexford town and was gifted to the State by private owners under the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College Act 1945 on condition that it be used exclusively as a lay agricultural college.  The use of the estate was subsequently expanded, under the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Act 1959, to include agricultural research.  The estate, which was transferred to Teagasc in 1988, comprises the castle, gardens and agricultural land.<\/p><p>Johnstown Castle is a leading research centre for soils and the rural environment.  The centre conducts research on soils, nutrient deficiency, recovery and losses, air and water quality, the agricultural environment and agri-ecology.  The research results generated are used widely by advisers, farmers, scientists and policy makers.  Teagasc conducts its research programme on the lands, with the castle and gardens no longer used for agricultural education and research.  As such, Teagasc is seeking to develop the castle and gardens as a tourism destination in the south-east region.  In addition, a plot on the estate is being development as a burial ground for the use of the local community.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister and the personnel in his Department for the work that has gone into the Bill.  It will have significant positive effects for tourism and heritage in the south and east of the country and will attract many visitors to the area.  I take this opportunity to note that there are several other historic houses located throughout the country.  My colleague, Senator Susan O'Keeffe, mentioned one outside Castlebar.  I remind the Minister of two in the north west, namely, Hazelwood House and Lissadell House, both in Sligo.  It would be a most welcome development if consideration were given to developing tourism ventures around those sites, which would have great benefits for local communities and the region as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100027#CC00200","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1402494600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the Bill he is presenting today.  It is some years since I visited the treasure that is Johnstown Castle, but it is wonderful to see it being maintained and redeveloped for the benefit of the nation.  I had one concern about these proposals, but the Minister has already put my mind at rest.  This concern related to the prospect of changing the uses to which a facility that was gifted to the State for a particular purpose could be put.  As we know, Johnstown Castle, which extends to some 980 acres, was gifted to the nation by private owners under the terms of the 1945 Act.  The castle itself is now vacant, however, and I am reassured by the Minister's reference to the enthusiasm of the relatives of the family who donated the estate for his proposals.

We fully support these proposals.  Since being elected to the Seanad, I have always worn a regional hat.  As a representative of the south east, I have promoted the positives associated with the region while also challenging the Government on the difficulties it faces.  Unfortunately, the south east has the highest unemployment rate in the country.  Last year, I undertook work on behalf of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to devise an economic development strategy for the region.  This involved visiting every county in the south east and meeting with stakeholders from enterprise groups, city and county managers, councillors, VECs, representatives of the institutes of technology, business groups, entrepreneurs and so on.  It was interesting to note that the two areas in which almost everybody agreed the south east could become a world leader were agribusiness and tourism.  It was noted, too, that there was scope to combine the two for the benefit of people living in the region.<\/p><p>In regard to tourism, work is ongoing to brand the south east as a regional destination, which includes promoting the tourism triangle of Wexford, Kilkenny and Waterford.  We hope this collective offering will add value and attract more visitors to the region.  A recent welcome development has been the opening of the new Waterford Crystal facility in the centre of Waterford city, in the wake of the disaster that was the closing of the plant in Kilbarry.  In a similar vein to what we are discussing today, I draw the Minister's attention to Mount Congreve Gardens, a gem at the heart of the region.  There have been difficulties with the facility in recent years to do with the trust that was established to run it.  The Office of Public Works is involved in trying to resolve that issue and turn the amenity into a visitor attraction that can be of huge value to the region.  It is one of the most impressive gardens in the world and I would encourage everybody to visit it when it reopens.<\/p><p>The proposals in regard to Johnstown Castle are welcome.  It is great to see that when the State is gifted land and property of this significance, scale and beauty, we do something constructive with it.  We all look forward to the advancement of these provisions.  The only caveat I attach to my support is that I would hate to see the castle and grounds being sold off at a future date to a private developer.  I very much hope it will remain in public ownership.  I realise that any such sale is not the Minister's intention, but it is vital that this amenity remains in State hands in the years ahead.  I acknowledge and appreciate, of course, that there is a cost involved in implementing these proposals.  This is a good initiative that links in very well with the overall strategy for the south east, which is focusing on agribusiness and tourism.  If this project attracts more visitors to Wexford and the rest of the region, it is good for all concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100027#CC00400","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1402494600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.<\/p> <p>I would like to take up a point Senator Cullinane made about the south east being a world leader.

Some people wanted a provision included in this legislation to allow us to sell more of the overall estate but that is not happening, and will not happen.  There was a provision in an amending Bill some years ago to allow for up to 5% of the estate to be sold for specific purposes.  That provision remains and is not being changed.  There is no threat of the sale of the house and gardens, which make up approximately 15% of the estate.  It may be leased to an operator who can run it efficiently.  It will certainly be part of State property.<\/p><p>There have been several surveys and viability studies done of the castle and its potential.  In 2007 a conservation plan was drawn up.  In 2009, the Buchanan report mapped out a three-phase development of the overall castle, which had a huge price tag.  The most recent survey, by Colliers, in 2013, for Teagasc, aimed to ensure that there is potential to get a return if we invest in the infrastructure.  This is not a pipe dream.  It is an estate, with castle and gardens that have significant potential to attract tourists and visitors who will contribute financially to see and use that facility.<\/p><p>We have two responsibilities.  I agree with those who have said that if the State receives a gift of this value we have a responsibility to look after it, to respect the wishes of the donors, and consult and inform their descendants about any changes.  My understanding is that has happened.  The exact wording the Senator asked for is: &quot;...Teagasc has informed the descendents of the original donors about the Bill and they have not raised any objections in relation to the planned change of use or burial ground proposal&quot;.  I specifically asked Teagasc to do that.<\/p><p>The Bill maps out a future for this estate.  The focus on agricultural research will be retained.  Teagasc and the Department will have a presence there and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has a premises adjacent to it.  The public use will continue intact.  We want to create a source of income and a justification for spending or investing money in the upkeep of the castle and the surrounding gardens and ensure that as many people as possible enjoy that facility into the future and that it adds to the overall stimulus of the economy in the south east.  There is a commitment of &euro;2.5 million in the Department&rsquo;s Estimate, through Teagasc, this year, if a plan is in place that makes sense, is properly costed and so on.  It may not be spent this year but we have provided for it.<\/p><p>This is not just a Teagasc proposal.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, the manager of Wexford County Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and someone from the Department have been planning this for some time.  This is not a simple project in isolation.  It will be part of a series of tourism attractions in Wexford and the south east, linked in with some of the other successful projects that Wexford County Council has been involved in.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Cullinane, the south east needs State investment and will, I hope, get it, subject to budgetary constraints, to fulfil the leisure and tourism potential of this estate.

It is the second time we have met this week and I am delighted to see him again on this basis.  Being appointed to serve as a member of the board of a public body is, in many respects, an honour.  Appointment on merit is an endorsement of the expertise of the person in his or her chosen field.  People do not accept appointments to the boards of State bodies because they are attracted by the pay and want to make money.  My first appointment to a State board was to An Bord Phoist, way back in 1979.  At the same time as An Bord Phoist was established, An Bord Telecom was established, and I asked the chairman of An Bord Telecom, Michael Smurfit, what condition he made.  His only condition was that he be paid &pound;5,000, in breach of the guidelines or strict rules that had been put in.  He had no intention of taking the money, but intended to give it to charity, as I did with my salary from An Bord Phoist.<br \/>During the 11 years I served on that board, there were no members who would have been unwilling to serve had the positions been unpaid.  There is no need to pay a person for serving on the board of a State body, although board members should receive an allowance and expenses, which is covered well in the Bill.  Those who want to be paid have no place on such boards.  An appointment to serve as a member of the board of a public body invariably brings with it the right to be paid fees for that position, along with the right to claim expenses.  When the economy was in good stead this may have been justifiable.  However, in the age of austerity, where people are having to do more with less, it is appropriate that we look at the boards of public bodies to see if greater efficiencies can be gained.<br \/>This Bill is not about saving a relatively small amount of money.  The objective at the heart of the Bill is to ensure that people who commit to serve on the boards of public bodies do so because they have expertise which they are willing to share.  Although very many of the people who serve on the boards of public bodies are experts in their fields and face many competing demands, they find the time to dedicate to the service of public bodies.  In most cases the fees paid to them fall well short of recognising the time, energy and commitment they put in, yet they persevere and give their all.  They do so because they are motivated by the goal of improving the future of the public body they serve.  For many, I suspect financial gain does not even enter the equation.  The service they give is the essence of public service.<br \/>Recently I have become concerned at the extent to which board membership of State bodies has become discredited and demeaned.  Recent events surrounding certain boards of public bodies - their memberships, fees and expenses and so on - have, regrettably, done a great disservice to all who serve as board members of public bodies.  The Bill seeks to go some distance towards undoing some of the damage caused to those who serve on the boards of public bodies.  While some may see it differently, this Bill is about recognising and safeguarding the role played by people appointed to serve on the boards of public bodies.  I know very many people who would like to be able to share their expertise with State bodies for no pay and no expenses.  However, many are deterred by the controversies associated with State body membership and do not wish to be portrayed as serving for the wrong reasons.  Rather than limiting the pool of talent available to serve on the boards of public bodies, this Bill will make board membership more attractive to a great many more people in society.<br \/>The Bill has three objectives.  First, it would preclude persons who serve on the board of a public body from being paid for their membership of the board.  Second, people who serve on the board of a public body would be entitled to be employed or engaged by that public body only if they file a declaration with the Standards in Public Offices Commission detailing payments received.  That is a very important aspect of the Bill.  Third, persons who serve on the board of a public body would only be entitled to be reimbursed for vouched expenses if they file a declaration with the Standards in Public Offices Commission detailing payments received.  Unvouched expenses would not be reimbursed.<br \/>The Bill highlights an issue which needs to be addressed and provides an appropriate and reasoned approach to resolving the problems in this area.  I urge the Minister of State to accept this very worthy Bill and see to its enactment as a matter of priority.  Recently, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, invited existing State board members to waive their fees if they wished.  While I do not have the answer, the Minister seems to share my opinion that people would be willing to consider waiving their fees.  We would have just as efficient, competent, capable and enthusiastic members of State boards even if they were not paid for their membership of State boards but were reimbursed for any expenses and costs they incurred.  I urge the Minister of State to give it every consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100030#FF00300","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1402496100,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and compliment Senator Quinn on once again bringing a Bill before the House.  He is one of the most prolific producers of legislation in the Private Members' Bill category.  It is an honour to be asked by a Minister to serve the State.  I have served on four boards without payment and one with payment.  We need public service, the practical patriotism Senator Quinn has described.  Many of us have talents because the State invested heavily in our education and it is a chance to pay back something when asked.  It is an honour to serve the public and the next generation, because we must repair much of what has happened in recent times.<\/p><p>It was interesting to hear that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, thinks board members should consider waiving fees.  Although the fees concerned are relatively small amounts of money, they, unfortunately, attract adverse comment and public odium out of all proportion, which nearly discredits the organisations.  While media comment may be ill-informed, it creates the view that Ministers reward their supporters, friends, pals or cronies - that dreaded word - by making these appointments.  This discredits the idea of public service because it is incumbent on all of us who have employment in other areas to offer something back to the State at this difficult time when we need to do so much better than we have in the recent past.  We still have to make up more than 200,000 jobs which have been lost since the peak.<\/p><p>People do lots of things as part of public service to their communities, notably through sporting organisations and schools.  It would be a great step forward if they were willing to serve when the Minister of State and his colleagues ask them to perform tasks on behalf of the country and I commend the Bill on that basis.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has tackled the expenses culture, and it is addressed in section 3 of the Bill.<\/p> <p>As we saw yesterday when the Companies Bill was introduced by the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sherlock, being on a board involves responsibilities that we may not have considered previously.  It is not an honorarium and it is not a reward for services done.  It is a job of work.  We have asked so many people to make sacrifices for the country and I think this will add to the list.  It will raise the status of boards and those who serve on them.  It will also help combat the negative views that appointments to State boards can attract.

At the outset, I would like to say that policy proposals from our colleagues to further improve the effectiveness of corporate governance in the public service are greatly welcomed.<\/p><p>By way of outlining the context to and current developments at Government level on the important issues raised in this Bill, I can inform the House that a revised version of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, last issued in 2009, is due for publication shortly.  The guide has been revised to take account of general developments concerning both the supervisory and monitoring regime between Departments and the State bodies under their aegis and guidelines to be observed by the boards of State bodies in matters of internal governance.  More specifically, the code of practice will include, for example, a checklist so that boards of State bodies can ensure compliance with the code on accountability for public money, reporting, audit, roles and responsibilities and standards of behaviour.<\/p><p>This Government has been pursuing a wide ranging political reform programme aimed at delivering open, accountable and ethical government underpinned by a transparent, efficient and effective public system to help rebuild trust in government and in the institutions of the State.  Many of the commitments in the area of political reform set out in the programme for Government and in the public service reform plan are now in delivery phase and real progress is being made on several different fronts.  This includes, for example: the extension of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction and powers; provision of a detailed legislative framework for parliamentary inquiries; the regulation of lobbying; extensive reform of freedom of information, FOI, legislation; and the introduction of legislation protecting whistleblowers.<\/p><p>I would further like to inform the House that an overhaul of the ethics legislation is now in hand in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform aimed at supporting and promoting ethical conduct, creating an environment in which ethical issues and conflicts of interest are managed effectively and corrupt and unethical conduct are severely discouraged.  Based on the work already done, it is clear that it is necessary to modernise the existing framework to make it simpler to understand and to administer.  There is a need also to ensure that a consistent approach is taken to ethics related processes and duties, right across the public sector as a whole.<\/p><p>In this context it is of interest to note that the World Bank has stated that a key lesson from experience in tackling corruption is that it needs to be addressed simultaneously on two fronts, prevention and enforcement.  Income and asset disclosure systems are gaining prominence as a tool in the fight against corruption and have the potential to support efforts in both prevention and enforcement.  This contribution is recognised in the United Nations Convention against Corruption, UNCAC, and other international anti-corruption agreements.  The World Bank has noted that a wide variety of approaches might be taken and a wide variety of challenges are faced by different disclosure systems.  It is of interest that its main finding is that there is no single optimal approach to design and implementation.  Context is essential and effectiveness depends on the right questions being asked and addressed at the right moment.<\/p><p>In terms of where this Government is currently at in addressing these critically important governance issues I can say that work on draft heads of a Bill to strengthen, modernise and reform the existing ethics framework are at a very advanced stage in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it is hoped to bring proposals to Government in the coming weeks.  While the amendments required are much broader than those provided for in the Bill before this House, the thinking behind certain of the proposals in the Bill will invariably have a bearing on them.<\/p><p>The intention is to refer the proposals to reform the ethics framework to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to request the joint committee's views.  This will provide the joint committee with an opportunity to consult with civil society groups, advocacy groups and individuals with expertise in ethics.  It will also enable the joint committee to provide input and to contribute to the development of the revised framework as envisaged in the Dail reform announced last September.<\/p><p>Turning attention to the Bill entitled the Public Service Management (Transparency of Boards) Bill 2014, I note that the central objectives of the Bill are: to preclude persons who serve on the board of a public body from being paid for their membership of that board; to ensure that persons who serve on the board of a public body will only be entitled to be employed or engaged by that public body in circumstances where they file a declaration with the Standards in Public Office Commission detailing payments received; and to ensure that persons who serve on the board of a public body will only be entitled to seek to be reimbursed for vouched expenses in circumstances where they file a declaration with the Standards in Public Office Commission detailing payments received.  Expenses that are not vouched will not be reimbursed.<\/p><p>The Bill defines a public body as an entity that is wholly or partly funded directly or indirectly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas or from the Central Fund or the growing produce of that fund and in respect of which a public service pension scheme exists or applies or may be made.  The Bill includes subsidiary companies where the latter pension provision may exist.  The list of bodies coming within the purview of the Bill would therefore include commercial State companies and non-commercial State bodies which are already come within the Ethics in Public Office Acts and the Standards in Public Office Act.  The Bill also proposes to bring those not for profit organisations in receipt of public funding and having public service type pension schemes within its scope.<\/p><p>I would like to begin by making certain comments on the issue of the payment of fees to board members.  This House will be aware that considerable work has been carried out by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in reducing the levels of fees paid to individuals for participation on the boards of State bodies.  Currently the fees payable to board members depend on the size and complexity of the State organisations they govern.  In order to determine what level of fee is appropriate, State bodies are divided into four categories, depending on the pay of their chief executives.  This rationale is regarded as being the fairest in terms of determining the appropriate fee payment to State board members.  Overall, the fees have been significantly reduced in recent years.  These fees were reduced by 10% in 2009 and, in the case of those bodies covered by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009, were reduced by a further 10% in 2010.  The current arrangements in relation to the payment of fees to board members is that they have been reduced significantly in amount in the period since 2009 and currently average in payment at &euro;18,788 for board chairs and &euro;10,421 for board members.  In general, for fees to be payable to the chairperson or members of a board an enabling provision in the legislation governing the State body concerned is required.  Such a provision typically specifies that members may be paid such remuneration, if any, that the sponsor Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, may determine.  It is the position that the payment of board fees is tightly controlled and monitored at central level.<\/p><p>Regarding public servants who are members of State boards, the one person one salary, OPOS, rule applies and fees are not payable to them in respect of their board membership.  There is however an exception to this restriction in that worker directors on certain commercial State boards are for legal reasons required to be remunerated on the same basis as other board members in respect of such board representation.  Since 2012 formal provision has existed to allow board members the option to choose to waive their fee payment and many do so, forgoing personal gain in the interests of the State.<\/p><p>The benefits to public spending of reducing State board fees have constituted but a small element of the financial contribution in the overall scheme of other remuneration reductions affecting public servants and can be said to have ensured a degree of solidarity in this regard.  It would be erroneous however to assume that such fee reductions may in some way imply that the payment of fees does not have a place in the provision of board members' services to the State. For the most part, while the fees that are paid to board members could only be regarded as a disproportionately small level of recompense for the work that they undertake, such fees nevertheless enable the State to continue to access a wider pool of candidates for State board appointments with valuable private sector expertise that may otherwise be unavailable to it.<\/p> <p>It is unclear as to whether this range of candidate would be available for board appointments were the board fee payment to be removed.<\/p><p>The proposal in the Bill to abolish the fee payment would represent a major departure from current practice.  It would constitute a move which has the potential over time to have an adverse impact on the economic profile of board members available for such State board appointments.  This is because the personal circumstances of the individual involved could, in the absence of a fee payment, determine whether they may or may not go forward for State board appointments.  The abolition of the fee payment is not in the long term regarded as being supportive of ensuring boards are composed of suitably qualified candidates drawn from a wide range of social and economic backgrounds.  In addition, and as already alluded to, there are certain legal constraints in regard to removing fees from certain board members such as worker directors appointed under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts.  Accordingly, for the reasons that I have outlined, it is not considered to be in the best overall interest of State organisations for the Government to support this Bill on the particular measure of its proposal to abolish the payment of fees to State board members.<\/p><p>I turn now to those provisions of the Bill that ensure that persons who serve on the board of a public body will only be entitled to be employed or engaged by that body in circumstances where they file a declaration with the Standards in Public Office Commission detailing payment received, or that persons who serve on the board of a public body will only be entitled to seek to be reimbursed for vouched expenses in circumstances where they file a declaration with the Standards in Public Office Commission detailing payments received along with the requirement that unvouched expenses would not be reimbursed.  In examining the call in the Bill for a personal declaration with SIPO, I think it would be useful to outline the current statutory arrangements for State board members in this regard.<\/p><p>The Standards Commission has a supervisory role under three separate pieces of legislation: the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2001; the Electoral Act 1997, as amended; and the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2001, which will be replaced from 1 July 2014 by the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2014 regarding the parliamentary activities allowance.  The function of the Standards in Public Office Commission under the Ethics Acts in so far as members of State boards are concerned relates to the disclosure of interests by State board members, guidelines for State board members on compliance with the Ethics Acts, and complaints and investigations regarding contraventions of the Ethics Acts or alleged specified acts within the meaning of the Ethics Acts by State board members.<\/p><p>State board members are required by the Ethics Acts to make statements of interests to an officer of the body determined by the Minister and to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Such a statement is required where the board member or a connected person, such as a spouse or child, has a material interest whereby they might seek to influence the board member to benefit themselves.<\/p><p>The supervisory role played by the Standards in Public Office Commission does not extend to the proposals set out in the Bill requiring board members to file a declaration with the commission detailing payments received in respect of work that may have been carried out by the board member on behalf of the organisation or reimbursement of expenses that are vouched.  While it can be expected that the generality of expenses claimed by board members will be, for example, for travel and subsistence payments, it is noted that the Bill draws particular attention to those payments that might arise from the conduct of business by board members with their respective State organisation and which are not explicitly addressed in current legislative provisions.<\/p><p>Taking into account the current statutory provisions set out in the Ethics Acts in respect of the declaratory requirements of board members, and having regard to the proposals in the Bill in respect of widening the scope of such declarations to include the detailing of payments received by board members on a vouched basis, I can assure the House that the proposals in the Bill will be fully taken into account in the context of the development of legislation to put in place a revised ethics in public office framework, which I referred to earlier.  While the Government will not be proceeding with this Bill due to the fact that its own Ethics in Public Office Act reform legislation is pending, it is nevertheless the position that certain of the proposals in the Bill will be closely considered in the context of drawing up a revised legislative framework in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100031#GG00200","speaker":"1042","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402497300,"counter":218,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's speech is quite balanced except for the last paragraph where the Government and the Civil Service need to get with the programme.  The Minister of State said, \"While the Government will not be proceeding with this Bill\".  With all due respect to the Government, it is a matter for the Seanad and Senator Feargal Quinn as to whether the Bill is proceeded with.  The Senator proceeded with Bills in the past that did not have Government approval or support.  Senators must assert themselves and let the Government know their views even though we are delighted that the Minister of State is here.  I am delighted with his balanced speech and agree with many of its aspects.  Proceeding with the Bill, however, is a matter for the Seanad and my party supports the Bill.  When Senator Quinn brings forward legislation, he does so in a genuine way to address specific problems.  His legislation has a great record of success that I think has not been equalled by any Member.  It is very hard as a Private Member to get a Bill through this House and the D&aacute;il, but he has done so.<\/p><p>I am glad the Minister of State has said he will look at this Bill in the context of the Ethics in Public Office Act.  Having said all that and having expressed our support for the sentiments and content of the Bill that Senator Quinn has put forward, I wish to raise some related issues that could benefit from being included in such legislation.  The first relates to the appointment to State boards, which is the nub of this issue.  I believe that if the system of appointments to State boards was completely open and transparent, and perhaps based on merit and public application, the public would not have as much of a problem with the payment of an allowance.<\/p><p>As has rightly been explained by Senators Quinn and Barrett, there is public odium and disquiet about the payment of an allowance due to the manner of appointment and the fact that these boards are seen as plum jobs for favourite supporters.  That is the problem.  If there were an open competition and people could apply for these jobs, I am not sure there would be much disagreement about paying members for their role.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn is right that there are many people who would be more than happy to carry out the role for nothing.  The problem lies with the transparency of appointments to boards.  I am not going to blame this Government for that but it has continued a tradition that has gone on since the foundation of the State.  Some Ministers have made changes and I know Eamon Ryan, who was a member of the previous Government, began to make changes.  Some appointments must, under statute, go through the relevant Oireachtas committee, which is a positive move.  Under the previous Government, the position of member of the RTE authority was advertised, which is also a positive move.  Transparency about appointments is the nub of the problem and is directly related to the issue raised by Senator Quinn, but I believe it to be a more serious problem.<\/p><p>I have one other concern that I discussed with Senator Quinn before this debate and it concerns the position of worker directors.  Section 3 of Senator Quinn's Bill talks about transparency arrangements for board members being employed or engaged.  I would not like to increase the burden on worker directors because they play a particularly important role.  I know from reading the guidelines that they get paid the same as other board members, but that is not the case in all instances.  Many people employed by the State do not get a payment for being a director, but that situation does not apply to worker directors for legal reasons.  I would not like to put too much of a burden on worker directors because they play a very important role in State bodies, a role that should be recognised.  I am sure that worker directors would have no problem with transparency and all the rest.  It is my impression that they are not on a gravy train and work in the interest of the companies of which they are directors.  That is their first duty but they are also there to represent their fellow workers.  It is important to remember the good work that they do.<\/p><p>My party will support the Bill.  I do not know whether Senator Quinn will put it to a vote.  I am glad the Minister of State has indicated that the Bill will be looked at in terms of the ethics legislation that the Government is putting forward.  However, the Minister has rejected the central premise of the Bill that board members are not paid fees.  I hope the Bill has opened a wider debate on the issue.  I would like to widen the debate a bit further in terms of the appointment of board members and how one gets on a board, but that may be a matter for another day.<\/p><p>I commend Senator Quinn on his outstanding record of legislation and legislative production in this House.  Regardless of whether the Bill is accepted by the Government, all of it or many parts of it will probably find their way into Government legislation.  The sentiments the Senator has expressed may well become the meon an phobail or common opinion and general consensus in regard to this issue.  That is what may happen as a result of him putting forward the Bill.  I thank him for doing so and we will support it if he does put it to a vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100032#HH00200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1402497900,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate Senator Feargal Quinn on bringing forward the Bill.

They have a business background and give of their time to improve the State board that they represent.  It is open to any member of a State board to forgo the remuneration.  Given that a provision is already in place whereby one can forgo his or her remuneration, why is there a need for the Bill?<\/p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn comes from a business background.  We have much in common but not on the same scale.  The Senator is aware that to get the best in any organisation, one has to pay for it.  I am sorry, but that is my firm belief.  Were this restriction to be introduced, the number of people who would qualify and be interested and give of their time free of charge would be considerably reduced.<\/p><p>It is a positive development that the Minister of State has indicated he will take on board some parts of the Bill in forthcoming legislation.  I reiterate that to get best, one has to pay the best.  If the Bill was to be enacted, we would find that State boards would probably be made up of retired wealthy individuals.  I do not think the socio-economic backgrounds of the whole country would be represented on State boards.  As the vast majority of boards meet in Dublin, would it mean that people from Kerry, Cork, Mayo and Donegal would not serve on State boards because of the time involved and the fact that there is no remuneration package?  I return to my initial point that to get the best, one has to pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100033#JJ00100","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1402497900,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.  I congratulate Senator Feargal Quinn on bringing the Bill before the House.  I spoke to him about this legislation before this afternoon.  As we are all aware, as a country we are still hugely burdened with a terrifying amount of debt.  Many of our citizens are unemployed, many have huge mortgages, there is a great deal of homelessness and a huge amount of suffering.  As Senator Feargal Quinn said, we are asking that some sacrifices be made by the bright and the best.  I take the Senator's point that if Senator Quinn wants the best, he pays for it.  We all know that the payments made to those who serve on these boards are not large and the Bill allows for expenses.  Whether one comes from Cork, Kerry, Donegal or Mayo, provision is made for expenses but it is one's time, expertise, skill and experience that is being sought.<\/p><p>When doing my research, I noted that it was the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who put forward the idea of asking people to waive their fees.  I remember the 2011 Global Economic Forum when a very brilliant, plain speaking man from Limerick, Mr. John Hartnett, who is busy on the west coast of America in the tech industry, suggested looking at the brilliant people in the diaspora.  Many people who wanted to help in Ireland came forward and served on boards without being remunerated.  I take the point that we want everybody.  We want transparency and not just wealthy retired individuals.  From my experience, many people who would regard it as an honour to serve on State boards and would be willing to give of their time.<\/p><p>While preparing for the debate, I came across a survey from MERC Partners which was published in March 2013.  Some of the results contained in that document brought home to me something which I felt was the case in any event.  However, the situation appears to be more grave and warrants discussion and proves why Senator Feargal Quinn's Bill is timely and the Government should consider accepting it.  The survey found that just 80% of respondents would be happy to put themselves forward for a position on a State board with the remainder fearing negative publicity or being unlikely to be successful without political affiliations.  We should consider this statement.  To my mind, that means there is a good chance that currently we are not attracting the best people to our State boards.  Given that the MERC Partners survey was conducted among the country's leading executives and directors, the statistic that only 20% of respondents would be willing to serve on State boards is a matter of concern.  Since the Government came to office, one Minister has appointed 311 people to State boards, only one fifth of whom were selected from the Government's much heralded public advertising process.  That is a worrying statistic.<\/p><p>An issue I focused on, and the Minister of State referred to it in his contribution, is that the Bill defines &quot;public body&quot; as an entity that is wholly or patly funded directly or indirectly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas or from the Central Fund.    I refer to the not-for-profit charity sector and some of the terrible events that have unfolded in the past ten months and the damage done to the wonderful volunteers around Ireland who give of their time to do so much work for vulnerable people.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the Bill in respect of this particular area.  Any charity, not-for-profit entity or commercial entity that is funded by the State should be treated today like a State board.  We all want complete transparency.  We want to see people with the skills and strategies needed for these charities, not-for-profits or the commercial entities that are afforded funding by the State.  As well being transparent, the selection process must be objective, impartial and fair.  We are seeking the right mix of skills, knowledge and expertise.  There is no doubt that the dreadful publicity is all about money and what people are being paid and if they gave service to the board.  If those people had been paid nothing, there would have been nothing for the newspapers to write about.  This is a difficult issue about which I have thought long and hard but there are so many people who would give of their time, for example, a day a month which involves much reading and preparation.<\/p> <p>It is a significant problem which has been highlighted by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I thank the Minister of State for his contribution and I am pleased that heads of a Bill will be prepared.  I ask him to please consider Senator Quinn's Bill because the question of payments to members of boards can be very problematic as we have seen in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100033#JJ00200","speaker":"1169","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402498500,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank Senator Quinn for presenting this Bill.  I do not think anyone doubts his bona fides in this matter.<br \/>Membership of boards generally, whether State boards or otherwise, is becoming a fraught issue.  This is the case in particular in the sector with which I am most familiar, the NGO sector, which as Senator O'Brien said, has been rocked by recent revelations of poor corporate governance and the salaries paid.  State boards have been the subject of much media criticism and accusations that parties in power, whether on this side of the House or the other side, have been appointing people through cronyism and jobs for the boys.<br \/>Senator Quinn's Bill deals with an important issue.  I have served on a State board and it has been my personal experience that the vast majority of people who serve on State boards do so out of the highest sense of public duty and a desire to give something back to society and this should be acknowledged.  I was disappointed when doing my research that there was extensive media coverage on the composition of State boards but not one report referred to the excellent service given by many people to the State through their performance as members of State boards.  No one can argue that being a member of a State board will make one rich or famous, at least not famous in the way that one would like to have fame.  As the Minister of State pointed out, the average fees paid to members of State boards are very modest, at &euro;18,788 for a chairman of a board and &euro;10,421 for an ordinary member.<br \/>I am very concerned at what Senator Quinn is proposing because I do not want a society ruled by the great and the good.  We have had enough of that, in my opinion, in the past.  If a situation is created where the only people who can serve on State boards are those who are either retired or independently wealthy or in many instances, are former civil servants, that is not a situation that we want in this country.  Senator Quinn's proposal is that aside from claiming out-of-pocket expenses, nobody is entitled to any remuneration and I wish to deal with that point.  What about a self-employed person such as an architect, for example?  We all know that the construction sector has gone through very tough times.  For example, what is the situation for an architect who is offered an appointment to An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Nobody in that situation could afford to take up that appointment and that is the reality.  I do not favour that situation.  In my view, State boards represent the people and as such, anybody on a State board must represent the people and therefore, State boards have to represent an inclusive society which means representing people from every economic profile.  It is critical that in order to participate we are not asking people to effectively subsidise the State which is what would happen.  If we do not give recognition to the time that people spend on State business it is a fake virtue to encourage people to put themselves forward and not accept remuneration.  Unfortunately, Senator Quinn's Bill goes too far, in my view.  It does not encourage access to participation on State boards and it does not make way for people who do not have the resources to effectively do what I am suggesting which is to subsidise the State.<br \/>I do not think the kind of fees paid to people on State boards merit derision because they are very modest.  I will move on to refer to some international research on this issue.  I cite the OECD paper, Corporate Governance Working Papers No.2, authored by W. Richard Frederick.  He deals with the issue of remuneration and states: <blockquote>Indeed, board members are motivated by their sense of duty and loyalty to country and the SOE, and the prestige of a board membership.  However there are also indications that board member compensation sometimes borders on the limit of Herzberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;hygiene level&rdquo;, i.e. that board members are not willing to put in quite as much effort in an SOE when the work is equally as demanding and the remuneration is less than in the private sector.<br \/>...The ability to find and motivate talent is critical...ultimately remuneration has to be regarded as fair and that the use of compensation to get the best people onto state boards is a critical factor.<\/blockquote>I refer to the study by the Institute of Directors produced in 2012, entitled State Boards in Ireland - Challenges for the Future.  The study asked members if members should be paid for their work as non-executive directors and whether they would agree to waive their fees.  Some 77% said they would not be prepared to do so.  The report stated that the consensus view was reflected in a comment:<blockquote>I do not believe the existing level of remuneration is in any way excessive.  I also believe that it is a good feature of all director appointments that there is some consideration paid to reflect the significance of the responsibility being taken on.  Of course - [a view reflected by others] - it is open to any individual to voluntarily forgo payment and this should be a personal choice. <\/blockquote>The issue around board membership is not what people are paid, rather it is the manner in which people are appointed.  The manner in which people are appointed has to be open and transparent.  I refer again to the OECD report as to what is important for the future of State-owned enterprises which states:<blockquote>The Working Paper concludes that the key success factors for the public ownership function in enhancing SOE boards include a shared vision for the governance reforms that are to be achieved; clearly communicated policies and objectives to SOEs; abstaining from ad-hoc interventions in SOEs once their objectives have been defined; well-designed training programmes for board members as well as the government ownership representatives; enhanced channels of communications between CEOs, boards and the ownership function; and increased transparency around the conduct of SOE boards, management and the government ownership function.<\/blockquote>The bottom line is the manner in which people are appointed to State boards and about how State boards do their business.  We are confusing the issue entirely by focusing on remuneration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100034#KK00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1402498500,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Like my colleague, Senator Byrne, I welcome Senator Quinn's initiative.  I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank him for a very balanced response to Senator Quinn's submission.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>published a survey about a year ago across a variety of interesting questions.  I refer to one of the questions which I will paraphrase.  It asked the respondents to say in their opinion that since 2009 do they believe that politicians' pay, (a) increased (b) decreased (c) stayed the same.  The overwhelming number - well in excess of three quarters of the respondents - said they believed that politicians' pay had increased.  We know different, of course.  Right across the entire panoply of representation in both Houses, from the very bottom to the very top and from the top to the bottom, Ministers, Taoisigh, Ministers of State, Deputies and even lowly Senators, have experienced something in the region of more than 20% reduction in their salaries.  Also, we are the only group in the public service which has had its long-term increments abolished.  There is a great deal of talk at the moment among the trade unionists and the trade union movement about the amount of money they received in recent times as part of the increment dimension to their pay.  Ours disappeared, literally overnight, by a decision of a former Minister for Finance but I have no doubt that the current Minister would have done exactly the same in the circumstances.  While I applaud Senator Quinn for his sincerity and for his motives in bringing forward this Bill, from his own remarks and those of Senator Barrett, somehow the implementation of these measures will restore public confidence and a perception that the public service is not coining it or milking it, I wish that in the real world that were true.<\/p> <p>As one Deputy told me after the most recent cuts in our salaries, if Members of this House or the other House were to stand on Kildare Street with a brush and shovel and tell people they were not receiving any money, members of a cynical public, fuelled by an equally cynical media, would ask us whether we would be willing to pay to serve as Members of the Oireachtas.  This general cynicism is not the result of the most recent economic crash but dates back to the year dot.  Politicians everywhere are viewed as somehow milking the system and this perception will never change.  I wish it would change and I hope the measures proposed in the Bill will go some way towards achieving that. <\/p><p>The nub of the problem, to which previous speakers alluded, is the following comment by the Minister of State: &quot;For the most part, while the fees that are paid to board members could only be regarded as a disproportionately small level of recompense for the work that they undertake, such fees nevertheless enable the State to continue to access a wider pool of candidates for State board appointments with valuable private sector expertise that may otherwise be unavailable to it.&quot;  This sentence caught my attention and that of other Senators.  There is an old saying that if one pays peanuts, one gets monkeys.  As the reports cited by Senator Hayden bear out, human nature dictates that some form of incentive is necessary.  Even among the wealthy and the great and the good, we find that more than three quarters of members of the Institute of Directors in Ireland are unwilling to serve on State boards without some form of remuneration.<\/p><p>I have mixed feelings about the Bill.  While I applaud and support what Senator Quinn is doing and understand his motivation of restoring public confidence in the system of public governance, I also agree with previous speakers, including Senator Hayden, that the principal issue is the manner in which appointments to State boards are made.  Public cynicism has evolved over the years as a result of the common practice of successive Administrations appointing their own people, either on taking office or before handing over power.  <\/p><p>I look forward with great interest to the heads of the Bill to which the Minister of State referred.  I hope he will consider the many other matters raised by Senator Quinn.  The Government refers to the need to have access to a wide pool of qualified individuals.  The previous Government initiated a process that culminated in 900 elected members of local authorities being precluded from sitting on State boards.  The Minister of State should consider the level of expertise that is available across all parties and none and from every walk of life.  Local authority members mirror and reflect the real Ireland as opposed to an elite group.<\/p><p>Senator O'Brien referred to the Farmleigh forum of 2011 at which it was suggested that certain people should serve on State boards.  I would love to know how many of the individuals in question have since been appointed to a State board and how many declined an offer of appointment.  While I recall applauding the idea at the time, I have not heard anything since the offer was made.  It would be interesting to establish how many members of the diaspora are serving on State boards.  The bottom line is that people must receive some form of remuneration. <\/p><p>Senator Quinn's Bill does not refer to the role of chairpersons of boards.  While board members may attend a monthly meeting, the role of chairperson is much more time consuming.  Having served as the chairperson of F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the north west, I am aware of the time required for such positions and the small amount of money involved.  I did not take the position for the money on offer as I was delighted and honoured to be given the role at the time.  While I was informed I would not be paid, I received a modest allowance which was subject to taxation.  It should be noted that the average figures provided by the Minister of State are gross rather than net, which means the average allowance of &euro;18,000 works out at approximately &euro;10,000.  One can also deduct 50% from the other figure to which he referred.  As such, the net cost to the Exchequer is small.<\/p><p>Perception was the factor that motivated Senator Quinn in introducing the Bill.  As one says in politics, perception is everything.  From that point of view, the Senator has done a good day's work.  If the Government cannot accept the legislation, as presented, I ask that it give serious consideration to certain aspects of the Bill.<\/p><p>My view echoes the sentiment expressed by Senators Sheahan and Hayden on the need to provide some form of incentive.  The Minister's statement appears to indicate that the Government shares our view that busy people who are prepared to give their time to the State must be given some form of incentive.  While I have no doubt that people would still be prepared to give to the State if no money was offered, that is not the issue.  The issue is that we need to have the broadest possible pool of expertise available.  Many decent, honourable people who would give their time are not wealthy and do not belong to the business elite and, therefore, need some form of recompense for the work the are prepared to do.  The payment of expenses does not meet that requirement because expenses have been drastically cut.  I know from speaking to people that the expenses provided by some boards do not compensate for the amount of time and effort they invest.<\/p><p>While we have all noted the flaws in the legislation, Senator Quinn's objectives are laudable and morally correct none the less.  If the Bill helps to restore public confidence in the system of governance and in parliamentarians and members of State boards, I would welcome it on that basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100034#KK00300","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402499100,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and commend Senator Quinn on introducing the Bill and providing Senators with an opportunity to discuss this important issue.  In January 2013, several news outlets ran with the story that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, had appointed Mr. Noel Ward, a former constituency organiser for the Minister, to the board of Ordnance Survey Ireland.  Mr. Ward was appointed although he did not apply for the position following a public advertisement by the Department.  The position to which he was appointed paid &euro;7,695 per annum for attending board meetings.  As Senators are aware, this practice has taken place under the watch of this Government and previous Governments.<\/p><p>I concur with Senator Mooney's general point on remuneration, namely, that the vast majority of people would serve on boards, irrespective of whether financial rewards were available.  Sometimes, however, money makes a difference.  One need look no further than councils up and down the State to see the way in which membership of strategic policy committees and positions of mayor and deputy mayor are being carved up.  When a role involves money, it will be contested whereas there is much less contention when positions do not involve money.  Payment has an impact and to argue that money is not an issue is to bury one's head in the sand. <\/p><p>Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised in their pre-election manifestos to end the culture of political cronyism in State appointments.  Unfortunately, political appointments persist and the Government has failed to tackle other State board governance issues.  The Central Remedial Clinic scandal is a good example of what is wrong with the system.  The CRC case highlighted how loose corporate governance of boards can result in potential financial and regulatory fallout.  Similarly, the position at Rehab, where members of the public waited for weeks to discover the salary of the then chief executive, Angela Kerins, directors and other members of the board, highlighted a lack of transparency in agencies in receipt of public money.  I hope we will move in a new direction in light of what occurred in the case of Rehab.  <\/p><p>The Rehab scandal highlighted a number of bad practices on boards.  We saw, for instance, that there was no proper appointments process in place despite the fact that the Health Service Executive had emphasised that it did not want appointments made without due process.  Brian Conlan was a former member of the board of the Central Remedial Clinic which signed off on a highly dubious &euro;742,00 golden handshake for Mr. Paul Kiely when he retired.  When the Committee of Public Accounts inquired as to the reason this payment had been allowed, Mr. Conlan denied knowledge of any of the details and, when questioned further, stated he was a member of numerous boards - I believe the figure was 12 - his attendance at CRC board meetings was infrequent and his interest was passive.  Mr. Conlan sat on the CRC board to do a job.  This case raises the question as to how one individual could be on 12 different boards and give each of them his or her full attention.  It is not possible to do so and the case highlights that certain people have been appointed to multiple boards, not on the basis of a particular skill but for reasons of political patronage, favours and so forth.  The CRC case is illustrative of a wider malaise in the system.<\/p> <p> There is a process for making public appointments, and it is important to acknowledge that the Government has improved that process for the better.  The problem, however, is that Ministers have routinely flouted it and, in so doing, have undermined the very process they sought to enhance and the boards to which those appointments were made.  In 2010, TASC produced a report entitled Mapping the Golden Circle which identified a directors' network of 39 individuals who were members of at least two boards across 33 of the 40 boards included in the study.  The revelation that Brian Conlan, the former chief executive officer of the Central Remedial Clinic at one time, was a member of 12 boards, including a number of public boards, may be startling but is not surprising.  It does beg the question, however, of how many boards one individual can sit on while still being able to give each his or her full attention.  This is particularly a problem when people sit on both public boards and private boards, where there could potentially be conflicts of interest, some of which go undeclared.<\/p><p>While Fine Gael and the Labour Party railed and rallied loudly in opposition against Fianna F&aacute;il's insider system of appointments, they have, since entering government, taken up where the last Administration left off.  Indeed, more than 60 appointments to State boards in the three years since the Government took office have not been made in a fair way.  Ministers have essentially ignored applications submitted through the public advertisement system established by the Government.  For example, only 15 of the 64 individuals appointed to State boards under the auspices of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation applied through this advertisement system.  Of the 40 who applied for positions on the board of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, only one was appointed through this process.  The Minister for Health appointed 52 people to State boards early in 2013, including a Fine Gael councillor who was appointed to the board of St. James's Hospital and a former party programme manager who was appointed to the board of HIQA.  A former Fine Gael councillor from my own city of Waterford was appointed to the board of Irish Water in what was clearly a political appointment by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, who is a personal friend of this individual.  Meanwhile, in his first two years in office, the Minister for Education and Skills appointed just five of the 190 members of the public who applied to sit on the three education boards under his remit.  None of the 49 who applied through the Public Appointments Service to sit on the board of L&eacute;argas, for instance, was deemed appropriate to be appointed by the Minister.  When the Institute of Directors in Ireland undertook a survey of appointments to State boards in 2012, it found that almost three quarters of the candidates for such positions whom they interviewed believed the process of appointment was not fair and transparent.<\/p><p>The Government must begin the process of addressing this issue by compiling a database of all commercial and non-commercial State agencies, boards, board members, competencies and remuneration.  This work must come under the auspices of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Six years after the financial crisis, the absence of Government action in this area is allowing problems to continue in State boardrooms.  It is in the interests of all political parties and everybody in the political system to deal with this issue once and for all.  I have already acknowledged the positive changes the Government has made and its improved performance in comparison with that of its predecessor.  We still, however, have a long way to go.  We support Senator Quinn's Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100035#LL00200","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402499700,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, and thank Senator Quinn for drafting this legislation.  The Government has pursued a wide-ranging political reform programme aimed at delivering open government underpinned by a transparent, efficient and effective public sector, which is vital to rebuild trust in government and the institutions of the State.  Notwithstanding his criticisms of aspects of the Government's performance, I welcome Senator Cullinane's acknowledgment of the efforts that have been made in this regard.  Reforms are set to include an overhaul of the ethics legislation aimed at supporting and promoting ethical conduct and creating an environment in which ethical issues and conflicts of interest are managed effectively and corrupt and unethical conduct is severely discouraged.  It is important, now more than ever, that we continue this work of reforming politics to bring about transparency, accountability and honesty.  At the same time, we must work to reform the public sector in the same way, bringing to the fore the principles of accountability and honesty.  I commend Senator Quinn on crafting the Bill with that intention in mind.<\/p><p>The legislation proposes to bring an end to the practice of paying those who serve on the boards of public bodies and similar entities.  This seems like a fair move in many cases, as long as reasonable expenses are paid to persons who are out of pocket.  However, there are some boards where such an arrangement may not be practical due to the large workload and frequent meetings.  Additional provision should be made to accommodate that reality.<\/p><p>The Bill requires that the employment of a person by a public body be conditional on his or her filing a declaration with the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  Aside from the additional administrative work for the commission, I see no reason to oppose this reasonable proposal.  In addition, the Bill requires that the payment of expenses to persons who serve on the boards of public bodies must likewise be conditional upon their filing a declaration with SIPO.  Again, this imposes an additional administrative burden but should pose no real difficulties.  It is my understanding that the list of bodies coming within the purview of the Bill would include commercial State companies, non-commercial State bodies and profit organisations in receipt of public funding and having public service-type pension schemes.<\/p><p>Although I agree with some aspects of the Bill, it must be acknowledged that reform in this sector is already under way.  The current arrangements in regard to the payment of fees to board members has seen a significant reduction in such fees in the period since 2009, with current payments averaging at &euro;18,788 for board chairmen and &euro;10,421 for board members.  In the case of public servants who are members of State boards, the one person, one salary rule applies.  In other words, fees are not payable to these individuals in respect of their board membership.  In addition, since 2012, formal provision has existed to allow board members the option of waiving their fee payment.  Many have chosen to do so, forgoing personal gain in the interest of the State.<\/p><p>I agree, however, with Senator Sheahan's observation that we do not want a situation where board membership is dependent on a person's wealth or personal circumstances such that it would become a somewhat elitist activity.  I suggested during the debate on the referendum to abolish the Seanad that membership of the House should be voluntary.  That debate is over, but I do take the point that such prescriptions have the potential to result in elitism and, in some cases, a Dublin-centric bias.  The retention of fees would enable the State to continue to access a wider pool of candidates for State board appointments, including those with valuable private sector expertise.  I echo the comments made by Senators Sheahan and Hayden in this regard.  The proposal in the Bill to abolish the fee payment represents a major departure from current practice and has the potential over time to have an adverse impact on the economic profile of persons available for such appointments.  Moreover, there are legal constraints applying to the withdrawal of fees from certain board members, including, for instance, worker directors appointed under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts.<\/p><p>That said, certain aspects of the proposals contained in this Bill should be given close consideration in the context of drawing up a legislative programme.

It has been a very interesting debate.  Sometimes, in bringing forward legislation, one's real aim is to encourage and facilitate changes in the law.

In that regard, I welcome the Minister of State's assurance that while the Government will not proceed with this Bill, its proposals will be fully taken into account in the context of the development of pending legislation to put in place a revised ethics in public office framework.<\/p> <p>He said in conclusion, \"While the Government will not be proceeding with this Bill due to the fact that its own Ethics in Public Office Act reform legislation is pending, it is nevertheless the position that certain of the proposals in the Bill will be closely considered in the context of drawing up a revised legislative framework in this regard.\"  I think that that will bring some satisfaction to all of us who have been involved in the discussion today.<\/p><p>We have had much input into the debate.

Senator Mary Ann O'Brien placed great emphasis on transparency, particularly in appointments to State boards.  We have to do something about that.

Senator Cullinane talked about the lack of standards in appointments to State boards, which has come up in our discussion of the Bill today.  Senator Noone spoke about finding a way of achieving a wider range of candidates and expressed concern that that might not happen if there was no salary for board members.  <\/p><p>This has been a useful discussion.  I was helped a great deal in putting the Bill together by somebody who has helped me in the past, Brian Hunt.  I think that the Bill will give rise to discussion.  On a number of occasions in the past, I have introduced Bills that became law.  I have also introduced Bills which did not become law but which became law in a different manner shortly afterwards.  I thank everybody who has been involved in the discussion, in particular the Minister, and suggest that we adjourn the debate at this stage in the hope that it will encourage the Government to grab hold of these matters, particularly on the basis that the Minister has said that certain of the proposals in the Bill will be closely considered in the context of drawing up a revised Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100036#MM00300","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402500300,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1402500300,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.54 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes: Statements","time":1402500600,"counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100038#OO00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1402500600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to visit the Upper House today to hear Senators' views on the serious matter of mother and baby homes, following the significant decision of the Government yesterday to approve my proposal for a commission of investigation.<\/p><p>At the outset, let me say that we are now at a planning stage.  Yesterday, the Cabinet agreed that the complexity and gravity of the issues raised by Tuam required a commission of investigation which would look at a broader range of issues and would not be confined to Tuam alone, but a great deal of additional groundwork is required before that commission is established, notwithstanding my commitment to have it established before the Houses rise for the summer recess in late July.<\/p><p>Of course, we are all mindful of the revelations that led us to where we are today, namely, the publication of revelations about the Tuam mother and baby home that identified a high rate of infant and child mortality combined with uncertainty and disturbing suggestions about the burial arrangements that may have taken place in or adjacent to that home over the years.  The genesis of those revelations lay in the work of local historian, Catherine Corless, who felt that the dignity of the deceased children had to be recognised and respected.<\/p><p>I have great admiration for Ms. Corless's work and commitment in this regard and I share her views in respect of the need for the dignity of deceased children to be respected.  Indeed, yesterday in the D&aacute;il I made the point that we must be careful in our use of language and mindful of the fact that while the figure of 796 children has been almost casually referred to in some quarters, the reality is that each of those 796 children was an individual, a citizen, a son or daughter.  The matters now under consideration concern real people and I am appealing for this fact to be borne in mind at all times.  We are dealing with personal histories here and it is not the time for sensationalism or political grandstanding.<\/p><p>Similarly, I have made the point from the outset that it is mistaken to rush to simplistic judgment on these matters.  That is part of the rationale for a commission of investigation.  The situation pertaining to mother and baby homes is complex.  It is often harrowing.  It is highly personal for those involved.  It defies a simple explanation.  It warrants far more than a simplistic analysis.<\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, I established a cross-departmental group of senior officials and involving other agencies such as the National Archives, for the purpose of performing a scoping exercise.  This committee has been meeting for the past ten days.  I understand it will be meeting again before the end of this week.  Tuam brought to the fore the issues of infant and child mortality and burial arrangements.  These are but two of the issues that I would like to see examined in the context of mother and baby homes.  Questions remain unanswered about the nature of adoptions and the issue of vaccine trials.  Significant legal difficulties have been identified in seeking answers to these questions in the past and it is my intention that the commission of investigation can make progress where past investigations have failed.<\/p><p>The work of the interdepartmental group is continuing and this work will play a crucial role in informing Government decisions regarding the terms of reference for the commission of investigation.  As I have said, I would like this commission of investigation to examine a number of matters.  Equally, I am a realist.  I want this commission to be able to conduct its work in a timely and efficient manner.  I do not want to see it descend into a bottomless quagmire.  Therefore, I am committed to clear and reasonable terms of reference.  I accept that there are many questions to be answered about aspects of our history.  However, I also believe that the reasonable person will accept that if a commission of inquiry is to complete its work in an efficient manner, its terms of reference must be realistic.  However, I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the deliberations and information gathering by the interdepartmental group, comprising people from almost all Departments with the exception of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Departments of Health, Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs, as well as the Departments of the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste and including agencies such as the National Archives.<\/p><p>Yesterday, I welcomed the fact that a number of church leaders had spoken positively about the concept of an investigation into mother and baby homes, among them a number of senior figures in the Catholic Church, including Coadjutor Archbishop of Armagh, Eamon Martin, Archbishop Neary of Tuam, Archbishop Martin of Dublin and Bishop Buckley of Cork and Ross.  I also welcome the comments of the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin and Glendalough, Michael Jackson.  I welcome the support that church leaders have offered and I am calling on them and on all those in religious institutions with access to records and documentation to co-operate fully with the commission of inquiry once it is established.<\/p><p>It is my contention that yesterday's Government decision to establish a commission of investigation underlines the seriousness of our approach to the matters raised in the context of mother and baby homes.  Since coming into power, this Government has shown its willingness to confront and shine a light into the dark aspects of our recent social history.<\/p><p>Clearly, a number of options were before Cabinet yesterday.  These included a tribunal of inquiry.  The difficulty with this approach is the huge costs associated with tribunals due to the constitutional protections that create a need for legal representation for all parties giving evidence.  Moreover, we have seen over the years, it is the nature of tribunals to meander into areas that were not part of their original remit, thereby slowing down the process of reaching conclusions very considerably.  Options such as an inquiry by an Oireachtas committee was also an option, but would be unsatisfactory in the light of the possible legal obstacles concerning some of the matters at issue.  Therefore, Cabinet deemed a commission of investigation to be the preferred approach to this matter of urgent public concern.  Under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, a commission has the power to conduct its investigation in any manner it considers appropriate within the parameters of the Act.  It must seek and facilitate the voluntary co-operation of people whose evidence it requires.  It is entitled to compel witnesses to give evidence.  It can direct a person to provide it with any documents in the person's possession or power relating to the matter under investigation.<\/p> <p>If any person fails to comply, the commission can apply to the court to compel compliance or it may impose a costs order against the individual for the costs incurred by all other parties arising from the delay.<\/p><p>It is also of significance that the approval of the order establishing a commission must be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In this context, I welcome the support of colleagues on all sides for the Government's commitment to investigate matters relating to mother and baby homes.  Yesterday in the D&aacute;il, Deputies were positively disposed to the Government's decision.  I am hopeful that Senators will share that spirit of co-operation.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on these issues.  I expect that the contributions made this evening will be taken into account by the intergovernmental group, which continues to meet and will meet before the end of this week.<\/p><p>I would like to conclude by reiterating a point I made yesterday in the D&aacute;il.  I welcome what I see as a growing national consensus in politics, in churches and among the public.  That is absolutely essential if, as a people, we are prepared to face up to our past rather than shying away from the issues at hand.  We must implement transparency in governance as we move forward, while also seeking to bring transparency and openness to the actions of the past.  The agreement reached by the Government yesterday to establish a commission of investigation represents an historic opportunity for this country to take a united approach to dealing with one of the most tragic and traumatic chapters in modern Irish history.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100038#OO00200","speaker":"1055","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402501200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome the announcement of the establishment of a commission of investigation to examine what happened in the mother and baby homes. It is important for us finally to uncover the whole truth about what went on in those institutions, the circumstances in which women were sent to them, the conditions in which they and their children had to live, the high mortality rates, the medical research that was carried out on children without their parents' consent and the forced separation of mothers and babies through adoption.  It is essential for the commission of investigation to consider the role of all bodies - the orders that ran the homes, the State agencies that interacted with them, the Department of the Environment and the local authorities that funded them.  We have to recall that these homes were set up at the instigation of the local authorities, which wanted people to be moved from the county homes into separate mother and baby institutions.  The roles of all the players involved need to be investigated.  We need to uncover the full truth.<br \/>I echo the Minister's closing remarks about the importance of justice finally being offered to those affected by this issue.  This horrible and dark aspect of our past is part of the daily existence of the many people who went through these homes.  The mothers who were forced into the homes and separated from their children have been living with that hurt since then.  The children who have never had the opportunity to track down their parents are living with the agony of separation and the denial of basic aspects of their identity.  It is important for the Government's response to these issues to be wide and comprehensive.  It is not just about realising the truth; it is also about finally doing justice to all of those separated by adoption.<br \/>It is right that there has been a significant focus on illegal adoption in recent days.  There has been a particular focus on cases of illegal birth registration and on the practices that were followed when children were born.  The general practitioners, solicitors and others who falsified birth records thereby deprived children of their identity from the day of their birth.  To this day, the State has refused to assist those whose rights were signed over by people who pretended they had been born to another family.  I have been looking back on the replies given by Governments in the other House when the issue of illegal adoptions has been raised.  Ministers have tended to say it is a private matter.<br \/>The State needs to do everything it can to assist these people.  That is what finally needs to happen.  The State should bring together all the records from the offices of general practitioners and solicitors.  Nurse Doody's record book, which listed 1,000 babies and their birth families, was found by her grandson in the attic of a house ten years ago.  I understand it is the only record of the truth of those babies and their circumstances, such as the details of their natural mothers.  There are records like that all over the country.  It is important for the Government to act now to seize all of that information, bring it together and make it available to families.  It should also act to ensure all information relating to adoption - I refer to illegal birth registrations, for example - is centralised.<br \/>Reference is often made to illegal adoptions.  I would widen it out in the way that has been argued by the Adoption Rights Alliance.  It is not just about illegal birth registration, which may have been the most straightforward form of illegal adoption that took place in the past; it is also about the many cases of women being forced under duress to give up their babies and to sign consent forms.  The Adoption Rights Alliance has examples of many cases of women who signed forms before the legal limit, as set out in legislation, had been reached.  Some women were forced to sign forms within three or four days of giving birth.  These forms were put in front of them when they were still in shock and did not know what was going on.  In those circumstances, it is an absolute fallacy to say that there was anything that could come close to amounting to consent.<br \/>The former Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, recognised this fallacy when she apologised for illegal adoptions in that country:<blockquote>We say sorry to you, the mothers who were denied knowledge of your rights, which meant you could not provide informed consent.  You were given false assurances.  You were forced to endure the coercion and brutality of practices that were unethical, dishonest and in many cases illegal.<\/blockquote>She acknowledged that in Australia's history - the same thing applies in Ireland - adoption was not a free process for many, if not most, of the women who lived through those periods.  Huge pressure was put on people.  The law was routinely broken in relation to having proper consent.  It is important to get the bottom of all of that and ensure adopted people are finally given the right to information.  The State needs to assist in that process in any way possible.  It is essential that a right to information finally be introduced.  Adopted people in other countries across Europe have enjoyed that right for decades.  We still do not have it here.  As an adopted person, I was lucky to find my mother after 28 years.  The vast majority of adopted people have not been that lucky in the absence of a right to information.<br \/>I understand the Taoiseach said today that a referendum will be required.  Dr. Conor O'Mahony, a constitutional lawyer who works in UCC, disputed that straight away.  I would dispute it too.  I have read the case - I O'T <i>v<\/i>. B - that is being referred to.  This Government, like its predecessor, has taken a very conservative reading of that case.  I ask the Minister not only to take advice from the Attorney General but also to establish an expert panel, as was done when the abortion legislation was being considered, bringing together legal experts and experts on adoption and the right to information from other countries to advise on setting up a process to make recommendations on taking this issue forward.<br \/>As I have said, this is an important issue for thousands of mothers and children throughout Ireland who have been separated through illegal adoptions and other forms of adoption.  It is hard to explain to anybody who is not affected by this issue what it is like not to know the basics of who one is, where one came from, where one's mother is, whether she is okay, whether she is happy and how her life has turned out.  Everybody else takes these basic things for granted.  I think this issue has been denied for too long.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is the Minister who will finally so something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100039#PP00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1402501200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on his appointment to the Cabinet.  I am aware that he worked on children's issues in the past when he was in opposition.  I am delighted that he has been appointed as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I commend him on his decision to establish a full commission of investigation with full statutory powers.  He acted promptly and swiftly when he set up a cross-departmental group involving eight Government Departments.  Following a preliminary update from this group, the Cabinet agreed yesterday to establish a commission of investigation with statutory powers to investigate mother and baby homes.  The commission will deal with issues of highest sensitivity, matters of life and death, the high mortality rate, the burial practices, the issues relating to adoption and the issue of clinical trials.<br \/>As the Minister said, this country has a history of tribunals that go on for years and cost millions of euro.  He has assured us that this will be a focused investigation with clear terms of reference and realistically achievable goals.  The sole focus here is on the mother and baby home investigation.  A reasonable time frame has been set.<\/p> <p>The Government's decision to establish a commission of investigation underlines the seriousness of our approach to these matters.  As the Minister said, since coming into power, the Government has shown its willingness to confront and shine a light into the dark aspects of our recent social history.  State and church were responsible for the mismanagement and neglect of these mothers and their babies.  While it is difficult to understand how it was allowed to happen, it was due to the attitude of society at the time to the women and their babies.  We cannot forget the fathers who were responsible for the women and their babies.  Although they are seldom mentioned they, like all fathers, have responsibility.<\/p><p>Many issues are not clear as of yet, particularly regarding consent for adoption and experiments, and if consent was given it was done while women were stressed, emotional, under pressure from parents, church and society, and made to feel ashamed of their situation and their children.  Some of the language used to describe these mothers was appalling.  The term &quot;fallen women&quot; is upsetting and sad.  I hope many women who had experiences in mother and baby homes will come forward and tell their stories so we can finally bring the harrowing facts into the open.  Although it will be difficult for many of them, I hope they have the courage to do so.<\/p><p>We cannot deal with what happened and move forward until we return to those dark days, bring it all into the open and acknowledge that it was wrong and shameful and that we treated women, children and precious human life appallingly.  While there has been much analysis of the cause of the problem, the root of it was the attitude of society and the Roman Catholic Church to women and their role in society.  Although the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church has moved on a bit, it has not yet moved into the 21st century.  Although women constitute over 50% of the world population, they still have no role to play in the Roman Catholic Church.  If women had such a role, the church could move forward and renew itself.  This is an issue of our dark past and I hope the investigation will give us the answers we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100039#PP00300","speaker":"1152","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402501800,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the Minister to the House.  Everyone in the Chamber will agree that the recent revelations are yet another deplorable stain on our collective conscience.  In preparing for my statement, my personal shame as a member of the collective that turned a blind eye to the abuse and suffering of women and children, out of fear and deference to the powerful, is as acute as ever before.  It is the same shame I felt reading each of the reports - Ferns, Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne - into the systematic abuse and exploitation of vulnerable children in State and church institutions in Ireland.  It is the same shame I felt reading the harrowing testimony from survivors of the Magdalen laundries and symphysiotomy procedures performed by medical professionals in Irish hospitals.<\/p><p>I share the overwhelming sense of shame and compunction over the unthinkable fate suffered by our sisters, cousins, friends and daughters labelled &quot;fallen women&quot; by church and community for becoming pregnant out of marriage and sent to these homes for their sins and rehabilitation.  The isolation, hardship and suffering to which these young women were subjected in the name of honour and respectability is almost unthinkable in contemporary Ireland.  How many of these young women fell pregnant against their will, by way of rape, incest and familial abuse, and found themselves arbitrarily and extra-judicially detained in these homes?  It is the worst injustice imaginable when the victim is punished.  It reminds me of punishment by stoning for adultery under Sharia law for women who have been raped.<\/p><p>Due to the time limit, I will limit my main observations to the issue of adoption, including the legality of adoptions prior to the Adoption Act 1952.  Although the national adoption contact preference register contains data on only a small number of adoptions, the 2011 Adoption Authority of Ireland audit of the records found 50 cases of illegal adoptions.  Given that the vast majority of adoption records are held by the Health Service Executive, HSE, and Child and Family Agency, CFA, we have seen only the tip of the iceberg of illegal adoptions.  The area of adoption legality is extremely complex and technical and the commission will need an expert on adoption law to deal with what is likely to be a huge body of work.  The Mahon tribunal had two to three experts working together.<\/p><p>So many of the issues thrown up by the mother and baby homes are not just legacies of the past but prevailing issues today, from which an examination of the past can yield lessons for legislation and policy today.  Earlier today, I met several survivor groups, and we must ensure any inquiry, and the process to establish it, will hear their voices and involve them.  The latest revelations have once again brought to the fore the trauma and suffering of many of the survivors.  We must ensure we care for the living.  I welcome, so early in the Minister's new term of office, his speedy and committed response to establish a statutory commission of investigation.  We are all waiting to find out the scope of the inquiry and which homes and what period will be included.  Will the State take responsibility for collating all the records or will it do the same as in the report into the Magdalen laundries, namely, receive the records and then return them to the church-run institutions?<\/p><p>The inquiry must deal with many inter-related matters.  The prevailing issues are adoption, the right to identity, lone parents, the role of women, poverty, social strata, and the rights of unmarried fathers, whose names are still not necessarily recorded on birth certificates.  Will the investigation have the resources it needs and the appropriate expertise to deal with the myriad issues I have outlined?  We must find a way to prioritise the truths from which there can be learning.  We have recently seen the role social historians and archivists have played and can continue to play in investigative teams.  Can we learn from the Murphy report experience?  Should the inquiry find a way to do its work by sampling to find the appropriate balance between truth, expediency, bearing witness, and establishing and identifying causal and contributing factors, thereby maximising the scope to learn lessons?<\/p><p>Lest we forget, each and every one of these children had a name, and to ensure they get the memorial they deserve, their names must be listed in their honour.  They are the children we promised, at the formation of the State, to cherish equally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100040#QQ00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1402501800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his elevation to the Cabinet.  From his speech and how he delivered it, I know he has a lot of compassion and will deal with this compassionately.  Many of us here are privileged to be parents, either by birth or adoption.  I have no doubt we have all showered our children with love, affection, good education and the material things in life.  Let us imagine an Ireland without televisions, mobile phones, iPads, iPods, computers and certainly without Google.  Let us imagine an Ireland of naivety, ignorance of the ways of the world, social conservatism and devout Catholic ideals but, sadly, without compassion and lacking in Christian values, where a young girl could be turned out of her home to face the unknown.<\/p><p>Let us imagine the fear in that young woman - or rather, usually, young girl - who did not even know what was happening to her body.  Let us imagine the terror, loneliness and isolation such a young girl endured, disowned by her family, shunned by the neighbours and an outcast from the community for having brought &quot;shame on herself and her family&quot;.  She faced the ordeal of giving birth not knowing what would happen to her or her unborn child.  She was penniless, alone and totally dependent on those in charge of the mother and baby homes.  This is the horrific situation in which young girls found themselves between the 1920s and 1960s in a country where these women felt, as the Taoiseach said, ashamed, suppressed and dominated.  What happened to these girls once they walked, or were dragged, through the doors of these homes?<\/p> <p>We all know of the dreadful and harrowing stories of the Magdalen laundries women, the residents of the Bethany Home and industrial institutions.  If those walls could talk would they tell us what happened to the babies?  Were their births recorded and were birth certificates ever issued?  Were they baptised, are there records of baptismal certificates and were their deaths recorded on death certificates?  Is there anything in this world to say these innocent babies ever existed?  Is their only legacy a pile of bones laying discarded in an unmarked grave or, as suggested in media reports, in a septic tank?<\/p><p>What of the fathers of these babies?  They were not cast out from their homes.  They were not left to fend for themselves and they were not made take responsibility for their actions.  They were allowed skulk away and pretend it had nothing to do with them.  They were considered to be merely sowing their wild oats.  They lived in a country where laws were made by men and ruled over by men to protect men.  Thankfully that has changed and today's men are more responsible and are willing to lead the charge in obtaining the truth and justice.<\/p><p>I would use the word &quot;shameful&quot; to describe us as a nation and as a society that allowed this to happen.  When we hear of mass graves in other countries we immediately react with horror.  Here it is on our own doorstep.  We owe it to these women and the innocent babies found in that mass grave to find out exactly what happened.  There may be more such cases around the country, many babies who were the subject of forced adoptions and illegally registered, and we owe it to them all.  We must discover what was endured by the women in Tuam and all over this country.  <\/p><p>I welcome the establishment of a commission of investigation with statutory powers and the Minister's swift actions.  The investigation must expose the injustice, the abuse and the appalling treatment of these women.  Shame on us as a society and shame on all politicians who stood over the appalling treatment of women and children during those years.  Shame on the organisations, both State and religious, into whose care these young women were placed - they let them down so badly.  Most of all, shame on the men who got these women pregnant and then abandoned them.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that all parties are willing to work together to see justice is done rather than make a political football out of sensitive and emotive matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100040#QQ00300","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402502400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Ba mhaith liom mo ghl&oacute;r a chur leis na gl&oacute;rtha at&aacute; anseo go dt&iacute; seo ar an &aacute;bhar f&iacute;or-thruamh&eacute;ileach seo.<br \/>I would like to start by commending Catherine Corless, the researcher, and Teresa Killeen Kelly, the chairperson of the Tuam mother and babies committee, on bringing the recent revelations to light and working so hard.<br \/>There is an element of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>about this as we are again discussing an issue that, at its core, relates to the treatment of Irish women and children by religious orders and the State.  Not so long ago the Taoiseach stood in the D&aacute;il Chamber and apologised on behalf of the State to the women of the Magdalen laundries.  Before that the Ryan report gave shocking revelations of what life was like for young men and women in the industrial schools and orphanages that marked the landscape of every city and town in Ireland.  In lifting the veil on this horrific aspect of our past we are now faced with the prospect of a Pandora's box that is characterised by violence, terror, abuse, shattered lives and broken people.  In this system of gulags death, both real and metaphorical, was the order of the day.  We now know hundreds, if not thousands, of children died in these centres of detention otherwise known as mother and baby homes.  We also know babies were wrenched from their mothers in a most coercive and manipulative manner.  The mothers concerned were virtually powerless, rendered sinful and outcast by a society steeped in a cruel and conservative Catholicism.  As has been mentioned, they were ostracised and condemned as fallen women.  <br \/>Their punishment was cruel and terrifying.  Shut away behind thick and high convent walls these women scrubbed and polished convent floors while heavily pregnant and did so until immediately before they were due to give birth.  Once in labour they were refused access to pain relief.  As if to remind them that in the eyes of the Irish church, State and society they were somehow not respectable and less than whole, they were denied stitches after childbirth.  The barbaric theft of women from these vulnerable women and the cruel and inhuman way they were treated is a stark warning to us all of what happens when fear and conservatism rule the body politic and church and State collude.  Designated outcasts by society and brutalised by terror, these women were cruelly estranged from an essential part of themselves.  Forced to live sad and secret lives where, for them, their young babies never grew old, they experienced a form of social death.<br \/>Immediate action is now required in order to uncover the full truth.  Foremost in our thoughts should be the surviving mothers, who endured what was effectively incarceration in the institutions, and also the surviving adopted children who wish to discover the truth about the identity of their parents, siblings and wider families.<br \/>One of the shocking aspects of mother and baby homes that requires answers is the use of children for medical experiments.  Vaccination trials were carried out on 58 children in 1960 and 1961.  Those children were from the mother and baby homes at Bessborough in County Cork, Castlepollard in County Westmeath, Mount Carmel Industrial School in Moate, County Westmeath, Dunboyne and Stamullen in County Meath and St. Patrick's on the Navan Road in Dublin.<br \/>That brings us to the question of why these crimes were perpetrated and why were they allowed to happen.  There have been attempts to place the blame on wider Irish society dating back some time, and this has occurred again in recent days, because of the deeply conservative social attitudes that dominated in those decades.  It should be acknowledged that the social attitudes of the times were disdainful of great numbers of people and cast them out of society.  However, this can too easily be twisted into a view that since everyone was to blame, no one was to blame.  In turn, this allows the powerful in Irish society to evade accountability and responsibility once again.  The reality was that there were powerful social and economic forces.  Powerful men of church and State ruled this society and ensured women, children, the poor and the marginalised were kept in their place, or what those same powerful men decided was their place.<br \/>Much has changed for the better but much has yet to change.  The onus is now on the Government to act.  I would urge the Government to include the Magdalen laundries, as a matter of course, in any commission of inquiry.  I would also like to take this opportunity to raise the issue of direct provision and I know the Minister is aware of this.  This issue must be discussed on another occasion because it must be addressed.  The young women in mother and baby homes who were once so full of promise and life deserve justice.  Their lives were shattered and the State and Irish society can no longer claim ignorance.  It is time to act and to demolish the official wall of silence that the State itself played such an active part in constructing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100041#RR00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1402502400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, for attending today in the House where this issue was first raised.  In fairness to the Minister, on first becoming aware of this issue he has expressed a willingness to deal with it and I welcome the establishment of a statutory commission of inquiry.  This is the proper course to take.<\/p><p>The treatment and neglect of children in mother and baby homes has been known and the subject of criticism for many years.  Parliamentary debates, health board reports, newspaper articles and local knowledge on this topic goes back to the 1930s.  Some of the parliamentary debates, both from the knowledge exposed and the language used, would make one's hair stand on end.  We really did not care for these children at all.  It both saddens and annoys me that we as a community and as a political and civil society will only agitate for action when a shocking episode such as the allegations in Tuam come to light.  They then, belatedly, receive international media attention.<\/p><p>It is a truism that sweeping secrets under the carpet will only make them fester and become a scandal.  While the comely maidens were dancing at the crossroads thousands of unmarried mothers were dancing into institutions and homes and their children were dancing towards early deaths.  Nobody in this House can afford to be political on this issue.  This shameful past is shared by all of us.  All of us know a party member, a family member, a friend or a neighbour that has been complicit in this through act or omission.  <\/p><p>This shameful social history was to a large degree directed by the church and wilfully followed by the political establishment.  Sometimes the actions of the political establishment and citizens exceeded those of the church.  We in these Houses of the Oireachtas are all too familiar with examples of important social policy being blocked, either directly or indirectly.  This was done to the great detriment of our citizens.  These actions were accepted by citizens, no matter how harsh the consequences.  The mother and child scheme is an obvious example and its pious and unforgiving politics are still within living memory.  When Brendan Corish introduced the unmarried mother allowance scheme in 1970 he was castigated for creating a licence for fornication by his fellow parliamentarians.<\/p><p>While we await the outcome of pending investigations into allegations relating to the Tuam case I will not comment further on specific matters.  It is incumbent on us to reflect on the conditions endured by those in mother and baby homes.  In general, it seems the mortality rate for what were called &quot;illegitimate children&quot; was far higher than the norm at the time.  The rate of incarceration in mother and baby homes was even higher.<\/p> <p>Some have postulated that in one home the mortality rate was as high as 50%.  In any event, it is simply not true to say, as some have, that all children were malnourished at the time, given the relative rates of poverty, and that these children were no worse off than others.  That is simply not true.  The simple fact is that all the research done to date has illustrated that being born into one of these homes significantly shortened a child's lifespan.<\/p><p>The religious undertook a duty of care in regard to these children.  They had a duty to protect and care for them.  They acted, effectively, as agents of the State which also failed them.  Church and State failed.  We are told that the cause of death of some of those 796 children was malnutrition.  How many Bon Secours nuns died of malnutrition in Tuam from 1925 to 1961?  How many town councillors and national politicians, who complained about the cost of those incarcerated in the place, died of malnutrition?<\/p><p>An additional matter was raised in the repeated episode of the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme on Monday last, namely, drugs trials conducted on people in such homes, orphanages or other State institutions without the consent of those involved and, seemingly, with the connivance of the State at the time.  There seems to be much documentation in existence on the issue.  I note the promise of the drugs companies to co-operate and I am very pleased that the matter will be investigated.<\/p><p>Third, and finally, there is the issue of alleged forced adoptions in America and elsewhere of our citizens.  The option was suggested to adoptive parents who were already considered unsuitable by their respective authorities.  It is good that the matter will be finally investigated.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Minister will consider a constructive suggestion.  The inquiry seems to have three distinct elements as follows: the treatment in homes and the disposal of the bodies of the children involved; the issue of medical research and drug trials; and the issue of forced adoptions.  Would he consider having three separate inquiries with each headed by a different individual with separate staff?  To be frank, the numbers and nature of the allegations are too vast for any one inquiry team or head to consider in any meaningful way or timeframe.  Perhaps it cannot be done but I ask the Minister to consider my suggestion if he has not already done so.<\/p><p>I cannot say that I look forward to the results of this inquiry because the findings may well be horrific.  However, I thank the Minister for coming to the House and dealing with this matter in such a speedy manner.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100041#RR00300","speaker":"1187","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402503000,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I call Senator Crown and he has two minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100042#SS00200","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1402503000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I shall speak briefly because I want to give one minute to Senator Healy Eames.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014061100042#SS00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1402503000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I am sorry but we cannot do that.
