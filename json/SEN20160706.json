I request that the decommissioned Naval Service vessel <i>LE Aisling<\/i>be donated to the people of Galway for use as a floating museum moored at either Galway Docks or Salthill.  To set out some of the background to this matter, in September 1996, Galway Corporation, which is now Galway City Council, formally adopted the <i>LE Aisling <\/i>on behalf of the people of Galway and resolved to develop a special relationship with the ship and its crew and to promote awareness of the role and functions of the Naval Service.  In accepting the adoption, the captain and crew of the <i>LE Aisling<\/i>undertook to nurture a special relationship with the city of Galway.  The city's coat of arms is displayed proudly on the insignia of the ship and it has been a continual source of pride for Galwegians to see that insignia and the ship itself when the <i>LE Aisling<\/i>has moored at Galway Docks.<\/p><p>Following the decommissioning of the ship, at which the Minister of State presided two weeks ago, Councillor Pearse Flannery of Galway City Council proposed on Monday last that the decommissioned ship would be donated to the city of Galway and received the unanimous backing of all councillors.  The proposal has the complete support of the Galway city manager, the heritage officer, the business community, the chamber of commerce and the Galway Harbour Company board, which is willing to berth the ship free of charge on behalf of the people of Galway.  All the stakeholders are in unison on this and I understand that a formal request was to be made to the Minister of State following the meeting on Monday night.  In view of the support from all of the stakeholders with connections to the city, I request that the application be considered favourably.  Galway is currently in contention for European city of culture 2020 and I understand the judges will be in the city in the next week or so.  This project could very much be a centrepiece in that process.<\/p><p>The <i>LE Aisling<\/i>patrol vessel was commissioned in 1980 and decommissioned a couple of weeks ago.  Its name was derived from the aisling poem to commemorate the centenary of the birth of P&aacute;draig Pearse.  How appropriate it would be in 2016 to donate the vessel to the people of Galway.

I attended the ceremony held in Galway on Wednesday, 22 June 2016 to mark the decommissioning of <i>LE Aisling<\/i>following 36 years of outstanding service to the State.  The proud record of the ship in operational service with the Naval Service was duly recognised and the range of activities which the ship was involved in was recalled and commended.  The former <i>LE Aisling<\/i>was twinned with Galway and its long association with the city of the tribes was also noted and remembered.  While in service the former <i>LE Aisling<\/i>travelled in excess of 628,000 nautical miles, equivalent to circumnavigating the globe 32 times.  The crew boarded more than 5,500 vessels at sea and detained more than 220 fishing vessels.  The former <i>LE Aisling<\/i>was involved in many successful operations, the most notable of which include the arrest of the <i>Marita Ann<\/i>in 1984.  It was also the first vessel on the scene of the Air India disaster in 1985, for which operation several of the crew were decorated.<\/p><p>In pursuit of our commitment to progress the ships replacement programme as set out in the White Paper on Defence, the Government has provided a significant increase in capital funding to enhance capabilities across the Defence Forces.  The <i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>will replace the former <i>LE Aisling<\/i>and is scheduled for delivery shortly.  The signing of a contract last month for the supply of a fourth sister vessel to augment the Naval Service fleet is a tangible demonstration of this commitment.  <i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>will be the third ship to be delivered under the current Naval Service vessel replacement programme.  <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>was commissioned into service in 2014, followed by <i>LE James Joyce<\/i>in September 2015.  <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>and <i>LE James Joyce<\/i>replaced <i>LE Emer<\/i>and <i>LE Aoife<\/i>, respectively, which were withdrawn from service on delivery of the new ships.  <i>LE Emer<\/i>was disposed of in 2013 by way of sale by public auction and &euro;320,000 was realised to the Exchequer in this regard.  <i>LE Deirdre<\/i>was similarly disposed of in 2001 for &pound;190,000.  A slightly different situation arose in 2015 in relation to the disposal of the <i>LE Aoife<\/i>.  The original intention was to sell <i>LE Aoife<\/i>by way of public auction in the same manner.  However, following a formal expression of interest from the Maltese authorities in acquiring <i>LE Aoife<\/i>and subsequent discussions between the then Minister for Defence and the Maltese Minister for Home Affairs and National Security, the plan to sell the ship was reconsidered.  The Maltese authorities requested the ship for their armed forces to patrol the Mediterranean Sea to endeavour to deal with the ongoing difficult refugee crisis in the region.  The then Minister agreed to the transfer of ownership of <i>LE Aoife<\/i>to the Maltese Armed Forces on humanitarian grounds.  While the vessel was no longer viable for use in Irish waters, it was ideally suited to address a pressing short-term requirement.<\/p><p>I understand the level of interest that the decommissioning of a Naval Service vessel generates.  The possibility of donating a vessel as a museum or visitor attraction also arose in connection with the disposals of the former <i>LE Deirdre, LE Emer <\/i>and<i>LE Aoife<\/i>.  However, I am advised that the age, size, structure and layout of Naval Service vessels mean they are considered rather unsuitable for conversion for use as museums or visitor attractions.  While my first priority is the appropriate disposal of defence equipment, I am aware that many issues arise in connection with the conversion of vessels for other roles.  This is because a vessel requires ongoing protection measures in respect of its physical condition to defend it and to guard it from deterioration.  Indeed, a vessel must be kept structurally sound, weather resistant and watertight.  This requires the availability of materials and competent personnel with the requisite skills and expertise to carry out work at a significant cost.  There are further considerations in relation to a vessel's use as a tourist attraction.  Large scale work would be required of the recipient to protect the physical condition of the vessel from deterioration or damage.  Further work would be involved in stabilising the structural integrity of the vessel and providing for its essential ongoing long-term maintenance.  Recipients face other significant costs associated with a donation of this type including those associated with health and safety issues and insurance liabilities and risks.  The most cost-effective approach will have to be taken into consideration in informing my decision on this matter.  I will determine the approach to the disposal of the <i>LE Aisling<\/i>very shortly and will take all of these matters into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#B00400","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his outline.

I am seeking clarification and a commitment from Irish Water to allay residents&rsquo; fears with regard to systems installed by county councils in housing estates over the past 50 years where main water and sewer lines pass through households, gardens and yards.<\/p> <p>In October 2015, the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, was asked if the Water Services Act 2013 would be amended to allow either Irish Water or the local authorities accept responsibility for all sewerage mains and infrastructure, such as manholes and interchanges, including those running through non-public properties which were originally maintained by the local authorities.  This refers to the maintenance of backyard sewer pipes.  At the time, the then Minister said that from 2014, Irish Water was responsible for the public water service infrastructure, including water supply pipes or sewers extending from waterworks or wastewater works to a boundary, an area of land attached to a property.  There were no plans to change the 2007 Water Services Act where the responsibility for the maintenance and replacement of any water or water waste pipes which are located in the boundaries of a property are the responsibility of the owner.  Irish Water produced a pipe ownership document which essentially stated the maintenance of communal sewers is a matter for the residents and not for Irish Water.  If Irish Water does not maintain the source, will the Government provide funding directly to local authorities to allow them to maintain the sewers maintained in the past, prior to the advent of Irish Water?<\/p> <p>For example, two weeks ago in one of the largest local authority housing estates in Carlow, I came across a situation where 12 houses, which are 50 years old, were all connected to the same pipeline.  There was a problem in one garden with the pipe leaking where the connecting manhole was located.  When I telephoned Irish Water, it informed me it was not responsible because it was inside the garden.  The local authority also told me it was not responsible.  The home owner affected is an old age pensioner and he was told he would have to pay a bill of &euro;2,500.  Nobody is taking responsibility and it is not acceptable.  It is outrageous to charge people for this when putting in water meters the same week.  We need to ensure Irish Water takes responsibility for this or the Government gives funding to local authorities to maintain these pipes, which they used to do.  This issue with these pipes is wear and tear and not the residents.  I know a committee has been set up to look into this.  This is the biggest issue facing Irish Water and local authorities and it needs to be sorted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#C00300","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Murnane O'Connor for raising this important issue which has slipped through all the negotiations over several years.

There is much work going on in trying to get this resolved.

It also provides a mechanism whereby water services infrastructure taken in charge by local authorities, pursuant to section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, may be subsequently transferred by ministerial order to Irish Water.<\/p><p>Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of public water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.  There are various categories of ownership of water services infrastructure in Ireland, State-owned, State-funded but operated by private group schemes, and infrastructure located on privately owned land, which is the issue raised by the Senator.  Irish Water is responsible for public water services infrastructure, including water supply pipes or sewers extending from a water-works or wastewater works to the curtilage of a private property.  That is the current legal position.<\/p><p>Under sections 43 and 54 of the Water Services Act 2007, responsibility for maintenance and replacement of any water or wastewater pipes, connections or distribution systems located within the boundary of a private property rests with the owner, which is the situation outlined by the Senator.  This was the position that existed prior to the establishment of Irish Water, when individual local authorities held responsibility for public water services and infrastructure.   Many cases have been highlighted in this and the Lower House where local authorities, from a public health perspective, may have carried out works to such infrastructure on private property in the past, even though it was not their legal responsibility to do so.  They did it because it was the right thing to do and the problem had to be resolved.  However, the practice varied greatly from one local authority area to another.  In some cases, developers can apply to local authorities to have water services in private estates taken in charge.  The case the Senator has raised relates to a council estate in County Carlow where some of the houses were purchased over time.  The request to take the estate in charge normally occurs one year after completion of the scheme when the developer applies to have his bond released.  That is where the infrastructure is generally outside someone's garden.<\/p><p>A memorandum-of-understanding protocol is in place between local authorities and Irish Water over the asset transfer process under the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013.  This protocol obliges local authorities to take all necessary steps to ensure that water services assets have been completed to a satisfactory standard or that the means to remediate such infrastructure has been obtained through enforcement action before these assets transfer to Irish Water.  Once an estate is taken in charge by a local authority, the water services assets will then transfer to Irish Water.  While the legal position is set out in the 2007 Act, my Department and various councils are engaging with Irish Water to establish clearly the respective responsibilities of Irish Water and property owners in respect of water supply and wastewater infrastructure.  Any agreement on respective responsibilities of Irish Water and property owners will need to be compatible with an individual's constitutional right to private property and Irish Water's obligations to deliver public water and wastewater services under the Water Services Acts 2007 to 2014.  There are issues to be resolved because this matter relates to people's private property.  I recognise that clarity is important for home owners and my Department will expedite its work with Irish Water on this issue in order that definitive clarity can be provided for all.<\/p><p>I totally understand what the Senator is saying.  I am familiar with similar cases and I am prepared to work on this to ensure it is as quickly as we can.  It is slightly complicated.  It probably should have been dealt with years but it was not.

I have detailed a list of US military aircraft which landed at or overflew Shannon Airport between 4 June and 12 June.  This list is by no means complete and only contains details of those aircraft that the Shannonwatch organisation has been able to monitor.  The number of US military planes listed as overflying is likely to be only a small fraction of the total and only includes overflying close to the airport.  The unusual number of midair refuelling aircraft landing and taking off from the airport during this period as well as overflying Irish airspace are of particular importance.<\/p><p>Two of these planes, KC10 refuelling tankers Nos. 85-0027 and 84-0192, made multiple departures from and landings at Shannon sometimes on the same days, indicating they were likely being used to refuel other US military aircraft in midair, either in Irish-controlled airspace or over the NATO exercise area in Europe.  Was the Minister aware that these planes were in Irish airspace?  What were they doing there?  It seems that they were involved in NATO's Anaconda military exercise, the largest war game in eastern Europe since the end of the Cold War.  The period during which these military aircraft landed and refuelled coincides with the preparations for the NATO Anaconda military exercise in Poland conducted between 7 June and 17 June.  It is likely that most of them are associated with that exercise.  If this is the case, it is not only a clear breach of Irish neutrality but this is also in clear breach of assurances given to the Government by the US Government that all US military aircraft using Shannon Airport and Irish airspace are not on military operations or military exercises.  Not only do these military planes breach our neutrality, they are a potential hazard to our environment and citizens.<\/p><p>A report in<i>The New York Times <\/i>on 20 June focused on former US soldiers who are now suffering from cancer after being used to clean up radioactive contaminated materials following two separate accidents involving US B-52 bombers carrying nuclear bombs, one in Spain and the other in Greenland.  Of course, we are told that the US military planes landing at Shannon and overflying Irish airspace never carry nuclear weapons, never even carry weapons or munitions of any sort and are not on military operations or military exercises.  However, we have no way of knowing what aircraft 50,000 ft. above Ireland are carrying, and no way of knowing what the US military aircraft landing at Shannon are carrying because no one searches them, except Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace, who were arrested trying to search some of these warplanes.  The Minister does not want to search them.  The Government has repeatedly refused to conduct searches of these military planes, despite an assurance in the previous programme for Government, arguing that trust of and diplomatic assurances by the US government are good enough.  However, this good faith is not good enough for myself, my party and for others.<\/p><p>In 2004, Deputy Clare Daly in 2004 said, &quot;They [the Government] are purposely turning a blind eye. They don't want to search [the planes] because they know what they will find and then the game will be up.&quot;In addition, the European Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, recently accused the Government of turning a blind eye to the use of Shannon Airport by the US for rendition purposes.  She also raised the question as to whether Ireland has compromised on justice in order to maintain good relations with Washington.  Why does the Minister not search these planes?  Is it because he is afraid of what will be found?  According to expert security analyst, Dr. Tom Clonan, Shannon is a virtual forward air base for the US military, and, in February 2015, he told a court that &quot;if Shannon was being used by any other group to cause the type of damage that the 2.25 million US troops that have passed through Shannon have caused, then the US would rightly identify it as a target&quot;.Dr. Clonan went to say that &quot;By allowing Shannon Airport to be used as a US military base, we are contributing to war and human rights abuse&quot;.<\/p><p>When one considers that estimates by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the UN, and the<i>Lancet <\/i>medical journal suggest that up to 1 million children have died as a direct and indirect result of the US-led wars in the Middle East since 1991 - the first Gulf War and the subsequent wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria - we should be thoroughly ashamed of any involvement we have in facilitating such attacks.  Sinn F&eacute;in brought a Bill before the D&aacute;il last year, which called for a referendum to enshrine Irish neutrality in the constitution.  The Minister rejected it and current policies on Shannon Airport make a joke of his Department's official policy of neutrality and of our international reputation.  Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality has been significantly diluted by successive Governments.  When will he accept this reality and give Irish citizens the power to ensure the State's neutrality in our constitution?  I am afraid to say that we are not neutral.  Instead, we are facilitating US military activity in wars that have cost millions of lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#D00400","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland.

Overflights by US military aircraft - and military aircraft from other friendly countries - are permitted without prior notification on the basis that the aircraft are unarmed, carry only cargo and passengers and comply with navigational requirements.  Ireland has bad a positive bilateral relationship with the US for a period that predates the official foundation of our State, as has been clear during our 1916 Centenary reflections.  Successive Governments have made landing facilities at Shannon available to the US for well over 50 years.  This facility is also made available for military aircraft from other countries that can be regarded as friendly.  From 2013 to 2015, permission was granted in respect of requests from 23 countries.  The same conditions apply to all landings by military aircraft.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan raises the issue of Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality.  Successive Governments have pursued a policy of military neutrality over many years.  This is characterised by non-participation in military alliances.  The continued commitment to this policy was reconfirmed last year in the foreign policy review, The Global Island, which stated, \"Our policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish foreign policy\".  Arrangements for landings at Shannon do not amount to any form of military alliance with the US or with any other country and are fully consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality.  The Senator referred to Ireland&rsquo;s international law obligations and used the term \"belligerent state\", which is used in the Hague Convention V on the rights and duties of neutral powers and persons in case of war on land.   It has been argued that our policy on landings at Shannon Airport violates the Convention but that is not the case.  The convention, concluded in 1907, concerns what was regarded at that time as the sovereign right of states to wage war and the rights and obligations of non-participant states which remained neutral.  War is no longer accepted as a legitimate instrument of national policy and the use of force is regulated by the UN Charter, which sets out a framework of internationally-accepted principles concerning collective security.  The charter has superseded the 1907 convention and the distinction made by it between belligerents and neutrals is no longer relevant.  The 1907 convention applies to the waging of war, which is an armed conflict between states, but it does not apply to conflicts within a state or to conflict between states and non-state actors, which represent the vast majority of modem armed conflicts.  Only 34 countries are states parties to the convention.  Ireland is not one of them, so the convention's application does not arise.<\/p> <p>Ireland's approach is broadly similar to that of other neutral European states.  I am satisfied that the Government&rsquo;s long-standing policy in respect of Shannon is consistent with our military neutrality and our obligations under international law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#E00100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I am reminded of the episode where Dougal holds up a sign saying \"Nothing to see here\".  The Minister's response is somewhat bizarre.  The clue is in the title - we are referring to midair refuelling planes landing repeatedly at Shannon.  I have the details in this regard in my possession.  I do not know about the Minister but on any occasion I have flown - even on a long-haul flight - I have never known a commercial plane to be refuelled in midair.  I do not believe that happens.  If we accept that to be true, what other credible explanation could there be for a series of refuelling planes to be landing and taking off from Shannon on the specified days other than that they were engaged in military exercises.  They were refuelling other aircraft.<\/p> <p>To be honest, the Minister did not reply to the matter as raised and that is disappointing.  Shannon Airport held a very honourable and important place in the social and economic life of the mid-west up until 2001 when its use by the US military became widespread and totally unjustified.  US military use contributes nothing to the profitability of Shannon Airport, except to fraudulently inflate the number of passengers passing through the facility.  The Minister will also be aware that taxpayers have paid out over &euro;40 million due to a ridiculous agreement with the US Government whereby we pay the air traffic control fees to Eurocontrol for US military flights.

Much to the credit of the political system in Ireland, countless Ministers have worked precisely to do that.  Much to the credit of the Minister's Department, officials have done a considerable amount of work over the years on educating farmers and ensuring the integrity of the Irish meat supply system nationally and internationally.  We have much to applaud ourselves for as a consequence.  We have responded to crises such as BSE and foot and mouth disease, and we have done so in jig time and with exemplary outcomes.  I do not wish to do anything today that would affect the integrity of meat supply from farm to plate, both nationally and internationally, or bring the system into disrepute.  Recently during the Seanad election campaign, I had the pleasure of visiting the mart in Kenmare, where I met Councillor Dan McCarthy, the mart manager.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#E00600","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>An honourable man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#E00700","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>He is an honourable man, indeed, and a gentleman.  On the day I visited, Dan was extremely frustrated because an animal delivered to the mart had two tags leaving the farm and only one on arriving at the sale ring.  The animal was forcibly withdrawn from sale and the farmer had to bring it back home.  To a large degree, that is the correct approach to ensure the integrity of the meat supply system.  We are talking about animals that are being sold for fattening.  I, being an urban dweller, am talking about something about which I have limited knowledge, but I could understand where Councillor McCarthy was coming from.  His point was that if I arrived at the gate of his farm and wished to buy an animal from him, I could do so, and that if the tag were missing from the animal, I could order a replacement and have it delivered to my farm.  His point made perfect sense and  I would be interested in hearing the comments of the Minister thereon.  The councillor said that when the animal is transferred to the mart, its tags are transferred to the mart's book.  The mart sells the animal and the tag is then transferred to the purchaser or recipient of the animal.  The councillor was making the point that if I buy the animal directly from the farmer and a tag is missing, I can order a replacement myself and have it delivered to my farm, making everybody happy.  If I bring the animal to a mart and the tag is missing, the mart will be told it cannot sell the animal on the day.  Councillor McCarthy asked whether it could not be the case that the mart could sell the animal, order a replacement tag on the same day, charge the seller for that replacement tag and have it delivered directly to the purchaser's farm.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

Councillor McCarthy estimated that bringing an animal to the mart costs &euro;75, which is a sizeable chunk out of any profit that is available to the farmer.  If it has to be done twice, the cost is &euro;150.  He thought this was bringing unnecessary hardship on farmers.<\/p><p>To me, it sounds like a very simple solution to what is a bureaucratic problem.  Nowhere along the line is the integrity of the beef being brought into question because only one tag is involved all the time, not two.  I spoke to Councillor McCarthy again last night.  He extends an invitation to the Minister to visit the Kenmare mart, which I am sure he would love to do, in order to allow the councillor to explain in detail to him how we might overcome this.

As a self-described urban dweller, I think he has a reasonable grasp of the issues involved.  I trust his briefing on the matter from Councillor McCarthy was fruitful in both directions in the context of the Seanad election, although the Cathaoirleach might have a slight concern about that.  I thank Senator Craughwell for his kind remarks.<\/p> <p>My Department is responsible for the development and implementation of the rules governing the identification and tracing systems for cattle in accordance with the requirements set out in EU and national legislation.  The objective of the Irish cattle identification system is to guarantee the safety of beef, beef products and dairy products by operating an effective, secure animal identification and tracing system under which cattle are required to maintain the same identity for life.<\/p> <p>The traceability system provides assurance to consumers and customers worldwide that a bovine animal can be traced from birth to slaughter or live export.  It is also a vital component in protecting animal and human health and in securing and maintaining markets for Irish cattle and beef and dairy products.  The Irish agricultural business is heavily reliant on beef, cattle and dairy operations which are underpinned by a robust bovine traceability system.  Thus, the implementation of an effective and reputable identification system plays a key role in underpinning beef and dairy exports in a competitive marketplace.  Ireland is one of the largest net beef exporters in the world, with some 90% of the output of the Irish beef industry exported.  A significant live cattle export trade complements the beef trade.  Furthermore, Ireland exports approximately 85% of its dairy production.<\/p> <p>Regulation (EC) No. 1760\/2000 sets down the system for the identification and registration of bovine animals.  National legislation underpins the Irish bovine animal identification and tracing system.  The bovine identification and registration system has four elements: tagging; bovine passport; on-farm bovine herd register; and a computerised database called the animal identification and movement system, AIM.  The AIM system records all births, movements and disposals in accordance with EU requirements and, therefore, traces all bovines from birth to slaughter.  SI No. 77 of 2009, European Communities (Identification of Bovines) Regulations, requires that bovines must be double-tagged within 20 days of birth and registered within seven days of tagging.  Keepers are obligated under the legislation to apply two ear tags to a calf up to 20 days after birth, or prior to movement off the holding, if earlier.  Accordingly, all bovines must bear two ear tags prior to leaving the holding.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that the obligation lies with the keeper to ensure that each bovine has two ear tags at all times and that if an animal loses a tag, he or she is obligated to replace that tag.  It is illegal to move a bovine animal from a holding with one tag and, furthermore, it is illegal to offer for sale or to facilitate the sale of an animal with one tag.  In line with the obligation on the keeper to ensure that each bovine has two ear tags at all times, it would not be appropriate for a livestock mart to facilitate the sale of an animal with one ear tag.  There is significant potential to lose traceability if a system were introduced to permit the presentation for sale of animals with one ear tag and such animals were to lose the ear tag on leaving the mart.  By extension it would not be appropriate for a second party to purchase an animal with one ear tag and for the Department to be involved in some mechanism to impose a restriction on that animal on the holding of the second party.<\/p> <p>Cross-compliance inspections apply sanctions on breaches of any one of the four pillars of identification.  If a cross-compliance inspection finds a bovine with one tag, the onus is on the keeper to apply a replacement tag within a certain timeframe, whereupon the restriction is lifted.  Accordingly, the obligation is on the keeper with the animal with one tag to rectify the problem, and this problem should not be transferred to another keeper.<\/p> <p>I must ensure that a coherent approach is in place to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s robust bovine identification and traceability system to support our critical markets in live cattle, beef and dairy products to underpin the livelihoods of farmers.  Furthermore, I need to ensure that systems are in place at all times to ensure that keepers are mindful of their obligations to have animals double-tagged and avoid any possible developments that could encourage laxity on obligations to have animals with two ear tags.  I must be mindful, in considering any proposals for changes in trading arrangements, of the potential for effectively transferring the penalty, which is currently imposed on a keeper for having an animal with one ear tag, to the farmer acquiring such an improperly identified animal.  My Department, as the competent authority, is obligated to implement the legislation.  However, this does not preclude discussion on any issues that may need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>I accept the Senator's bona fides in raising this issue.  I am familiar with it because I live in a town with a mart.  I have seen the issue raised and know it is one that antagonises farmers.  The message I am trying to communicate is that there is more at stake than the individual impact on a single farmer.  There is the question of reputational damage and the necessity for a nation that exports so much beef product, most in processed form but a significant amount in live exports, to have efficient traceability systems.  Since my appointment, I have met the ambassadors of China, the US, New Zealand and Iran, all with the purpose of securing new and improved market access.  We will be going to China in early September on a mission to improve market access, particularly in the context of beef.  One of the cornerstones of our sales pitch will be that we have a system of traceability that is second to none and that our system stands up to scrutiny on any occasion we have to order a recall or identify a batch or an animal, for one reason or another.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that this puts a significant onus on individual farmers inside their farm gates.  However, if we look at the bigger picture, while onerous, I believe it is a price worth paying.  In the absence of the heat of a specific case, when we stand back and look at it, I believe it is a necessary burden that individual farmers carry for the collective interest of the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#F00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for a most comprehensive answer which has reassured me as to the quality and traceability of Irish beef.

Will the Leader confirm whether this measure is being progressed and the NTPF will be set up urgently to address the ever increasing waiting lists?  The figures for May show that they had reached a new high, with 74,000 patients waiting for day case treatment, an increase of more than 45% in two years.  The former Minister set a 15-month target to the end of 2015, but more than 5,300 patients have been waiting longer for treatment.  A further 5,691 have been waiting for between one year and 15 months.  Outpatient figures are also continuing to rise, with 415,000 waiting for treatment.  Some 62,000 patients have been waiting for longer than one year for an outpatient appointment, including 4,500 in children's hospitals, of whom more than 1,800 have been waiting for longer than 15 months.  Overall, 30,000 patients have been waiting for longer than 15 months for an outpatient appointment.  In my constituency 857 patients have been waiting for longer than one year at St. James's Hospital for an outpatient appointment, an increase of 588 since December.  In Crumlin's children's hospital nearly 2,000 children have been waiting for longer than one year for an outpatient consultation, a jump of almost 1,000 since last December.  Some 236 of these children have been waiting for 18 months plus.  In 2002 Fianna F&aacute;il set up the NTPF.  In 2010, the last year of its existence, 33,000 public patients were facilitated.  In total, almost 200,000 public patients were treated under the fund.  In 2010 the average waiting time for elective treatment was just 2.6 months, down from between two and five years in 2002.  Furthermore, in 2010 the prices negotiated with the private hospital system were, on average, 8% lower than in the previous year.<\/p> <p>The second matter I wish to raise relates to older people, loneliness and elder abuse in the community.  World Elder Abuse Awareness Day was 15 June.  Many of us have friends, close relatives and neighbours who live alone and who, from time to time, feel isolation and loneliness to varying degrees.  This leaves many of them vulnerable to abuse by those who, as the statistics have shown, are closest to them and meant to be their care givers.  ALONE has reported that the abuse of older people is often carried out by a carer or family member on whom the older person relies.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As a result the abused individual is often fearful of speaking out and losing their only source of contact, help or support.<\/p><p>Elder abuse, as has been defined, is a single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action occurring within any relationship, where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person or violates their human or civil rights.  Sixty-five years of age is taken as a point at which abuse may be considered elder abuse.  Elder abuse can manifest itself in many forms.  It can be physical, emotional, financial or neglect.  The World Health Organization identifies social isolation as a risk factor in elder abuse.  As people's support networks narrow and they become more reliant on individuals, the risk of elder abuse heightens.  <\/p><p>If one suspects that an older person may be in need of help or suffering from abuse one may contact their GP, the Garda, public health nurse or HSE care worker.  In our communities it is imperative that centres for caring for the elderly, from active retirement facilities to more hands-on centres for Alzheimer's or more serious impairment issues, are funded and supported by the Government to ensure that this sense of loneliness and anxiety is not felt by a huge proportion of our citizens as it is today.  I would like to see an increase in hours allocated for the home help care packages and the introduction of some type of scheme, intimated by Senator Colette Kelleher whereby elderly people are supported to stay in their homes rather than go into a nursing home which, in many circumstances, can be traumatising for the individual as a massive change in their life.<\/p><p>In light of more recent developments and irregularities in Console, in particular, I ask the Government not to leave this gap in funding to non-governmental organisations.  The Government must act now to properly fund and progress facilities and supports for our elderly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#G00500","speaker":"1407","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I wish to raise two issues.  I agree with Senator Catherine Ardagh in respect of her concerns about the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  It is timely we had a comprehensive statement on it.  I declare I am a former director of the NTPF so I know a good deal about it.  It has had a great record in the past.  I understand from a brief discussion here in response to another issue last week that the Minister touched on the NTPF and its objectives and targets.  There is mention of it in the programme for Government.  It would be helpful if we had an overview of what is planned now because this organisation is up and running, albeit submerged back into the Department and called the delivery unit or the special delivery unit.  It has a very good track record of delivering and ultimately treating the patients who are longest on the waiting list and bringing them forward.  That is what it was set up to do and I think it has the potential to do it.  It would be helpful if we had an update on it.<\/p> <p>The other point I wish to raise is the suggestion by the Government and, in particular, by the Minister with responsibility for housing, planning and local government, Deputy Simon Coveney, that more than 150 units of housing be fast-tracked through An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There was a suggestion - one I read in the media - that Fianna F&aacute;il was in agreement and would like the number reduced from 150 units to 50 units.  I have not spoken directly to Fianna F&aacute;il to date on the issue but that is what is attributed to it.  I believe in the power of local democracy and local government and the role of planning authorities to determine the outcomes of planning applications as provided in the Planning and Development Act.  That is where it should remain.  The supply of planning for the planning process is not delaying the roll-out and construction of houses.  What is delaying it is the development levies.  The sections 48 and 49 levies, under the planning and development scheme, are inhibiting development and people are waiting to see if there will be a change in how that is supplied.  I would like to have the Minister come to the House to elaborate and share with members what he is planning in respect of the roll-out and empowering An Bord Plean&aacute;la which currently is not meeting its 18 weeks deadline on a whole range of major critical infrastructural issues.

I have been dealing with home help hours for a long time.  Between 31 August 2009 and 31 August 2010, Fianna F&aacute;il cut 32,000 hours of home help from very vulnerable people in Mayo.  Fine Gael when in government went on to cut 9,000 hours from people in Mayo.  In addition it told elderly people that they were not even worth one hour, that it had to be 15 minutes, 30 minutes or 45 minutes.  In view of this I find it difficult to hear such people calling for increases in home help hours given what they did and in spite of us begging them not to so that people could stay in their own homes.  I had a case in Westport of a 99 year old man who was getting three hours home help per week.  His home help hours were cut to two hours per week.  As he was 99 years old it was not going to be long-term care.  I cannot let that pass without putting on record the facts around home help and the savage cuts made under the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government and continued, albeit to a lesser extent, under the Fine Gael-led Government.<\/p> <p>I wish to speak about Console.  We are aware of the dreadful facts as they emerge in regard to the improper behaviour at Console.  Apart from the understandable disgust felt at the actions of a few, there is a concern with regard to the viability of the charity and the services it provides.  The Government has tactically admitted that charities such as Console exist in the first place to make up for the shortage of services.  We have to remember that charities such as Console are filling in gaps in essential services, often life saving services, that should be put in place by Government.  In this context I call for time to be set aside for the relevant Minister to attend the House to discuss specifically the strategic view of the mental health commission which set out a new strategy for mental health for 2016 to 2018 and to review the progress made in A Vision for Change.<\/p> <p>I am aware that we have had statements on mental health in the House but I believe that a focused debate on the progress made since the report was published in late June, on the allocation of funding, would be helpful.  We could also discuss the delay in making legislative changes to the Mental Health Act 2001, as signalled in the review carried out in December 2014.  I am calling for a debate which would be centred on the positive measures that can be adopted and which, hopefully, will reassure the public which unfortunately has had to rely heavily on organisations such as Console.  I wish to convey our solidarity and thoughts to the staff of Console who have worked very hard, and continue to do so, under very difficult circumstances and also to the many people whose lives depend on Console.  They must be to the forefront of our minds at all times and we must ensure that whatever emergency measures are needed are put in place to ensure the service is continued to those people.<\/p> <p>I refer to the wonderful briefing given this morning by my colleague Senator Frances Black and others from the Alcohol Health Alliance on alcohol and its impact on children.  The issue is one on which we in the Seanad can work and in this regard can support the public health (alcohol) Bill.  I look forward to that Bill coming before the House and the Seanad doing everything it can to address the impact of alcohol not only on adults but on children.  Also there is a role for the Seanad in terms of the online advertising of alcohol which is particularly targeted at children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#H00300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I refer to the report that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, is proposing to de-designate 46 raised bogs as natural heritage areas.

However, in moving to permit fresh unrestricted cutting on these 46 sites, the Government is throwing away so much.  I would like to hear from the Minister if she will commit to carrying out environmental impact assessments on each of the proposed de-designations.  These boglands are a unique natural repository of information about past climates, vegetation and human activity and they have extreme value for biodiversity, acting as a carbon sink and mitigating against flooding.  They also attract tourists to Ireland.  Seamus Heaney's poetry gives us a great sense of the importance of our bogs.  I hope other Senators will join me in condemning this move and seeking that the Minister comes to the House to explain her reasoning for the de-designations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#H00400","speaker":"1385","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>It is Labour Party Private Members' time later, for which I thank the Leader.  We are taking Committee Stage of the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2016, which passed Second Stage last January.  I thank colleagues on both sides of the House for expressing support to me for the principle underpinning the Bill and for supporting the passage of the Bill on Committee Stage.  It seeks to amend competition law to provide collective bargaining rights for freelance workers.  Under the current interpretation of the Competition Act, that is not permitted.  Unions, including the NUJ and SIPTU, in particular, back the Bill strongly and I am hosting a briefing with union representatives for all Senators who are interested in learning more about it in advance of the debate at 3 p.m. in Room C, LH2000.  I urge colleagues to attend.  There is a broader issue in terms of false self-employed, that is people who are in all but name employees but who are being treated by their employers as false self-employed and who, therefore, lack various workers'  protections, including collective bargaining rights.<\/p> <p>I call on the Leader to schedule a debate on the Middle East and foreign policy in light of the terrible suicide bombing in Baghdad.  I condemn it and offer my sympathies to the people of Iraq.  The Iraqi Government said earlier that the number who died in the bomb attack has increased to 250.  Just a short while ago, the Chilcot report into the UK Government's decision to go to war with Iraq was published.  The preliminary indications are the report has delivered a crushing verdict on the UK Government's decision.  The report says it was made before all peaceful options were exhausted and the evidence on weapons of mass destruction did not support the pre-invasion statements by the government.  There will be more to come from the report and I would like us to have a debate on that.  Many of us marched against that war in Ireland and, indeed, in Britain in 2003.<\/p> <p>I regret the resignation of Mr. Joe O'Toole from the position he had undertaken to accept as chairperson of the commission on water.

The Leas-Chathaoirleach was one of those who contributed.  This issue has, therefore, not only been highlighted by this Seanad.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise a decision by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which was formerly the NRA, to reject a proposal by Clare County Council to deal with the extraordinary traffic difficulties caused by Blake's Corner, Ennistymon, on the N67, a national secondary route.  It is the worst junction on the Wild Atlantic Way.  It has national significance because 1.5 million people will attend the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience this year, the vast majority  of whom will have to navigate this corner, where there can be delays of up to two hours.  The county council proposed a bypass of the buildings on the corner by constructing a new bridge.  I have maintained consistently for a long time that this approach is not correct and would not deal with current and future traffic challenges.  I am glad TII agrees with my assessment.  Will TII fund a full bypass of Ennistymon, which is the only way to deal with the year-round chaos?  I call on the Leader to write to the chief executive officer of TII and ask what are the plans of the organisation to deal with the traffic congestion that has chocked the town.  I seek a clear statement about what TII will do and the timeline for this because there is utter chaos, which needs to be dealt with.  The cost of a bypass would be between &euro;15 million and &euro;20 million and that would solve the problem.  The county council's proposal would cost between &euro;6 million and &euro;8 million.<\/p> <p>The Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience is the No. 1 or No. 2 tourist destination in the country.  It is not too much to ask that a proper road infrastructure be provided to the millions of people who travel there to give them a pleasant experience of Ireland.  It is not good enough that they face traffic chaos going to and from the cliffs.  Usually, they are the first or final destination for tourists using Shannon Airport.  This issue creates an impression and an impact one way or another.  The wonderful work done by the management at the Cliffs of Moher is being negated by the incompetence of both Clare County Council infrastructure section and TII.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#J01000","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I refer to Senator Conway-Walsh's contribution in respect of cutbacks during the last the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government six years ago.

Can the Leader confirm whether that is the case and, if so, will both Chambers be obliged to ratify it?  Two national newspapers, the <i>Irish Daily Mail<\/i>and the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, have covered the trade deal between Canada and the EU.  Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m is the EU Trade chief executive and yesterday she accused EU Governments of not showing adequate leadership in explaining the deals to their citizens.  It is difficult for citizens to know about a deal unless it comes through their national parliaments.  To my knowledge, none of the deals have come national parliaments, so far.  It was also reported that the deal, known as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, is the largest trade deal ever concluded by the EU.  It eliminates 99% of customs duties between the EU and Canada and opens up lucrative public procurement contracts in agrifood markets for EU companies.  EU trade deals are negotiated by the European Commission on behalf of the bloc's governments but have increasingly required the approval of national parliaments before they can take effect.

The reason given for doing so was serious electrical issues in the centre in Athlone.  Since news broke I know that Deputy Troy's office has been inundated with phone calls from people.  They expressed genuine concerns and fear that the centre will remain closed, as has happened in the past when other care centres were closed down for similar reasons.

The Minister also needs to give an assurance that this care centre will re-open.

When one considers the worrying statistic to which Alcohol Action drew our attention today, namely, that an estimated 271,000 children under 15 years of age are living with parents who are regular risky drinkers, we can see this is a huge issue.

I was on the relevant committee for the last number of years.  It was an excellent presentation which focused on the effect that alcohol in the home has on children and, in particular, the effect that availability, affordability and accessibility of alcohol has on both adults and children, who are of course affected by the adults with whom they live.<\/p> <p>Minimum pricing is one thing that will make a huge difference.  In all studies, affordability is linked to the amount that is consumed.  Another issue mentioned by Senator Conway-Walsh is the social media aspect, which I believe is a real challenge for us and which I mentioned some time ago on the Order of Business.  Broadcasting rules which apply to alcohol advertising on television do not apply to social media.  We are chasing to catch up on this issue because children are ahead of adults when it comes to much of the Internet.  It is a real problem.<\/p> <p>I take Senator Mullen's point that we need to be more courageous and I agree that alcohol is a societal issue.  However, the Bill is a start and shows we are facing up to it to some degree.  I welcome it because it is probably the most courageous alcohol legislation that we have seen.  It is a start, although I accept a lot more needs to be done.  The economic argument is also huge, as I have mentioned before, given the unacceptable level of alcohol consumption is costing the taxpayer &euro;1.5 billion, which is equal to &euro;1 for every &euro;10 spent on public health.

The people in the Six Counties, Nationalist, Unionist, republican, loyalist and everything else in between, have clearly exercised their democratic wish to stay in the EU.

In particular, I refer to the fact that on top of the 80% from an elderly person's income, they are required to contribute towards the cost of their care in a nursing home.  An amount of 7.5% of the value of an asset, whether it be land or a business, is also required to be contributed.<\/p> <p>A problem arises in that farms may not necessarily be able to support such a charge on property.  It is only on the basis of certain criteria that the three-year cap applies.  A farmer or a young business person who has inherited land or a business from a parent could have an indefinite charge of 7.5% for as long as a parent, aunt or uncle survives.  That can be untenable from a business point of view because the young farmer or the business person has to be able to live as well.<\/p> <p>Another issue is the assessment of the financial contribution requires that land and any other assets which the retired elderly person receiving care had within the previous five years up to the date of the application must be included in that assessment.  We have policy which encourages land mobility, especially to younger farmers, and in many cases where older farmers transfer land, they do not receive payment for it.  The idea that the value of an asset of land a farmer transferred four years ago would be included and assessed as income seems a nonsense.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a case to reduce the timeframe for the transfer of assets and income which are included in the financial assessment.  The IFA suggests that this should be three years.  There should also be a reduction in the 7.5% per annum charge against the farm or the business to reflect the ability of the farm or business to pay towards the older person's care in the nursing home.  Other than that, it puts people in an untenable position.  In the context of the upcoming budget, I would like the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to take up this issue with the Minister for Health because he is best placed and he understands the position of farm families and businesses.

I recall the savage cuts.  More than 500,000 hours were cut between both parties, yet Members have stood up today pretending to be friends to home helps.

I thank Senator Ardagh for her remarks regarding the Minister for Health and waiting lists.  The Minister and the Government are engaging with the NTPF and it is planned that prior to the end of the year, the NTPF and the HSE will have a dedicated waiting list initiative.<\/p><p>We all accept that there is a key issue around waiting times.  All of us are working to eliminate them but it is important to note that 60% of those on the lists are waiting less than six months for required care and 94% are waiting less than the waiting time maximum of 15 months.  We all accept we have a journey to travel but improvements have taken place.<\/p><p>The Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Varadkar, have worked to eliminate waiting times.  There was an interesting article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>earlier this week in which the chief executive of Cork University Hospital, Mr. Tony McNamara, issued a set of figures relating to those who miss appointments and the implications this has for waiting times and for hospitals.  It is important to ensure there is a dedicated outcome in terms of the levels of service, be it in terms of chronological scheduling or putting a plan in place regarding the procedures for how people are seen and assessed, in the HSE service plan in order that waiting times for patient treatment and appointments are reduced.  We all very much want that to happen and I share the Senator's concerns in this regard.  She raised the issue of older people.  We had a good debate on yesterday's Order of Business on elderly care and the national dementia strategy.  I hope we can work together as a collective on ensuring the strategy is worked on on a cross-party basis.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan also raised the issue of the NTPF.  He then raised the issue of the special delivery unit on housing.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will bring his housing proposals to Cabinet and then to the Oireachtas.  The Government is committed to recommencing a building programme and has set aside capital funding for that.  The Minister has said he is willing to work with everyone to ensure there is a process that will deliver housing and I look forward to that.<\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised an important mental health issue, on which we had a good debate.  I agree with her that many positive measures are being taken.  We should examine the Mental Health Commission report with a view to seeing how we can work with the Minister and the National Office of Suicide Prevention on that.  The issue of the family carer can be addressed next week with the Minister for Social Protection when he comes to the House.  I will not invite commentary or engage in the war between Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna Fail regarding who did what or where.  Revisionism is alive and well in our Chamber.<\/p><p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan raised the issue of raised bogs and the Habitats Directive and I am happy to have the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht come before the House regarding that issue.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik raised the Private Members' Bill which will be taken later today.  We will have a discussion on that and I thank her for working with all of us regarding the legislation.  It is important that we protect workers who do not enjoy the same rights or conditions and who are in a vulnerable position regarding their hours of contract and employment.  I very much hope that this can be resolved during the lifetime of this Parliament.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh mentioned the atrocity in Baghdad yesterday and I neglected to comment on it.  I join the Senator and Senator Bacik in sympathising with the families that have been affected by huge atrocities across the world.  The publication of the Chilcot report earlier was chilling for those charged with the administration of key offices throughout the world.  I have only perused it briefly but the report should be read not least because he makes a number of key points such as that Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator who was in violation of UN human rights obligations.  The report states peaceful options were not exhausted, which is a source of worry, and flawed intelligence was presented to governments in respect of Iraq's nuclear programme. The role of the UN and the authority of the Security Council was undermined.  Having attended the OSCE last weekend, we might have a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade about the role of the UN and the Security Council.<\/p><p>Senator Martin Conway raised an important health and safety issue regarding Blake's Corner in Ennistymon.  He rightly referenced the fact that 1.5 million people will visit the Cliffs of Moher on the Wild Atlantic Way.  I thank him for raising the issue, as Senator Hopkins did yesterday, regarding health and safety at key visitor centres.  At a time when the Government has invested heavily in tourism, it is important that should be linked to transport facilities and infrastructure.<\/p><p>Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Mullen raised the issue of probate, which must be addressed.  Senator O'Sullivan is correct regarding waiting times.  Some of the delays are due to time being given to families by the relevant office.  Probate is a sensitive and difficult issue but I agree with him that the processing of applications should be expedited.<\/p><p>Senator O'Donnell mentioned the important issue of the ongoing effect of Brexit.  I hope we, in this House, can play a key role in discussing not just the North-South implications, which are profound, but also the implications for us as an island nation.  As a first step, Irish MEPs should come to the House.  I hope the Senator will pursue this important matter again because we need to have it addressed.  The House can play a key role in shaping opinion, highlighting issues and plotting a forward course for the country.<\/p><p>Senators Conway and Davitt referred to the remuneration of councillors, which was addressed in yesterday's motion.  I thank Members for their support and I apologise for any miscommunication around the motion.  The debate demonstrated none was intended and I am willing to keep the issue to the fore.<\/p><p>Senator Paddy Burke raised the timely issue of the EU-Canada trade agreement.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->To the best of my knowledge, the debate centring on this is an important one for the EU, not least because the agreement gives us an opportunity for further economic development.  My understanding, from listening to the Senator and from doing a bit of research, is that there are three stages to the ratification process.  The European Council meets in October and, depending on its recommendation, the agreement will go to the European Parliament, after which the national parliaments will ratify it.  I hope that the Houses of the Oireachtas will jointly play a role in the ratification process.  I stand with the Senator in ensuring that the Seanad will play a part.<\/p><p>Senator Paul Daly raised the important issue of St. Vincent's Care Centre, Athlone, in respect of which an electrical report highlighted a number of risks.  In the interests of patient and staff safety, there have been moves to place the people affected into temporary accommodation on a phased basis.  From speaking with the Senator, Senator McFadden and Deputy Troy, my understanding is that the HSE is involved in discussions on how to address the matter and ensure that the people's discommoding is temporary and they will return to St. Vincent's as soon as possible.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is also involved.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke discussed the role of Senators regarding the ten-year health strategy.  I have repeatedly stated that Senators should be included.  This is the Upper House.  The Senator was modest in his remarks concerning the members of the health committee of the previous Oireachtas.  He and former Senator Jillian van Turnhout played pivotal roles.  I hope that Senators will be a part of the new committee.  There is no reason for it not to be a joint committee.  The ratification can be amended to include us.  It is a question of all voices being heard.  If it is to be an inclusive ten-year strategy, it will get off to a bad start if Senators are excluded.  I share Senator Colm Burke's view in that regard and I will raise it at today's meeting of the Whips and leaders.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen referred to a missing child and the role of the journalist, Ms Gemma O'Doherty.  I will raise the matter with the Minister to get a response for the Senator.  He also mentioned the issue of probate.<\/p><p>Alcohol was discussed by a number of Senators.  I commend the all-party group on the briefing co-hosted by my colleague, Senator Noone.  I congratulate her on her appointment as Deputy Leader, which I meant to do yesterday, and wish her well.  Blessed am I among women, as I am the only male among the group leaders.  I look forward to working with all of the women leaders, if I can use that word, of the groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#N00300","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>The Leader is all-embracing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#O00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>It is brilliant that there is a majority of women leading the Seanad.

I hope that we can arrive at legislation that tackles alcohol's misuse.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine referred to the role of the charities regulator in respect of the irregularities that have arisen.  Yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste addressed the House on a Commencement matter.  She will sign a statutory instrument in September.  On behalf of the Seanad, I praise the staff of the charity sector.  They do a great deal of valuable work.  The service-level agreements that are signed up to by the HSE on behalf of the State with service providers require scrutiny.  We may debate this matter in the autumn.  Perhaps the Seanad can play a role in improving that relationship and process.  We must give confidence to the families and people who require charities' services that that work will continue in a safe and proper manner.<\/p> <p>Senator Lombard raised a matter that is dear to my heart, namely, that relating to Cork Airport and Norwegian flights.  I had the opportunity to meet Vice President Biden a couple of weeks ago and I raised with him the importance of the Cork-Boston-Norway flight.  For Senators who are not familiar with this issue, it is for the US Department of Transportation to sign a licence to allow Norwegian airlines to operate the transatlantic link.  That link is important from the point of view of economic development, tourism, jobs and the country.  Senator Lombard asked that the Minister to come before the House.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, took my Commencement matter a couple of weeks ago, but I will ask him to return on this topic.<\/p> <p>Senator Clifford-Lee discussed yesterday's shooting in Lusk.  I thank her for her co-operation with and support for the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill.  It is important that we allocate extra resources and take a universal approach to stopping gangland crime.  Yesterday's Bill was an important first step in that regard, as will be the issuing of extra provisions.  The Senator mentioned Rush Garda station.  I am sure that the T&aacute;naiste will be happy to engage with her on that matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne referred to life-long learning in Limerick and commended the Limerick City and County Council on its Summer Stars programme.  It is important that we inculcate in young people a love of books and reading.  If Senators do nothing else, we should combine our resources to sponsor a book for a school library in each of our individual areas.  Reading is a skill that we should not lose.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile discussed North-South relations.  I hope to see these being promoted in the House, given Brexit and the Senator's point about an all-Ireland forum.  The Taoiseach is right about that and it is something that we should pursue.  There is the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, as well as co-operation in the House on North-South issues, but it is important that we continue building relationships that are more than just talking shops and have tangible outcomes.  We are an island nation.  It makes no sense not to have further co-operation.<\/p> <p>Senator Mulherin raised the important issue of the fair deal scheme as it related to farmers and the owners of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  The Ministers for Health and Agriculture, Food and the Marine should attend the House in this regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan referred to bin charges.  The Minister has appeared before the House twice and I do not believe that we will have another debate on bin charges before the summer recess.  I will ask the Minister to send a note to the group leaders on the issues we have raised.  As to home helps, we have all seen difficulties in the health service being addressed.  Despite the Senator's remarks, we all want to see an improvement in our communities' home help hours.  This is not an issue of clients or service level hours.  It is about how to improve the terms, conditions and lives of those who need home help.  I will work with any Senator to promote the role of home helps and to improve the living conditions of those who require their services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#O00500","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467797400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Communications, Climate Action and the Environment: Statements","time":1467797400,"counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#P00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>This is my first time in 19 years to address the Seanad.  I am delighted to be back in the Chamber as the Minister with responsibility for communications, climate action and the environment.  When I was appointed, I told senior officials in my Department that it was very much a facilitating one because we can drive much of the change required to achieve energy efficiency in the public sector and provide high-speed broadband in communities across the country.  We will work with colleagues in other Departments to drive changes in society, not just in government.  I want to be a facilitating Minister.  As I said in the D&aacute;il on the day of my appointment, I spent long enough on the Opposition benches to know how lonely, difficult and frustrating it can be when one has constructive suggestions to make but they fall on deaf ears.  Senators should come forward with their constructive suggestions and ideas.  I want to hear and facilitate them.  I have asked my officials to examine Seanad amendments proposed to the Energy Bill and the Minerals Development Bill to see if we can facilitate their passage.  The Energy Bill will be completed here before the end of this session and the Minerals Development Bill in the next one.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to give an overview of my Department, set out the key economic sectors for which it is responsible and outline how Senators can assist me in delivering on its key priorities, in particular, those set out in the programme for Government.  Many Members from rural communities will understand the basic difficulties experienced by families and businesses across rural Ireland arising from the absence of high-speed broadband.  The national broadband plan, NBP, is one of the key priorities for the Government, with the aim of bringing high-speed broadband to every household and business in the country.  It will involve 96% of the landmass and over 100,000 km of road network.  The network, once developed, will be expected to serve at least 30% of the premises which cannot currently gain access to high-speed services.<\/p> <p>Yesterday I brought proposals to the Cabinet outlining the ownership model for the NBP network and that we were moving to the next stage of the procurement process, with a view to having a tender in place by the middle of next year.  The Government has chosen a commercial stimulus, or gap-funded, model as the optimum ownership model for the network.  This model will see the successful bidder design, build, own and operate the network.  For the next 25 years there will be absolutely no difference between either of the two ownership models.  The main difference, however, is that if we had gone for a model where the State would own the network in 26 years, I would be announcing a minimum additional six-month delay in the tendering process.  This would have been ten weeks after the Department had announced a six-month delay.  In effect, in ten weeks, we would have announced a minimum of a 12-month delay in the roll-out of the network which would not have sent a positive message to families waiting for broadband, or encouraged existing businesses in rural areas to invest and create jobs or new businesses to locate in rural communities.  This was the right decision.  As Members know from my record, I feel strongly about the ownership of State infrastructural assets and have acted on it.  There are few Oireachtas Members who have a record as strong as mine on this issue.  I was one of the few Members, in either the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, to publicly oppose the farming organisations, the then agriculture Minister and the European Commission when they decommissioned the sugar industry, an industry which some Members are now trying to re-establish.  There were very few voices against the move at the time and I took a lot of heat for standing up against the decision, but I was proved right.<\/p> <p>I was a lone voice in the D&aacute;il in arguing that the Heathrow slots owned by Aer Lingus were a strategic national asset.  I convinced the then transport Minister, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, to include specific provisions in the Aer Lingus Act to ensure specific protections would be put in place for these strategic national assets.  No one else raised this issue on Second Stage of the legislation at the time.<\/p> <p>I was a lone voice in the previous D&aacute;il when an Opposition amendment on Irish Water was accepted by the Government.  My amendment ensure no asset of Irish Water could be privatised or sold off without a democratic vote of the people, a point many D&aacute;il Members today conveniently ignore.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Denis Naughten:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=809\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=809&amp;amp;pid=DenisNaughten&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When I first examined this issue, I wanted to keep the asset in State ownership but I also gave a promise to the people after the election, and before it in my constituency, that I would ensure broadband would be brought to every single home and premises as quickly as possible.  I was not prepared to stand over delaying this process for six, 12 or 18 months because the Government kicked the can down the road last December and failed to make the decision that I believe should have been made at that stage.  The reason it did not make the decision last December is the same as the one I have difficulty with now, namely, an additional &euro;1 billion would have to be made available and it would have to be taken out of the capital plan, which would delay schools building projects and other infrastructural projects across the country.  Additional cash would have to be sourced up-front from the current budget.  That is why the can was kicked down the road last December.  I was not prepared to take that option although it was suggested to me that we delay further.<br\/><br\/>I want to make real on the promises given by the previous Government, by me as a Deputy and candidate in the general election, and by all of us in both Houses on the rolling out of the national broadband plan.  People in rural areas are sick and tired of being promised they will get broadband next week or month.  When I give a date, I want to be able to stand over it.  It is my intention to be able to say by the back end of next year exactly when every premises in the country will get broadband.  It will not be 2018 or 2019 when they will find out.  If I had gone down a different funding route, I would have to wait until then to provide information.<br\/><br\/>Once the contract is awarded next year, the roll-out phase will begin immediately in conjunction with the already planned commercial investment.  Some 85% of premises in Ireland will have access to high-speed broadband within two years, and I hope 100% will have it within five years.  I hope it will be before five years.  In the tendering process, we will try to ensure the broadband will be rolled out as quickly as possible.  Some contractors are telling us they can do the work in three years.  If so, we will take that into account.<br\/><br\/>Small businesses are the backbone of every provincial town and village.  Consumers across Ireland are now spending almost &euro;14,000 every minute trading online.  It is essential that we capitalise on that to support the creation of new business and jobs.  Sadly, of the &euro;14,000 per minute, &euro;10,000 per minute is being spent outside Ireland.  My Department funds a trading online voucher scheme, which is operated through the national network of 31 local enterprise offices, LEOs. This initiative has real potential to create jobs.  We have seen from an analysis of the vouchers that have already been given out that sales have increased by one fifth and employment has increased by one third.  Two thirds of the relevant businesses are now trading internationally.  I encourage any business that is not currently trading online, no matter how small, to contact its local enterprise office and avail itself of the initiative.  It is an opportunity and the funding exists to scale up the programme.  I ask each of my colleagues here to engage with local businesses on this.<br\/><br\/>As committed to in the programme for Government, I am establishing a mobile phone and broadband task force to identify and recommend solutions to the broadband and mobile phone coverage deficit.  The group will meet for the first time this month and will report to me by the end of the year on the actions we are taking.<br\/><br\/>Let me turn to climate change, the global challenge of our generation, which requires radical and ambitious thinking to implement the fundamental changes to achieve our national, EU and global objectives in this area.<br\/><br\/>The EU has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050.  The first milestone towards achieving a low-carbon economy by 2050 is the delivery of the 2020 targets set by the EU and the corresponding national targets.  Ireland has a requirement to achieve a binding target of 16% of energy demand coming from renewable sources.  We are making steady progress.  At the end of 2015, just over 9% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy came from renewables, including around 25% of electricity generation.<br\/><br\/>The period between 2020 and 2030 is the next critical phase in the evolution of EU climate and energy policies.  In advance of the Paris agreement of December 2015, the European Union set out an ambitious 2030 climate and energy framework involving a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 40%, an increase in EU energy from renewable sources to 27%, and an indicative target of 27% for energy efficiency.<br\/><br\/>Domestically, following the enactment of the Climate Action Development Act 2015, Ireland is now focusing on implementation, including preparing a national climate mitigation plan, targeting publication for consultation by the end of this year, and also developing the first statutory national adaptation framework, a draft of which is to be published early next year.  We have committed in the programme for Government to establish a national dialogue on climate change that will address the key infrastructural, land use and economic issues to be considered in our long-term transition to a low-carbon future.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that Ireland's long-term interests are best supported by further decreasing our dependence on imported fossil fuels through increasing energy efficiency across our economy.  On the energy efficiency side, we will continue to invest in the better energy programme, which has already provided grants to some 170,000 households.  Some &euro;54 million will be spent on the better energy programme in 2016, which will facilitate the upgrading of a further 21,000 households.<br\/><br\/>My Department will support the transition from peat power plants by using greater amounts of biomass, and it will work with industry and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to develop sustainable indigenous supply chains.  New support schemes will be developed to support renewable heat incentives and a range of technologies, including solar technology, in the renewable electricity sector.  Newer technologies, such as wave and tidal energy technology, will have an important role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s future renewable energy mix and we will support these through the research and development stages.  We are supporting research and demonstration projects in this area, with a total of &euro;17 million committed from my Department's Vote to ocean energy research in the period 2013 to 2016.<br\/><br\/>By November, the new Department responsible for housing, planning and local government, working with my Department, will bring to the Government revised wind energy planning guidelines to address issues of noise and shadow flicker and provide a structure for minimum setback distances.  The issues of community engagement, participation and benefit will also be addressed.  We have to achieve the right balance by ensuring the interests of local communities are heard and addressed and that the necessary regulatory and investment certainty exists to ensure ongoing investment in renewable energy.<br\/><br\/>A properly funded, independent public service broadcasting service is essential to the functioning of our democracy and society.  My Department is responsible for the development of the legislative and regulatory framework for broadcasting and certain media in Ireland, including funding for the public service broadcasters, RTE and TG4.  The Department oversees the collection of the TV licence fee by An Post and payments to RTE, BAI and TG4.  The sector has been facing a very challenging funding environment over the past few years owing to a large fall in commercial advertising revenues arising from the increase in competition in the sector and the impact of advertising budgets being spent in different media platforms.<br\/><br\/>In the absence of a public sector broadcasting charge, I have asked my Department to consider what options are available to ensure a sustainable funding stream for public service broadcasting and to address the high levels of TV licence evasion.  I expect to bring proposals to the Government in this regard later in the year.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The Eircode system was launched in July 2015 to provide a unique postcode to every premises in Ireland.  Approximately 35% of addresses are non-unique in this country and it is important that we develop a system that could make it easier to find and locate addresses, particularly in rural areas.  As Senator Leyden will know, townlands like Milltown are quite common in our county, County Roscommon.  It is the same across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#P00200","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>There is a Milltown in Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#R00100","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>There is one in Galway too.  The Department is facilitating the encoding of large public sector customer databases in encouraging the use of Eircode.  Since the launch of Eircode approximately 12 months ago, more than 3 million items of correspondence have issued from public sector bodies that included the use of Eircodes.  A significant number of commercial bodies have incorporated Eircode into their online services and this is growing all the time.  Eircode is currently in the process of being incorporated into navigation systems and, as Members know, has already been incorporated into the national ambulance service deployment system.  I see significant value in this project which will take time to become fully embedded in our society and as part of our national infrastructure.<\/p> <p>The natural resources area encompasses mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and extraction, the Geological Survey of Ireland and Inland Fisheries.  The sector employs 30,000 people and contributes 3% of our GNP in combined value in excess of &euro;4 billion.  In recent years, the Department has taken a number of regulatory and technical initiatives to attract a higher share of mobile international exploration investment to Ireland.  The culmination of this has been the success of the Atlantic margin licensing round in 2015, which resulted in a total of 43 applications for licensing options.  Some 28 new licensing options have been awarded as part of this process following the assessment by my Department.<\/p> <p>On the mining side, Ireland is a significant source of zinc and lead with one of Europe's largest zinc mines in Navan.  We are consolidating the legislation in this area and the new Minerals Development Bill 2015 was considered earlier this year by the Seanad.  <\/p> <p>The Department, working with Inland Fisheries Ireland, is also responsible for conservation management and regulation of the inland fishery resource and arbitrating between competing interests for limited and finite stocks which, in many instances, are either at or below conservation limits.  The Geological Survey of Ireland supports the geoscience sector by providing data and objective geological advice and information crucial to the sustainable economic development of our natural resources.  It also manages major data acquisition initiatives, such as INFOMAR, the seabed mapping programme jointly with the Marine Institute based in Galway, and the Tellus project.  INFOMAR which has completed the mapping of Ireland's deeper waters is now assisting in the updating of charts for marine safety and providing baseline data for ocean energy, environment protection, fisheries and research.<\/p> <p>The Tellus project is an initiative to carry out state of the art mapping using airborne remote sensing and ground based sampling.  That is in Connemara, County Galway, at the moment and will then move to east Galway.  The objective there is to complete a baseline of all island environmental and geological datasets.  Both of these projects are funded by my Department.  Each of them has attracted approximately &euro;3 million in funding per annum in the past number of years.<\/p> <p>I hope I have given Members a good overview of the broad range of activities in my Department and what we are responsible for overseeing at present.  Hopefully, later this month, we will take over the environmental portfolio from the Minister for housing, planning and local government, Deputy Coveney.  There are many other programmes across the individual sectors but time does not allow me to go through them.  However, I am happy to answer any questions that Members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#R00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#R00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, back.  It is 19 years since he was a Member of this House.  I was a Member of the other House and then I came here, so it was the other way around.  The Minister has an enormous portfolio; it is mind-boggling.  I must mark him in the Seanad but I did not realise I would also be dealing with refuse collection.  I understand the Minister is being given that portfolio on top of everything else.  It is not a great gift to receive.  It is controversial and will be more controversial in the future.<\/p> <p>Does the Minister for regional development, rural affairs, arts and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, have any input into broadband or is it the responsibility of the Minister for communications, climate change and natural resources?  The Minister gave a general outline on broadband and it is welcome he is grasping this nettle and trying to do something constructive.  There has been much talk about this issue over the years but very little action.  The Minister has made a commitment to roll out broadband to 900,000 premises by 2022 and it will then revert to private ownership.  Fianna F&aacute;il is concerned about this - the Minister expressed his own concerns - because the privatisation of Eircom was not a good experience.  However, it raised money for the State at that time, whether we like it or not.<\/p> <p>During my time as a Minister in the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs, we invested a significant amount in the provision of telecommunications services and then we privatised it.  The company was subsequently sold on a number of times.  All the assets of the company were sold, including all the newly built facilities - for example, building to house the control of the system.  One such building was built in Castlerea, County Roscommon, but all these buildings were sold off at low prices.  Now the work of Eir is serviced from vans.  There are very few places where people are based in a building where one can go to talk about one's telephone service.  That was a bad experience.<\/p> <p>What State body would be in a position to take on the roll out of the broadband service?  Would the ESB have the capacity to take on this role?  The Minister referred to the fact that the roll out of broadband is equal to rural electrification.  The ESB provided a public service.  I am in favour of a public rather than a private service.  The ESB is an example of what this State provided back in the 1920s with the construction of Ardnacrusha and rural electrification.  That was a State owned and a State controlled service.  Without that, we would not have the service we have today.  The same applies to the investment in Bord na M&oacute;na, which developing new opportunities.  Again, it is an example of State investment.  Let me give credit to the former Minister, Pat Rabbitte, who prevented the sale of Coillte.  I think the Minister was opposed to that also.  Is that part of Minister's portfolio?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#R00400","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Coillte comes under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

To my knowledge, he prevented the sale of Coillte.  That is very important.  State and semi-State companies provide a very good service to the State.<\/p> <p>The Minister has a very complex portfolio, so I will limit my contribution to a number of general points.  I refer to the roll out of broadband.  When I was a Minister in the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs, it was very difficult to provide certain rural areas with a telephone service.  I considered whether the existing poles could be used to carry insulated wiring and so on.  The Minister has access to expert advice, what role, if any, has it in this regard?<\/p> <p>Some years ago, there was an attempt to roll out broadband by using the infrastructure of CIE.  There was a proposal to bring the wires along the railway tracks and that option was researched.  To bring it to our area, I recall the installation of a very expensive circuit in Roscommon town to bring broadband to the town.  Who owns that?  The Minister has indicated his Department owns that, which is good.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Terry Leyden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is the Minister's Department.<\/p><p>We are provided with an excellent service here by the Oireachtas with regard to our offices in our own constituencies, counties or whatever it is.  However, it did not use a roll-out.  It used Eircom, or Eir, to bring that about through the copper wire system.  The Minister has an office on Abbey Street and I have an office on Goff Street.  It should have been provided through the system that was provided by the State.  It is very difficult.  The Minister probably has the answers there.  I believe the Minister has the capacity to get this done one way or another.<\/p><p>I can see the Minister's point on the capital costs of this whole situation, the cost of running it and getting it done.  Particularly now, with the position of Brexit and the British exit of the EU looking like a reality, never before has the roll-out of broadband been so urgent.  It is absolutely vital that we have fast broadband to get in touch with the other 27 member states to sell our produce at home and abroad.  Never before has it been more vital that the island of Ireland and all of its rural areas is connected to the world.  It is absolutely essential.  That is why it is the most essential of all of the Minister's responsibilities.  Each one of his portfolios is vital to the interests of the State, including climate change and the whole question of renewable energy.  We will park the question of broadband.  The Minister has outlined his decision and the Government's decision, which he received yesterday.  I certainly would not impede his work in any way in that regard.  Let us get on with it, get it started and get it done one way or another.  There have been too many false dawns.<\/p><p>I outlined the programme regarding the CIE investment.  We then found that it was undermining some of the lines.  There was an inquiry carried out.  That inquiry was terminated at one stage, as I recall, and there were many repercussions in that regard.  As far as I know, the ESB got involved in this area.  The strange thing about it was that An Post was involved back in the 1980s and it sold off a wing.  It had an involvement with the Internet but it decided to terminate that type of investment at the time.  That was a very poor decision.  To my mind, Eircom, which would have been ideal had it been in existence, would have rolled out broadband ten years ago if it had been under public ownership.  However, we have to go from here.  We are where we are at the moment.<\/p><p>On the issue of climate change, the Minister made the point that he will be taking over responsibility for investment.  I do not think he will be taking over responsibility for the environmental proposals around the distance between solar-powered or earth energy generators and residences.  The Minister has received a communication from our friend in Sliabh B&aacute;n, Mr. Mike de Jong.  He has outlined his concerns, as he has done in the past.  It is a local issue.<\/p><p>There was a recent flash flood in Curraghroe in County Roscommon.  The Minister has looked at that situation and he may be in a position to say whether it is in any way linked to the erection of the wind energy pylons in Sliabh B&aacute;n.  I believe the Minister would have reservations, as I have, about those wind turbines being erected very close to houses at Sliabh B&aacute;n, which is a beautiful tourist area.  That project is under way at the moment.  In fairness, I do not think the Minister is in a position to change that.  However, the issues raised should be investigated to see if there is any link between the work that is under way and the flooding of that particular area.  That is a point made by Mr. de Jong, who has been advocating on this issue for a long time and is very concerned.  There are also concerns in Dysart.<\/p><p>There is another point in this regard which the Minister may be able to answer.  I know that the Minister has to have-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#R00600","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>The Senator is over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#S00200","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>That is the point.

Even on the road from Athlone to Dublin, there are areas which have very little housing on them.  I ask the Minister to look at that area.  I know he has to have power.<\/p> <p>The other point is about post offices.  Can the Minister get the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to prevent his Department from demanding that money goes directly into banks?  This is a very small point.  The present An Post system of saving should be used to allow people to go into the post office and have their account.  If they wish to transfer their money to that post office, it should be allowed.

As other Senators have said, the Minister has a unique portfolio which takes into consideration energy, communications, natural resources, broadcasting, inland fisheries and, in another few weeks, the environment.  In fairness to the Minister, he has a very large portfolio and there is no better man to take care of it.<\/p> <p>Over recent years, there have been major changes in the energy market.  The Brexit vote could have an impact on where those changes happen.  At the moment, we have a single electricity market between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  A Bill is to come before the House at the end of the month which will tie into a European target model.  There will be issues which we will need to examine.  The Minister and his Department will probably have issues regarding where the European target and model will work regarding Brexit.  We have two interconnectors between here and the UK, but no major interconnector between here and mainland Europe.  Where does the European policy fit in, if we are on the leg of Europe?  That is one of the key issues.  As an energy consumer and as a nation, we need access to the mainland European market if we are to be competitive.  How can we do it?  One of the key issues is the competitive nature of it.  The targeted model will give us a more competitive nature if we can tap into it.  However, we lack an interconnector with France.  The Minister, with the forthcoming energy Bill, which will firm up our connection with Northern Ireland, will hopefully consider the other long-term issues regarding how we can connect with mainland Europe.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister's statement yesterday regarding taking the broadband plan to Cabinet.  The Minister has taken the right approach.  He has been proactive.  At the end of the day, it is about delivering on the ground.  People want and need broadband and do not care what the technicalities are.  In rural Ireland, in places such as Minane Bridge, where I live, or in rural areas like Goleen - I often quote former Deputy Paddy Sheehan, who will jump up and down and tell me not to quote him again - people are crying out for good broadband.  This will give people hope.  It is about delivery.  In a few months' time we will know when delivery will happen on the ground.  That is positive.  It is what people want.  They want people to make decisions and not just produce reports.  I welcome the Minister's statement on broadband.<\/p> <p>Amazingly, when one talks about broadband, people always raise the mobile phone coverage and say that, while broadband is one issue, their phones do not work.  It is a core issue in rural Ireland.  It even affects part of the motorway.  If one travels from Cork to Dublin on the motorway, how many times does one drop a call?  It is significant.  It is not what it is all about.  We must at least ensure that people can take calls all along our main thoroughfares.  Unfortunately, we do not have that at the moment.<\/p> <p>While every household can consider energy efficiency, maybe we should examine internally what we can do as a State.  In my own neck of the woods, through working on the energy efficiency issue and the national energy efficiency action plan, last month Cork County Council became the first local authority to receive the ISO 5001 accreditation and has set the standard as a local authority.  I compliment the manager, mayor and others in the local authority on delivering it.  We must ensure that other local authorities drive on.  The standard has now been set and it is up to the Department to ensure that every local authority reduces its energy usage.  They must return to 2009 levels, which realistically requires them to cut energy use by one third.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are significant challenges in trying to deliver on issues like that.<\/p><p>One of the other issues proposed in Cork in recent years was the \"drive for zero\" programme, trying to encourage people to use electric cars.  That worked with the businesses and the providers, and it also worked with the local authorities, which provided free car-parking spaces and additional charging spaces.  The Minister needs to get all the stakeholders around the table to drive the issue.  While there has been extensive talk about electric cars, it needs a stimulus and someone to tie all the stakeholders together to deliver it.  In many ways the \"drive for zero\" programme is something that could be introduced throughout the country.  If we were to provide free car-parking spaces in town centres for electric cars, more people would consider it a logical form of transportation.  We need to get everyone thinking on the same page in order to deliver it.<\/p><p>Obviously, one of the key issues for the State will be our oil refinery.  Whitegate is a key part of that.  We need to establish the status of Phillips 66 and the proposed change of ownership.  It is an issue for the entire island; we need to have an oil refinery.  We need to ensure this oil refinery will stay operational in the coming years.  I do not believe it should be in public ownership, but we should ensure that the new owners will develop the refinery so that it can go to from strength to strength.<\/p><p>The Minister is in charge of very many issues.  I believe he will use his 20 years of experience in public life to great benefit because he will need to tie all these entities in the State together to deliver.  That will be a major challenge in many ways.  I wish him the best.  I believe he is the appropriate man for the job.  As he said, it is about tying everyone in together and delivering on the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#S00600","speaker":"1386","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Naughten.  This is my first opportunity on the floor of the House to welcome his appointment.  Not only does he deserve this appointment, but I believe he will be very good in it.  I do not wish to butter him up too much in advance of one or two nagging points, having known him for a long time.  I believe he brings a certain skillset that will be a great asset to us at this time.  He is a very independently minded person and a man with attention to detail.  He is not afraid to think fresh thoughts and to launch ideas.<\/p><p>It was often said in previous incarnations of the Seanad that relatively few Ministers came in here with a genuine intention of being in dialogue with Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; or indeed in the other House.  The newly-elected Senator McDowell and perhaps the late Brian Lenihan were among those who got deserved praise for their willingness to take ideas on the hop, engage with them and run with them if they were convincing.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Naughten, will be a Minister in that tradition; he certainly has the capacity to do so.  I wish him the very best.<\/p><p>In encouraging him not to be afraid to think fresh thoughts, I point out that the Minister takes office in a very difficult and interesting time in Irish politics not just because of what is happening in this country, but also what is happening elsewhere, obviously in the context of Brexit in particular.  The Minister has many important things on his plate.  He spoke about broadband and developing greater indigenous supply of sustainable energy and those are two very important issues.  The progress he makes on those issues in whatever time he is given as Minister will be career defining for him as a Minister.<\/p><p>I am going to nag the Minister on two points, starting with one that may appear insignificant.  Given that he is Minister with responsibility for communications and as a procedural matter to assist us in this House, I encourage him to be one of those who restores the tradition of bringing in copies of his speech to assist Members in following what he has to say.  I have noticed lately that it is not happening as much.  I am all in favour of saving the planet and cutting down on unnecessary printing.  However, we do not just come in here to make our own statements.  We actually come in here to listen to what Ministers have to say.  The art of speech making is a rather outdated art.  None of us has the concentration that we would like to have and I often find myself saying, &quot;What did he say?&quot; or &quot;Did he just say that?&quot; and wanting to check back before making my intervention.  That would be helpful and he might pass the word back through Government.  It is a small thing, but it is helpful to legislators.<\/p><p>I want to deal with broadcasting in particular.  I recently gave the Minister mild criticism in the context of general praise in an interview I gave to the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, because of what he said about there not being, in his opinion, a significant left wing or liberal bias in the media or broadcasting.  The Minister comes from a constituency that is filled with people who think very differently.  I do not deny him the right to think his own thoughts or form his conclusions.  However, there is a problem when politicians talk about the media.  We often give out about the media when they criticise us or the things we believe in.  Because the media must hold politicians to account, journalists can be unpopular with politicians.  Very often politicians make rather ill-considered criticisms of the media in a generalised way.  I acknowledge that.<\/p><p>However, as the old saying goes, &quot;Just because you're paranoid, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they're not out to get you.&quot;  A person in the Minister's position must look at how Irish political culture has evolved and the issues that are neuralgic in today's society.  We need to look in an honest and fresh way at the role the media play, not just in terms of how politicians are seen, but how politics itself is seen.  We should consider it in the context of what has happened in Britain, where it is now fashionable to decry what experts say in order to make more emotive types of points.<\/p><p>Regardless of one's view on the issue, who could deny that the media were a significant player in how the debate on last year's referendum was organised?  I have no doubt that many people made up their own minds in the end, but who could deny that there were not significant percentage points flowing to one side of the issue from the way media people in their droves handled that particular important social issue?  Who could deny that that is not also the case on the much more important and neuralgic social issue of abortion?  There are people in RTE who will privately admit that they are amazed at the groupthink among their colleagues on that issue.<\/p><p>For example, a study of media treatment of some of these social issues will find that when it comes to the so-called liberal position, we frequently have sycophantic facilitating questions focusing on a particular dimension of the issue.  When it comes to the more, let us call it, conservative perspective, we have people being grilled.  It is not an issue that can be dismissed lightly by saying there is no significant bias in the media.<\/p><p>We need a long hard look at how public service broadcasting operates here.  No vested interest should be above scrutiny.  For example, RTE is sitting on a massively valuable land bank while at the same time telling us it is strapped for money.  It is seeking a protected television licence fee while at the same time it derives significant revenues from advertising although, as the Minister rightly says, it is a crowded market in terms of potential suppliers of advertising.  We must not be afraid to question powerful vested interests in our society and that starts with the media, probably the most unquestioned institutional power we have today.  It is diverse, but only to a degree.  While it may seem like a mad thing in which to start a discussion, should RTE necessarily sit on a highly valuable land bank if one way of saving revenue would be its eventual relocation?<\/p><p>That might also address the often-described - sometimes exaggerated and sometimes understated - disparity or disconnect between urban and rural in our society.  I come from a parish, which the Minister knows well given that he has family connections there, where RTE nearly destroyed the life and career of a man.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There was reason to believe at the time, and it was widely stated, that perhaps the culture of prejudice towards faith, faith communities and clergy, contributed to the way that problem unfolded.  Whether that is true there were promises at the time of new standards in regard to fairness and balance.<\/p><p>I would say that it remains the case that significant institutional bias exists in broadcast media in particular.  The one I most concerned about is publicly funded media where people without any sense of contradiction can speak on the one hand about human rights and equality and at the same time treat in an utterly partisan fashion important social issues such as abortion.  I ask the Minister not just to take my word for it.  Can we have a working group to survey questions around fairness and balance in the media and ask journalists whether they think there are significant areas where bias is impacting on the quality of public debate and to look bravely but with a curious eye and intellectual honesty at the question of whether sanctions could be a part of the remedy.  If a journalist or a presenter working for a public service broadcaster has a contract worth hundreds of thousands of euro which is indirectly tax funded and if he regards it as a perk of the job that he can take a sycophantic approach to somebody who shares his point of view, for example, in favour of abortion and engage in persistent and selective and tendentious and hostile questioning on those who oppose his view, can that person be sanctioned or challenged in any way?  If a finding is made against him once or twice or three times by the broadcasting authority, can anything be done?  Does he have to read out the apology himself?  Does he have to express any personal regret about his conduct which is wasting taxpayers' money and abusing the public?  Can we have a body that has genuine teeth so that when people make a complaint they do not feel that they are pissing against the wind, excuse the language?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#T00200","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The Senator is well over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#U00200","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I am about to conclude.

He has one of the most interesting and varied portfolios and deals with many of the critical issues of our time.  I wish him well and I have no doubt he is up for the job.  I am aware that consideration was given to adding another aspect to his portfolio.  I know that whatever is put before him he will deal with it well.<\/p> <p>I mentioned the national broadband plan yesterday.  I compliment the Minister who has hit the ground running.  I am pleased that he brought a paper to Cabinet and that we will see some progress on that plan which is critical for rural Ireland.  I am aware that 85% of the country will need assistance to get high speed broadband.  Given that the Minister mentioned the cost to the State if it was to provide it without engaging with the private sector, how can he ensure that once a grant is given to a private company, it will deliver the broadband to the rural areas which are not commercially viable?  Is there a service level agreement to begin with or how will it be described in the terms of reference of the tender process?  <\/p> <p>I support Senator Tim Lombard in respect of his comments on the mobile telephone service.  It is a terrible.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten the House on the issue of individuals being compensated for dropped calls.  I do not know how widespread the problem is.  There is also another issue where one is driving along for a minute or two and one cannot hear somebody and one's natural inclination is to extinguish that call and try to make another one with the result that people are paying again and again for telephone calls.  As was explained to me by a person involved in the area of foreign direct investment at a time when we are trying to encourage people to locate in  the country outside the large urban centres, when an American or somebody else drives down the road and picks up their mobile telephone and cannot get through he or she will ask if this is a modern country of the European Union in which to invest.  We are really up against it not just to get foreign direct investment but for ourselves.  Perhaps the Minister would take up the issue with the telecommunications company concerned because it is being given licences and it owes to people to give them a service other than the type of service that most of us in rural Ireland experience, which is totally below standard.<\/p> <p>I turn to the issue of climate change and the environment.  This is one of the most critical conversations of our time and how we proceed will leave a mark for generations to come.  The Paris agreement of December 2015 brought back into sharp focus the issue of targets and trying to bring on board as many nations as possible.  Ireland alone or no country on its own will bring about the required change and reduction in carbon emissions that are causing global warming.  There are particular challenges for developing countries.  They look at the West, at developed countries and see that we have prospered on the back of fossil fuels.  They ask why they cannot have that action and why they have to take on board, for example, renewable energy technologies, which are more expensive.  We need to have a real conversation on what is the common good.  Too often, the pendulum has gone in the other direction.  It is all about the individual and not the common good.  I would argue that what has made this country and many nations great is a conversation about the common good and what steps we need to take, being responsible citizens, towards reducing carbon emissions and embracing renewable technologies and renewable energy.  That requires us to think outside the box.  <\/p> <p>Mr. Alvin Toffler an American writer and futurist who died in June said the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn.  We live linear lifestyles where we consume, and up until the last few decades we have had very little regard for the end result, how we discard our waste and what we take from the ground.  As Mr. Alvin Toffler said, nobody is pumping oil or gas back into the ground.  We know there are supplies that probably will see our generation and the next generation through but there is a big price to be paid for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#U00400","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>The Senator's time has come to an end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#U00500","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>There are two points I wish to make.

We do not want people in energy poverty.  The carbon tax levied on coal affects the poorest households who may have no choice but to buy coal.<\/p> <p>The other issue is community engagement.  There are too many contradictions.  At times Government targets are criticised.  People ask why they are not being achieved and why the Government is not implementing them at a time when there is resistance on the ground.  There has to be proper engagement on the issue and a dialogue on how we go forward together, a dialogue about the common good.

We have much in common.<\/p><p>One issue that has not gone away, however, in spite of the arrival of new politics is that of post offices, and I am glad the Minister has that role.  At the start of the year the Minister's belief in the post office network and how it must be protected was to the fore, so today I want reassurance that his Department is working with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that no more letters are sent to social welfare recipients who currently collect payments at post offices asking for their bank details.  We should be seeking to extend the services that rural post offices offer, not to reduce them by pressurising people to switch to big financial institutions.  I know the Minister will agree with that.  Recognising the challenges facing post office networks, we need to modernise and transform the role of the post office so that it becomes a hub for accessing public services and social protections within the community.<\/p><p>The post office network is an integral part of the social make-up of Ireland.  It should therefore be protected and given the resources that it needs.  As well as ensuring social protection payments continue to be processed through the post office, other sources of revenue, such as Government payments and banking, could be identified for the post office network.  Furthermore, more and more services are moving online and being offered through e-Government, which certainly produces efficiencies but is serving to marginalise a whole cohort of people living in rural areas, particularly elderly people and people who do not have broadband.  These people are being excluded and deprived of many essential Government services, and the post offices could play a key role here.  It is often very difficult to speak to a human being on the end of a line.  It can become very confusing for older people when they are trying to access a service and they are put from A to B to C to D.  If those services could be offered through post offices, where somebody could go in and speak to a human being, that would be a major advancement for rural Ireland.  Will the Minister therefore consider the extension of services that can be delivered at post offices and for local communities and examine the role that they need to play in addressing inequality of access to essential services?<\/p><p>The issue of broadband, which has been spoken about, is a very important one to rural Ireland, especially in my county of Mayo.  The obvious impact upon businesses and homes of having access to fast communication is important.  Just as tangible, though, is a feeling among people that this issue is not being taken seriously by the Government.  People in the west especially feel that various services have been rolled out in a way that suggests that these people do not matter, which they find hard to believe.  Broadband is essential not only for business, but also for many projects which can extend essential services to isolated rural areas.  One example of this is the Scottish community hospital health model, which I spoke about here a few weeks ago, which relies on broadband to deliver certain services through equipment that is linked up to hubs through high-speed connections.  Again, this is vital for addressing access to health services within communities.  For instance, we have a super X-ray machine in Belmullet Hospital but it cannot be used, and we could be using it.  It has been funded by the diaspora and members of the community.  We could use it if we had broadband and proper high-speed connections to do that.  The national rural development programme and the Leader programme are coming on board as well, which will create opportunities for job creation and enterprise, but that cannot be done without the necessary broadband speeds either.<\/p><p>I am also very concerned about the plan to privatise the broadband network in the long run.  At the start of the year the Minister, Deputy Naughten, was himself opposed to the privatisation plan.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in would go back even further to argue against the privatisation of Eircom, and the Minister knows the folly of that.  Sometimes I question do we really learn from such matters.  Telecommunications and the network was mentioned.  Mobile telephone coverage is appalling.  The Minister referred to having a report and an examination of the areas of poor coverage.  There is no need to do that.  In his role he should be forcing the telecommunications companies to address the problems where they know exactly where they are, what they are and what is causing them in many instances, like masts falling down and being left unattended and so on.  There are things that need to be done and actions that need to be taken.<\/p><p>I note the admission of Fianna F&aacute;il's Deputy Timmy Dooley that privatisation was wrong and that we are still experiencing the consequences of it, so there is broad consensus on that aspect.  I question the Minister's actions on broadband and the cost-benefit analysis that was done.  Variables are being used to come up with a specific result in doing the cost-benefit analysis.  I am very concerned about the power of the auditors, the likes of KPMG, PwC, Ernst &amp;amp; Young and many more organisations.  They seem to have control over the decision-making of this Government.  I question that decision-making because we have evidence that they played a key role in the banking crisis and the whole collapse of the economy, not only in Ireland but also in the rest of Europe and worldwide.  For them now to be making decisions about broadband and rural Ireland does not sit right with me.<\/p><p>I also ask the Minister if fibre, rather than copper, lines will be guaranteed to people's homes as part of the plan because many people who live off roads are concerned that the fibre cable will only go as far as the main road and the existing copper wire, which leads from the road to the house, will result in slower download speeds.  Furthermore, the threshold of 30 Mbps as the initial standard is too low.  We should be future-proofing this.  This is not even about future-proofing; it is what is required now to download maps and various other graphics that are needed in the day-to-day running of a small business.  Take, for instance, even an agricultural advisor or consultant who would need to download maps and other things.  He would need more than 30 Mbps, so-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#U00800","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>The Senator's time has concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#V00200","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I will finish on the Corrib gas project.

The national broadband roll-out is very much to be welcomed, but I want to make a number of points.  There has been much discussion comparing it with Eircom when Eircom was privatised.  Eircom was a national network entirely owned by Eircom.  Much of the current network is in private ownership as it is, so it is not as if there are not already some areas of the country covered by fibre broadband and by private providers who have built up the network.  That is a distinction that needs to be made.  Notwithstanding that, the devil is in the detail, as the Minister well knows, so I want to pose a number of questions about what was announced yesterday.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The network will effectively be in State ownership for the first 25 years.  What control mechanisms will be put in place to ensure there can be no abuse of service users in the price they will pay during that period and that, beyond the period of 25 years, agreements will be in place to ensure people will have certainty and trust in the system?<\/p><p>Only 35% of Irish premises have access to broadband speeds greater than 10 MBps.  Some 69% of Irish homes have access to broadband speeds of only 4 MBps.  The Minister is providing for a figure of 30 MBps.  In a couple of years time we may find that this is insufficient.  What provisions will be built into the contracts awarded to ensure they are future-proofed and that in two or three years time, if there is a need for speeds of 100 MBps, they will be provided for?  The last thing we want is for the State to invest in something that will be obsolete in a short period.<\/p><p>I have looked to see whether the Minister has announced who the selected potential bidders are.  Are they existing providers in Ireland?  At what level is their network?  As we want to avoid a monopoly, how many contractors will be appointed?  These are extremely important issues to ensure people will have security and trust in the system.  In east Limerick broadband speeds vary.  While the service is quite good in much of the city and surrounding areas, it is very patchy in rural east Limerick.  We are looking to develop the area with the rejuvenation of towns and villages, including Murroe, Abington, Cappamore, Caherconlish and Castleconnell.  What is the roll-out target to be achieved in these areas?  What can the Minister indicate to the people of rural east Limerick about the timeframe for the roll-out, the broadband speeds to which they will have access, how the issue will be prioritised and the timeframe in contractors being appointed?  We want to encourage SMEs to set up in the towns and villages of rural east Limerick and cannot expect them to do so without proper broadband.  They may see broadband provision as a promise which will happen in a few years time, with no certainty as to when it will be installed, speeds, capacity, price and future-proofing, which would reassure those who set up a business that broadband speeds and capacity could be increased over time, as required.<\/p><p>I am a frequent user of Irish Rail services and broadband coverage on the main line between Limerick and Dublin is, to say the least, dire and patchy.  It is also extremely poor.  If the train is relatively empty, the service will be reasonably okay, whereas if the train is full, it is dire.  If we want to promote the use of public transport, it is not good enough in a modern society for the phone line to die during an important call and one can nearly guess where it will die.  It is not good enough for broadband to die and one to lose a file or whatever else.  I welcome the establishment of the mobile task force to examine the issue and wish the Minister well.  For me, it is about delivery on the ground in east Limerick in order that we can tell people that if they want to establish a business in any part of east Limerick, broadband capacity is strong enough.  It must happen with immediate effect.  I wish to know about timescales, price, capacity and security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#V00700","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, for coming to the Chamber.

I say this because action has been missing consistently from our response to climate change.  After more than nine years of painful birthing of climate legislation, the climate response architecture will not be fully active for another couple of years.  Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has told us that we have already exceeded our EU emissions targets for 2020.  We have reached the endgame.  Without serious corrective measures, we will be fined.  An EU analysis suggests Ireland will not meet its renewable electricity, heat and transport sectoral targets either and we face significant fines from 2020.  We, therefore, need a plan for the future.  We need to invest now in good initiatives that will save energy and encourage the use of renewables rather than waste money on fines after 2020.<\/p> <p>Last December we had the monumental Paris climate deal.  It was a real, solid achievement for the betterment of the world in these times of great uncertainty.  The Taoiseach told us here at home that we would be at the forefront in responding to the climate emergency.  However, when he got to Paris, he made us a laughing stock in pleading for special treatment for Ireland, while to some degree representatives of Bangladesh, sub-Saharan African countries and Pacific island nations looked on with raised eyebrows.  This deeply cynical behaviour was entirely consistent with his approach to climate change.  With his Ministers in the previous Government, he made the same plea when agreeing to the EU 2030 range of targets.  If Ireland is to live up to the spirit and the letter of the Paris agreement, we need a fundamentally different approach.  We need a firm statement from the Government that it is not only possible to fully decarbonise the economy by 2050 but that this is a core objective and commitment that runs across all areas of policy.  That is something I hope to hear from the Minister today and I am prepared to work with him on it.<\/p> <p>We need to look towards reforming the public service obligation, PSO, levy; phase out the subsidy for peat and gas burning and work towards a new PSO model to commence by 2020.  We need to talk about divestment from fossil fuels, green procurement and ensuring wind energy sources are developed in a responsible way that will include input from local communities.  Again, we run the risk of running into enormous problems in the development of solar energy projects.  Although the number of applications to develop such projects and connect them to the national grid has ballooned by more than 150% per annum during the past two years, there are no planning guidelines to deal with the influx.  We are just repeating the same ignorant mistakes.<\/p> <p>I am very ambitious for this beautiful country of ours.  We are well placed to lead the world in responding to the climate challenge in a way that will bring new investment, create permanent indigenous industry and jobs and improve the quality of life of citizens.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Yet, because of bad planning, caving in to narrow sectoral interests and the dominance of profit over good policy, we move ever further away from realising these goals and make it that much harder to steer the State towards a sustainable and profitable future for its citizens.<\/p><p>The Minister was being interrupted when I made the point, but I hope he will be the climate action man for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#W00200","speaker":"1385","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his new post.  I speak today to represent the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, which was my nominating body.  The IBI represents the two national, four regional, one multi-city and 27 local commercial radio stations throughout Ireland.  The mission of the IBI is to promote a strong and vibrant radio sector which reflects the preferences and needs of the listening public.<\/p> <p>Independent broadcasters make a significant contribution to the Irish economy and to the social and cultural life of the country.  Listenership to independent broadcasting in Ireland has never been stronger.  In excess of 70% of the Irish population, some 2.5 million people, tune in to independent radio on a daily basis, which clearly shows the value listeners place on independent programming.  Local independent radio connects many of our citizens with their local communities.  We should not underestimate the positive impact of this.  It is a vital service that we should support.  Independent radio provides a valuable public service to Irish radio listeners and is currently funded entirely from the sale of advertising and sponsorship.<\/p> <p>The IBI has been campaigning for a fair and equitable system of funding for public service broadcasting.  The introduction of the new public service broadcasting charge will result in additional revenue being collected for the purpose of funding public service broadcasting.  I ask the Minister to consider allocating a portion of this funding to the IBI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#X00200","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  His brief strongly combines both urgency and a long-term perspective, even beyond that of other Ministries.  That urgency and long-term perspective was addressed to the area of broadband.  Obviously, urgent action is needed and I commend that. However, I join others in expressing concern in terms of the long-term implications in regard to the issue of privatisation.  As someone who comes from the west, I want to know that future generations will also be able to live there and not be hostage to potential private service providers which may find smaller communities do not suit their interests at that time.<\/p> <p>The issue I want to address is the very urgent and long-term one relating to climate change.  It is urgent for the 19.8 million people in eastern Africa, from Somaliland to Ethiopia, who are facing the dangers of hunger and poverty, exacerbated by El Ni&ntilde;o and climate change, and for the many climate refugees who we see joining the stream of other refugees currently moving across the world at a time when more people have been displaced than ever before.<\/p> <p>Having represented Tr&oacute;caire in Poznan and Copenhagen at the climate change talks, I was very relieved and gratified to see Ireland among the 196 countries that signed the Paris agreement.  We need to step up the pace of response if we are to meet those targets.  It is unfortunate, for example, that the EPA has estimated we may overshoot our 2020 limits in just 18 months.  Again, I urge the Minister to play a very active role in engaging across all Departments to ensure we revise our policies in areas such as agriculture and food production in a way that is sustainable and which keeps us within our targets, not simply because of the fines we may face but also because Ireland cannot afford to be behind the curve in moving to a sustainable economy.  In that regard, the role of the Climate Change Advisory Council will be crucial, in particularly in the context of its independence.  The council will give guidance on the low carbon transition and mitigation plan.  In addition to the issues of transition and mitigation, we need to include the issue of adaptation, both here in Ireland in terms of flood defences, and for those countries that have done least to cause this issue but which are now facing devastating consequences.  I urge that this be a strong part of the Minister's considerations.<\/p> <p>I welcome the comments on the common good and climate justice.  Again, climate justice is a key frame in respect of recognising the responsibilities we share on this planet.  In the context of the long-term issues, I would like to highlight three areas where the Minister can make a difference.  The first is in the area of public procurement and ensuring we have strong environmental criteria and clauses within the process relating to such procurement.  Second, I ask that we would approach public-private partnerships with caution to ensure we maintain our regulatory role and that we do not create, as we did with toll roads, a hostage to fortune in terms of our future emissions targets.  Third, in terms of the TTIP and CETA negotiations, there is a crucial question to be asked by the Minister's Department of other Departments-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#X00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>The Senator should conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#X00400","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":181,"content":"<p>With regard to energy policy, I urge the Minister to challenge the question of fracking to ensure we maintain our position, and to have an open mind and to look again at the Corrib gas project and how we should approach that in a different way.

Will the Minister consider amending the National Treasury Management Agency Act during the upcoming review of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to ensure we are environmentally considerate in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#X00500","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and warmly congratulate him on his appointment.  He will bring huge personal energy, ability and commitment to the role, as he is already doing.  I am delighted to welcome him and to wish him well.<\/p> <p>I consider the availability of high-speed broadband to be a major issue.  At the time of the Celtic tiger, the bulk of representations received by my office related to planning.  Then, sadly, for the past few years, the bulk have been about social welfare.  Now, quite a percentage of the representations in my office are from people who cannot access broadband, which is indicative.  Despite some of the wrong stereotyping of local political work, it is important that these things are discovered through local political work, and this point about broadband is very much what I am discovering.<\/p> <p>High-speed broadband is crucial for students, many of whom now commute out of financial necessity and are going to colleges in Maynooth or in Dublin on coaches, and who need broadband in the evenings.  Small businesses need it and, as the Minister said, it is crucial to encourage online sales, which cannot develop without broadband.  The position is similar for farmers and the citizenry in general.  It is a necessity, which I believe the Minister has recognised.<\/p> <p>I personally support the Minister in his decision to use the gap funding model, although I know it goes back to private ownership after 25 or 26 years.  I take the Minister's crucial point that we would in that way free up perhaps &euro;1 billion for other expenditures, such as schools and so on, and that this will be off-balance sheet.  There is no avoiding the importance of that.  Delay would be unacceptable because people have a huge expectation around this.  I am very pleased the Minister has introduced 170,000 further premises into the equation.  My concern, which I am sure the Minister and others share, is that proper price controls will ensue when private ownership takes over fully.  One must assume that this will be the case.  While it will be our successors who police that, it needs to happen.<\/p> <p>I agree with some of the earlier contributions on the need to write into the agreements a real commitment to rural areas in regard to timing and speed, and I am sure the Minister and his officials will be very vigilant in this regard.  Of course, as the project unfolds and is brought on stream, more houses and small businesses will gain access to broadband.  It will be a rolling programme and progress will be made incrementally, although I want to ensure that is all copperfastened.  I am happy with the Minister's commitment to achieve 85% in two years, which would be good.  I can identify with Senator Kieran O'Donnell on the difficulties experienced by people in his area because the same difficulties apply in my area, as well as in Roscommon and other parts of the country.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We all have great expectations around the Minister's initiatives here.<\/p><p>To turn briefly to climate change, I am happy that we are signed up to the Paris agreement, which we have to be.  The evidence is all around us.  The Minister is a scientist by background and I do not propose to lecture him or anyone else in the House on the obvious case around this.  It is well accepted now and there are very few who dissent.  <\/p><p>To make a few practical points, I would like the Minister to provide for an analysis as to how far he could incentivise electric cars by way of lower taxes.  How much would be saved in the process in terms of the contribution to lowering carbon emissions?  It has been presented to me that there is considerable potential here and I would be happy to hear the Minister make a commitment in that regard.  While we meet and continue to have targets, I would like us to take on board the reasonable proposition the IFA makes which is that the trees farmers have planted since 1990 and the REPS work they have done should be considered part of our assessment for target purposes.  A great deal has been done there and there has been a great commitment.  Many farms have a few very poor unarable acres which could be incentivised for forestry use, which would have a cumulative effect.  There is potential there.  The Minister can relate to that from his own experience and knowledge of his constituency.  I note finally that there is no logic in replacing food production here, where it is fairly carbon free in terms of emissions, with food production where it would be much more expensive and carbon producing.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his indulgence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#X00600","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister.  I hope to be able to work with him on this subject, which I hold very close to my heart.  Previous speakers have said the Minister must take on this interest group, the IFA, and another interest group in regard to major articles in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>this week about forestry in Leitrim.  No matter which way we go on climate change and how we address it, it will not be possible to make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.  I recognise that this is difficult because there are interest groups which will have to be taken on and told that it will not be possible to go to certain places.  This is an important issue not only for Ireland but for our planet and if we do not address it, we will be in serious difficulty.  Our children and grandchildren will pay the price if we bow down to specific interest groups.<\/p><p>The Minister said the national low-carbon transition and migration plan will be published this year.  One of the reforms introduced by the last Government was pre-legislative scrutiny.  Along with that, came the Climate Change Advisory Council which was part of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Act.  That was based on the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  I suggest to the Minister that he looks at the council's advice at an early stage so that it is published at the same time as the draft plan.  That would allow us to weigh up expert advice against the draft plan, which would be very helpful.  It was brought to my attention by Tr&oacute;caire this week that this would facilitate a mature discussion and debate.<\/p><p>We are moving rapidly and technology is changing such that the householder will generate electricity and add it to the grid.  Mention has been made of interconnectors and connection to the mainland.  One of the things we have to look at now is our relationship to solar energy.  We could move very quickly down the same road we have run along in regard to wind turbines, which are wholly unacceptable to sections of society.  At the moment, major developers are travelling around Ireland, in particular to the south east, buying up rights.  That is going to generate anxiety in communities.  Agriculture-based communities will see jobs migrate in regard to solar energy.  As such, we need to be cautious and to move very quickly.  While we need to move in those directions, we need community support to do so.  The White Paper has been very helpful.  It was published by the previous Minister, Alex White, and it sets out an ambitious energy transition programme.  We have to take that on board.  It recommends very strongly that there be engagement with local communities, which is why I raise the issue of solar energy.  There are rumblings at the moment but that could turn into a roar as we have seen in regard to wind energy.  In many cases, wind energy has got a very bad name on foot of the lack of consultation and engagement with communities.  Ireland has just one community-owned wind farm, which is at Templederry in Tipperary.  We have to ask why we only have one community-owned project and what the barriers around that are.  It is a 4.6 MW facility consisting of two turbines.  On a cost-benefit analysis, the two turbines give a dividend to the community equivalent to that of 35 turbines.  If we are really serious about community engagement and improving community activity in places like that, we must ask what we need to change.  How can we assist that engagement and get community buy-in on renewable energy?<\/p><p>The Minister will come under very strong pressure at different stages in respect of our peat plants.  I say this to be helpful.  The same is true in regard to generation from gas and coal.  The plants provide a very important local employment element.  If we truly want to engage and move from that position, we must develop a plan on how to do it.  That plan must include the people who are currently in employment in the area.  How do we develop a local plan to move people who are currently employed in those areas to ensure that they have secure employment in their own local areas while reaching our targets?  Peat plants have to close.  The damage they are causing to our environment is far too great.  As a Dub, I recognise, however, that they are very important to their local communities.  We have to have a transition plan, not only in relation to reducing our carbon emissions but also for families and individuals which allows them to stay and work in their communities.  One of the ways we can get local community buy-in is to go out with our hands open, say we want that proper engagement and, while setting out the target, indicate that we also want to secure the local community and local employment.  We must work hand in hand with those communities.<\/p><p>There are a number of questions but I might not get through them all.  I might e-mail them to the Minister if I may.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#Y00200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":185,"content":"<p>By all means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#Y00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>The Senator has a minute remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#Y00400","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>We have an energy regulator but it is not viable for local communities to apply for a licence.

That is fine for a major developer travelling around the country and taking options on sites with a view to what is down the road.  There are road blocks there.  We must facilitate community engagement in local generation of energy which can also connect to the grid.  I suggest a minor change that would facilitate communities to generate their own electricity.  Developers cannot apply for a connection to the grid until they have planning permission because there is a gridlock, if the House will pardon the phrase, in respect of applications.  Many of those applications, however, are speculative.  They do not have planning permission and they are clogging up the system.  Where a genuine community group comes along with a proposal for a micro-generation plant on the local river, it cannot get a connection and just sees a backlog.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will forward a further six specific questions to the Minister, which I know he will respond to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#Y00500","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Farm Safety: Statements","time":1467797400,"counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#Z00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his appointment and wish him an equally long tenure.  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the issue of farm safety.  While my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, through his responsibility for the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, has primary responsibility for health and safety on farms, I am particularly supportive of the farm safety agenda and improving the safety record on farms.  I have seen at first hand the devastation that follows farm accidents and fatalities.  Their impact on families and communities is unquantifiable.  As Minister, it is my intention to be a vocal advocate for safety and vigilance to ensure our farms are the safest working environments possible.<\/p><p>Accordingly, I take this opportunity to highlight the second UK and Ireland farm safety week, which has been running since Monday.  This is a positive addition to the HSA&rsquo;s own farm safety campaign which ran in April of this year.  This farm safety awareness week offers five days of themed, practical farm safety advice and guidance to farmers, urging them to consider the slogan, &ldquo;Who Would Fill Your Boots&rdquo;, if they had a farm accident.<\/p><p>Farm safety is a critical issue facing farming today.  Statistics show that accidents on farms cause more workplace deaths than all other occupations combined.  Between 2004 and 2013, there were 176 fatal farm accidents, a shocking statistic.  To date this year, there have been eight fatal farm accidents on farms.  These eight fatal farm accidents account for more than 40% of all fatal work accidents so far in 2016, while farming accounts for less than 6% of the workforce.  While this is a welcome reduction, the rate of accidents on farms remains high and it is important the focus on farm safety is maintained.<\/p><p>Injuries and fatalities are caused in a several ways but the two highest areas of accidents relate to tractors and machinery and livestock.  So far this year, tractors and machinery account for 75% of all fatal farm accidents.  It is important farmers maintain all their tractors and machinery in good working order.  This is part of being a good farmer.  Farmers need to be reminded that accidents with tractors and machinery are the cause of the greatest number of fatal farm accidents.  The pattern is being repeated again this year.  Machinery and tractor maintenance should be seen as a routine part of farm work and that it is an essential expenditure to ensure a safe and profitable farming enterprise.<\/p><p>Cattle can be unpredictable, particularly cows with newly or recently born calves.  A cow with a calf may see the approach of a person as a threat to her calf and may, naturally, take action to defend her calf, particularly if there is a dog present.  It is important, therefore, to take great care when approaching or handling a cow and calf to prevent an accident from occurring.  It is important to remember all animals can be unpredictable, especially when they are confined or there is poor visibility.  Although most animal incidents are not fatal, many men, women and children are needlessly injured every year due to a lack of safety awareness.<\/p><p>Behavioural change is urgently required to minimise risk and prevent future accidents.  In support of this, my Department has several ongoing initiatives in farm safety.  As part of all of TAMS II, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, it is mandatory for all applicants to have completed a minimum of a half-day farm safety course before they can claim grant aid.  This will ensure a farm safety statement has been completed on all of these farms, while for all of TAMS II, all structures must be completed in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s building specifications.  These specifications set out the minimum standard to which all work must be completed and include safety related requirements, such as ensuring all slurry agitation points are outside a building.<\/p><p>In addition to the grant aid schemes, there is a mandatory health and safety element included in all knowledge transfer groups which I am supporting under the 2014 to 2020 rural development programme.  These groups will directly engage with approximately 27,000 farmers with farm safety right across the sectors and, most importantly, in a setting where they are among their farming neighbours and peers.  This year, as in the past four years, my Department has issued a farm safety leaflet to more than 130,000 farmers.  This was included in the basic payment scheme application pack.  This year the leaflet focused on slurry safety and the impact of non-fatal farm accidents.<\/p><p>The aftermath of a farm fatality is a particularly difficult time for those left behind.  To support families who have suffered a sudden loss and who may not have experience in dealing with the Department, there is a co-ordinated single point of contact in the Department.  This is to assist families in dealing with my Department&rsquo;s schemes and services to ensure they get the assistance they require.  As a further commitment to farm safety, my Department is an active member of the farm safety partnership advisory committee, which brings together all of the industry stakeholders.  My officials are in regular contact with the Health and Safety Authority to ensure a co-ordinated approach to farm safety.<\/p><p>In addition, a North-South farm safety group has been established involving my Department, the HSA, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland and the Health and Safety Executive Northern Ireland.  This group provides a strong link on farm safety to ensure a co-ordinated approach across the island.<\/p><p>One area around farm safety regularly talked about is the education of children.  The HSA has a dedicated section on farm safety for both primary and post-primary schools on its website, including a section on teacher support and resources for the classroom.  This website includes safety programmes, videos, games and other publications for teachers and pupils to use.  There is also the HSA e-learning website, <i>hsalearning.ie<\/i>, which includes a section for primary and secondary schools, along with a wide range of other safety training courses.<\/p><p>Considerable efforts are being made to ensure farm safety and health is embedded at all levels in the area of education from primary to third level.  In recent years, all primary schools were given a small stock of the publication <i>Staying Safe on the Farm with Jessy<\/i>, designed to be read with children explaining the dangers on farms to children in a pleasant way.  Also, several initiatives encouraging both children and parents to think about farm safety have been run including colouring competitions to produce a farm safety calendar.  A booklet of safety stories, poems, drawings and sketches by children was produced, which materialised in the production of the publication <i>Only a Giant Can Lift a Bull<\/i>.  This latter publication drew on more than 7,500 entries and, again, was widely distributed to all primary schools.  In 2014, all national schools were circulated with information on a new e-learning resource which gave an interactive series of online lessons which included a keep safe on the farm module.  This can be viewed on the HSA e-learning website.<\/p><p>While there are many risks in farming, farming does not have to be a dangerous occupation.  There are plenty of ways to reduce the danger, without spending significant levels of money.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael Creed:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=259\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=259&amp;amp;pid=MichaelCreed&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Farmers should be encouraged to take time to plan buildings and work.

I acknowledge the schemes he mentioned and how he would like to see farm safety become part of the primary and secondary schools curriculums.  In achieving this, however, we would miss a generation but it would be a good investment for the future.  I would like to see more stringent modules in the curriculum as opposed to the optional use of websites or colouring competitions, for example.  I would like to see an initiative similar to the road safety programme of the Road Safety Authority or the green flag initiative to promote environmental awareness.  If one learns to ride a bicycle at three or four, one can ride one for life.  It is at this early stage that we should teach the dangers and the importance of good practice and safety.  This knowledge would remain with the children for life.  While all of them may not end up working on farms, they will all visit one at some stage.  Unfortunately, the casualty is not always the farmer or worker on the farm; sometimes the casualty is a visitor.<\/p> <p>It would be helpful to have a high-profile individual to front the farm safety campaign.  This strategy worked for the Road Safety Authority.  While I was sceptical initially about the use of Mr. Gay Byrne to front the Road Safety Authority, I believe it worked extremely well.  We should consider a high-profile sportsperson, such as a GAA player, or a television presenter who is well got and liked by young people and who could make an impression on them.  This worked for the Road Safety Authority.<\/p> <p>I welcome the inclusion of an element of farm safety in the knowledge transfer schemes.  This could be pursued to a far greater extent.  I would go so far as to say there could and should be knowledge transfer schemes specifically on farm safety.  The feedback from the knowledge transfer schemes is excellent.  Farmers will obtain more information from one another than from an outside body that might be forcing it on them.  I would seriously consider a knowledge transfer scheme solely on the issue of safety.<\/p> <p>There are other schemes I would like to see introduced.  I plead with the Minister to introduce one in particular, the PTO scrappage scheme, which has been mooted and lobbied for.  As we all know, the PTO is the cause of many of the accidents on farms.  If there were a scrappage scheme, an old, worn, broken or damaged PTO that is being replaced could be returned to the supplier.  Not only would a scheme offer a financial incentive, it would mean the old PTO would be taken out of the equation.  At present, even a diligent farmer puts the old PTO in the shed when he has replaced it.  He scraps it himself until some occasion when, late at night when he is under pressure trying to finish a job or at the weekend when the supplier is closed, he reuses it to complete an hour's work if the new one is worn or broken.  It is natural for him to say he will get another hour out of the old one.  The scheme I propose would decommission the old PTO.  With a small financial incentive, the frequency of replacement could be increased.<\/p> <p>A number of measures have been introduced in the interest of farm safety, particularly the road traffic legislation and the measures on trailer haulage and trailer weights.  Unfortunately, however, the Minister needs to look into this.  There is much confusion among the various bodies.  Representatives and others have been in contact with me on this.  I have noted two relevant incidents.  In the first, a farmer was stopped and summonsed and received penalty points for going inside the yellow line to let traffic by.  In the second, an individual was stopped and treated similarly for staying outside the yellow line on the grounds that he should have pulled in.  Do the enforcers not know the new laws?  I also encountered a case in which an individual was pulled in, summonsed and given penalty points for not displaying a weight plate on a trailer weighing way under 19 tonnes.  The weight at which the weight plate is required is 19 tonnes.  While the laws are introduced in the best interests of the people and with the best outcomes in mind, they can cause more confusion and become problematic if the enforcers do not understand them.<\/p> <p>The bottom line on most issues we discuss is money.  One of the easiest and best ways to solve many of the issues concerning farm safety is helping farmers and increasing their margins.  If they do not have sufficient disposable income, it is very hard for them to update the machinery or enhance their safety procedures and methods.  This is no different from any other walk of life, irrespective of the profession.  If the tyres of the car are bald and need to be replaced but disposable income is at a minimum, the replacement will be put on the long finger and bills of a more pressing nature will be accorded priority.  Until we can improve the margins of farmers, we will always have a safety problem by virtue of there being insufficient money to spend on addressing it.<\/p> <p>Sometimes the mental health of farmers is not mentioned.  There were 18 deaths in 2015 from accidents involving machinery or animals.  According to the Central Statistics Office, there were 24 agri-related suicides.  We ought to be seriously concerned about this and offer support in this area.  There is a lot of pressure on farmers in that they are fighting against the weather, prices and everything that could conceivably be fought against on a farm to make ends meet.  This leads to a lot of pressure.  When we talk about 18 farm accident deaths, we cannot ignore the fact that in the same year, there were 24 deaths from suicide.<\/p> <p>What other measures is the Minister considering introducing in this area?  As mentioned, I would like to see a PTO scrappage scheme.  I would like the Minister to negotiate with the insurance companies so they could give a premium reduction to those who carry out a farm safety audit.  This would work in the interest of both the insurance company and farmer.  I would like the Minister to consider seriously placing responsibility for farm safety, in particular, and safety in the agri-sector under one body.  The Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, is ultimately responsible for the HSA.  The Irish Maritime Administration, which is responsible for safety at the fisheries end, falls under the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Could all these areas be under the one body?  This would be preferable.<\/p> <p>The Minister mentioned the safety of farm buildings.  Unfortunately, to qualify in respect of farm buildings, one has to be a young farmer.  All deaths so far this year from farm accidents were of farmers over 60.  This needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070600002#AA00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467797400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
