One of the parties involved has said it is not co-operating with that.  There is a bit of a stand-off.  The committee could do some useful work by bringing all entities in here sooner rather than later, based on the correspondence the Chairman has received, to get to the bottom of this.

They record gross expenditure by the service of &euro;104.6 million in 2013.  This represents a 2.9% reduction in expenditure year on year.  I have provided a graphic to illustrate the composition of Courts Service expenditure in 2013.<\/p><p>  Salaries accounted for 47% of expenditure, with total payroll costs amounting to &euro;49 million.  There were 927 full-time equivalent posts at the end of 2013, down from 945 at the end of 2012.<\/p><p>  The most significant programme spend relates to payments under the Criminal Courts of Justice PPP deal.  These are in the form of monthly unitary or combined payments which cover the cost of facility availability, financing, insurance and the provision of specified facility maintenance and support services for the users of the complex.  The charge in 2013 amounted to a total of &euro;20.2 million which represents an 11% reduction year on year.  This includes the effect of a rebate of &euro;566,000 arising from a periodic review of insurance costs, as provided for in the PPP contract.<\/p><p>  Programme expenditure under the Vote also includes spending on capital works for other courthouses.  A provision of &euro;3.9 million was made for such spending in 2013 and the outturn was &euro;2.5 million.  Note 3 explains that the underspend was due to delays in commencing works on a number of courthouse projects, including a delay in commencing preparatory works for a planned PPP bundle to provide new or refurbished courthouses at seven locations.<\/p><p>  On the receipts side, there were appropriations-in-aid amounting to &euro;46.8 million, of which &euro;42 million relates to fees charged for various categories of court transactions.  In addition, the Courts Service collected court fines, totalling &euro;11.7 million, which were remitted to the Exchequer.  A further &euro;7.6 million was collected and remitted to the Revenue Commissioners and a number of other State bodies.  This mainly comprised fines imposed in cases prosecuted by the Revenue Commissioners and fees paid for licensing applications.<\/p><p>  Members of the committee may wish to be aware that, as provided for by law and under the rules of the superior courts, the Judiciary oversees the investment and management of court funds.  They include funds held on behalf of wards of court and awards to minors arising from certain court proceedings.  These funds, amounting to around &euro;1.3 billion at end 2013, are not accounted for in the appropriations account for the Courts Service.  Annual financial statements for these funds are produced by the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and audited by an audit firm appointed by that office.  They are not within my remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000005#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1416478800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Ryan to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000005#Q00900","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416478800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee in my capacity as Accounting Officer for the Courts Service, Vote 22.  I look forward to discussing any aspect of the Vote with the Chairman and members of the committee.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to report that a clean audit report has been provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the 2013 appropriations account.  Overall, the Vote was managed successfully and within budget at year end.  A surrender balance of &euro;515,170 was recorded in the Vote.<\/p><p>  The Courts Service is responsible for the management and administration of the courts.  The administration of justice is a matter for the Judiciary and, in accordance with the constitutional independence of the Judiciary and the provisions of the Courts Service Act, is outside the scope of the functions of the Courts Service.  The committee will appreciate, therefore, that in my discussions today I am precluded from commenting on any matter relating to the exercise by a judge of his or her judicial functions or the exercise of quasi-judicial functions by an officer of the court.  I am also precluded from commenting on matters of Government policy.<\/p><p>  Since its establishment, the Courts Service has worked to ensure the courts operate effectively and efficiently, that the use of available resources is optimised, that value for money is achieved and that the best possible service is provided for court users.  Since the Vote was last considered by the committee in 2010, the Courts Service has seen very severe reductions in funding and staff numbers.  In this regard, the service has worked tirelessly to introduce a broad range of changes and reforms to bring about savings for the Exchequer, while maintaining access to justice and services for the public.  The service has diligently cut expenditure and, through proactive management, increased court fees, resulting in a significant contribution to the Government's recovery programme.  The net cost to the Exchequer of operating the service has reduced by &euro;41 million, or 41%, since 2008 - from &euro;99 million to &euro;58 million - as provided in the Estimates for 2014.  During this period day-to-day running costs as represented by non-pay current expenditure decreased by &euro;19.3 million, or 44%, with an 18% reduction in pay and a 73% reduction in capital expenditure.  Court fee income in 2008 was &euro;39 million, whereas the fee income target for 2014 is &euro;46.5 million, an increase of 19%.  The fee income for 2014 is forecasted to exceed this target.<\/p><p>  The Courts Service fully accepts and supports the Government&rsquo;s ongoing requirement for savings to be achieved and reforms introduced in the delivery of public services.  In this regard, the service has in place robust financial control measures across the organisation to ensure expenditure is kept to an absolute minimum, incurred only where absolutely necessary and unavoidable and that value for money is achieved.  In the past six years the service has been to the fore in the introduction of a range of transformational changes which have delivered very significant savings.  Given the severity of the funding and staffing reductions in the service which saw a 16% reduction in staff numbers - double the Civil Service average and significantly greater than the public service average of 10% - it would not have been possible to maintain services without introducing a range of efficiency and productivity measures across all aspects of Courts Service structures, administration and operation, while maintaining access to justice.<\/p><p>  The modernisation programme has included significant structural and administrative reforms, with the completion of the combined office project, and the rationalisation of stand-alone offices and the regional management structure.  We have also carried out a review and rationalisation of court venues and the hearing of cases in larger venues has freed up judicial and staff time.  We have also worked to introduce a substantial programme of legislative and process reforms to enable improved operation of the courts and efficiency in deployment of court resources.  The implementation of our ICT programme has resulted in the optimisation of courtroom and court support technology, including the roll out of digital audio recording, DAR, to all court jurisdictions and venues; extended use of video link and video conferencing, which has resulted in significant cross-justice sector efficiencies; the development of case management systems for the debt claims on-line project, the new insolvency service, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court; and ICT support for the new fines legislation.  There has also been increased staff flexibility in a number of areas such as DAR logging by court registrars, as well as increased in-house ICT and legal support, all of which have yielded significant savings.<\/p> <p>The increased productivity arising from these measures has enabled the service to support a 7% increase in the number of judges, not including the ten new judges appointed to the Court of Appeal, and an estimated increase of 10% in the number of court sitting days in recent years, despite reduced staffing and funding.  It has also allowed us to initiate an ambitious public private partnership programme which will see the refurbishment of seven courthouses around the country in the coming years. <\/p><p> The Courts Service very much welcomes the funding and staffing provision sanctioned this year to support the establishment and running of the Court of Appeal.  That court is now sitting and work on the infrastructure it will require is under way.  We also welcome the increased funding announced for the Courts Service Vote for 2015.  An increase in investment will continue to be required in the coming years to address the consequences of the austerity measures which had to be introduced.  Investment is required in ICT, for example, which, if made, has the potential to bring about a transformation in the way the courts operate and achieve significant further savings.  In the context of reduced resources and growing workloads, technology offers the best solution to enhancing customer service and delivering improved value for money.<\/p><p> Investment is also required to undertake a number of smaller courthouse capital refurbishment projects and urgent maintenance in courthouses.  These works have continued to be deferred owing to a lack of funding and are now urgently required if the fabric of these buildings is not to be totally compromised and if the future of our historic structures is to be safeguarded.  <\/p><p> The prioritisation of court sittings and front-line services has resulted in the stripping of back office and support functions, which in itself carries operational risks.  The Courts Service has reached tipping point in regard to staff numbers.  Additional staff are required if we are to continue to support court sittings as required by the presidents of the courts, maintain court services in offices around the country and support Government initiatives such as the implementation of the new fines legislation, new arrangements for the hearing of child care cases, the new legal costs adjudication regime to be provided for under the Legal Services Bill and the restructuring of the family law courts.  Just as with the Court of Appeal which was successfully established on 28 October, the successful implementation of these initiatives will require provision of the necessary funding and staffing.  <\/p><p> Our priority has always been and will continue to be the provision of front-line, core court services to support the Judiciary and court users.  This can only be achieved through the ongoing review of the organisation and delivery of services and the continued implementation of our change and modernisation programme.  The Courts Service strategic plan 2014&ndash;17 which sets out the key priorities for the service in the next three years has been submitted to the Minister for Justice and Equality for approval.  Over the lifetime of the plan we propose to build on the progress made in the review and reform of our structures and service delivery to bring about improved services and value for money.  We intend to focus on maximising the use of technology, developing our staff to ensure they have the necessary legal, technical and management skills and placing particular emphasis on the ongoing standardisation and rationalisation of processes and procedures to enable us to achieve significant economies and efficiencies in the delivery of services.  The service will work to ensure we continue to improve services for court users, make the courts as accessible as possible and achieve real value for money in the provision of these services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000005#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416479400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ryan.

The views expressed by those consulted form part of a detailed assessment provided for the building committee of the Courts Service.  If the committee proposes to recommend to the Courts Service board the closure of a particular venue, all those previously consulted are informed of this proposal and allowed to make a submission directly to the board.  As I said, it is an open and transparent system.<\/p><p>  On the Dublin venues to which the Deputy referred, we took the view that their closure was warranted from a Courts Service perspective.  I have mentioned that we have had severe reductions in funding and a 16% reduction in staff numbers.  There are challenges in maintaining sittings on a daily basis.  The Courts Service and its staff should be applauded in that, despite all the cutbacks made in the past six years, the fact that judicial numbers have increased by 8% or so and the 10% rise in the number of sitting days, no scheduled court sitting has been cancelled.  However, in the central Dublin area, we considered it would be more efficient to centralise all of our business within the Criminal Courts of Justice and the Four Courts area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000006#R00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1416479400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Would there have been enough space to do so?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000006#R01000","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416479400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>We were satisfied that there would be adequate space available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000006#R01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1416479400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Would it have had an impact on an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the provision of back-up support?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000006#R01200","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416479400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000006#R01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1416479400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>In other words, the maintenance of these extra four courts does have implications for the Garda and other services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000006#R01400","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416479400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>That was the reason for the decision ultimately taken.

The Courts Service, in accordance with the Courts Service Act 1998, is responsible for the management and administration of the courts and provides a support service for judges.  It is in this capacity that the service has a role in the management and investment of court funds.  These funds are invested in line with the provisions of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act 1958 and subsequent orders.  The Courts Service was established in 1999 and in 2001 commenced a review of the management and investment of court funds which culminated in the establishment of a number of customised funds in December 2003.  Most court funds have since been invested according to the new arrangements, including District Court and Circuit Court funds, in addition to High Court funds.  The Courts Service operates a very conservative investment policy to ensure the capital sum is protected, particularly in the case of minors.  Where necessary, an appropriate balance is struck between income generation and capital preservation and this approach has worked well in the past 11 years.  Very good returns have been generated, while protecting court funds from the worst effects of the credit crisis.  Some 65% of funds are held in cash-based assets and bonds, while there is a 35% exposure to equities and corporate bonds.<\/p><p>  In making a decision to invest court funds on behalf of a ward or a minor a key factor is the length of time the funds will be held by the courts.

We have not costed this project.  It all comes down to reductions in staff numbers and funding.  As stated, we have been stripping back office areas to support front-line sittings.  I take great pride in the fact that no scheduled sitting has been cancelled.  In that context, the number of staff in the ICT unit has been reduced from 16 to 12.  That is just one of the areas to which I refer that has been affected.  In general, we know what we need, but we have not costed it.  If we are going to go down the route of having a standardised civil system for the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court - such a system will really generate significant efficiencies - we will be obliged to take staff out of all three in order to build the business case and supply the ICT people who provide exactly what is required.  The difficulty is that we have stripped out staff all over the place.  We cannot pursue this matter unless we obtain additional resources.  As I stated, we have reached tipping point.  I reiterate that we have lost 16% of our staff and that the net cost to the Exchequer of running the Courts Service has fallen by 41%, which is amazing.  In 2009 the Exchequer was obliged to provide us with funding of &euro;99 million.  This year the figure is &euro;58 million.  We have made huge efficiency gains, but we need to start investing.  If the cut to our staffing levels had been similar to that applied in other areas of the Civil Service - according to a report by Mr. Boyle of the IPA, it stands at 8% - we would have a staff of 980.  We have 903 staff members, which is giving rise to significant consequences.

Fixed charge penalty points apply to a range of motoring offences.  What happens in any case is that a fixed charge penalty notice is issued by the Garda national processing office in Thurles when a motoring offence has been detected by a garda or a speed or safety camera, either static or mobile.  The notice is issued to the registered owner of the vehicle in the case of detection by a camera or the driver if the vehicle is stopped by a garda.  When the initial 28 day period has elapsed, the registered owner or driver has a further 28 days in which to pay the fine and incur penalty points.<\/p> <p>Once the fine is paid, the Garda electronically updates the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport with the offence details.  Once the 26-day period has elapsed, a fine cannot be paid.  I will come back to the issue.  The unpaid fine triggers an application to the courts for the issue of a summons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000008#T03400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416481200,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Deputy Kieran O'Donnell took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416481200,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The summons is then prepared and printed by the Courts Service and a hearing is scheduled.  The summons is served and when the accused person is convicted of the offence, approximately 28 days after the conviction we inform the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of the penalty points.  The notification is electronic.<\/p><p>  To return to the Deputy's point on the collection of driving licences, section 63 of the 2010 Act provides that, where a person is alleged to have committed an offence or has been charged with the commission of an offence under the Road Traffic Act and is due to appear before the court, the court is required to collect sufficient information - that is, the driving licence number - to provide to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport so that the penalty points are applied appropriately to the licence holder.<\/p><p>  The Courts Service has taken the following steps to implement penalty points.  All summonses issued in respect of the alleged offences under the Road Traffic Act include a specific provision that notifies the accused person that he or she must bring to court his or her driving licence permit and a legible copy of the driving licence.  The court registrar, following consultation with the presiding judge, makes an announcement at the start of the court proceedings to the effect that, as required by the summons, the person must produce his or her driving licence permit and a copy to the registrar once the case has been called.  Where a driving licence permit and a copy are produced, we put it into our system and the information is transferred electronically.  Where a driving licence permit is not produced, the registrar records that in the summons book and the minute book.<\/p><p>  We have made the case over a long period that we view this as an inefficient use of court resources.  I do not know whether the Deputy has ever been in a District Court when it is dealing with road traffic offences, but it is a very busy court with a lot of hustle and bustle.  Stopping the court just to try to collect details has caused issues for busy courts.  We believe it is very inefficient but, more importantly, we think it is a very ineffective way of collecting much-needed data in this area.  Over the years we have pointed out to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Road Safety Authority and others the specific difficulties associated with the collection of driving licence numbers when the business of the court is being conducted.  It is inefficient and, more importantly, it is ineffective.<\/p><p>  When an accused person is convicted in his or her absence of a road traffic offence, which is a regular occurrence in court, the Courts Service is not in any position to collect his or her driving licence details.  The Courts Service has consistently advocated an alternative approach, going back many years.  We feel that the national vehicle driving file and the motor tax file should be linked.  At the first registration of a vehicle and upon every change of ownership, the owner of a car should have to indicate his or her driving licence number.  Through the years we have changed the manner in which road tax has been paid.  Years ago in Dublin, one had to queue up for hours to apply to pay road tax, but mostly people now do it online, and one also provides details of one&rsquo;s insurance certificate number.  We are of the view that when one buys a car or it changes ownership the detail of one&rsquo;s driving licence should be incorporated.  That would address the inefficiency in the system and, critically, would result in driving licence numbers being available at the point of detection, either by camera or upon being stopped by a garda, and when a summons is being issued.<\/p><p>  We did not seem to make any progress in the area for years but, following the Garda Inspectorate report on fixed-charge processing systems, a working group was set up - the criminal justice fixed charge processing group - of which we are a member, and which is jointly chaired by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The group has been actively considering the proposal and we hope it will be implemented.  We feel this is the only sensible approach.<\/p><p>  There is also the third payment option.  I mentioned earlier that after 56 days, when the summons issues, if a motorist wants to pay his or her fine at that stage, unfortunately, that is not possible at the moment.  That is regrettable, but it is the way the legislation is framed.  Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 provides for a scenario where the appropriate fixed charge penalty will now be paid after the issue of a summons and not later than seven days before a person comes into the court, as the court needs seven days to take the issue out of the court list.  A subgroup of the criminal justice fixed charge processing group examined the option of bringing this section into effect.  Based on the approach agreed at the working group, the solution will involve the Garda taking on from the Courts Service the printing of all District Court summonses - not just those relating to road traffic offences - using an outsourced printing service provider and extending the payment system to include third payment options, and then electronically updating the court case management system to remove cases from the court list when a person has availed of the third payment option.  Such an approach would make it possible to automate aspects of the process that are currently managed manually and would provide assurances that the same organisation will generate the payment notice and managing receipts.  Obviously the Courts Service is fully supportive of the process.  From our perspective, it would reduce the number of cases that come before the courts-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000009#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1416481200,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I think we get it.

Yet when it comes to this area, it appears to be acceptable.  It is a political process.  I know it should not be, and it is something this Government probably has fallen down on when it comes to judicial appointments.  In our programme for Government we promised that we would look at this, and I believe it is a failing.  People such as Mrs. Justice Susan Denham have commented that it is a miracle our Judiciary has maintained its independence so well considering it is so political.  That aside, what we can do at the very least - I understand this is not Mr. Ryan's role - is to have a reasonable transition when something like this occurs to ensure there are no gaps and that sittings are not postponed.<\/p><p>  I know Ms Duffy does not set policy, but she deals with it within the Department of Justice and Equality.  I can raise this with the Minister, but it is a simple question.  The suggestion I am making and that I will make to the Minister - I am raising it with Mr. Ryan now because he is the person dealing with policy in the Department when it comes to the courts - is that when this occurs, the appointments to the Circuit Court and the District Court should happen at the same time.<\/p> <p>They should happen in tandem or, at the very least, within a specified period.  That is a simple suggestion.  <\/p><p> Mr. Ryan makes a good case about the Courts Service's efficiency and talked about a 16% reduction in its staff.  Some would state it is too efficient, while plenty of communities nationwide would suggest it has stripped down courthouses and so on.  The service has done a good job in cutting costs and, at the very least, it is possible to have sittings take place.  While one part of the Government system may be working well, another is not and has failed in providing judges to preside over sittings in the Circuit Court.  This is something that could be rectified easily.  I do not know whether the witnesses have a comment to make on this.  I again acknowledge to Ms Duffy that I am aware departmental officials do not set policy.  I do not know whether this issue has been raised in the past, but it appears to be a reasonable suggestion that when something like this occurs - retirements and deaths take place all the time - this could happen in tandem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000010#V03900","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416482400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I am certainly happy to take back the Deputy's comments to the Minister who probably will make the point that she has moved speedily to appoint judges and assist in the process of appointing them.  In the past four to six weeks she has brought a series of memorandums to the Government on appointing ten judges to the Court of Appeal, the subsequent replacements to the High Court and, this week, on appointments to the Circuit Court.  As Mr. Ryan stated, this has been unprecedented.  This is the first new court jurisdiction established since 1961.  It has been a long time since we went through such a major change to the system.  As for the nominations to the Circuit Court announced by the Government yesterday, the process was completed in as speedy a manner as possible.  As the Deputy is aware, names are submitted via the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which conducts its process.  The Government then has its part to play in evaluating the names and considering serving judges for the position.

It is the issue of wards of courts in terms of the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice, although I would say it was more within Mr. Quigley's domain.  Members of the committee have on and off received written correspondence on the issue, about which I have a couple of questions.  The office is independent in the way it functions and has its own investment committee.  Funds in the order of &euro;1.3 billion at the end of 2013 were involved.  Funds are audited independently; the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have a role.  The question that arises is whether Mr. Quigley is satisfied with the management strategy for investments and that the funds have been properly benchmarked in terms of performance.  He might put the matter in context.<\/p><p>  Awards have been made to persons who are wards of court.  In some cases, relatives are worried that there may not be sufficient funds available to deal with all eventualities in meeting the needs of an individual who is a ward of court.  They have major worries about the make-up of investments, as between equities and cash.  Mr. Quigley might give his perspective.  During the downturn, in the period from 2007, was there a fall in investments?  I suppose it is about providing comfort.  I am not questioning the independence of the investments committee and what it does, but Mr. Quigley might give his perspective in terms of ensuring there are sufficient funds available.

I think I understand the scenario to which the Deputy refers.  We are looking at the value of those funds at the worst point in the financial crisis.  As I alluded to earlier, all those funds took a hit.  We have looked at a number of cases.  If one looks at them over the longer term, even since December 2003, all of them are significantly up.  Of course, if one looks at any long-term fund in a particular year, which is what we are looking at here, and the fund is down substantially, it is not a real loss.  It is a paper loss.  If one were to sell all those units at that point in time, one would trigger the loss, but that did not happen in this case.  We are getting into investments where there is going to be fluctuation in the value of funds in the short term.  We get into those investments, however, because we take a long-term view.  That has been determined to be in the best interests of cases such as the one the Deputy has mentioned.  If we were to take an approach in which we took no risk with the funds and put them into a cash-type investment, we would be criticised because the return is extremely low and would not achieve the long-term objective of growing the investment.<\/p><p>  In terms of input, there is consultation between the wards of court office and individual beneficiaries, but, ultimately, the registrar and the courts must make a decision based on what is in the best interests of the beneficiary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000015#AA00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Quigley"},{"type":"speech","time":1416484800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>We just have a collision of two different worlds in exactly what Mr. Quigley has described.

However, families feel very locked out of the system and actually quite helpless.  The families I have spoken to have the bigger best interest at the core of their concerns, which is the best interest of their injured child or disabled parent or whoever it might be.  I suggest to Mr. Quigley, without intending to open a long discussion, that it might be useful to go back and look again at that interaction between individuals and the system in these cases.

I have not heard any demand from the Courts Service for an increase in its budget from the Exchequer at this point in time but it has used the fee income very successfully.<br\/>I wish to mention two points.  I wrote to Mr. Ryan last month about issues concerning decisions that had been made in the Circuit Court and the High Court and possession orders that had been issued.  Mr. Ryan wrote me a very fine and extensive letter.  However, there seems to be considerable discrepancies in the manner in which the Circuit Court and the High Court conduct their business.  For example, I was looking for possessions broken down in terms of residential possessions and non-residential orders that had been issued.  The Circuit Court was able to supply those details but the High Court did not have any breakdown of that nature.  Likewise, I was looking for location.  The Circuit Court had the breakdown in respect of location but the High Court had none.  It just had a bald figure.<br\/>While I understand that nobody wants to interfere too much with the Judiciary and the manner in which it conducts its business, it would seem that we could do with a more detailed level of information and at least a standardised level of information related to the same matters from the different courts.  I cannot understand why we cannot get information with regard to residential and non-residential and for both courts to be able to provide a breakdown with regard to the various areas.  Now that the Department of Justice and Equality is no longer the go-between with regard to Oireachtas Members because the Courts Service provides that information, the relationship between the Courts Service and the Oireachtas Members - because this is information that is coming from our clientele - is very interesting and it is very important that we are aware of it.<br\/>In the context of the new Courts Service strategy plan for 2014, I think the witnesses suggested that this was before the Department of Justice and Equality so it is a draft plan.  Is there any chance of us getting a look at that draft plan to see whether or not we could have an input before it is finalised in the context of our relationship with the Courts Service as serving Members of the Oireachtas and the work we are doing as it would be mutually beneficial?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014112000016#BB02300","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416485400,"counter":440,"content":"<p>There is no problem with sending it to the committee.
