They can see from this that there are three main elements to what the EPA does and that these relate to regulation, knowledge and advocacy.  What we are presenting today relates to two of those, namely, knowledge and advocacy, in the context of measuring, preparing inventories on greenhouse gas emissions, examining Ireland's performance, carrying out research and developing knowledge.  In the context of advocacy, we are focusing on smart farming.  This is a concept to which I will refer later.  Our vision is for a clean, healthy and well-protected environment supporting a sustainable society and economy.  We are of the view that this is not an unreasonable ambition.<\/p><p> This meeting is extremely useful coming, as it does, hot on the heels of the recently-published fifth assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, particularly that part produced by working group II, which has responsibility for assessing impacts, adaptation and vulnerability.

I will provide a brief introduction in respect of the EPA's work in this area and I will then refer more generally to greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland, before moving on to outlining the agency's climate-change specific vision for 2020 and the potential role of land use in this regard.<\/p><p>  As the third slide in my PowerPoint presentation indicates, we published our strategic plan - copies of which have already been circulated to members - last year.  The plan sets out the priority activities that we will undertake to deliver in the context of our mission to protect and improve the environment as a valuable asset for the people of Ireland.  Within the strategy, there are nine priorities which range from developing a holistic way of managing our water right through to driving positive behavioural change at individual, business and societal levels.  Two of the strategic priorities to which I refer are particularly relevant to these proceedings, the first of which relates to evidence-based decision making.  In that context, we are interested in producing national greenhouse gas inventories - that is, information relating to our historical emissions - and projections for the future.  The production of this data is absolutely critical.  It is also a key priority for the EPA in terms of informing evidence-based decision making.  The other strategic priority I wish to highlight is that which relates to maintaining a vibrant research programme.  The climate change pillar of this is absolutely integral in the context of identifying climate-change specific issues within the Irish context, particularly in terms of how it is affecting the country.  We also want to ensure that we can engage with the climate change debate at EU and international level.<\/p><p>  The main sources of greenhouse gas emissions are illustrated on the doughnut chart contained in the next slide.  The chart shows that 32% or our emissions come from the agriculture sector.  This means that just under one third of our emissions emanate from agriculture, which makes us quite unique across the EU.  Typically, emissions from agriculture across EU member states are approximately 10%.  Agriculture in Ireland is, therefore, a significant source of emissions.  The chart also shows that the energy sector - mainly energy generation - is responsible for 22% of our emissions.  In addition, transport is responsible for 19% of our emissions.  In total, agriculture, energy and transport account for just under three quarters of the country's emissions.  The remainder of our emissions come from the industry and commercial, residential and waste sectors.<\/p><p>  The next slide refers to trends in greenhouse gas emissions and shows that the profile of our emissions during the period 1990 to 2012.  Again, one can see that agriculture has made a sizeable contribution - shown in green and along the middle of the chart - as has transport, the level of the emissions from which is outlined in blue.  These two sectors contribute quite significantly to our emissions profile.  We are of the view that emissions from both sectors will increase as we move towards 2020.  In the case of the agriculture sector, this will be on the back of Food Harvest 2020 and the lifting of the milk quota in 2015.  Emissions from the transport sector will increase as the economy recovers and as we begin to move ourselves and increasing numbers of goods around the country.<\/p><p>  The next slide refers to land use, land use change and forestry.  We are compiling emissions data for this sector, which is an important carbon sink.  The graph shows that our land and forests absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.  The sink mainly comprises the forestry sector and its impact has been increasing during the past 22 years.  This is because the area of land under forestry in Ireland has increased as a result of afforestation grants.  As forests mature, they have a greater impact in terms of absorbing carbon dioxide.  During the Kyoto period - the five years from 2008 to 2012 - the land use, land use change and forestry sector has absorbed 16 million tonnes of CO2.  This represents 5% of our emissions over the period.  This is a very important sector for Ireland because it provides a vital carbon sink.<\/p><p>  Up to now I have outlined the sources of and levels of emissions in Ireland.  The EPA has a climate change specific vision for 2050, the basis of which is that we will have a carbon-neutral and carbon-resilient Ireland.  This will require transformation on a number of levels in the context of how we produce energy, how we use it, how we transport ourselves, how we produce food and how we manage our consumption systems.  In the context of delivering on that vision, we have identified a number of goals.  I will not discuss all of these but there is one in particular on which I wish to focus.  I refer to the need to ensure that positive sequestration practices are recognised, promoted and sustained.  What this means is that we would like to see the development of a system or framework that will bring the agriculture and the land use sectors together.  At present, agriculture is very much seen as being separate to the land use sector and they tend to operate in separate silos.  We would like them to be combined and accounted for together because this would recognise the inherent link between them.  As a result, activities that are taking place on the land would be connected to changes within soil carbon and carbon pools.  This would provide a potential way forward and it is something we would like to see happen.<\/p><p>  I referred earlier to the land use, land use change and forestry sector.  We would like the land use sector to be considered in its entirety.  As it is currently accounted for and defined under international accounting rules, it is viewed in quite narrow terms and the focus is very much on the forestry sector.  As stated, we would like it to be considered in its entirety and all of the potential sinks that exist to be recognised.  What we are seeking is a strategic approach to the optimisation of land use in Ireland.  We must examine the potential and economic benefits of recognising ecosystem services and how they might be included in mitigation costs and benefits.  We must consider all of the sinks that exist in our managed land systems and assess ways in which they might be maintained and enhanced.  We must also examine the accounting rules, which are currently quite narrow in scope, and ensure that they are as broad as we require.  We must also ensure that we realise the full potential of our land use sectors.<\/p><p>  The holistic approach whereby agriculture and land use would be considered together under one system would recognise that these two sectors are very closely linked.  As stated, greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector are projected to increase and they already account for just under one third of our overall emissions.  We are already obliged to meet demanding EU targets in this area and these are likely to become even more onerous.  In that context, we have a land use sector which could possibly offer access to a very large potential sink.  I refer here not only to what we are already accounting for, but also to, as EPA-funded research shows, the even larger sink that exists.  In 2050, there could be a potential net sink of 9 million tonnes.  Grasslands have the potential of increasing this figure even further.  The sink is not captured in our current accounting model and we would like it to be broadened.  We must work at international level in order to facilitate this development.<\/p><p>  The EPA has allocated a significant level of resources in respect of these issues.  In the context of our climate change research programme, I have highlighted one research project, the Irish soil information system, ISIS, to which the representatives from Teagasc will refer in greater detail during their presentation.  This project shows the collaborate effort between two State agencies and it involves some extremely important research in respect of the classification of Irish soils and their properties.  The investment we have made in this regard is going to give rise to a very high return.  We would like resources to continue to be allocated in respect of this project into the future.<\/p><p>  In the context of next steps, it is vital that the research be supported because it will play a critically important role in helping us to manage our resources - in this instance, our land use resource - effectively.  We will be obliged to engage at international level in order to shape the accounting rules and ensure that they evolve in a manner which will be of benefit to Ireland.<\/p> <p>It is not only an issue at international level.  We must also recognise at national level that land use is one way to achieve climate change objectives.  It is about more than forestry.  We must consider it in a broader context.  I hand over now to Dr. Jonathan Derham who will talk us through other ways to mitigate climate change with particular reference to sustainable food production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040800004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eimear Cotter","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396963500,"counter":15,"content":"<p>My presentation is on resource efficiency.  A copy of it should be included in the circulated handout.  I will discuss an initiative called &quot;smart farming&quot;, but to set things up members can see from my first slide that we face a perfect storm on a worldwide basis of diminishing resources, increasing population and increasing demand for industrial output.  It is beyond the capacity of the planet to provide the resources we need to live in the way we do in the developed world.  Resource efficiency is about adopting a model of living better while using less.  It is a well-recognised policy in Europe, the OECD and UN as a means of identifying the impossible balance of prosperity, progress, development and living within the boundaries of the planet as given to us.<br\/>The EPA's model for resource efficiency addresses energy efficiency, clean technology, which is making products more cleanly and with less harmful substances, water conservation, eco-design, which involves designing better products that last longer, are easier to dismantle at end of life and are repairable with replacement parts, and behavioural change, which is a big part of it.  We are trying to adjust people's consumption and production behaviours.  On the energy efficiency side, we work hand in hand with our colleagues in the SEAI to deliver energy efficiency services into the State and industry.<br\/>The next slide features examples of a number of behavioural change activities.  Members can see that smart farming is one of a suite of programmes we offer.  Members are probably well aware of &quot;stop food waste&quot;, which is advertised on radio and television.  We throw away 30% of the food we produce.  Part of what we must do to be more resource efficient in agricultural production is to stop people wasting the food that is grown and delivered to them.  If one piled up all the food waste produced in Ireland annually, it would make a column 150 m high with a base the size of the Aviva stadium pitch at Lansdowne Road.  It is a lot of food waste.<br\/>The smart farming initiative is a collaboration between the IFA and the EPA.  Our normal approach to behavioural change activities in different sectors is to work with a sectoral champion or leader.  The IFA came forward and has taken up the baton.  The IFA is very keen to drive the matter itself and we are really a supporting agency.  It is being delivered by the IFA and represents a successful start to the programme.  It is a voluntary programme which is not locked in to any grant aid, obligation or regulatory compliance issue.  It is a voluntary, on-farm resource efficiency and cost saving programme.  Why did we do it?  A gap was identified in our national resource efficiency programme.  We have activities in the hospitality sector, industrial manufacturing, the social pillar, homes and communities but did not have a particular activity in the farming sector.  That was the gap.  In our national recovery plan, farming and food production are a key sector.  We felt we had to address it to address the national recovery plan.  Food harvest resource efficiency is a strong theme running through that.  The cost of inputs to Irish farms was &euro;5.5 billion in 2013.  If we only manage a modest 1% efficiency gain, it saves the farming sector &euro;55 million.  There are clear gains.<br\/>Members will see from slide 7 on page 4 that it is not just the EPA and the IFA that are involved.  The programme was put together, led by the IFA, in collaboration with UCD's school of agriculture, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Teagasc, the Fertilizer Association of Ireland, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the Irish Grasslands Association and the Farm Tractor and Machinery Trade Association.  There are seven major themes in the smart farming programme: soil fertility, grassland, machinery, time management, inputs, energy and feed.  The approach includes top tips on how farm enterprises can save money by doing simple things better for little to no investment.  It increases the efficiency and production of farms and leads to a double dividend.  It generates a financial dividend for farms while reducing the overall environmental burden and resources input.  An example is soil fertility.  Members will see from the handout that this is about lime and the proper pH of soil.  My colleagues from Teagasc are probably more expert than me in this regard but I note that low soil pH reduces the availability of nutrients.  This is about getting the right soil tests to improve the use of fertiliser.  The yield is &euro;20 per acre in savings on fertiliser in getting the pH balance right.  It is a question of linking the environmental gain with the clear economic gain.<br\/>Members can see the sheets on farm machinery.  We have found that many small farms are over-mechanised with tractors and machinery that are far too powerful for the size of the farm unit.  One of the challenges we have in addressing this as a national policy issue is determining how to match machinery size to the scale of the farm.  Simple things can be done on machinery such as addressing the waste of fuel associated with low tyre pressure and travelling to distant and isolated blocks of land.  Dr. Schulte has more comments on those sorts of issues.<br\/>Members can see, if they go through the sheets, that there are useful and straightforward tips for farm enterprises to reduce their environmental burden while saving money.  This is all available on the web as a free resource regardless of whether one is a member of the IFA.  Any farmer can access the material.  We held a very well-attended national conference last year to launch the initiative accompanied by an excellent 12 page supplement in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>.  The initial phase involved resource efficiency assessments or cost saving studies on five candidate farms in autumn 2013.  We saved an average of &euro;5,000 per farm, a not insignificant sum for these small farm enterprises for no or low investment.  These are young, engaged and highly motivated farmers who believed they were doing as good a job as they could up to that point.  There is clearly plenty of scope across the sector.  It is very positive.  In 2014, we are looking at undertaking 30 on-farm assessments with volunteer farms.  These are clustered around farm discussion groups operated by the IFA.  This is about diffusion of skills through discussion groups and regional seminars.  We do not need to work hard to find candidate farmers as they are queuing up to get involved.  There is high interest and uptake.<br\/>The benefits for farmers are financial.  It is clear income and revenue.  The initiative also underpins and supports the ambitions of Food Harvest 2020 and Origin Green with low resource input production and sustainable farming enterprises.  It benefits our overall economy and environment and reduces inventories.<\/p> <p>This will again lead in to some of Dr. Schulte's comments.<\/p><p> The final slide states that smart farming fits into a sustainable consumption and production cycle.  It is part of an overall national cycle that we have.  It is an essential part of primary production but it does not exist on its own.  It cannot solve the whole problem of delivering a sustainable consumption and production in society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040800005#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jonathan Derham","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396964100,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am contributing on behalf of my colleague, Mr. Daire &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in, a research officer in the area of agri-ecology and I bring apologies from Dr. Rachel Creamer and Dr. Gary Lanigan, who, unfortunately, had prior engagements today.  I thank the committee for inviting us to elaborate on our initial presentation last February.<br\/>I will begin with one slide from that presentation.  We spoke about the emerging demands on land use going into the future, contrasting demands from an agronomic perspective as specified in the food harvest strategy and from an environmental perspective as specified in many different environmental policy frameworks.  We were invited to elaborate on three subjects - the greenhouse gas policy framework, agri-ecology and soils.<br\/>Greenhouse gases have been prominent in public debate this week on foot of the publication of the IPCC report and when we talk about public debate, I start with what we call the Irish paradox when it comes to agriculture and greenhouses gases because we often hear two contrasting statements.  On the one hand, we hear that agriculture in Ireland accounts for a large proportion, 32%, of national emissions while, on the other, we hear that agriculture has one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world.  Both statements are true at the same time.  A large proportion of emissions come from agriculture.  The average in Europe is 10% whereas it is 32% in Ireland.  Part of that can be explained by the fact that we do not have a large heavy industrial sector nor do we have a large population of cattle.  This means that in Europe agriculture emissions are often masked by industrial and residential emissions but this is not the case in Ireland.<br\/>Second, we rely on ruminant farming in Ireland - cattle, dairy cows and sheep - which is largely a reflection of our soils and climate.  It is simply what we are good at.  The next slide contains data from the Commission which compare the carbon footprint of a litre of milk for every member state.  The green circle is Ireland and shows that it has the lowest carbon footprint for milk in the EU.  When we look at beef, we are again in a relatively good starting position.  We have the joint fifth lowest carbon footprint.  That is a good place to start.  However, there is no room for complacency.<br\/>The next slide features screen grabs from the Internet of some of our main competitors.  Each has proactive sustainability programmes both at national level and at processor level.  For example, last week we were in FrieslandCampina in the Netherlands, Europe's largest dairy processor and it is making a serious effort to reduce the carbon footprint of its milk.  In other words, we have to find ways to continue to reduce our footprint to maintain our position.  Teagasc has a greenhouse gas working group where we pool together all the different expertise from our research centres and advisory services and over the past number of years we have produced three significant reports, two of which I have circulated.  In 2012 we published our vision for 2020 and our research and development strategy.  That report is in front of members.  Last year we published our long-term vision for 2050 and that is the colourful report in front of members.  If they prefer not to read long reports, we wrote a two page summary in our research magazine, <i>TResearch<\/i>, which we have also circulated.<br\/>I will focus on our 2020 vision.  We produced a marginal abatement cost curve.  This is a normal tool in the wider sense of the economy to assess what the options are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  We are one of the first in the world to use it for agriculture.  The curve contains a number of bars, which represent options for agriculture.  The width of each bar tells us how much impact each measure will have on reducing emissions whereas the vertical axis tells us how much it would cost.  Bars that are below the axis pay for themselves and are cost beneficial whereas those above the axis cost money.  Of all the options we assessed, we broke them into three groups, which we colour coded.  The green measures relate to efficient farming, for example, an increased economic breeding index, higher genetic merit for cows, extending the grazing season and nitrogen efficiency.  These measures, as we calculated them, turned out to be cost beneficial.  The yellow measures relate to land use change and they are largely the production of biofuel and bioenergy.  We see two things.  First, they are cost neutral, which means there is no financial impediment or incentive for farmers to take them up.  Second, under the current Kyoto accounting framework any carbon credits associated with biofuels and bioenergy are not credited to the agriculture sector.  Instead, they end up in the power generation or transport sectors.  The blue measures relate to technological intervention, for example, anaerobic digestion of pig slurry or slurry spreading equipment, and these turned out to be quite expensive.<br\/>The headline conclusion of our 2020 vision is that it is possible to achieve the food harvest strategy targets while, at the same time, keeping greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture constant.  Part of that is good news because if that were to materialise, that would represent a decoupling of production from emissions meaning we could increase production while keeping emissions constant.  That would mean a further reduction in our carbon footprint through efficiency alone.  However, the other half of the story is this will not happen by itself overnight and I will come to that.<br\/>The theory is that increased efficiency will reduce carbon emissions but does this work in practice?  This is where we look at the Teagasc national farm survey.  This is a proper statistical survey, which has been operating for decades through which we collect economic indicators on more than 1,000 farms across the country on an annual basis.  As of last year, for the first time, we are also collecting environmental indicators.  I will highlight one graph from the report which shows the carbon footprints of the dairy farms in our survey.  We split them into three groups - the one third of dairy farms that are most profitable, one third that have average profitability and the one third that are least profitable.  The most profitable farms also have the lowest carbon footprint and <i>vice versa<\/i>.<br\/>The question is how will we make this happen.  We teamed up with Bord Bia and we asked ourselves how we can maximise the adoption of these green measures.  This is when we produced the carbon navigator, which is a decision support tool for farmers that helps them to identify which of the measures is most appropriate for their unique farm.<\/p> <p>It uses very practical language.  We do not talk about nitrous oxide emissions or methane but about grazing season length, nitrogen fertiliser rates, etc.<\/p><p> Third, we put a lot of emphasis on the distance to target rather than on the carbon footprint.  I will elaborate on that distinction because it is important.  The slides show two hypothetical farms, one in Wexford and one in Donegal.  Each has a carbon footprint associated with its produce.  There is a good chance that the carbon footprint of the farm in Donegal would be higher, simply reflecting the wetter soils, which result in greater nitrous oxide emissions.  The lower productivity of the land also increases the carbon footprint.  When we talk about individual farms, the carbon footprint is not the most important metric, however.  This is because each farm has what we call the biophysically minimum footprint.  There are and will always be some greenhouse gases associated with food production; that is the minimum footprint.  The important question concerns the distance to target.  How much has the farmer reduced his or her footprint towards the minimum?  As in the example, it is entirely possible that a farmer in Donegal will have progressed more towards the target than a farmer in Wexford.  Again, I emphasise that the example is hypothetical.<\/p><p> The carbon navigator, which is probably clearer in the slides shown to the members, is a very simple software tool.  On the left of the slide, members will see the green measures, from our marginal abatement cost curve.  The top example, on extending the grazing season, shows the farmer's current performance based on existing data in existing databases.  The right-hand side shows that the farmer, together with his adviser, sets for next year a target, in days, for the extension of the grazing season.  The farm is then benchmarked against the top performance within his or her county where the soil type is the same.  The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions arising from this change in practice is shown in the slides.  Most important, the financial benefit that would accrue is shown.  The carbon navigator will be rolled out in all the discussion groups on the beef and dairy side in Teagasc in 2014.<\/p><p> Our EPA colleagues have already referred to the fact that the United Nations and European Commission have agreed that after the expiry of Kyoto accounting mechanism that runs until 2020, a new one will be required.  In this regard, I have to hand an extract from the European Commission's latest communication to the European Parliament.  Basically, it is inviting member states to come up with ideas or suggestions specifically on how to treat agriculture differently in the future.  We are working very closely with our colleagues in the EPA, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the National Economic and Social Council to produce a coherent Irish proposal.<\/p><p> We already mentioned soils in the context of greenhouse gas emissions.  On the last occasion, I announced that we would finalise the Irish soil information system.  I am very pleased to be able to announce today that we have done so.  The members are the first to see this, and the viewer is evident on their screens.  It will be operational on the Internet.  This occurs on foot of a very large programme funded by the EPA and co-funded and operated by Teagasc.  We completed the 1:250,000 soil map of Ireland and have put all the information, including the databases, into the public domain and onto the Internet.  The study is based on an extensive field-sampling campaign using over 10,000 augur points and over 200 full soil-profile descriptions.<\/p><p> I will outline what the soil map can and cannot be used for.  It is important to do so in today's context.  Any 1:250,000 soil map will be based on associations.  Associations are groupings of soil types that often occur together in a landscape.  These soil types can be quite different.  A slide shows glacial and brown soils that occur together in a group in a particular landscape.  There can be two soil types in an association, or there can be three or more.  What does this mean in terms of the use of the soil map?  We  are not able to drop a pin on the soil map and pinpoint soil types A or B because, as the animation available to members shows, we do not know which of the soil types we have actually hit with the pin.  We can use the map to click on a polygon that tells us which soil types occur in the area in question.  This means that when our advisers visit our client farmers, instead of bringing a list of 200 soil types, they will know they can expect to find one or more from a list of three or four.  All the information in the databases will be available to them.  Of course, the holy grail is to come up with soil-specific management strategies.<\/p><p> The soil map can also be used to regional and national levels, for example, in respect of river basin district management plans, the tier-3 Kyoto accounting of greenhouse gas emissions and habitats.

I will speak a little about agro-ecology.  Dr. Schulte, in a previous presentation, mentioned the various demands on land use in Ireland, one of which concerns agro-ecology and the conservation of habitats and species, or the conservation of biodiversity.  Approximately 10% of the terrestrial land of Ireland is designated as a special area of conservation under the habitats directive.  Approximately 6% is designated as a special protection area under the birds directive.  There is some overlap between the two designations.  Therefore, in total, approximately 13% of the terrestrial area of Ireland is designated under Natura 2000.  This is probably the <i>cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me<\/i>of our biodiversity, species and habitats, and it is afforded the highest conservation priority under European legislation.  However, it is important to conserve and enhance other aspects of our biodiversity.<br\/>There are habitats and species eligible under the habitats and birds directives but which are not yet designated.  Approximately 50% of eligible habitats are designated under Natura 2000.  How should we go about conserving the other 50%?  There are also species and habitats that are rare or threatened on a national scale.  There is high-nature-value farmland.  This is a new term that has been bandied out for the past 20 years or so.  It is important from its biodiversity prospective.  I refer to extensive farmland with highly diverse species and habitats.  There are also more common farmland habitats, such as hedgerows, ponds, streams and watercourse margins.  There is also a semi-improved grassland and improved agriculture land and forestry.  It is important that we aim to conserve not only the <i>cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me<\/i>at the top of the list, namely, the habitats designated under Natura 2000, but also the biodiversity associated with the large proportion of land comprising agricultural land and forestry.  It is important that we conserve the biodiversity associated with those habitats because they feature widely throughout the country.<br\/>Consider the addressing of the conservation status of these habitats.  We can target through two methods, namely, critical conservation, focusing primarily on the top three or four on the list, and more strategic conservation measures.  It is a question of using critical or strategic conservation strategies to target the various habitats.  There will be different effects in respect of each habitat and species.<br\/>The next slide shows differences in regard to how we engage in targeting and the impacts of critical and strategic conservation.  For example, there is a difference in regard to the cost-effectiveness of measures.  Critical conservation measures will be more costly because they are specific.  We can consider more general cost-effective measures for strategic conservation.  Any measure that we select must be supported by landowners.  There will be an impact on the productivity of landowners as critical conservation measures are likely to have a greater impact on landowners than more strategic measures.<br\/>For critical conservation, there is a need to target species and habitats, in addition to specific locations for these species and habitats.  A good example concerns the freshwater pearl mussel.  We have approximately 27 catchments designated under the special area of conservation, SAC.  It is unlikely that we can have conservation measures to target all these catchments.<\/p> <p>There will be a report saying that it is better to target where one is most like to receive or gain the most rewards in terms of conservation strategy.  By targeting the top eight or so catchments, we are most likely to see the conservation strategy make an impact.<\/p><p> For strategic conservation there is less of a need for such targeting.  There are also differences in designation and policies to address habitats and species under critical conservation and those under strategic conservation.  There are also differences in the funding available and funding streams that can be used.  For example, for critical conservation there is Pillar 2 under the Common Agricultural Policy.  The new proposed GLAS scheme, which is a new agri-environment scheme, could be seen as one area for targeting funding towards critical conservation.  For strategic conservation there are also opportunities under Pillars 1 and 2.  Under CAP, for example, there is the greening of CAP or the greening measures which could be seen as more strategic conservation strategies.<\/p><p> There will also be an impact on landowners if we target critical and strategic conservation.  For example, in the case of flagship species such as the corncrake, which has declined for a number of different reasons, one of its main threats has been the change in agricultural practices and the switch from traditional hay meadows to silage production.  Let us consider the conservation of the species, as we are obliged to do under the birds directive.  There is a requirement, where these species occur, to switch back towards more traditional measures, and these will have an impact on production.<\/p><p> Another species is the freshwater pearl mussel.  There may be historic reasons for its decline but one of its main threats is sediment.  Conservation of the species would impact on the landowner as he or she would have to implement mitigation measures such as buffer strips or sediment traps.<\/p><p> Species rich grassland has declined massively over the past 50 or 60 years and one of its main threats has been abandonment.  Therefore, if we want to conserve such habitats, we need farmers to actively manage and farm the land.<\/p><p> From a strategic conservation point of view, these matters are less resource affected.  For example, hydro conservation benefits biodiversity and agriculture because it provides shading, shelter and drainage.  Let me give the example of species associated with riparian margins, which benefit the margin and the biodiversity associated with the watercourse and also intercept nutrients and sediment, thus preventing them from getting into watercourses.  There are also opportunities to target strategic conservation strategies to more marginal areas of land.  For example, a farmer can target areas that are less productive, thus benefiting biodiversity and ensuring a reduced cost for agriculture.  The last slide provides a summary and heralds the end of the Teagasc presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040800007#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Daire &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396965300,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank both delegations for their comprehensive presentations which dovetail quite a lot.

If one grows a tree it will take in carbon, but if one grows other plants, like grass and so on, they will not take in carbon.  When an animal eats the plants the gas will be expelled again.  How does constantly putting out a lot of greenhouse gases not deplete the carbon amount?  Where is it all coming from?  There is a permanent carbon cycle.  Is there an accounting issue?  Have I missed the point that was made about the greenhouse gas count?  It has been said that one type of plant takes carbon in and holds it, but when one kills the tree and burns it, one lets out what was brought in, although it is kind of neutral by then.  However, other plants take in carbon, animals feed on them and then the animals release gases and so on both at the front and the back.

The factors that come across from all the contributions are education, efficiency, the joined-up approach by the various agencies and, in particular, working with farming organisations because that is where many of our problems come from.  The smart farming, whole farm approach to soil fertility plays a huge role.  When one comes from that type of background and travels around the country, particularly the more marginal and weaker areas, one can see that things could be more efficient from a production perspective and in terms of what we are trying to achieve on the carbon issue.  If this efficiency and education were available to many of the weaker and poorer sections of the farming community, it could help to address the problem in some way.<\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that 30 farmers will be included in an educational discussion.

If the witnesses are to achieve what they want to achieve, the concentration must be within sectors of the farming community that are most vulnerable and most in need.  <\/p><p>  The witnesses talk about critical and strategic conservation.  When they talk about critical conservation, they are talking about land that is probably sterilised for that to happen with the loss of income to the farmer involved.  There are no more relevant areas than parts of west Limerick and north west Cork where whole areas have been sterilised because of the hen harrier.  In these areas, people entered into an agreement, did not have the contract and have no income.  We must make it attractive through a support mechanism.  <\/p><p>  I think about 7% of forestry is managed by Coillte while forestry takes up 11% of land nationally.

Deputy Ferris is quite right.  Education is a founding element of this resource efficiency model.  We have certainly proved that the joined-up approach has been very successful across State agencies and sectoral organisations.  Clearly, it is the way to go.  At the root of all of this, behavioural change is a sociological issue and probably in some cases a psychological issue for individuals and groups.<\/p> <p>Why do groups have difficulty with change?  The following elements should be considered, namely, the economic element and the cost of change.  Age is a factor when individual farmers reach the age when they think about retiring they do not want to have to reinvent themselves.  The scale of the farm is another element, with very small scale farms having low-cost effectiveness.  Habits and culture also dictate people's behaviour.  It is a complex sociological problem.<br\/>We in the State agencies have found that telling people what they should do is not terribly successful.  The most effective model has been the farm-based discussion groups in which farmers talk to farmers.  There is a direct exchange of experience between them.  I am not from a farming background but through my professional life I have a great deal of interaction with the farming sector and we are very pleased that the IFA is coming forward with the farm discussion group model.  Members will see at the top of page 7 of the slides, the indicative farm discussion groups are spread across the country.  There will be some fine tweaking based on farm types but they will look across the tillage, beef and dairy farms.  There will be a range of different farm types and different farm enterprise types within the discussion groups.  We will continue this process in the following years, money permitting.  The EPA is putting funding of &euro;100,000 in cash into this year's discussion groups and about another &euro;70,000 in terms of people and human resources.  That is a modest sum but the impact is significant.<br\/>I will comment very quickly on the 2020 targets.  My colleagues might add further to them.

Is there a genetic issue with different breeds?  What affects the output of methane gas from cattle?  Is there anything we can do to produce the same amount of beef yet generate less methane?

There is some confusion in the public debate about the impact of Food Harvest 2020 on total bovine numbers.  The results from our economic modelling unit, the Frappery Island model, which projects these animal numbers forward up to 2020, suggest that the number of dairy cows will increase in response to the phasing out of the EU milk quota.  However, as these additional dairy cows produce additional calves, the model output suggests a contraction of the suckler cow herd.  The change in total bovine numbers, dairy cows plus suckler cows, will be very small.  It will be a change in the composition of the national herd rather than a growth of the national herd.  Sometimes in the public domain we see questions on what will we do with the 50% additional slurry, the increase in the amount of slurry will be in single digits.<\/p> <p>That puts the challenge in context.<\/p><p> There are small differences between breeds in terms of methane output.  Interestingly, there are greater differences between breeds in terms of milk and meat output.  If we are considering efficiency in terms of CO2 per litre of milk or kilogram of meat, there is much to gain from breeding.  As is evident from our marginal abatement cost curve, one of the largest potential gains is in the economic breeding index, EBI, which is a composite indicator of the genetic merit of a dairy cow.  This includes not only output indicators, but also efficiency indicators and so on.<\/p><p> We are disadvantaged because of our type of farming.  The fact that we rely on ruminant farming poses a major challenge to our greenhouse gas balance sheet.  Having said that, the debate in the Irish context is different from the debate in the continental context.  In Europe, farmers theoretically have a choice between tillage and grassland farming.  In Ireland, we must take food security into account.  If we do not have ruminants on our grass, what are we going to do with it?  This important question is now being taken into account by the European Commission in the post-2020 framework on greenhouse gases.  For the first time, the term \"food security\" appears in the Commission document under the agriculture heading in the context of greenhouse gases.  The fact that we export between 80% and 90% of our produce has opened the door at the Commission to ensure that any new policy or accounting framework recognises this contribution to food security.  How this will be worked out in the details is open to negotiation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040800010#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rogier Schulte","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396967100,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I may be wrong, but did a UN report last week criticise Food Harvest 2020 for being an export-based model that took no account of international food security?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014040800011#M00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396967100,"counter":61,"content":"<p>No, that was not my reading of last week's document.

The fund has invested a total of &euro;20.7 billion in Bank of Ireland and AIB at the direction of the Minister for Finance.  The NPRF Commission, that is the trustees of the fund, has continued to manage the remainder of the fund &ndash; the discretionary portfolio, now approximately &euro;6.8 billion &ndash; in line with its original statutory investment policy. <\/p><p>  In September 2011 the Government announced its intention to channel the NPRF&rsquo;s remaining resources, following appropriate changes to its governing legislation, towards investment in sectors of strategic importance in the Irish economy.  In June 2013 the Government announced legislative proposals to establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, which will absorb the NPRF and will have a statutory mandate to invest on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.<\/p> <p>That is the key basis for our activity moving forward.  The commercial nature of ISIF&rsquo;s investment mandate is of critical importance and I will return to this later. <br\/>The Minister for Finance has said that the legislation to establish the Irish strategic investment fund, ISIF, which will be the NTMA (amendment) Bill, should be published shortly and he hopes that it will be enacted by the middle of the year.  This will also involve the dissolution of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, with oversight and management of the ISIF passing to a new overarching NTMA board and its investment committee.  The new board of the NTMA will also be responsible for approving the business plan for the ISIF, on which we are working at present.  The new ISIF will also hold the NPRF&rsquo;s directed investments in AIB and Bank of Ireland on behalf of the Minister for Finance. <br\/>When established later this year, the ISIF will not be beginning from a standing start.  Significant progress has already been made by the NPRF Commission in refocusing the NPRF towards commercial investment in Ireland within the constraints of the NPRF&rsquo;s current mandate.  Some &euro;1.3 billion has already been committed or invested in areas of strategic importance to the Irish economy and the legislation in progress will facilitate the remaining &euro;5 billion plus of the fund&rsquo;s discretionary resources being invested in Ireland. <br\/>Finding and developing investment opportunities will be a key function of the ISIF.  To help generate investment opportunities and potential investment partners, the NTMA last month held a market engagement and communication event in Dublin Castle.  The event was attended by more than 400 delegates, including representatives of pension fund investors, industry bodies and financial and legal advisers to companies, throughout the economy. <br\/>We expect opportunities to be developed for the ISIF from a wide variety of sources, both through our own proactive efforts of the executive team within the NTMA and via third parties coming to us with ideas and proposals.  We have an open-door policy and actively encourage people to approach us or our third party managers with any proposals or ideas.  By way of information, the presentations from the Dublin Castle event and the related contact details are available on the front page of the NPRF&rsquo;s website, <i>nprf.ie<\/i>.<br\/>The ISIF is unusual in that it will combine a commercial approach to investment with the requirement to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.  There is little precedent globally for sovereign funds investing with such a &quot;double bottom line&quot; so unfortunately there is no well-worn path to follow.  Essentially we have twin objectives.  As there is no well-worn path to follow, we are finding our own way.<br\/>While the domestic focus represents a significant change of direction, the ISIF will share one fundamental feature with its predecessor, NPRF - investments will be undertaken on a commercial basis.  It is important to understand what &quot;commercial basis&quot; actually means.  In simple terms it means that we have to get our money back plus a bit more.  When we disburse money we expect to get it back plus a bit more.  That &ldquo;bit more&rdquo; is the expected investment return, which will vary according to the risk involved in each investment proposition and this risk-adjusted return should be comparable with other opportunities available to investors.  If that definition is met, we can say that it is a commercial investment. <br\/>One of the key advantages of the ISIF will be its ability to attract co-investment from domestic and international third parties, such as the China Investment Corporation, CIC, with whom the NPRF has recently co-invested.  These investors will only put their money to work alongside ours if they have confidence that investments are made on a commercial basis.  Not every investment will have the same expected return, risk profile or timeframe but they must all pass the commerciality test of risk-adjusted return.<br\/>This commercial requirement imposes a direct discipline on our consideration of opportunities.  However, whenever we make an investment, the fact that we are making a financial return and getting the original investment back means that the accompanying economic impact benefits are, in a sense, free.  This would not be the case if we were just spending money from a pot of funds, in which case the State&rsquo;s resources, once spent, have been depleted.  In our case, we expect to get the money we expend back with a bit more.<br\/>In seeking economic impact, one of our key criteria will be the &ldquo;additionality&rdquo; of the economic impact that results from our investment.  That is an important word to bear in mind.  It would not be an efficient use of our resources if the resulting impact would have happened anyway &ndash; this is referred to as &ldquo;deadweight&quot;, where somebody else would have made the investment if we did not do it.  Where the purely domestic-focused sectors are concerned, any economic impact would be lower if we produced gains in one sector at the expense of other players in the domestic economy; this is referred to as &ldquo;displacement&rdquo;.  For example, investing in a new hairdressing business, which might be a very good investment proposition, would quite likely mean that an existing hairdressing business nearby would suffer if our business did well and there would be limited incremental aggregate economic activity arising as a result of an investment of that nature.  Avoiding deadweight and displacement has been a central element of Government policy for quite some time and we will apply those principles in the investment strategy for the ISIF. <br\/>In recent months, the NTMA, in consultation with the Department of Finance and a number of other Departments and agencies, has been developing an economic impact framework for the ISIF which will help it identify target areas for investment which have higher potential economic and employment impact, and we would expect these areas of higher potential to make up the lion&rsquo;s share &ndash; approximately 80% &ndash; of the new portfolio.  Some of the sectors with the lowest levels of deadweight and displacement and, therefore, the highest levels of additionality would be those involved in exports, manufacturing, and internationally-traded services.  However, there is also some room, perhaps 15% to 20% of the portfolio, for investments with a lower economic impact on the grounds that they have important short-term benefits associated with assisting and accelerating normalisation of capital markets in Ireland.  The capital markets have, obviously, struggled as a result or as a consequence of the financial crisis. <br\/>At this stage it is envisaged that the ISIF will include investments in infrastructure, public private partnerships, SMEs, venture capital and private equity.  These are broad categories and we can go into more specifics, as necessary, later on.  Deployment of the ISIF&rsquo;s &euro;6.8 billion will take at least three to four years, depending on the opportunities available, and the future shape of the ISIF portfolio will only be clearer over time as these investment opportunities materialise. <br\/>It is expected that the ISIF portfolio will involve a combination of investment through funds, such as the SME funds in which we have invested recently, which we will discuss later, and direct investment such as our participation in recent PPP projects.  An important element of the ISIF strategy will be, where possible, to act as a cornerstone investor, thereby acting as a catalyst for additional third party investors to participate.  This will significantly increase the economic impact that can be achieved with the ISIF&rsquo;s finite resources. <br\/>Due to uncertainty regarding the nature of opportunities that may emerge or will be developed, it is not clear at this stage what will be the nature and shape of the ISIF's ultimate investment portfolio or the quantum of co-investment that can be achieved.  There will also be a time lag between the ISIF commitment of capital and when money is drawn down.  Therefore, it is not feasible at this stage to estimate in advance what the economic activity and employment impacts might be.  In the interim, we are developing our capabilities for collating and analysing data to measure and report on economic impact on an ex-post basis, that is, after the investment has been made. This will require a completely new set of data to be reported on by funds and the underlying companies who are used to reporting financial information to their investors but our mandate will also require them to report economic impact metrics.  We expect to be able to publish a preliminary assessment of the economic impact of the investments made to date in Ireland during the second quarter of this year. <br\/>Turning specifically to the SME sector, in January 2013 the NPRF Commission announced investment commitments to three new long-term funds that will provide &euro;850 million of equity, credit and restructuring or recovery investment for Irish SMEs and mid-sized corporates.<\/p> <p>The NPRF played a significant role in the development of these funds and was a cornerstone investor in each, alongside investment from third party investors.  The NPRF has committed &euro;375 million across the following three funds: a &euro;125 million to &euro;300 million equity fund focusing on healthy businesses seeking to grow, including those with over-leveraged balance sheets, which is managed by Carlyle Cardinal Ireland; a &euro;50 million to &euro;100 million turnaround equity fund focusing on under-performing businesses which are at or close to the point of insolvency but have the potential for financial and operational restructuring, which is being managed by Better Capital; and a &euro;200 million to &euro;450 million credit fund focused on originating and acquiring loans to larger SMEs and mid-size companies, which is being managed by BlueBay Asset Management.<\/p><p> In addition to these three funds, in June 2012 the NPRF announced a collaboration with Silicon Valley Bank which will make $100 million of new lending commitments available to fast-growing Irish technology, life science, clean tech, private equity and venture capital businesses.  In January 2014, the NPRF announced the establishment of the China Ireland Technology Growth Capital Fund, capitalised at $100 million with equal commitments from the NPRF and China Investment Corporation, which is China's sovereign wealth fund.  The fund&rsquo;s strategy will be to make minority equity investments in fast-growing technology companies and Irish companies that have a substantial presence or strategic interest in China and in Chinese companies that have a substantial presence or strategic interest in establishing a presence in Ireland, most likely as a gateway into the broader European market.<\/p><p> Since these funds were signed, each manager has set up a Dublin office, recruited senior team members, integrated the Irish platform within their wider international business and begun to develop local market awareness of their platforms and investment offerings.  These activities have positioned the managers as important new players in the Irish market and as alternative sources of funding to Irish businesses.  By its nature, the establishment of a new business activity and capability takes some time but the managers have generated significant deal flow to date.  Not every opportunity that is considered results in an investment.  Often an opportunity may prove to be unsuitable or it may be that our manager is unable to bring an attractive opportunity to a successful conclusion for various, typically negotiation, reasons.  However, across the five different managers, more than 400 investment opportunities have been reviewed.  Three of the managers have been in operation for all of 2013, one since mid-2013 and the other since early 2014.  There were 400 investment opportunities over that period, and 45 terms sheets, which is a detailed proposal for a transaction, have been issued, resulting in 131 transactions completed to date.<\/p><p> The NTMA is currently exploring additional SME fund opportunities that could complement those already in place, with the objective that the eventual suite of funds would have the capacity to invest across the full spectrum of SME financing needs, including the smaller end of the range where, because of higher operations costs, it may be more difficult to establish the commercial case.  Additionally, the NPRF has committed &euro;125 million to the Innovation Fund Ireland programme, a Government initiative in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland to attract leading international venture capital fund managers to Ireland, which has seen some venture capital firms, typically from the US, enter the Irish market.<\/p><p> One of the most salient features of the Irish SME sector is that it relies disproportionately on bank credit as a source of finance.  In our view, the solution to excessive corporate debt levels is not necessarily more debt but greater use of other financing means such as equity, where the ISIF can particularly make a difference.  Its flexibility to invest up and down the capital structure and over longer time periods means it can provide alternative funding options to complement those provided by traditional banking.  Nevertheless, the wider backdrop is a complicated one.  Banks and the economy generally, including SMEs, are still in the process of deleveraging, and while this is under way, it will inevitably have a dampening effect on SMEs' appetite for growth financing.  The ISIF is not, therefore, on its own sufficient to address the problem but it is an integral part of the overall solution and recovery of the Irish economy.  In this regard, the NPRF-ISIF works closely with Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and relevant Government Departments.<\/p><p> That is a summary of where we are now.  I would like to make a couple of additional concluding points.  First and foremost, I must emphasise that the ISIF philosophy is that of a commercial investor, but with an additional objective of contributing to economic activity.  Second, investment is different from spending, and economic impact needs to be considered in that light.  Third, the ISIF is only part of the overall solution but an important one, and the NTMA looks forward to building on the progress we have made to date.  The ISIF may not formally exist yet but it is very much open for business.  We have been developing a transaction pipeline, and along with our external investment partners, we are open to investment proposals and ideas and would encourage committee members, as we have done with the wider business community, to approach us in that regard.<\/p><p> I hope my opening remarks have given the committee a good understanding of our role and our work to date and can serve as the basis for some further discussion today.  I appreciate members' time and look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014040800003#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene O'Callaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396962300,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Callaghan for his informative presentation, which has given us all a good update on how the NPRF-ISIF works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014040800005#E00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1396962300,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Callaghan's presentation was very impressive and interesting.

If we invest in an SME fund, we would have agreed with the manager of the fund on the overall return.  We would work that through in terms of the expected return from the underlying assets minus the cost of managing and so on.  There is a second level beyond that which is portfolio level.  The draft legislation, which it is hoped will be published shortly, will require the ISIF at a portfolio level to seek a return above the cost of Government debt.  Clearly, an alternative use of these resources for the Exchequer is to take the cash and pay down Government debt.  How much we would look, at portfolio level, to exceed the cost of Government debt will be addressed in detail in our business plan, which, as I said earlier, is currently being developed.  We could exceed it by 1%, 2% or 4%.  If the cost of Government debt is, say, 3% or 4%, we will have to work out the expected return.  The calibration of that target depends in turn on how much debt investment as compared with how much equity investment we expect to see in the fund.  That target will probably iterate as the opportunities become a bit clearer.<\/p><p>  The Senator's second question was around the discussion of deadweight and displacement.  These are phrases used by economists.  They are economic terms which are not necessarily commonly used every day.<\/p> <p>We have had to come to an understanding of these terms as well.  Dead weight refers to an investment that would happen without the intervention of the National Treasury Management Agency.  There is no additional economic impact to be obtained when the investment would have happened on its own without our involvement.  As it will happen anyway, the economic impact will be achieved.  There is no point in using the finite resources of the fund to help achieve an economic impact that could be achieved elsewhere.  Let me give an example.  Initially the ISIF was a potential participant in the financing of a PPP motorway project.  It turned out there was more than sufficient demand from the marketplace to participate and provide the funding for the project.  Our involvement was not required.  We avoided an accusation of deadweight by not participating when we were not needed.<\/p><p> Displacement is more tricky.  Our mandate is primarily to support economic activity in Ireland.  Let me give an example.  Economic activity happens when people go and have their hair cut.  If we invest in a good hairdresser as opposed to the existing hairdresser who is in business down the street, the number of clients who will have haircuts will be roughly the same.  Our mandate is to try to assist additional economic activity to take place.  If we invest in a business that is successful but only displaces another business, that does not create new economic activity.  There will need to be a case by case analysis because even in sectors such as hairdressing by virtue of providing very high quality product or service, some businesses can stimulate new economic activity and increase spending that otherwise would not have taken place.  That is a much more fine tuned consideration.  We need to consider each investment proposition in the context of whether it adds incremental economic activity or displace existing activity.<\/p><p> The phrase \"term sheet\" is investment market jargon and is the basis upon which a transaction proposal would be put forward and discussed between an investor and an investee company, in the case of a borrower looking for equity.  The term sheet would set out for discussion the principle proposed, terms and conditions, the type of investment - whether equity or debt, the timeframe, the rate, the covenants or terms and conditions that might be attaching and the key commercial considerations.  The commercial and business issues would have been dealt with at the term sheet stage.  Normally when a detailed term sheet is agreed between the parties, the legal documentation process would follow, unless title or other legal issues have been unearthed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014040800005#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene O'Callaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396962900,"counter":96,"content":"<p>To be involved in this process what is the business background of the team, do they come from banking, finance or economics?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014040800006#F00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396962900,"counter":97,"content":"<p>The team members have a varied background, in a broad sense they are investment managers, so they have all managed assets across all asset classes, equities and bonds, private equity, real estate and so on.

Within our team we do not have anybody with pure economics, but we have supplemented our resource on two fronts, by working with the various Department and agencies and with external consultant to help us develop an economic impact framework.  This was an economics oriented activity with a high level of economics expertise.  Our role will be to apply the framework that is being developed with very strong economic credentials.

I would have though the National Pensions Reserve Fund, could have had a major role to play at the start of the crisis, but unfortunately the funding of the NPRF was used for the banks.  I would have been considering what the former US President Roosevelt operated during the New Deal programme to get people back to work and using the fund for similar initiatives.  I am pleased to see the change in thinking so that the fund is being partially used for this purpose.  Does it impact on the national balance sheet that some of the funding is being used to invest in infrastructure, companies or private investors?

The National Pensions Reserve Fund or the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, is a commercial investor and expects to make a return from all of its investments.  The EUROSTAT treatment is off-balance sheet.  There is no spending or depletion of State resources arising from the activities of the NPRF or the ISIF.  Our activities up to now have been and will continue to be off-balance sheet in a sense that there is no increase to the deficit or the national debt arising from our activities.  One of the proposed clauses in the new legislation that is currently being drafted is specifically to make that point, that we should endeavour to structure the activities so that they would not have a detrimental effect on the State's finances.<\/p><p>  That point links with the Deputy's second question on PPP projects.  The PPP projects are off-balance sheet and they do not add to the Government debt, purely because there must be more than 50% of private sector involvement in PPP projects in order for them to qualify as a PPP.  Government or Government entities can only contribute up to 50% of the value of PPP projects, the other 50% must come from private sources.  There is a genuine sharing of risk between the private sector and the public sector and EUROSTAT is happy because these are well developed rules that EUROSTAT oversees in terms of its auditing of Government accounting.<\/p> <p>What that means is that for any PPPs in which the ISIF might be involved, its investment would need to be less than 50% of the total value and the remainder of the balance of more than 50% would need to come from third parties.  Should there be any financing gaps in the financing of PPP projects or proposed PPP projects that would meet the cost-benefit criteria the Deputy has described, we would be ready and willing to participate in the projects in order to help bridge those gaps and allow the transactions to happen.  We have done this in the case of a couple of PPPs.  There was a schools bundle project in late 2012 and the N11 project, which was signed in the second quarter of 2013, in which the NPRF was involved in making a contribution as part of the overall transaction structure which enabled those projects to happen, and without us those projects would not have happened.  We participated on a commercial basis to enable that to happen.  That was all positive.<\/p><p> Where we see the bigger opportunity in the PPP market going forward is possibly more in the smaller PPPs rather than the larger ones.  The larger PPPs typically have large international contractors and their large international financiers who are only interested in playing if they can write large cheques in particular projects.  The larger ones and the one I have described that is closing shortly is a larger roads project where our money was not needed, but we would certainly see potential under the Government's stimulus package programme where there is a programme of PPP projects.  Certainly, on the smaller to medium-sized projects there is every possibility that there will be financing gaps in those and we would certainly be very interested in participating in the projects where such gaps might exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014040800006#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene O'Callaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396963500,"counter":101,"content":"<p>What is regarded as a small to medium project?

We meet many international investors as part of our activities and it is clear they are interested in investing in Ireland.  They are aware we have been through a financial crisis and they perceive that the economy has stabilised, is beginning to be ready for a pick-up and is a good investment opportunity.  Part of our difficulty is that many of these are large investment funds and, as Mr. Nick Ashmore said in respect of the PPP projects, they are only interested in writing large cheques and the Irish economy is quite small.  If someone wants to write a cheque for a minimum of &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million, it can be difficult to find the opportunity for them to do that, particularly in a single transaction.  At investor level, investors are in the business of anticipating the future - that is the essence of investment - and there is a high level of confidence.

First is their own sense of their financial capabilities and their instability of operation and second is their sense of opportunity.  Is there an opportunity that is well defined and well understood on which one can take a risk and be confident of making a return by borrowing or taking out more equity to make an investment?  There is still a sizeable cohort of businesses suffering the hangover of the boom in terms of exposure to real estate and real estate investments they may have taken on.  We are aware that banks are working their way through resolving those books and trying to stabilise their situations as quickly as they can, and I think they are substantially through that process now.

On that front it is starting to improve.  We also look closely at the quarterly SME lending surveys in which the Department of Finance engages.  They show a pick-up in demand for finance by SMEs.  I think that reflects both of those sets of changing conditions.<\/p><p>  To elaborate just a little, we are tracking within our own operation - this is a mix of direct investment ideas but also of fund investment ideas - more than 60 opportunities which are in the pipeline.<\/p> <p>Approximately two thirds of these are what we call radar opportunities, which are opportunities we are only starting to understand and develop.  We run economic analysis on these opportunities so that we can see what type of economic impact they would have.  There are approximately 25 different stages to our due diligence, legal review and approval process.  We have to take these opportunities to the Commission in the first instance and, ultimately, once the legislation has been amended, to the new ISIF governance structure.  <\/p><p> I hope that provides members with an idea of the volume of opportunities we are seeing.  Many of those are funds which will go on to make ten to 30 investments themselves.  Not all of them will work because not all of them are good ideas.  Some are good ideas and others are less good.

In terms of an inbound approach, an offer comes to us.  Teams hear about the opportunity to raise funds from us and approach us directly or through contacts.  This is a highly networked environment.  It takes little to get a contact to introduce an idea to us.  We find this happens on a regular basis.  We have been developing intermediary relationships over the past couple of years, culminating in the market engagement event which took place last month.  We try to be as accessible as possible.  The degree to which we can do this is a reflection of the team.<\/p><p>  Another approach involves our identifying an opportunity, to which we take a much more aggressive outbound approach.  The BlueBay Assessment Management fund, Carlyle Cardinal Fund and Better Capital Fund are all results of a proactive process by ourselves identifying a gap in the market, sourcing a manager and encouraging the making of a proposal to us, which we then run through our process.  Once we have a firm proposal, we conduct our own due diligence and do our own referencing.  We also analyse the financial models and risks, potential pitfalls and any legislative requirements, etc.  We then review the proposal and create formal investment proposal papers before taking those to the Commission for approval.  Once we have approval from the Commission, we then move to a legal and taxation due diligence process where we finalise the agreements and move to close.  The fund is then up and running and committed.<\/p><p>  In regard to direct investment, we have seen few of these to date.  However, they are starting to come in.  To engage on a direct investment, we need a substantial investment opportunity.  Our minimum investment size to date has been approximately &euro;5 million to &euro;10 million.  For a fund commitment, it would need to be &euro;15 million and above.  For a direct investment it would be higher than that.  If it is not higher, it is quite likely that we would steer that opportunity to one of our funds, if there is one in place.  If it is a generalised private equity opportunity, which is a &euro;20 million investment, we would steer that to Carlyle Cardinal or other players in the market.  If it is a distressed business of any scale, we would steer it to Better Capital and if it is a business seeking a loan of between &euro;5 million and &euro;45 million over five or six years, then it is ideally suited for BlueBay.  We try to complement rather than compete with these managers because they too are bringing other funds to play.  We have a small team and they provide us with a great deal of leverage.  They will also run similar investment processes and will have their teams review proposals and carry out their own due diligence.

We are used to a traditional approach to infrastructure, which is typically a single track approach, where all water is treated, pumped to the consumer and then wastewater is treated on-site or collectively, and then discharged.  That is the conventional approach.  Innovations and the discussion to date have focused on supplier-led issues, such as network leakage, treatment optimisation and so on.  We would like to discuss a complementary approach rather than an alternative.<\/p><p>  The current situation in respect of wastewater, particularly with the establishment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann, is almost analogous to the waste management issue of ten or 15 years ago.  If we were to look at water as a value chain, and apply the same concepts we have developed through waste management, we might possibly look at a zero waste approach.  Rather than looking at the single track, we would look at a number of values along the way.  For the benefit of the committee, I will use the \"reduce, reuse, recycle, disposal\" slogan.  I will not call it plagiarism as we are only borrowing it and not claiming it.  The first layer is obviously water efficiency and demand management, on which there has been much focus, and rightly so.  If we were to look at it as a value chain, then issues arise such as reusing water on site and rainwater harvesting, which we will examine later in more detail.  Further down the chain we find recycling before discharge through natural wastewater treatment systems, and finally we have disposal through sustainable urban drainage systems or water sustainable design.  We are looking on it as a value chain and valuing each element of that chain, for both consumer and supplier.  That is the context which we would like to tease out a bit.<\/p><p>  From our studies and from other studies, an average person would use 150 litres per day.

Looking at the value chain, the most important issue is innovative thinking that accepts there is an alternative approach that can be part of a coherent Government and community development policy.  To do that, we need sustainable and resilient technologies and innovations.  There are opportunities in this regard, particularly for job creation, reskilling and creating an industry similar to technologies within the green area.

It is well-developed internationally that the focus is going to be on designing water in rather than water out.  While that may seem like a catchphrase, our approach has always been to design developments to get rid of the water as quickly as possible.

First, we think the way to bring this forward on a viable strategy is to look at working pilot schemes, best international practice and then at developing that through a series of new build and retrofit with the purpose of evaluating exactly the cost benefits to the consumer.  There is significant potential to reduce the cost to the consumer, in particular with the onset of water charges and so on.  There is also a cost benefit to the producer.  We should also look at the barriers and incentives that are required and we need to link that to vocational training to produce a set of guidelines and technical standards.

There is no doubt but that we must move towards conserving water.  It has been frustrating for those on the local authority to try to get measures included in the development plan, for example, setting out standards for new builds and so on.  It is almost easier to put standards in place for new builds rather the retrofitting  of older buildings.<\/p><p>  Irish Water, Uisce &Eacute;ireann will be responsible for water services.  Have Mr. McCarton or Dr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;g&aacute;in put their ideas to Irish Water?  Irish Water, Uisce &Eacute;ireann is far more likely to be the body setting the standards for the local authorities, which the authorities must implement.  Have they made suggestion on the planning guidelines or areas that take the idea to the practical, or are they looking at issues from the engineering perspective?<\/p><p>  I wish to raise question on the domestic installation in County Carlow, as shown in the chart provided.  Am I correct that an additional tank has been installed for rainwater and that as well as plumbing from the mains there is also another plumbing system down through the house?  Would the delegates have a prototype for this work?  It will be essential to have an incentive scheme for the retrofitting, if it is to happen on a large scale.  <\/p><p>  Water quality is critical.  If water is of a poor standard, it must be treated.  Chemicals are used in water treatment plants.  Sometimes people experience a reaction to some of the chemicals.  I frequently hear complaints about the chemicals in the water, in cases when people are taking showers.  Is it possible that rainwater could be of a higher standard than some of the water that has been treated with chemicals, which in some cases are fairly sinister?  Treated water is heavily chlorinated and can be very unappetising.  Water treatment can be managed well where there is treatment along a system as opposed to close to the outlet.<\/p><p>  I presume the waste water and storm water go into the combined sewer system but that in new builds it may be possible to have storm water absorbed by a new system.  The witnesses showed some examples of greenery absorbing storm water but there has been a difficulty with maintenance.  I often wonder why we have green spaces, covered in weeds up to 4 ft high because nobody maintains the space beside a road, which obstructs vehicles.  It would be useful if there was a type of greenery that would not cause that problem.

We are particularly conscious of the constraints on local authorities, in particular that the parks departments are under pressure.  The picture in our presentation was from Philadelphia and it took between ten and 15 years to get to that point.  The core innovation was the partnership with community.  Within the local authority structure in Philadelphia they created a number of catchment areas and each community were part of the design and maintenance theme for that.  Deputy Murphy is correct that it requires a certain element of transfer of responsibility.  This project shows one way of overcoming maintenance issues and is linked to the combined sewer.  The Deputy questioned the nature of the surface water drainage system and she is correct that in Dublin, in particular, we have a number of combined sewers and we have a lot of sewers at the receiving of rivers.  The consequences are felt increasingly with the effects of climate change.<\/p> <p> In response to the Deputy's question, there are possibilities if we look at the concept of on-site treatment.  In the cases of a number of catchments around Dublin, we could look at where the storm water is emanating from.  I suggest that rather than treating it at the end of the system or discharging it into the Liffey, which is what happens to most of it at present, we should look at point source treatment.  I can give the Deputy a simple answer without getting into a great deal of detail.  There are possibilities in this regard.<\/p><p> The Deputy was quite right in what she said about the domestic rainwater harvesting system.  A lack of innovation and high costs have been among the big barriers in this respect in Ireland - and in the UK, to a certain extent - in the cases of both new-builds and retrofits.  We have undertaken a number of studies to look at how innovations can take place.  Indeed, we have installed one or two systems in private houses.  We are involved in a project at Carrowholly national school near Westport.  We have some publications on that project.  Storage accounts for approximately 50% of rainwater harvesting costs if it is properly designed.  Storage is way over-designed at present, assuming these systems are being used to supply toilet demands only.  A typical tank size in some of our studies would be 1 cu. m, which would be approximately the same size as an oil tank.  By contrast, off-the-shelf systems use tanks that are 9 or 10 cu. m.  There is a need for innovation in the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014040800005#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam McCarton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396964400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>One of the points we are trying to make in proposing one of these pilot projects is that innovation should lead to more installations, which should lead in turn to adaptions which reduce the price.

We believe the work that is being done to bring about innovations in this regard should lead to price reductions and to streamlining.  As Mr. McCarton said, if there is a focus on non-potable uses, such as toilets, the sizes that would be needed would differ significantly from the sizes that would needed for other purposes.

We have found that the quality of captured rainwater, for the purposes of domestic systems, is quite high.  It depends on the operation, maintenance and design of the system in question.  The qualifier is that the tank needs to be sealed or closed.  I do not know whether the Deputy noticed that the six months of results were peaking up and down.

It would be perfectly logical to have a second tank that would be supplemented from the mains during dry periods.<\/p><p>  When I made a submission during the establishment of Irish Water, I suggested that all new and replacement toilet cisterns should be dual-flush models.  We should start doing that from a certain date, such as 1 January 2015.  What is the view of the witnesses on that?  There is a huge difference between the amount of water used in a dual-flush toilet and the amount of water used in an ordinary flush toilet.  I listened to the reply that was given to Deputy Murphy's question about the cost of harvesting or capturing water.  I am asking about two separate things which are compatible with each other - the use for dual-flush toilets and the use of a second header tank, as in the Carlow project.  What would it take for such an approach to be pursued?  Do the witnesses believe a grant should be made available for these purposes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014040800006#L02000","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396964400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's point that within the culture of Ireland - indeed, this committee is responsible for culture - dry toilets have a particular association with poverty and with smells.

Deputy Stanley is quite correct about dual-flush toilets.  Water efficiency and management would be the first layer in our permit.  It is looking at it as a coherent whole.  It involves not taking any one item in isolation but trying to look at a strategy where each one has a value starting with the simplest, which is water efficiency measures.  These measures can have a significant effect on their own.<\/p><p>  I forgot to address the cost of the harvesting system, which was also mentioned by Deputy Stanley.  The typical cost for the off-the-shelf one that we used in Currow was about &euro;6,500 or &euro;7,000 and about another &euro;2,000 for insulation.  I will give a very practical example of the innovations.  One I installed recently cost less than &euro;1,000.  That is simply because, as I mentioned earlier to the Deputy, there has been no innovation in technology.  We have published a number of studies looking at tank sizes.  Tank sizes are very over-designed for what we want to use the water for.  Pumps are quite over-designed.  There are significant cost savings.  It is strongly recommended that two working pilots be looked at in respect of cost savings to the supplier and producer and the innovations that are required.  We feel strongly that the costs of the system for a new build could easily be brought down to less than &euro;1,500.  There are also innovations within retrofit.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the header tank.  We did not want to go into too much detail in the introduction but there was only one possibility with the system the Deputy saw up there.  One of the systems I have put in has no header tank in the attic so there are possibilities where one pumps directly to the point of use.  There are pros and cons associated with that.  The advantage of having a header tank is that if there is electricity failure, one still has flushable water from the gravity system.  Issues can arise if it is pumped and the pump fails or there is an electrical failure so there are pros and cons associated with it.  The Deputy is quite right.  Current costs for systems are prohibitive in terms of any real viable strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014040800007#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam McCarton"},{"type":"speech","time":1396965000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Is the Dublin one legally enforceable?

A reed bed has been fitted in Clonaslee, County Laois.  It was opened by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government about six months ago and is working very efficiently.  Something needs to be done in a number of other villages in Laois.  There are 18 houses in the village of Emo which are served by what is really a large septic tank.  We have an unusual settlement pattern in that we have many very small villages.  We have many small villages with many small parts because there is one piece up here, another down there and somebody else got a piece half a mile away in another direction.  We do not have that kind of concentrated settlement in villages that one would see in some other European countries, particularly Germany.

I will go through that invitation quickly, then respond to any specific topic that the committee wants to discuss.<\/p> <p> I would like to say a few words about Ulster Bank at the outset.  We are the No. 3 bank in the Republic of Ireland and the No. 1 bank in Northern Ireland.  We are building a substantial market share in a number of key areas, including mortgages.  Our clearly defined strategy is based on building a really good bank for our customers and addressing our legacy issues.  Our strategy is working.  We expect to return to profitability this year.  Our customer focus is evident in our approach to the resolution of mortgage arrears.  We provide transparent and equitable solutions that are tailored to the individual customer's circumstances.  Our focus is equally evident in our approach to existing or new customers who are looking to buy or move.<\/p><p> During our last appearance at this committee, we set out our approach to assisting mortgage customers who are in arrears.  We recognised the need to comply with regulatory targets.  We explained that we were focusing on getting appropriate solutions in place for our customers, based on what is affordable after reasonable living expenses are taken into account.  We have invested in people and systems.  The range of supportive, fair and affordable solutions that we have developed enable the vast majority of customers who engage with us to remain in their homes.  I am happy to report that our customer-based approach is working.  Over 2,500 customers have moved out of arrears since we last met.  Our innovative \"economic concession\" product continues to be the most popular structural solution for our customers.  It features a discounted interest rate of as low as 0.5% over varying durations of up to seven years.  The particular rate and duration are based on what the customer can afford.  We also offer other options, including split mortgages, capitalisations and term extensions.<\/p><p> As we have told the committee previously, our starting point on this matter remains that there is a cost to living in a home and that customers need to engage with us.  We recognise our responsibility to work with them to find the most effective solution that allows them to remain in their home where possible.  Recent research on the Ulster Bank mortgage book shows that paying the mortgage is more affordable than paying the equivalent rent in the same community, particularly when more progressive restructuring methods are considered.  This requires engagement, however.<\/p><p> Ulster Bank does not offer debt write-off.  Writing down arbitrary amounts of debt for a small number of people while they remain in their home is not something we will do.  We do not believe that it is an appropriate solution as it raises as many questions as it purports to resolve.  We believe the write-down or write-off of debt is an unhelpful distraction that is likely to create issues around moral hazard, transparency and fair outcomes for customers.  In our view, the focus should be on affordability and offering transparent solutions that can be made available to all mortgage arrears customers.<\/p><p> The figures we have provided to the committee indicate that we have exceeded our regulatory targets and that the number of our customers in mortgage arrears of 90 days or more has fallen every month since March 2013.  This trend is not seen elsewhere in the market.  We have provided the committee with additional information that shows our approach over the full mortgage arrears book, including early intervention which we believe is essential in addressing the mortgage arrears issue.  This information establishes beyond doubt the success of our approach and the value of early engagement.<\/p><p> Since last summer, the number of customers in arrears who have not engaged with us and are not making any contribution to their mortgage has reduced significantly from 35% to 14%.  This number is still unacceptably high.  It is not fair to all other people who pay their mortgage that someone makes no contribution to the cost of their accommodation.  We have no choice other than to pursue these customers through the legal route.  Having said that, the primary intent of legal action is to encourage meaningful re-engagement so we can help.  Any customer can take themselves out of the legal process at any stage by meaningfully re-engaging.  We are pleased to advise the committee that almost half of our customers entering the legal process have re-engaged with us.  Unfortunately, that means the same number are not engaging despite the seriousness of the situation.<\/p><p> We expect to see a continued substantial decrease in Ulster Bank arrears.  We also expect to see a continued increase in the overall number of mortgages where a borrower is more than two years in arrears.  This is not because the banks are slow to offer solutions to these customers, but because these customers are refusing to engage and legal action appears to be the only option.  The longer it takes to move a case through the legal process, the longer these cases will sit in the reported serious arrears numbers.  I acknowledge that progress has been facilitated by addressing the legal and administrative obstacles to resolving the mortgage arrears problem, for example by revisiting the Dunne judgment and revising the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  It would be remiss of me not to point out that real problems continue to impede the process.  It can take more than two years to process a repossession case through the courts.  This timescale seems to be increasing as the cases previously blocked by the Dunne ruling enter the system.<\/p><p> I would like to make a few comments on the personal insolvency arrangements.  We have argued from the outset that we are dealing with a consumer debt issue, rather than a mortgage arrears issue alone.  In these circumstances, the debt relief and debt settlement elements of the insolvency arrangement are a useful addition to the process, as they enable borrowers to put their debt burden on a more sustainable footing.  The banks, which hold two thirds on the unsecured debt in the market, will deprioritise these unsecured loans so that customers can focus on paying their mortgages.  We welcome the recent comments from Goodbody Stockbrokers, which confirmed the view unsecured debt is just that - unsecured.  I note that, to date, Ulster Bank has not vetoed any protective certificate proposal put forward by a personal insolvency practitioner.<\/p><p> I will conclude on a positive note.  The mortgage market is showing signs of improvement.  We are well positioned to support the recovery.  We are growing and actively gaining overall market share in key segments, particularly in the residential mortgage market.  Our mortgage lending for 2013 has increased by 32%.  We now support 14% of the market.  We have close to &euro;500 million to lend into the mortgage market in the Republic this year.  We are approving eight out of every ten applications made to us.  We also recently introduced a number of tracker porting products to enable customers to move house.  I reiterate that Ulster Bank is committed to supporting the economy and building a really good bank for our customers.  While there is more to do, I believe we are on the right path.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040800003#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Brown","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396962600,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brown.

It will send shivers down the spine of many people to hear that despite the improvement in the number of people who are co-operating with the bank three in every ten, or 30%, of people in arrears of 90 days or more are now in the formal legal repossession zone.

Mr. Bell is putting forward the justification that many of these people have not engaged at all, and they have stopped making any repayments on their mortgages, but it is an incredibly high figure.  Would many of these people have had other offers of sustainable solutions from the bank thus far?  Or would this be the first offer as such?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040800007#O00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396964400,"counter":277,"content":"<p>No.  We tried not to consider legal action as an offer, as such.  It is more a consequence of a failure to take advantage of an offer.  It is absolutely not in our interest or our preference to go down the repossession route.  When we appeared before this committee previously we said that the mortgage arrears target regime had some extraordinarily swingeing penalties for banks that did not meet them.  As a consequence of that, it was always going to be inevitable that banks would do those things that allowed them to hit the targets.  The only incontrovertible way of hitting the targets in that early stage was by taking legal action because everything was subject to subsequent review by the Central Bank and its auditors.<\/p><p>  We commenced legal action in about 4,300 cases beyond the threatening letter.  That number has not changed since we last appeared before this committee.  We have increased by over 60% the number of long-term arrangements we have put in place with our customers.  We have now narrowed down to around 2,300 those customers that still are not in some kind of arrangement or meaningfully engaging with us.  We think that is making reasonable progress.  Alongside that we have taken 2,500 families out of serious arrears.  <\/p><p>  This is going to be a longer process because we effectively had a two-year hiatus where we could not do anything very much.  That was because under the CCMA, contact was restricted and under the Dunne ruling the threat of consequences had disappeared.  In a multi-debt environment, which is what Mr. Brown referred to as part of his opening remarks, this is not purely a mortgage issue - this is a personal indebtedness issue.  When credit card lenders, credit unions and unsecured lenders can continue to pressure customers to pay, but mortgage lenders cannot, it does create an uneven playing field.  I am afraid this is an element of catch-up as we try to get back to a normal position. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040800007#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Bell"},{"type":"speech","time":1396964400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>In light of what Mr. Bell has said, does the bank have individual cases on its books where it has ended up issuing a threatening legal letter or ended up taking them to court because of the pressure to meet certain targets as issued by the Central Bank?

All this has let this bubble move further down the pipe than we all might have liked.  Therefore, I am not saying that it is entirely down to the Central Bank, not at all.

Paragraph 7 of Mr. Brown's opening statement concerns the issue of writing off or writing down mortgage debt.  Some of Ulster Bank's competitors are now writing down and writing off debt.  I am interested in some of the language used and have three quick questions about it.  Mr. Brown said he does not write off debt.  Is that just mortgage debt?  In the second page he stated that the mortgage has to be seen as a priority over other unsecured loans.<\/p><p>  When Mr. Brown says that write-offs and write-downs are an unhelpful distraction, he is talking about AIB.  Is AIB's policy an unhelpful distraction because it is writing down and writing off debt?<\/p> <p>The representatives of the bank maintain that write-off is likely to create issues around moral hazard and fair outcomes for customers.  Are they really suggesting that it would be a problem for some of the bank's customers if the bank wrote off some of their debts?  How can the bank possibly justify that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040800007#O02800","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396965000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I will take those three questions.  We will postpone or write down non-mortgage debt to allow the customer to remain in his property to maximise what he can afford to allocate towards his mortgage.  Along with all the other the banks in Ireland we have agreed with the general principle that unsecured debt should be de-prioritised to enable the customer to focus on mortgage payments.  That has been agreed between all the principal banks due to appear before the committee as part of this session.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to our view on write-offs not being helpful.  We are not commenting on any particular institution but we believe that solutions must be effective.  This remains a major issue and involves many thousands of customers.  Spending too much time talking about solutions that can only really be applied to a small number of customers, numbering in the hundreds, does not really solve the problem.  It is something of a distraction from the real issue, which is how we help the tens of thousands of customers who are still struggling to get back onto a level playing field.<\/p><p>  There is a question for us around moral hazard.  I have no wish to personalise this in any way, shape or form.  Let us consider one example that received a reasonable amount of coverage in the press.  Let us suppose the mortgage is written down to what happens to be the indexed value of the property today.  We know that property prices will increase over time.  We know property prices have increased in Dublin by 12% or 13% in the past 12 months.  It is likely, therefore, that over the remaining term of the customer's mortgage the customer will receive a windfall gain at the gift of the State or the State and banks because the customer will have positive equity building up on a debt that was written down for no obvious reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040800008#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Bell"},{"type":"speech","time":1396965000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>That is reasonable and gets us back to negative equity and those other arguments.

If the mortgage situation is not affordable even then, we can put one of the arrangements about which we spoke earlier in place that will deem the mortgage affordable in the long run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040800011#S02800","nonspeaker":"Mr Jim Brown"},{"type":"speech","time":1396966800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>If I was a customer of the bank and in arrears on my mortgage, the other unsecured loans were written off and I would be able to meet my mortgage repayments because of the change of circumstances, would Ulster Bank write off my unsecured loans?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040800011#S02900","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396966800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Broadly, yes.

While the set of problems concerning those who took out mortgages to buy their own homes has been highlighted, the plight of tenants who pay rent and have a reasonable expectation of security of tenure has not been highlighted to any great extent over the past year or two.  They find that because their landlord has gone bust, receivers move in and tell them they must leave, in many cases at very short notice.  This presents a big problem, particularly for families with children.  In the current market, it is very difficult in many cases to obtain alternative accommodation.  What is the attitude of the delegation to this?  The delegates said they will let the leases run.  Leases will have expired in many cases.  Typically in the private rental sector, one gets a one-year lease in the first year and no lease at all after that.

I wish to pick up on something Deputy O'Donnell mentioned, the balance sheet repair that the institutions are undertaking.  The problem that has arisen for everybody across the markets, not just Ulster Bank, is due to the creation of credit by the abandonment of fractional reserving.  Ulster Bank is part of RBS Group and in 2008 RBS Group, if one ignored ABN AMRO, which had a good balance sheet, had loans-to-customer deposits ratios of 135%.  That is 45% above the safety level of 90% for prudential lending and responsible bank board operation.  Forty-five per cent as a proportion of 90% is 50%.  When Ulster Bank is in a sector of banks where the average loans-to-deposits ratio was 173%, with an abandonment over seven years of fractional reserving, absolutely reckless balance sheet construction and creating an asset price bubble with the credit that had been gathered through the banking system, that bank is responsible for 50% of the asset price fall of assets bought with funds provided by the bank.  That is a fact mathematically.  In the case of Bank of Ireland, it is 75% responsible and accountable for the asset price fall of the assets that were bought with funds loaned by Bank of Ireland to its customers.  It is really a breathless, astonishing arrogance on the part of the sector to seek to collect 100% of the loans that created a mirage.  It was a bubble of air to which the customers are now long-term mortgage slaves.<\/p><p>  In fact, let us consider the etymology of the word \"mortgage\".  \"Mort\" means death.  Normally it was death of the asset while the borrower was repaying the money so that the asset became his or hers at the end of the 25 years.  Now, because of those seven years of profligate and absolutely malfeasant lending by the boards of banks, the borrowers of that period find that they have no assets.  The only asset that they might have had after 25 years is likely never to be theirs.  The nonsense that is being peddled at the moment, that the property market is taking off, is absurd.  It is like saying that the stock market has gone up in value because 1% of the equity on the stock market has been traded at a temporarily high price.<\/p><p>  This is where we must get real.  I do not like the language and terms such as \"encourage meaningful re-engagement\".  Let us get real about this.  The bank had a breakdown in its computer systems for three or four months but there was no engagement, even with people who had deposits or credit balances in their accounts.  This is unfair.  I am not asking for heads or scalps, just for fairness.  A total of 15,000 customers of the bank are in deep distress, mental depression and even facing death.  It is wrong.  I am asking all the witnesses to put it to their boards that they really wrecked this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040800017#Y01200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1396970400,"counter":684,"content":"<p>The Deputy has about one minute left if he wishes to ask a question and I will afford the witnesses a chance to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040800017#Y01300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1396970400,"counter":685,"content":"<p>These are indisputable facts.

Valuations by so-called auctioneers and valuers in this country have been very wide of the embedded and true benchmark of the inverse yield value of a property.  As Mr. Brown said, people have to pay a rent for living no matter who owns the property.  If we take a four-bedroom semi-detached suburban house - in Stillorgan or Kilmacud, for example - the maximum rental value of which is &euro;2,000 per month or &euro;24,000 per year, a 7% yield will give a maximum value of &euro;360,000.  It is because of the very small volume on the market at this time that prices have been bid up.  As Mr. Ryan said, the volume of lending went down last year.  The public perception is that prices are going up, but it is not a sustainable increase because it is not related to the inverse of rental yields.

I look forward to receiving that information in the coming days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040800019#AA01000","speaker":"990"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1396971600,"counter":772,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 6.15 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 9 April 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
