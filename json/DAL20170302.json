One of the resources children traditionally had at school was guidance counselling.  Mental health issues, self-harm and suicide attempts have all increased in recent years.  Guidance counselling was introduced in schools around 1966, a signal time in second level education in this country, and it was made a legal requirement in the Education Act 1998.  Guidance counsellors provided appropriate guidance and support to students at second level and since that time the relationship has been mutually beneficial, meaningful and, above all, confidential.<\/p><p>The previous Government made a decision to cut and cull guidance counselling in the infamous budget of 2012.  This was a wrong and poorly thought-out decision which led in practice to a reduction of some 51% in the amount of guidance available.  What is worse, it hit disadvantaged students and disadvantaged schools even more.  In the confidence and supply agreement that Fianna F&aacute;il entered into with Fine Gael we put this as a priority and we wanted the restoration of guidance counselling on an ex-quota basis.  We saw the deficit and felt that it needed to be addressed.  I had a meeting with the Minister about this and my colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, had a meeting with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  My party leader also spoke to the Taoiseach about it because there has been a marked reluctance to deal with the issue, despite the fact that it was agreed between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in the confidence and supply agreement.<\/p><p>This week, the Department has issued a number of circulars relating to teaching posts, including provision relating to guidance counselling, but there is no provision for ex-quota guidance counselling.  That has come as a shock to people in the profession but it has also come as a considerable shock to my party, in light of the high priority we have put on this and the number of communications we have had since we agreed this in the confidence and supply agreement.  There is no attempt in the circulars to ring-fence guidance counselling and they simply reiterate the position of the 2012 circular that, &quot;Schools should consider how best to align the resource allocation with the objectives of the guidance plan.&quot;  There is no requirement for a guidance counsellor to be ex-quota.  Can the Minister clarify these latest circulars?  Will guidance counsellors be employed on an ex-quota basis or will schools be entitled to have an <i>&agrave;<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b><i>la carte<\/i>approach to guidance counselling, contrary to what was agreed in the confidence and supply agreement between these two parties?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200003#A00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1488456000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue, which goes to the very heart of making sure that resilience is built in the young people who come through our education system, in a world where there are increasing pressures on them.

To date we have restored 400, with 300 this September and another 100 next September.  The total restoration will amount to 600.<\/p><p>We are fully committed to that.  Not only that, we are also rolling out a well-being programme at junior cycle and committing significant resources to make that a reality.  We are increasing the service from the National Educational Psychological Service to support schools in the implementation of policies across the schools to ensure that they provide an environment where young people feel safe, respected, valued and their resilience is built.  We have specifically required in our disadvantage plan that disadvantaged schools have proper guidance support provided.  We are fully committed to that.<\/p> <p> We are also committed to ensuring that the resource of guidance counselling will be ring-fenced within schools and that it will deliver to targets.  We will be monitoring the performance of schools in ensuring that adequate support in guidance is provided in every school.  I have had a number of meetings about well-being and can say that there is huge energy within the schools, not only to restore guidance, but to build much deeper relationships with groups in the wider community to ensure that the environment within schools is the best possible for supporting young people who are vulnerable to pressures that would not have been in place when I was at school.  We are committed to this.  In addition, this year, we are providing for open hours so that there would be access to guidance support at a given time every week in every school, so that people could bring issues to someone who is professionally in a position to assist them.

There are some people who do not want guidance counselling to be provided on this basis in schools.  They want to be able to use a resource for other subjects, which are important, but we have said that guidance counselling is a key issue and must be done ex-quota.  The Minister's circulars allow schools to not ring-fence guidance and to provide the hours for other items if they do not value guidance in the same way that he purports to value it.

They will do so in the face of the determination of management and Government to burden workers with the financial responsibility for this crisis, which was created by Government policy and mismanagement.<\/p><p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister's Government are putting his privatisation agenda ahead of the needs of the citizens of this State.  The plan is the same here as it is with his approach to other vital services such as health, housing and education.  The steps are the same in every case - starve the service of investment, implement draconian cuts, foster disputes and inconvenience the public to the point of anger.  The model of public ownership is then blamed and the workers are penalised in order to create a false justification for privatisation.  The destruction of our public services is an inside job.  <\/p> <p> The Minister's Government and the Minister, Deputy Ross, are responsible for the shambles that exists in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, has shown a complete lack of leadership on this issue.  The Government is happy to sit on the sidelines and let the chaos unfold.  The Taoiseach said this week that both he and the Cabinet fully support the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the same Minister who acts as if his job description had been written by H.G. Wells - the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, the invisible man of Irish politics.  <\/p> <p> The Government's privatisation agenda is very clear, but the ordinary workers of Bus &Eacute;ireann see right through it, as do the people living in rural Ireland.  Bus &Eacute;ireann workers will not allow the Government, the Minister, Deputy Ross, or company management to destroy their livelihoods, dismantle the services they worked so hard to provide and then blame them for the mess that the Government created.  It is not an easy thing to vote for strike.  Sinn F&eacute;in commends those workers on their brave decision.  We understand the reasons for that decision.  We understand the inflammatory proposals that were put before the workers and we stand fully behind them as they prepare to stand on a picket line next Monday.<\/p> <p> The communities of rural Ireland know well by now that the Government is no friend of theirs.  The Minister's plan to destroy our public transport network further underlines the great isolation being imposed on people living in rural communities by the decisions taken by his party over the past six years.  They will now wonder how they will get to work, to hospital appointments or to visit family.  The message to rural Ireland is very clear.  The Government has abandoned rural Ireland.  <\/p> <p> My question is very simple.

The reason we are able to do that is because, in the past 12 months alone, we have seen 65,000 extra people back at work.  That has provided &euro;1 billion in additional resources for this House to allocate to public services.  We are doing that.<\/p>  <p>  In less than two weeks, 800,000 people will get a social welfare increase for the first time in eight years.  That includes carers, disabled people, unemployed people and sick people.  That is rebuilding our public services.  Some &euro;1.5 billion has been reinvested into our health service.  Some 250,000 more people are getting operations in our public hospitals now than there were four years ago because we are reinvesting.  There are problems because we have had a lost decade in public services, but we are now rebuilding that service.  In my area, 5,000 extra teachers and special needs assistants will, between this September and next, be going back into our schools to provide particularly for children with special needs or with disadvantage.  We are rebuilding in areas where damage has been done.  <\/p>  <p>  When we come to the issue of the public transport service, last year we provided a 21% increase in the subvention to Bus &Eacute;ireann and other public service obligation bodies.  This year, there will be another 11%.  That is a one third increase in the investment we are making in the delivery of public services.  There is a problem with Expressway.  This is an area where Dublin Bus has go to head to head with private competition.  It is losing money heavily in that regard and this is an issue at the heart of this industrial dispute.  The Deputy asked why the Minister does not intervene.  There has been a very long history in Ireland of Ministers not politicising industrial disputes.  We have very professional services in the Workplace Relations Commission that support the resolution of even the most intractable dispute. <\/p><p>Those are the professional services that should be used.  It is not by accident that we protect those services from political interference, because their very effectiveness depends on them not being undermined by politicians. <\/p> <p> This is a difficult area, but on every front we are doing what people are saying needs to be done.  We are increasing the subvention for public services, reconsidering the contract for social welfare customers and we are ensuring that the National Transport Authority will be available if a rural service that needs to be restored.  It will stand available to provide that on a new basis as a public service contract.<\/p> <p> This dispute centres on an area where, under law, subvention cannot be given to Expressway, which is competing head-to-head with private sector providers.  That is the law of the land, which the Minister is correctly observing.

In stark terms, that means that 13% of the total housing stock is vacant.  According to answers to parliamentary questions received by my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the group established to compile a register of vacant units and set out actions to bring them into use is due to report at the end of the first quarter of this year.  Work is progressing too slowly on this very important issue.  There seems to be a lack of understanding of the urgency of these matters.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, the previous Government put a record amount of money into housing, which the current Government has been able to increase, but it appears that there is a distinct lack of delivery.<\/p><p>Projects have been announced but little progress seems to be happening on the ground.

Instead of building homes, it appears that local authorities are buying properties, which does nothing to increase supply.<\/p> <p> Last August, the Labour Party proposed an eight point plan to tackle this specific issue of vacant houses.  This morning the Simon Community launched its own ten point plan.  Like the Labour Party, it calls for a vacant housing register that would see a real-time database with formal communication and data-sharing structures between relevant bodies.  Like the Labour Party, it believes that more needs to be done on the vacant site levy.  Sadly, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael combined to vote down a Labour Party Bill that would have achieved that last year.  Both my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, have called for more money to be allocated to the Housing Agency's vacant housing purchasing initiative.

This was not unknown to those other than the Simon Community.  The vacancy rate is 13% but it is only 6% in Dublin, so the area with the most acute pressure does not have the same high vacancy rate.  The Government's programme is very clear and a series of initiatives have been taken, including the buying back of vacant properties by the Housing Agency.  A target of 1,600 was set in that regard.

She probably hoped this would allow her to put the Garda controversies behind her but sadly that is not the case because the disclosures by Garda whistleblowers are only one aspect of the serious questions regarding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Minister is aware of five other pending statutory inquiries into Garda negligence and malpractice.  In 2002, we had the tragic death of Shane Tuohey after a night out.  The Garda investigation into Mr. Tuohey's death was flawed and his family was targeted.  Patrick Nugent, a 23 year old banqueting manager in Bunratty Castle, died horrifically after a function at which off duty garda&iacute; were in attendance.  The inquest into Mr. Nugent's death and internal Garda inquiries have led to further questions.  Another case involves 24 year old John Kelly from Tallaght who drowned in Dublin's docklands after screaming for 30 minutes while garda&iacute; stood back.  Another case is that of James Clancy, a man in his 80s, who was killed after being dragged along a road by a truck.  Documents subsequently went missing and the driver of the truck was never found.  In all of these cases, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has refused to engage with Kevin Winters, the legal counsel for those who are seeking information on the terms of reference of the inquiries and wish to ensure they are compliant with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the T&aacute;naiste has engaged with the Policing Authority, which is not an alternative to including victims in the process.  More important, why has the Policing Authority, which has the power to demand the convening of such inquiries, not done so?  The reason is that, despite all of the T&aacute;naiste's bleatings about dealing with reform and Garda oversight, these issues have not been addressed.  Unless she addresses the question as to who is guarding the garda&iacute;, these problems will continue.  <\/p>  <p>  Members of the Policing Authority were hand-picked by the Government and the authority was structured in a manner that would ensure it was subservient to government.  Its first test was the appointment of new assistant commissioners, for which there were 31 applicants.  On the date the Oireachtas signed off on the terms of reference for the inquiry into allegations of misconduct by the Garda Commissioner, we found out that the very same Commissioner had nominated herself to be on the selection board for the assistant commissioner positions.  Nobody on the Policing Authority or in government had any problem with this decision, about which we sought information and eventually received confirmation.  We then learned that the position had suddenly changed between Monday and Tuesday of this week and the Garda Commissioner would no longer be on the selection board because she was a bit busy.  She had, however, appointed her loyal sidekick, D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, an individual who is involved in a number of these cases, to the selection board.  This is an absolute joke.

We do not have proper oversight, and that is not only my view.  Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, the chairperson of GSOC, has demanded increased legislative powers supported by the justice committee precisely because we do not have proper oversight.  We do not have an independent Policing Authority.  A policing authority that sits still in the midst of the biggest crisis surrounding policing in our State and has no problem with the Garda Commissioner sitting on a selection board that will dictate the culture of the Force and senior appointments into the future is a big problem.  The fact that we do not have these bodies is precisely why we have six inquiries going on.  We will have six more, and six more again, unless the Government addresses the fundamental issue here.  That could have been addressed four years ago when Deputy Wallace brought forward legislation for a proper oversight independent policing authority.  What we recommended then was an independent board, greater scope around appointment of the Garda Commissioner, deputy Garda commissioner and assistant Garda commissioners, powers to remove same and a real role that would deliver proper and genuine accountability.

The one sentence contained in our Bill states that:<\/p><blockquote>Section 22 of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 is amended by the substitution of the following for subsection (2):&quot;(2) A person who is guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable to a fine of not more than &euro;1.00.&quot;.<\/blockquote><p>The reason I have included this is because I strongly believe and I think there is widespread evidence that most people in this country are not aware that a 14 year sentence is contained in the 2013 legislation and can be applied to a woman or a medical practitioner who assists her in respect of obtaining an abortion in this country.  That legislation also covers accessing the abortion pill.  There is increasing evidence that the abortion pill is being used on a daily basis by women across this State.  According the evidence relating to Internet use, about three women per day access the abortion pill.  Northern Ireland has similar legislation except that the sentence is not 14 years but a life sentence.  That is the maximum sentence you can receive.  Three women in Northern Ireland have been charged with accessing the abortion pill, one of whom was a mother of a 14 year old girl who found herself pregnant.  The woman accessed the pill for her daughter while the other two were charged for self-aborting.<\/p><p>My amendment Bill seeks to do something that is fundamental to justice and equality in this State.  This is to say that women should not be equated to criminals and be subject to the fear of a 14 year sentence because they tried to gain control over their fertility and lives.  Whatever Deputies' views on abortion are, the criminalisation and sentencing of women to a sentence of this magnitude is totally unconscionable and unacceptable.  Even after we get the result from the Citizens' Assembly and the potential for a referendum, whatever that may be, this sentence still remains on the Statute Book and can be used against women for asserting their right to something they can procure outside this State but not within it.  It is a very simple Bill that tries to change that sentence to a fine of &euro;1.  One might ask why am I bothering with a fine of &euro;1.<\/p><p>The reason I had to include a sort of peppercorn fine was that on the two different occasions we drafted a Bill to decriminalise the procuring of an abortion and to get rid of the 14 year sentence, the parliamentary legal advice was that one could not do this as it was unconstitutional as a result of the eighth amendment.  Instead, we are reducing the penalty from a sentence of 14 years to a peppercorn fine of &euro;1.<\/p> <p> I hope everybody in this Chamber will consider this a serious alternative to draconian legislation which is punitive on women and on women's right.  International Women's Day is coming up and we could at least make a gesture to take this extremely seriously and look at alternatives.  On Tuesday next, I hope to move the Second Stage of this Bill should the Deputies here allow the First Stage to go through.<\/p> <p> People Before Profit and other groups in this Chamber believe further delaying a referendum on repealing the eighth amendment is causing much hardship to women, particularly those who face a fatal foetal abnormality and those with crisis pregnancies who leave the State or procure the abortion pill.  We need to have that referendum.  Even if a referendum is held, there is a 14 year sentence for procuring an abortion in this State and women and their medical practitioners may well fall foul of future legislation.<\/p> <p> The purpose simply is to reduce the penalty to a &euro;1 fine.  Hopefully, we will debate this on Tuesday next.  As I said, what really triggered the urgency behind this is that in Northern Ireland, 80 or 90 miles up the road, three women have faced the courts because they have used the abortion pill, which is increasingly the choice women are making because it is simple and safe and if one obtains it early, it is the best way of dealing with a crisis pregnancy.  I very much fear this sentence imposes a fear factor on women in this country and that it is a chill factor on medical practitioners.  Reducing it to a &euro;1 fine would be fair, decent and humane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200013#L00500","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488460500,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200014#M00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1488460500,"counter":68,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200014#M00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488460500,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1488460500,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200014#M00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1488460500,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200014#M00600","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488460500,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Civil Liability (Amendment) (Prevention of Benefits from Homicide) Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1488460500,"counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200014#M00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1488460500,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Civil Liability Act 1961 to provide for the effects in civil law of the principle that a person should be precluded from benefitting from committing any homicide and the principle that no cause of action arises from one's own wrongful act, to amend the Succession Act 1965 and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>This Bill seeks to ensure that a person who is convicted of murder, attempted murder or manslaughter of another person shall be precluded from taking any share in the estate of that deceased person.  At present, under the Succession Act 1965, there is a general prohibition preventing persons who are guilty of murder or manslaughter from succeeding to an estate.  However, it does not go far enough and it does not cover situations pertaining to joint tenancies.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, we have had experience in this country of persons, in particular, husbands, who have been found guilty of the murder or manslaughter of their wives.  Under the joint tenancy, which they have with their wives, those husbands are entitled to inherit the estate after they have served their sentence and they can enjoy the benefits of that.  There is no barrier on them inheriting the estate.  Under the proposals contained in this legislation, there would be a mechanism whereby families of those deceased persons would go to court to make an application to prevent the person convicted of the offence against their family member from inheriting.<\/p><p>There have been two prominent cases in this regard over the past 20 years or so - one in 1998 and one approximately five or six years ago.  The courts recognise that there are limited statutory rules in place in respect of this matter and for that reason, it is appropriate that this legislation should be introduced.<\/p><p>It is also important to point out that under the legislation there are certain exemptions given in respect of those who are convicted of manslaughter.<\/p><p>The court can exercise discretion not to grant an order as provided for in the legislation if it believes there are good grounds for so doing.  One of those grounds would be that the person who has been convicted of manslaughter is in a position of <i>in loco parentis<\/i>or is a parent of young children and the court believes it appropriate that they be entitled to inherit the property and remain so.<br\/><br\/>It is important to point out that the Bill also applies in circumstances where a person has not been convicted before our criminal courts of murder, manslaughter or attempted murder.  However, it does allow a party to bring an application before the courts on the basis of the civil burden of proof, namely, on the balance of probabilities, and if a court believes that an individual has been responsible for the unlawful killing of an individual, the provisions in the legislation can be invoked.  Clearly any such finding would involve no criminal culpability on the part of the person against whom the order was made but it recognises that there are certain circumstances when civil orders can be made, notwithstanding the fact that no criminal conviction has been found.  In determining those applications, the court will be applying the burden of proof based on the civil standard, which is the balance of probabilities.<br\/><br\/>The manner by which this legislation is being introduced is that it provides for an amendment of the Civil Liability Act. That Act provides significant statutory detail in respect of the liability of wrongdoers.  The proposal in respect of my legislation is that it would insert a new section after Part 3, which would be entitled Part 3A, with section 46(<i>a<\/i>) being the first of them.<br\/><br\/>This is not an original piece of work by me because it is based on a Law Reform Commission report published in the middle of 2015.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that the law should be changed in order that individuals would not be in a position to benefit from joint tenancies in circumstances where they had been found guilty of criminal offences involving the death of the other individual.  I ask for leave for the Bill to be introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200014#M00900","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488460800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200015#N00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1488460800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200015#N00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488460800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1488460800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200015#N00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1488460800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200015#N00600","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488460800,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1488460800,"counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200015#N00800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488460800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1488460800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  As the Minister of State is aware, we have an obligation to transpose the victims directive into law and in order to do that we will be introducing three items of legislative, one of which is before the House now.  Legislation on domestic violence currently before the Seanad is relevant to this also and, in time, that Bill will be dealt with in this House.<\/p>  <p>  The deadline for the transposition of the victims directive was November 2015.  While we have not managed to transpose it yet, it is fair to say that a number of steps have been taken in preparation for that, some of which I will outline.  We had the directive by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to establish a new communications and victim liaison unit and to implement rights under the victims directive pending the transposition of the directive into Irish law.  We also had the establishment of the protective services bureau and the Garda victims services office.  We are very quick in opposition to highlight cuts to services so it is important to put on the record that this area has seen increased funding allocated by the Victims of Crime Office to victims support services.  We have also seen training and other initiatives being undertaken in preparation for the transposition of this directive into Irish law.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of training, new recruits in Templemore are required to take a module in training on empathy.<\/p><p>If they fail this, they are not allowed to pass out and they must do this module again.  One question to which I have not been able to get an answer, and perhaps the Minister of State can come back to me later today or whenever he can get the answer, is whether this module is being rolled out throughout the force.  I know it is being implemented for new recruits, but we have serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have been there for a number of years.  When they did their training in Templemore, the issue of victims' rights may not have been as important or prevalent as it is today.  I do not know how much training has been undertaken by officers who have been there for many years in preparation for the directive being transposed.  Perhaps this is something we can look at.  I know it is an operational issue for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p> I have an excellent paper produced by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, which I read last night.  It highlights some of the potential - I will not stay flaws - inadequacies of the Bill which, in its opinion, need to be addressed as the legislation progresses through the House to ensure the directive is transposed correctly into Irish law.  I will touch on a number of points raised.<\/p> <p> Section 2 of the Bill includes the definition of the victim, and Deputy O'Callaghan raised an issue in this regard yesterday.  The definition as proposed in the Bill is \"a natural person who has suffered harm, including physical, mental or emotional harm or economic loss, which was directly caused by an offence\".  Section 2 also states the term extends to a family member where the death of a victim is caused directly by an offence.  While we all welcome the definition, we need to be very careful it is not too restrictive.  Recital 19 of the directive states a victim should enjoy that status regardless of whether an offender is identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted and regardless of the relationship between the offender and the victim.  The IHREC states that to ensure the directive is transposed correctly, we should look at expanding the definition of a victim to ensure there is no doubt an individual may be considered a victim regardless of whether an offender has been identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted and regardless of the relationship between the offender and the victim.  This is something we need to look at on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> The commission also discusses section 14(2)(d) of the Bill, which lists the personal characteristics of the victim which must be taken into account at the time of the assessment.  The IHREC welcomes this approach but it makes some observations on section 14(2)(e) of the Bill, which relates to instances where a crime appears to have been committed with a bias or discriminatory motive.  Section 14(2)(e) directly cross-references the list of personal characteristics set out in section 14(2)(d).  The IHREC recommends, and asks us as law-makers to examine, an amendment to section 14(2)(e) to clarify the basis of hate crime is not limited to the personal characteristics listed in section 14(2)(d) and may also include other characteristics.<\/p> <p> The next section highlighted by the IHREC is section 16, which outlines the special measures which must be implemented in respect of a victim during interviews in the course of an investigation.  The section includes provisions to ensure interviews are carried out in suitable premises by persons specially trained for the purposes.  In the case of multiple interviews the section states the same officer should carry out the interviews where possible.<\/p><p>In cases of sexual violence, gender-based violence or violence in a close relationship, that is domestic violence, it should be a right for the victim to be interviewed by a person of the same sex as the victim.  While the Bill appears to transpose the directive's strict requirements in this regard, it states that such special measures may be implemented in respect of a victim.  This should be amended, and \"may\" should be replaced with \"shall\" to remove any doubt.<\/p> <p> The report also discuss restorative justice.  When the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality held its prelegislative scrutiny of the Bill, it contained a section on restorative justice but it has been dropped from the published Bill.  I am not sure why this has happened and I ask for clarification from the Minister.  Restorative justice is a very important part of the process for victims.  Victims want to know why somebody committed a crime against them but questions such as this cannot be addressed through the criminal justice system.  We identify offenders, we apprehend them, we prosecute them and, if convicted, send them to jail or impose another penalty.  That is often not enough for victims as they want to know why they were victims of a crime and that can be very difficult, especially in cases of sexual violence.  They want to know whether they were targeted, if they were being followed by somebody or whether somebody was watching their home before burgling it but these questions are not answered in the course of a criminal investigation.  This is where restorative justice comes in.  Restorative justice exists within the State but not on a statutory footing and we should look at it.  Various models of restorative justice are used throughout the world and research suggests it is very successful.  There is research that suggests that, in certain types of offences, restorative justice is not successful, one being sexual and domestic violence, but restorative justice increases the rights of, and answers at least some questions for, victims of all other offences.  It is important to address this on Committee Stage.  If it was important enough to have a section at the time of prelegislative scrutiny, I am not sure why it has been dropped from the Bill.<\/p> <p> In recent years there have been positive developments in victim-sensitive processes in the criminal justice area and this legislation will enhance that.  Despite this, however, significant challenges remain, some relating to the under-reporting of crimes and we need to address this.  Unfortunately, all the figures show that there is under-reporting of crime, particularly in cases of hate crime.  There may be many reasons for this, one of which is the fact that we do not have specific legislation on hate crime.  We have to address that and I know the Minister has said she will bring forward something on this issue in due course.  One reason given for the under-reporting of hate crime is the perception that the offender will not be detected or the victim may not be believed.  We should do everything to encourage victims of crime to report the crime because that is how we can deal with victims' rights and how we can support them.  We will also be able to get data on the people engaged in hate crime or domestic violence, where there are also difficulties in reporting for many reasons such as fear, intimidation, uncertainty, the unknown and a feeling they may not be believed in situations where it is their word against that of the perpetrator.  It is difficult to say how many cases of hate crime there have been because of its significant under-reporting.<\/p> <p> Another area we will address on Committee Stage is the case for a central point of contact for victims and for continuity of support for a person who reports a crime so that, for example, a liaison officer assigned to a victim remains the same throughout the process.  This goes beyond the sentencing of an offender.  Under the directive, victims will also have rights to information on release dates and on whether somebody has escaped from prison and these things are addressed in the Bill.  However, expanding the definition of a victim and restorative justice are issues for us.  The latter has an important role in the transposition of the directive into Irish law and I would like it to be addressed on Committee Stage.  We will support the legislation, however, and look forward to its passage.<\/p> <p> It is important to pass legislation but it is also important to ensure the resources and the necessary supports are put in place afterwards.  We could formulate an implementation plan, which is not catered for in the legislation at the moment.  Given the fact that we are so far behind schedule in transposing the directive into law, and that a number of initiatives have been taken in the lead-up to the legislation, it is important the process is monitored in the interests of victims and an implementation plan will enable us to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200015#N01000","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488461400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton, to the debate.  It will not have the same applause and attention as the announcement last night and I congratulate the Minister of State on that initiative, which was very important.<\/p><p>This legislation is important too.  The Bill is welcome but it is belated.<\/p><p>It originates in the EU directive that dates back to October 2012.  All member states were required to transpose the victims' directive into law by 16 November 2015.  As of December last, infringement proceedings had been brought against 11 member states, including Ireland, for failure to communicate on their implementation of the directive.<\/p> <p> I do not blame the Minister for Justice and Equality or, indeed, her Department.  Every Minister for Justice produces a considerable portion of legislation and, indeed, a significant chunk of the entire legislative programme of Government.  The difficulty seems to be in distinguishing between what is important and what is urgent.  Long-standing legislative commitments can be displaced by the need to respond immediately to current developments.  That is a pattern in every Department and it is unfortunate that issues sometimes get side-tracked and do not make the progress they need to make.  Bills get re-prioritised and, as I know, some Bills go backwards in the priority list.  A former colleague introduced a Coroners (Amendment) Act 2005, which was accepted by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Senator Michael McDowell, now a distinguished Senator, and became law.  His officials were slower to agree to its implementation than the then Minister because they said they were already working on comprehensive legislative reform on the coroners' side but we did not see a coroners Bill until two years later.  Ten years after that we are still waiting for a comprehensive code.  In fact, the coroners Bill is not even on the legislative programme any more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200017#P00200","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488462000,"counter":89,"content":"<p>It is coming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200018#Q00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1488462000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>It is coming as well, is it?  It is ten years on.<\/p><p>I have no doubt that budgetary restraints of the past few years have impacted, but I wonder if the Minister of State thinks any institutional changes are needed to improve the flow of legislation, particularly through the justice area.  It is an area on which I was spokesperson many years ago, and it is an area of great demand.  The volume of work coming from the Law Reform Commission together with the work being done on codification and consolidation of criminal law, all really important and welcome work, adds to the pressures on the legislative capacity of a Department.  On that general issue, I would welcome hearing from the Minister of State or the T&aacute;naiste about whether there is a restructuring, an additional support mechanism or a different way of ensuring that legislation does not get bogged down in Parliaments over more than a decade.<\/p><p>As I indicated, I very much welcome this legislation.  It aims to implement the victims' directive and it broadly mirrors that directive, although there are, as I said and others have highlighted, some omissions we need to address.  I say broadly, and will be touching on some other points later.  We have the benefit of a review of the Bill by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Many of its observations are not to do with its drafting, but rather to do with the way that the Bill is to be implemented.  I am thinking of the commission's observations about the need to encourage and support the reporting of crime.  That is something we have to reflect on.  Specifically, it refers to the reporting of hate crimes and providing assistance to victims of hate crimes.  That is a category of crime that we are only now beginning to properly focus on.  The commission also says that victims of sexual violence should be interviewed by a person of the same sex.  That is a very simple requirement that one would think would be a matter of course in any event.  More generally, it emphasises that training is essential for the professionals who are in regular contact with the victims of crime.<\/p><p>There is little or no point in legislating to the highest standards, as we try to do, if there is no effort to properly implement the laws that we pass.  In particular, a crime victims' charter is effective only to the extent that it is actually put into practice.  We are not great at that.  I looked at much of the legislation that we pass ourselves.  We spend enormous effort and time crafting good legislation, but making sure that it is implemented in the correct way, that the resources are there, that the training is there and that the cultural shift is put in place in some instances is a much more daunting task.<\/p><p>It is also depressing, if true, that this survey was only published following an instruction from the Policing Authority to senior Garda management to do so.  I refer to the figures published in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's own public attitudes survey.  If a public attitude survey is done, it is important we actually see it.  The survey involved 6,000 respondents and it showed that more than 40% of those who reported a crime to the garda&iacute; were dissatisfied with the handling of that crime.  If that is the case, it is a very worrying statistic.  The Garda Assistant Commissioner, Michael O'Sullivan, agreed that some Garda members had, by their manner, alienated members of the public.  He insisted that the problem could and would be addressed through training and changing the mindset.  We have all spent much time focusing on the delivery of policing in this country and we have all come across minor examples of where a different way of behaving would have had a different result.  I know of individual instances where issues were aggravated by a basic lack of courtesy at times and, at others, a lack of a little empathy for people who were victims of crime.<\/p><p>On the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's 12 specific recommendations which were put before us, the Minister of State could usefully respond in detail to each of those as we advance, probably more properly on Committee Stage.  It makes practical proposals about measures to encourage the reporting of crime and to ensure support services are available to victims who do not make formal complaints, about minimum common inter-agency standards to facilitate consistency of practice, about the necessary resources and guidance to bodies, and so on.  In addition, the Victims' Rights Alliance has been in contact and has made useful observations to all of us about this Bill.  Two aspects of its submission strike me and I hope the Minister of State is in a position to respond positively to those two observations.  I have amendments prepared which I will table to deal with them, if necessary.  It points out that Article 8(2) of the directive provides, as the previous speaker said, that the garda&iacute; shall facilitate the referral of victims to victim support services.  However, section 6(8) of the Bill merely provides that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &quot;may, where a victim consents, arrange for the victim to be referred to a service which provides support for victims&quot;.  There are cases where a lawyer will say that the word &quot;may&quot; in an Act actually means &quot;shall&quot; and <i>vice versa<\/i>but I do not think this is one of them.  The Bill diverges from the directive for no clear or apparent reason, by making referral discretionary rather than mandatory.  The Bill would be improved, and I hope the Minister of State will agree, if it was aligned more properly and accurately with the directive in that regard.  Specifically, the phrase &quot;may, where a victim consents&quot; should be replaced with &quot;shall, where a victim consents or so requests&quot;.<\/p><p>The second point raised by the Victims' Rights Alliance is that it seems to me that there is a gap between the directive's provision about restorative justice and what the Bill contains.  As the previous speaker said, the Bill is silent on restorative justice.  It was in the pre-legislative scrutiny, so what happened to it?  I recognise that we do not have a statutory framework for restorative justice in this jurisdiction and it is important to say the whole concept has been given a bad name on this island, given the way in which the concept of restorative justice was hijacked by some paramilitaries in Northern Ireland and by their political champions.  The IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in, in particular, at a time when they were boycotting normal or formal policing, were responsible for what could only be described as a grotesque charade that masqueraded as restorative justice.  This sometimes involved - we know the individual cases - hauling the victim of the most serious cases, including very serious sexual abuse cases, to face the perpetrators of the crimes against them.<\/p><p>We have heard some of the evidence or testimony in public, and one can imagine how damaging it could be when people, victims of crime, were brought to dark back rooms and, in that menacing environment, were asked to face the people they knew had perpetrated the crime against them.  That is not any concept of restorative justice that any of us could decently accept.  The great majority of political parties and right-thinking citizens want nothing to do with that concept.  Nonetheless we had an ad-hoc, non-statutory restorative justice programme operating on a pilot basis in this jurisdiction.  It was run by the Probation Service and involved parties meeting in a supervised setting to discuss the effects of crime on a victim.  From my understanding of it, that pilot programme was quite successful.  <\/p> <p> The EU directive does presume some sort of restorative justice system.  Article 4(1)(j) asserts that victims must be informed, on first contact with the garda&iacute;, of the available restorative justice services.  Article 12 provides that \"Member States shall take measures to safeguard the victim from secondary and repeat victimisation, from intimidation and from retaliation, to be applied when providing any restorative justice services.\"  That is obviously a critical point.  It would be a cruelty indeed if the notion of restorative justice was actually to further traumatise the victim and to exacerbate the damage done.  That would be wholly and entirely unacceptable.  We need to think very carefully about how this system could work, but it is one that has worked well in other jurisdictions.  <\/p> <p> The Department's own strategic review of penal policy was, as the Minister is aware, published in 2014.  It acknowledged that the victim's directive promotes the appropriate use of restorative justice services, which is in line with the existing delivery of such services in this State.  That is what it says.  In addition, sections 26 and 28 of the Children Act, 2001 invite victims to be involved in a conference convened by a probation and welfare officer.  That in and of itself is a form of restorative justice.<\/p> <p> In this light, it seems to me mistaken that the right to access information on restorative justice and the right to safeguards on the use of restorative justice are not included in the Bill.  Perhaps, in his summation of Second Stage, the Minister might explain why that is the case and whether there is to be a separate set of proposals coming in or other legislative measures to deal with this area.  He might say whether it is not advanced, prepared or developed enough or if it is a resource issue.  Whatever it is, it is an area in which many in this House have had an interest over time and I would be interested in hearing the official Departmental perspective on it.  The failure to include restorative justice safeguards would seem to me to be a breach of our obligations under the victims' directive, as victims are engaged in these services regardless of a lack of statutory provision for such a scheme.  As I say, I hope the Minister will respond on these points, specifically to see if we can craft amendments, either from the Opposition benches or from the Government, on these points before we get to Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> A final point, raised by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, is a practical one.  It relates to the need for a workable complaint mechanism involving a single contact point for victims to register a complaint about their treatment in the criminal justice system.  A single contact point.  This, IHREC points out, would assist in securing greater transparency, greater consistency and foreseeability of treatment in respect of victims of crime.  I would be slow to recommend the establishment of victims of crime ombudsman.  That does exist in some jurisdictions.  It is effective elsewhere but I think we have a plethora now, particularly in the justice area.  I would again be interested in hearing the views of the Minister in respect of where we could site such a contact point.  Perhaps a one-stop shop could be developed under the auspices of GSOC or some other existing institution that might be expanded to include this one-stop contact point envisaged by the Human Rights and Equality Commission. Its point on this is very fair.  It would also deal with consistency of treatment, which is really very important for us.  We must learn consistently from the experiences of individual victims of crime.  <\/p> <p> I am advised that the success of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime in Canada, for example, illustrates the effectiveness of a formal model of this kind.  Without such support victims may be left with no option other than to bring their complaint to a court, which is of no benefit to either the victim or the State if there is an alternative way of dealing with it.<\/p> <p> These are the points I wanted to raise.  I welcome the Bill and its arrival in the House.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say at the conclusion of Second Stage.  As I say, on the points I have raised, I will table amendments to address what I regard as either lacunae in the Bill as published or improvements that could be made. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200018#Q00300","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488462600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 is to be welcomed because it marks a shift in culture in our legal system.  Ireland has a very adversarial system where the focus is on the prosecution and defence of the accused.  Victims have often been considered as merely witnesses to a crime and not victims who are also witnesses.  The experience they face by reporting crimes and being witnesses in court has not been a major consideration of the legal system in the past.  There are welcome changes in the Bill.  Victims, for example, will now be given information on first contact with the authorities, they will have a right to information on why a prosecution was not advanced by the Director of Public Prosecutions or the garda&iacute;.  We saw this issue arising in, for example, the O'Higgins commission in respect of the way some of the victims were treated in those case studies in the Cavan - Monaghan district.  They were kept completely out of the loop as to what was going on.  In one case the woman's husband received a phone call when she herself did not.  I think it is absolutely critical that is done.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also provides for protection measures, if required, to protect victims when an alleged offence is being investigated.  There will be victim personal statements, which can be considered by a judge at sentencing.  Victims can be also accompanied by another person, including a legal representative or somebody else, at an interview.  This will be of major practical assistance to victims coming forward when reporting a crime is difficult for them.  There also will be changes to court procedure such as giving evidence by video link or exclusion of the public during sensitive evidence.  Victims will also have access to interpretation and translation as a right, which is very important giving the growing diversity of population we have.  In our courts there are also meant to be separate waiting areas for victims.  This is recognised in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The Victims' Rights Alliance conducted a survey.  It showed that 72% of victims feel re-victimised by the justice system.  Many are unwilling to come forward due to the traumatic experience they feel they have had to relive.  It is essential that the garda&iacute; and the courts are able to minimise the difficulties that victims face when coming forward to report a crime.  The area of intimate partner violence is one that requires particular attention in the debate we will have on this Bill.  We know that in most incidents of serious physical and sexual violence from a partner the victim does not come forward and the crime is never reported.  Most victims do not prosecute the crime. <\/p><p>For example, Safe Ireland told the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality during pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill that 79%, an incredibly high figure, do not tell anybody else about a serious physical or sexual violence when it is carried out by a partner.  One in three women experience serious psychological violence from a partner, which is 500,000 women in Ireland according to the Safe Ireland report.  The SAVI report showed that 10% of women and 3% of men have been victims of rape.<\/p> <p> According to the Rotunda Hospital, one in eight pregnant women face abuse and 25% of all violent crime involves men attacking a partner.  One in seven women and one in 17 men face domestic abuse.  Women are seven times more likely to be the victims of sexual violence.  This statistics show that in Irish society, as is the case in other countries, sexist and misogynistic attitudes exist which lead to serious crime, but also that there are flaws in the legal system. <\/p> <p> The prevalence of intimate partner violence is not reflected in prosecutions in court.  Many of the provisions of the Bill will, therefore, be welcome for the victims of domestic violence.  The welcome provisions include the ability to have a person accompanying one during the reporting process, the ability to give evidence by video link and the ability of the court to have members of the public step out when sensitive evidence has been given.  There is a need for other changes in the law to assist victims, such as greater access to emergency barring orders which cannot be granted outside of court sitting times.  Violence does not take place solely during court sitting times, and a facility must be set up to deal with that fact.<\/p> <p> Women's Aid has demanded that barring orders be accessible to non-married and non-cohabiting couples.  Violence is carried out by boyfriends, girlfriends or past partners, but a barring order cannot be granted unless people are in married or cohabiting relationships which is a serious flaw in the legislation.<\/p> <p> Section 20 makes some provision for a restriction on asking questions in court about a victim's private life, an important provision that requires particular attention.  We have a victim blaming culture in our society, whereby victims of sexual assault, in particular, are questioned about what they were wearing and where they were, and judged as to whether they led a person on.  We should be very clear that the cause of rape and sexual assault are rapists and not their victims.  This matter deserves more attention when we are drafting amendments. <\/p> <p> The right of an accused person to have people giving evidence in a trial be cross-examined is another area that needs to be examined.  The Victims' Rights Alliance made the point to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality that an accused person does not have an unlimited right to cross-examine a witness and that the rights of victims also have to be considered.  Somebody has to be able to put up a defence and have a witness cross-examined, but not on irrelevant information such as previous sexual partners or personal life, neither of which should have any bearing on a legal case.  I would like section 20 to be considered by the Select Committee on Justice and Equality on Committee Stage to make sure the defence no longer has the right or ability to cross-examine a witness on his or her private life.<\/p> <p> In the sexual offences Bill that has been passed by both Houses, a definition of consent was included which was very important.  There is a need to increase awareness of sexual consent and tackle any backwards views that exist in society around us.  Legislation on its own is pointless and ineffective unless it is backed up with resources.  There has to be a discussion on how we can give victims much more ability to prosecute and have a better life in general.  <\/p> <p> The experience of victims is not just about legal rights and procedures with the Garda or the courts, important as they are.  It also happens in the context of resources being made available.  Domestic violence is a recurrent reason for women in my constituency contacting me about housing problems.  Those facing violence in the home are unable to leave due to the serious housing crisis.  Rents are too high and it is impossible for a single person to rent a home, in particular if that person has children and is unable to work full-time.  <\/p> <p> Council waiting lists are very long and it is not possible for a person leaving an abusive partner to secure a home through his or her local authority.  In 2015, 5,917 people were turned away from women's refuges, a rise of over 1,000 on the previous year.  Every day 16 women are unable to access refuges.  There is a 20-week waiting list for a hearing for a safety order, and something has to be done to tackle that.  Free legal aid fees rose from &euro;50 to &euro;130, which is a serious deterrent for the poorest in our society being able to get proper legal advice regarding their situation.<\/p> <p> There is a shocking lack of support services for child victims in this country.  The ISPCC outlined that it provides therapeutic services  to 500 children.  However, waiting times for child psychologists are at least six months to a year.  When a child is in distress that is simply unacceptable.  The Children's Rights Alliance told the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality that there is no free counselling for child victims in murder cases, for example.  Children At Risk in Ireland, CARI, outlined that there are long waiting list for child victims of sexual abuse.  Those aged under 14 years only have one State service, based in Galway.  Services offers to those aged over 14 depend on geography and where the victim lives.  Like any legal reform, there is a need for resources to back up to make these legal reforms more than just an abstract change which produces nothing in reality. <\/p> <p> I am concerned that the requirement in the directive that people who have contact with victims receive training is not included in the Bill.  It is a serious problem if the first contact with the Garda, the Judiciary or other services involves people who have not been trained properly.  We have all heard anecdotal evidence from people with whom we deal who are unhappy with the manner of their first and other encounters.  We have an opportunity to underpin training requirements in the Bill, something that the Minister should consider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200019#R00200","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488463200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I commend and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, on the historic announcement yesterday regarding the recognition of ethnicity for our Traveller community.  I hope that, as the Taoiseach stressed in his speech, it does not have implications in terms of constitutional rights, other rights to resources and so on.  I hope that the spirit of what was achieved yesterday will ensure that the necessary resources in terms of housing, education, training and so on are provided.  That would be the measure of the announcement.  The career of the Minister of State encompasses the same period as mine.  It is good to see a very positive step forward.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to thank the Oireachtas library and research service for its excellent briefing on this Bill and my colleagues who helped me.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak briefly on the Bill.  It is long overdue and is required in order to transpose EU Directive 2012\/29\/EU.  It will replace Council Framework Decision 2001\/220\/JHA and amend the Criminal Evidence Act 1998, the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and the Courts Service Act 1998.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bill is approximately 16 months overdue.  It is interesting to note that 11 member states have been reprimanded for lengthy delays in moving on the required legislation.<\/p><p>Victims will finally now have legally enforceable rights, which is the core of what we are discussing today.  Maria McDonald of the Victims&rsquo; Rights Alliance said:<\/p><blockquote>[F]or the first time victims will have rights and for the first time they will be able to go to court to protect those rights.  We&rsquo;ve had a Victim's Charter in this country since 2010 but it [had] no legal force.  This [now] has legal force.<\/blockquote><p>I also recall the former General Secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and former presidential candidate, Mr. Derek Nally, who deserves a mention for all the work he, his friends and colleagues, including many other members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, undertook to provide for victims of crime.  He founded the Federation for Victim Assistance in 2005 along with Ms Mairead Fernane.  Many other organisations have long done, and continue to do, great support and advocacy work for victims including One in Four, the Rape Crisis Centre, Women&rsquo;s Aid and Support after Homicide.  The Victims of Crime Office has received small increases in funding over the past couple of years with an additional &euro;250,000 announced in budget 2017, which is welcome, but approximately 50 organisations are to receive funding from the total that is available, meaning it is spread thinly.  Likewise, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, COSC, also received additional modest increases in funding.<br\/><br\/>Part 2 of this comprehensive Bill relates to information.  This was a key concern for Deputies over the years.  It is hoped that this will begin to address the worrying inconsistencies and failings of the system and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in providing timely information to victims.  The 2014 report by the Garda Inspectorate raised the kind of issues that we would have heard repeatedly over the years, including victims finding it difficult to contact the investigating garda due to changing shifts.  Victims would ring a Garda station to find the investigating garda was not available and no one else was able to help them.  Calls were not returned and appointments were not kept.  People were not aware of the PULSE number that was allocated to an alleged crime.  On many occasions there was no follow-up contact and victims sometimes learned of the outcome of their case in the courts section of the local newspaper.  These are the kind of information concerns that we all would have had to grapple with down through the years.  It certainly seems, therefore, common sense that information about where to get support, the status of an investigation or court case, reasons not to prosecute and outcomes of court cases would naturally be offered and provided to victims of crime.  As I stated, unfortunately the performance in the past has varied greatly throughout the country and victims have often felt desperately frustrated.<br\/><br\/>Victims&rsquo; satisfaction on how garda&iacute; are engaging with them often differs depending on the type of crime involved with those who are victims of heinous crimes such as domestic violence and sexual assault sadly reporting lower levels of satisfaction than those who are victims of burglaries for example.  When discussing the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill recently, our colleague, Deputy Shortall, called for the provision in that Bill for those under 18 years of age to give evidence from behind a screen to be extended to everyone.  I welcome such provisions in section 14 of the Bill before us today.  This allows for the identification of special protection needs and special measures to be extended to certain victims.  Given the clear evidence of serious intimidation of witnesses and victims in the past, section 19, which provides for the exclusion of the public at the discretion of the court, is also a valuable step forward.<br\/><br\/>Most important, we now have a statutory definition of the word &quot;victim&quot; and a Bill that gives rights to victims, including rights to information, support and protection.  For these reasons, I welcome the Bill.  A victim is defined as &quot;a natural person who has suffered harm, including physical, mental or emotional harm or economic loss, which was directly caused by an offence&quot; and it will also extend to a family member should the victim have died because of the offence, except where the family member concerned may be implicated in the cause of death.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, in its review of the legislation recommended that the definition of victim should be expanded to be fully in line with the directive so that &quot;an individual may be considered a victim regardless of whether an offender is identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted and regardless of the relationship between the offender and the victim&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Over the years, I have been contacted by many victims of crime who felt let down badly by the system.  They faced problems with lack of information, communication with the investigating garda and feedback.  Long periods of time have often ensued between forensic and other investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any information on the conclusion of the investigation.  Constituents have also raised grave concerns around the decisions of the DPP, particularly when the decision was not to prosecute.  All of these demonstrate why the Bill is so badly needed but they also reinforce the need for improved training and resources.  It is interesting that training and the additional resources it is hoped that the Minister of State will provide were raised repeatedly in the earlier debate.  Perhaps this could be addressed in the amendments on Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>I welcome section 27 which provides for the right to make a victim impact statement by amending section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993.  Victims' voices are the most important in appropriately dealing with crimes and deciding on outcomes.  Section 6(1) provides for the information to be given to victims upon first contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or GSOC.  Section 6(1)(e) notes that it will include information on &quot;the role of the victim in the criminal justice process&quot;.  As we know, Ireland has an adversarial criminal justice process meaning that the main role of the victim was historically regarded as prosecution&rsquo;s witness because the State takes the case if a decision is made to prosecute.  Section 6(3)(a) states that information should be provided &quot;as soon as practicable&quot; but the Minister might consider changing the wording on Committee Stage to something such as &quot;without unnecessary delay&quot;, as was recommended by the Rape Crisis Network Ireland in its observations on the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Another important point is one made by IHREC about the various agencies victims will be liaising with throughout the process.  IHREC recommends that there should be a minimum standard set regarding the manner and timeframe around communication with victims to ensure consistency across agencies.  In recent years, we have noticed the lengthy periods during which crimes are investigated and go through the court process.  I was reviewing statistics on the criminal courts in other jurisdictions such as the Ministry of Justice's statistics bulletin for England and Wales.  It appears to be a much faster process in many cases than our system.  I am obviously moving beyond the territory of this Bill, but this is something that frustrates victims greatly.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  This year, we will often read about decisions made on crimes that took place in 2015 or earlier.  It seems to be an endemic feature of our legal system that justice is so slow and cumbersome and we need to address it.  Many people have noted that civil law jurisdictions, in particular, seem to have a much faster process of carrying out an investigation and proceeding through their court systems.  These are bigger questions about how to proceed in the future.  It is often said, for example, that we did not really change our legal system at all in 1916 or 1922 and that all of those who were in the British system before 1916 just morphed into the Free State system afterwards, with all its old English traditions.  Whereas the English court system may have been greatly modernised in many respects, our own system still has a lot of cumbersome and slow features, which frustrates victims.  I know that goes beyond this Bill, but perhaps we need to deal with it.<br\/><br\/>Section 7(2)(c) provides for information to be given to victims if a decision is reached &quot;not to proceed with, or to discontinue, the investigation&quot; and section 2(d)(ii) provides for the victim&rsquo;s right to review such a decision.<\/p><p>The concept of reviewing a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions addresses another element of the dissatisfaction frequently felt by victims.<\/p> <p> The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, is another agency which may be involved and may run the investigation given that victims may contact GSOC first.  Following the wide-ranging debate in the House last week on the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry into protected disclosures, we must review and strengthen the independent and investigative roles of GSOC, the Garda Inspectorate and the Policing Authority.  <\/p> <p> While the Bill states no funding is required, increased resources will need to be made available to all agencies involved in the proper execution of the rights bestowed on victims by the Bill.  There is no point inserting in legislation phrases that sound great and in that connection I refer again to the step forward we made in the House last night.  Victims' rights must be backed up with necessary supports, including upgrading information technology infrastructure for the Garda and Courts Service.  Many complaints have been made regarding the flow of information between the PULSE system, the Road Safety Authority and the national vehicle driver file in respect of fatal road traffic accidents.  Substantial resources are required in this area.  In October 2016, the Victims Rights Alliance and Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, began the process of identifying additional training that will be required for lawyers for the implementation of this directive.  I welcome news that the European Commission is funding this project, which will also include other jurisdictions in the European Union.<\/p> <p> Why will legally enforceable rights only be applied to criminal proceedings that begin after commencement of the Bill?  Given the length of time involved in many criminal proceedings, surely most aspects of the Bill could be applied immediately upon commencement.<\/p> <p> The Rape Crisis Network Ireland recommends that a victims ombudsman's office be established to ensure all the Bill's provisions are adhered to.  A previous speaker referred to the plethora of bodies we have in the justice area.  Perhaps the victims ombudsman function could be performed by one or other of the existing agencies.  <\/p> <p> The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, cited a worrying statistic which highlights that Ireland is letting down victims of crime, particularly those most at risk of repeat victimisation.  Deputy Ruth Coppinger raised this issue in connection with serious sexual assault cases, domestic violence in all its forms and people who have left home because their lives have been threatened.  Most Deputies have encountered cases involving homeless women who fear for their lives because they have violent partners.  IHREC's submission on the Bill states that \"Ireland is not currently fulfilling the minimum requirement to provide shelters or appropriate interim accommodation 'for victims in need of a safe place due to an imminent risk of secondary and repeat victimisation, of intimidation and of retaliation', with reports in 2016 of 4,831 unmet requests for emergency accommodation.\"  This issue is also within the remit of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, whom I have repeatedly asked to declare a housing emergency along the lines of the banking emergency and take whatever steps are necessary to address this statistic.  Even in recent weeks, I have been contacted by people who are desperately seeking emergency accommodation, in part on the grounds set out by the IHREC.  Legislation on repeat victimisation needs to be strengthened and the issue of emergency accommodation needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> I also note the submission made by the Irish Penal Reform Trust on the importance of restorative justice.  I echo the disappointment expressed by previous speakers regarding the omission from the Bill of head 28, which would have placed adult restorative justice practices on a statutory footing.  I ask the Minister to explain the reasons for the exclusion of this head.  The National Commission on Restorative Justice defines restorative justice as \"a victim-sensitive response to criminal offending, which, though engagement with those affected by crime, aims to make amends by crime, aims to make amends for the harm that has been caused to victims and communities and which facilities offender rehabilitation and integration into society.\"  The Irish Penal Reform Trust's submission references the Le Ch&eacute;ile annual report of 2013, Building Bridges, which showed an average 22% increase in victim empathy levels after restorative justice interventions and noted that 100% of victims and offenders felt \"their voices were heard throughout the process\".  We must develop a process of restorative justice and I ask the Minister to consider this before Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> Paragraph 12 of the directive includes the statement that \"the rights set out in this Directive are without prejudice to the rights of the offender.  The term 'offender' refers to a person who has been convicted of a crime.\"  It is important to note that offenders, while imprisoned, may also be victims of crime and may constitute vulnerable persons.  As such, they would also have rights under the Bill.<\/p> <p> I paid tribute to the organisations which have worked hard over the years on behalf of victims.  I commend the great work of the civil society group Promoting Awareness, Responsibility and Care on our Roads, PARC, which is led by Ms Susan Gray.  PARC produced and disseminated an excellent information guide entitled Finding Your Way, which is shared on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s website.  This free information guide for families of victims of fatal and serious road traffic collisions recently received the \"highly commended\" accolade at the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, plain English awards 2016.  The Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, instructed Garda family liaison officers to distribute Finding Your Way to families bereaved as a result of road traffic collisions.  The guide sets out the rights available to families and is exactly the type of tailored, crime specific information the directive requires to be provided to victims of crime.<\/p> <p> I generally welcome the Bill.  However, my colleagues, Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace, will try to make improvements on Committee Stage when they address some of the points I have raised.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200020#S00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488464400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1488464400,"counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200022#U00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1488464400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Martin Kenny - payment delays under the GLAS and AEOS schemes; (2) Deputy Brendan Griffin - the need for progress on cystic fibrosis drugs, Orkambi and Kalydeco; (3) Deputy Carol Nolan - the <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme of compensation for school sex abuse survivors; (4) Deputy Thomas Pringle - the south Donegal CAMHS consultant psychiatrist post; (5) Deputy Bernard J.

With many Bills coming through the Houses in recent times, I know it is not easy for Ministers.  The victim must be at the centre of all programmes, whether they involve rehabilitation or restorative justice, because many victims have been sidelined.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to the failure to reform the courts system when we got our country back from the British.  The courts system is archaic and outdated.  I was down at the courts on Tuesday morning.  With respect to my learned colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, to see barristers and judges in their fine robes and head gear is intimidating.  The Minister should visit the courts or send her officials down to them to listen to proceedings.  I was in courtroom No. 6 and we could not hear what was being said because the court was packed, with people standing everywhere.  The crowd thinned out a little later.<\/p><p>It was impossible to hear what was being said.  Justice delayed is justice denied and justice unheard is not justice at all.  It is difficult to hear what the learned men and women, the justices, the clerks and so on are saying.  While these people do important work in terms of serving the justice system of the State, they are in a little bubble of their own.  In saying that I am not being critical of judges, but of the audio system in the courts.  It needs to be upgraded to the type of system we have in this House to allow what the judges and so on are saying to be heard.  I recently accompanied people to the courts in respect of a civil case.  We had to rely on the interpretation of lawyers in regard to what was happening because we could not hear what was said in the court.  This is a problem in most courthouses, including in my area in Tipperary.  There are also judges who speak in a low voice.  I cannot say that is true of myself, or that I cannot be heard.  There are people who speak so low one cannot understand what they are saying, particularly people who are nervous, frightened and apprehensive during an appearance before the court which might be their first experience in that regard.  That needs to be looked at too.<\/p> <p> The main purpose of the Bill is to transpose into Irish law an EU directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime.  The adage, prevention is better than cure, is true.  We all learned that from parents and grandparents.  I agree that the best thing we can do for victims of crime is prevent the reoccurrence of crime.  In this regard, we need to put in place a sufficiently robust Garda Force that does not fall below the recommended minimum of 13,000.  The lack of Garda visibility, vehicles and equipment has been a huge problem since the recession.  Garda&iacute; have been left high and dry.  This time two years ago I met a garda in a Garda station shortly after a storm.  He did not have a working mobile phone or a computer on which to access PULSE.  When I met him again he told me that he went home early that day because owing to a lack of resources there was nothing for him to do in the station.  Many rural Garda stations have been closed.  Without the necessary and up to date equipment and tools of the trade, including access to PULSE, garda&iacute; in the stations that remain open will not be able to do their job.  Many Garda stations do not even have the facilities to make a cup of tea.  The health and safety interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not being looked after.<\/p> <p> The Department of Justice and Equality has outlined the main rights that will flow from this Bill.  We have a lot of legislation in this area.  I look forward to this Bill progressing through the Houses and to engaging further on it with the Minister on Committee Stage.  We regularly pass legislation with great gusto only to find at a later date that it has not been enacted or implemented.  There is a failure to get our house in order and our ducks in a row in terms of having legislation enacted and implemented.  It has been mentioned by others that the legislative process is too slow and that is affecting the speedy enactment of legislation.  It was suggested that following First Stage of a Bill some aspects of it could be implemented or that that idea at least be explored.  I am a huge believer in restorative justice.  The restorative justice programme in Nenagh, north Tipperary, which operated on a pilot basis, worked very well and it needs to be expanded.<\/p> <p> The right to receive comprehensive information on the criminal justice system and the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within it, and the range of services and entitlements victims may access following on from their first contact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a huge grey area.  This is particularly important in the case of people traumatised by a crime, particularly sexual or domestic crime.  Often this will be their first contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and they are out of chartered waters and they are devastated and feel violated by the crime committed, particularly if it occurred in the home.  The first point of contact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be very important for them.  One can wait a long time in rural Ireland to meet a garda, particularly in a non-emergency situation.  It is important that a victim is given the number and name of the garda handling a case and that he or she has an opportunity to build up a relationship with that garda.  However, when it comes to further contact and feedback this is often very difficult because of rostering arrangements, particularly in rural areas, because garda&iacute; are regularly deployed to urban centres to augment shortages there.  This means that if a victim contacts a Garda station the garda on duty may not know the details of a situation and he or she either has to repeat them again or wait until another time to see the relevant garda.  In this regard, a victim may often be told that the garda will be on duty on, say, Monday night at 8 p.m. but then a situation arises, for example, he or she is required to be in court or is attending an incident, and the victim has to call back another time.  There is no joined up thinking or appreciation of the isolation and devastation caused to victims of crime when it comes to their dealings with the State.  Their first engagement is often the most vital.  How they are dealt with on that occasion will either put them off further engagement or assure them they are people who will defend and support them and deal sensitively with their issues.  We also need balance in terms of male and female garda numbers, so that each can swap and take over from each other where the need arises.<\/p> <p> I too recall the work of the late Derek Nally.  While there are a number of listening and support services in place they are operating on a shoestring.  Many of them are run by volunteers, who I acknowledge are trained volunteers and Garda vetted, which is very important.  Above all, they are qualified to listen.  They may not be qualified to take appropriate actions but they are qualified to refer people to the relevant professionals.  As well all know, to be ag &eacute;isteacht - to listen, is very important.  Many of the people I meet - I am sure the same applies to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and others - are often better for my having listened to their story.  When people are listened to and engaged with they feel more confident and they often then do not need any further help.  This type of support is very important, as is the support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I said many of these support services are voluntary, volunteer-led and they need to be properly resourced.  These groups and organisations are not sufficiently supported or recognised for what they do.  I acknowledge that in many cases they cannot be recognised because their services are anonymous.  There is one such service in my own village in Tipperary which provides a listening ear for older people.  It is an exemplary service.  I salute the volunteers who provide that service on a weekly basis.  They are very understanding.  As I said, these services are held behind closed doors and the staff are sufficiently trained to refer people in need of care to the right professionals.  They have a very good relationship with their clients and the groups to whom they refer them.  We need more supports for these services.<\/p> <p> Another issue addressed in this Bill is the right of receipt of a written acknowledgement of the making of a complaint by a victim.  One would think there would be no requirement for this to be included in this legislation.  It is vital that victims are provided with a written acknowledgement of their complaint.  I have had experience in this regard.  I once sought the assistance of a garda at a 24-hour Garda station.  I was told I had not made contact with the station even though I had done so twice and that annoyed me.  I sought my telephone records from Eircom at the time and they showed that I had not made any calls to the Garda station, including on the day I first made contact with the station.  Despite that this was a 24-hour Garda station, the record showed no record of a call back from the station.  This happened during a time when we did not have access to mobile phones and when calls were always made from a home telephone.  The records showed no telephone calls to or from my house over three days.  Thankfully, two or three days later, unsolicited, the proper records arrived.  While most of the information was the same they also showed a list of calls made on the three days in question.  As I said, the first set showed no record of any calls having been made on the days in question.  There was fun and games going on.  This is not the type of game that should be upheld by the justice system.  It is obvious the records were inferred with.  Thankfully, as I said, the second set of records proved that I had made telephone contact with the Garda station.  We all know that calls to Garda stations are recorded and have been recorded for some decades now.  This is done separate from the people on either end of the call.<\/p> <p> The written acknowledgement is very important for a victim, even if it is only so he or she can keep it in their wallet, pocket and so on.  It is evidence that he or she made a complaint.  The victim also has a right to be provided with information concerning the progress of the investigation and any court proceedings.<\/p><p>As things stand, arrangements in this regard are abysmal.  In saying that, I am not criticising the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but the system.  The whole process takes far too long and one has no idea what needs to be sent to the DPP or when to send it.  In my own case, 13 statements were provided but only five actually went to the DPP's office.  The other eight, incidentally, were supporting my side of the argument.  That is disgusting and it should not happen.  Under the current system, victims have no idea what the DPP has received or not received and the whole process is conducted under a cloud of secrecy.<br\/><br\/>The Bill includes measures for ensuring victims are updated about court proceedings.  I have already said that courtrooms should be made more comfortable and more receptive to the needs of people who are, for examples, victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse.  Indeed, I have argued on previous occasions that the proceedings in such cases should be held in another location.  That location should constitute a court of law, certainly, with full access for the media and the public, but the current environment is too formal and lends itself too easily to a situation where the victim of a crime may be intimidated by the perpetrator or persons associated with the perpetrator.  The Bill will provide for the right of victims to be informed of any decision not to institute a prosecution in regard to an offence committed against them and the right to request a review of that decision.  As it stands, people are not given any information on the progress of a complaint and have to telephone or write to the DPP's office or ask their solicitor to find out.  Where a decision is taken not to prosecute, no explanation is given of the rationale for that decision and there is no opportunity for the victim to ask questions.  He or she will not be told what information was sent, or not sent, by the Garda to the DPP's office, or which, if any, information was rejected.  That is a huge grey area and this Bill goes some way to address it.<br\/><br\/>The right to receive information on the temporary release or escape from custody of an offender who is serving sentence for an offence committed against the victim is a very important right.  In fact, it is bizarre that such information is not already provided as a matter of course.  I have spoken to people who encountered on the street the person who perpetrated a crime against them.  It was very traumatic for them.  For too long the well-being and concerns of the victim, the person who was violated, have not been afforded sufficient attention.  We must ensure the welfare of victims is placed front and centre of the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>The Bill includes a provision on the right of victims to receive information in clear and concise language and to have access to interpretation and translation services where such are necessary.  This is vital to ensure victims understand what is happening and can make themselves understood in their dealings with the criminal justice process.  Solicitors usually do their best for their clients but often use legal jargon which ordinary people do not understand.  Information should not just be rattled off and the victim left to take it or leave it.  It is important that people understand exactly what is happening when it comes to matters of such import to their lives and well-being.<br\/><br\/>The Bill further provides that each victim will be individually assessed so that any special measure necessary to protect him or her from secondary and repeat victimisation are implemented.  I alluded to this already.  There should be no opportunity for intimidation of the victim, subtle or otherwise.  The growth of social media and advances in technology have brought many new ways of contacting people and invading their privacy.  Special measures during investigations may include advice on personal safety, including safety orders and-or barring orders, applications to remand the alleged offender in custody or seek conditions on the granting of bail, and requests that interviews be carried out in appropriate premises by specially trained persons and, in the case of sexual or gender-based violence, by a person of the same sex as the victim.  I mentioned already that we now have many excellent female officers in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These types of measures should be standard practice and we must work to develop the progress that has already been made.<br\/><br\/>Provision is made in the Bill for the extension of the right to give evidence by live television link or from behind a screen to all victims who would benefit from such measures.  This is particularly welcome.  We should not oblige victims to be in the same room or otherwise physically close to the perpetrator of a crime against them, particularly where that crime is an especially heinous one.  We will have to wait for the enactment of the legislation but we must up our game in this regard in the meantime.<br\/><br\/>There is a need for a broader awareness by the State and its agencies of the needs of vulnerable persons, including refugees, victims of domestic violence and the elderly.  We should bear in mind, for example, the needs of those refugees who will be coming to Ireland from Syria and elsewhere in the coming months and years.  Local authorities are not training their staff to deal with people in those types of traumatic and devastating circumstances.  They have neither the resources not the accommodation to cope with their needs.  Cuan Saor in Clonmel is a women and children refuge centre which does Trojan work on a shoestring budget.  It receives very little support from the State and is largely reliant on fund-raising by the public.  The staff often have to take in women and children in the dead of night who have had to be removed from their homes by the Garda.  My Vulnerable Persons Bill seeks specifically to protect older people from financial abuse.  There is huge evidence of that type of thing going on, where vulnerable elderly people trust somebody, often a family member, to do their business transactions for them only to have that trust abused.  The situation has got much worse since the onset of the recession.  It is shocking that people who are seen as a soft touch are being abused in this way.  Unfortunately, my Bill seems to be stuck at the bottom of the pile and I cannot get it progressed.<br\/><br\/>I very much welcome the provision in the Bill before us this afternoon to extend the right of victims to provide a victim impact statement.  Other welcome measures are those which seek to ensure the particular vulnerability of child victims is recognised.  Where a specific need to protect the victim is identified, the Bill provides that a court may exclude the public from proceedings and restrict questioning regarding the victim's private life.  Family law cases are often held <i>in camera<\/i>, which is important, and these measures provide further protections for children and their families.<br\/><br\/>Overall, I welcome the Bill, but I want to know when it will be enacted once it has completed its passage through the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  We need to come into the 21st century in our dealings with victims of domestic violence and sexual offences, in particular, and take measures to manage the intrusiveness of the media.  I conclude by highlighting that there is a problem with the holding of inquests, which is a matter for separate legislation.  Inquests should be taken out of the courtroom setting completely, particularly in the case of the traumatised family of suicide victims.  Some years ago a family I knew lost a young man who took his own life by going under a train.  The train driver had to come in to the inquest to give his testimony and it was very traumatic for the young man's mother and other family members.  The local media reported the proceedings line by line, with all the nitty-gritty, the awfulness of what happened and the devastating consequences.  Those types of inquests should be conducted in hotels or other locations with a more comfortable ambience.  The court setting is totally unsuitable.  As I said, here should, in addition, be some restrictions on court reporting of such cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200022#U00700","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488465600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>This Bill represents a welcome step towards finally transposing the victims directive into Irish law.  Establishing minimum standards regarding the rights of victims and their entitlement to protection and support is an important element of the State's obligations to the victims of crime.  I am grateful that several issues which were raised during the course of the debate on the sexual offences legislation have been provided for in this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of a communications and victim liaison unit within the DPP is a welcome development.  There are several questions around the role of the DPP to which we do not receive satisfactory answers.<\/p><p>It is often impossible for victims and others to understand why the DPP's office has not proceeded with a prosecution.  While recognising the clear need to ensure an obvious separation of powers, accountability is important and there is a concern about a lack of accountability on the part of the DPP.<\/p> <p> When examining the details of the Grace case during the week, I noted that the Garda had carried out a number of investigations down the years.  It referred cases to the DPP on five different occasions, but prosecution was not recommended any of those times.  In light of what we know at this point, an explanation is needed and the question of whether there is a pattern or a reluctance to prosecute in particular cases needs to be researched.  Without going into the detail of specific cases, some kind of explanation should be given where, for example, there have been shortcomings in the law or the preparation of cases.  The public needs to know why, in what appears to be a large number of cases, the DPP does not recommend prosecutions.  Glaringly, no action has been taken on some recommendations and reports from tribunals that have been referred to the DPP.  This applies to the Garda as well.  There is a lack of accountability.  In the absence of any kind of explanation, even at a global level, one cannot help but wonder whether there is something wrong.<\/p> <p> I welcome the proposal on a protective services bureau within the Garda.  It represents the sort of victim-centric approach that is needed in our justice system.  When I raised the matter of individual assessments with the T&aacute;naiste last month, I was pleased to hear that the Garda had put in place the IT infrastructure to facilitate the bureau.  All that we can do at this point is hope that the infrastructure is adequately resourced and proper training is provided.  Creating the infrastructure is one thing, but ensuring that it is it widely available and officers are trained to operate it are critical factors.  As with many aspects of the legislation, the actions are welcome but dependent on adequate resources being provided.<\/p> <p> All too often, victims find themselves adrift in the unfamiliar waters of criminal proceedings or facing into undue bureaucracy.  For this reason, any step that can be taken and any resource that can be put in place to mitigate against that would be welcome.  However, transposition of the directive only represents the minimum protections required.  The Bill can represent a significant opportunity for us to progress the area of victims' rights.  In addition to passing the legislation, it is important that we avail of the opportunity to put victims front and centre in the response to crime.  With that in mind, we should be ambitious and strive to achieve the greatest possible level of protection.  I hope that the T&aacute;naiste will be open to amendments that reflect some of the criticisms and strong points that have been made by groups, such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and Rape Crisis Network Ireland.<\/p> <p> The victims' directive requires member states to ensure that access to victim support services is facilitated at the earliest point following a crime.  This access is not dependent on a victim making a formal complaint or a formal investigation being launched.  Victims are entitled to this status regardless of whether an offender is identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted and irrespective of the relationship between the offender and the victim.  Other Deputies have referred to how there is sometimes a problem with a lack of protection for common law couples.  It is certainly not the same type of protection that is provided to married couples.<\/p> <p> The IHREC has recommended that the definition of \"victim\" used within the Bill be expanded to reflect this language.  Doing so would place beyond doubt that, to be considered a victim, the offender does not need to be identified, apprehended or prosecuted.  While victims should be encouraged and facilitated to make reports wherever possible, the reality is that many crimes go unreported.  Given the evidence of this in terms of sexual and other serious crimes, steps must be taken to ensure that access to support services for victims is in place before a formal complaint is made.<\/p> <p> Anecdotally, it would appear that such under-reporting is also highly prevalent in cases of hate crime.  While the directive does not require specific hate crime legislation, the deficiencies in the reporting and prosecution of hate crime can make it difficult for victims to come forward and often leads to secondary victimisation.  While the Bill acknowledges instances of crimes committed with a bias or discriminatory motive, it does not include specific protections for victims of hate crimes.<\/p> <p> Section 16 will provide for the special measures that I mentioned to be placed on a statutory footing.  However, will the T&aacute;naiste outline why she chose to limit the application of these measures?  Under the Bill's current wording, they \"may\" be implemented.  Given that the Bill contains exemptions from providing for these measures in certain circumstances, would it not be more appropriate to state that these measures \"shall be\" provided where appropriate?  The current wording is sufficiently qualified in terms of certain circumstances, so it would be preferable to use the term \"shall be\".<\/p> <p> Under section 4(1), certain special measures will only be available to victims engaged in cases where criminal proceedings have commenced after the legislation comes into force.  I understand that the trial judge may apply these measures to be implemented even when no individual assessment of the victim's specific protection needs has taken place.  If so, then it seems unnecessary to limit who can access these measures based on the date criminal proceedings were instituted.  I endorse Deputy Broughan's point about Ireland seemingly having a slow-moving justice system.  In other jurisdictions, perpetrators of crime are made amenable more quickly.  Given the implications of that for the victims and affected communities, it is difficult to understand why our system moves so slowly.  For this reason, making it so that this legislation is only effective going forward would be a missed opportunity.<\/p> <p> When an assessment takes place, there does not seem to be a requirement for it to be provided to the trial judge.  Rape Crisis Network Ireland has suggested that there should be a specific obligation on the prosecutor to give the judge a copy of every report that comes into his or her possession.<\/p><p>While this may not require a statutory footing, those are the sort of administrative and operational aspects that are vital for the functioning of the directive.  As recommended by the European Commission, it is crucial that the commencement of this legislation be accompanied by appropriate non-legislative measures, and a far wider public awareness of people's rights under this law.  The victims' directive requires the establishment of processes to guarantee access by victims to information on their case.  The process must be transparent and not overly bureaucratic.  Under section 7 the onus is placed on the victim to make a request for information from the relevant body.  However, depending on the stage of the matter, that could be the Garda, the DPP, GSOC, or a number of other agencies.  In practice, that could lead to victims being passed from one agency to another, or facing an uphill battle against bureaucracy.  For that reason, would the Minister consider establishing a central point of contact or single liaison for victims?  Even if this was on a non-statutory basis, it would be a positive to streamline the<br\/><br\/>information request process wherever possible and could ensure that a minimum standard and timeframe of reply would be kept to following the request.<br\/><br\/>The list of information to which victims should have access should also be extended to include information on the bail conditions of the accused and the protections in place to protect victims from breaches of bail condition or intimidation.  We have all come across situations where a victim has come forward to make a complaint or has reported a crime, very often putting himself of herself in considerable danger, and the expectation is that when proceedings start it will only be a matter of time before the perpetrator is brought to book, yet he or she can go outside and see the perpetrator walking around the neighbourhood or, worse, approaching the house or engaging in practices that are very intimidating.  That is hugely disturbing and worrying for the victim concerned.  For that reason there must be a much greater level of information exchange and the victim must be informed of the conditions of bail.<br\/><br\/>On that front also an issue arises in this country in terms of anti-social behaviour, some of which can be of a most serious nature.  We are all familiar with it as it happens in many housing estates.  Such a crime is extremely difficult to address adequately.  Inherent in anti-social behaviour and crime is intimidation and threatening behaviour, in particular the threat of violence against an individual or his or her child.  When attempts are made to deal with that at community level, the Garda tells people they must come forward and give evidence.  People take huge risks in coming forward to give evidence and report crimes.  In spite of the Garda being aware of it and the possibility that several charges have been made against a perpetrator, and a strong awareness locally of the threatening activity of the perpetrator, decisions are taken at court level in terms of granting bail.  That is a significant disincentive for victims of serious anti-social activity to come forward.  It is a huge disincentive and discouragement to residents' groups who are trying to work with the Garda and local authorities to tackle serious anti-social behaviour, and an enormous disincentive to people to take that courageous step and report a crime.  There is a real issue about the need to inform and train judges and the legal profession generally in terms of the impact of some elements of community crime on vulnerable communities and individuals.  On a regular basis there is evidence of a complete lack of appreciation of what it means to release somebody on bail into the community the person has been targeting and in many ways devastating over a long period.  There is a lack of appreciation of that on the part of the Judiciary in particular and that is an issue that must be addressed.<br\/><br\/>Fundamentally, we must ensure that a minimum standard of support and uniformity of treatment is in place for all victims.  The current wording of the Bill does not specify the importance of referrals to services which are suitable for the victim's specific characteristics and situation.  The Rape Crisis Network has recommended that the Bill be amended to reflect more closely the wording of the directive.  Doing so would address the concern that rural dwellers will be disadvantaged due to the limited catchment areas of some of the voluntary agencies that support the provision of victims' services throughout the country.  That, again, raises the question of resources.  When it comes to support services and many social services there is a geographic lottery and for that reason it would be very helpful if there was a centralised approach in terms of referral and then access to regionalised support services.  Such support services and social services generally must be adequately resourced.  One can have all the legislation one likes but if the support services are not in place then people will simply not come forward and in many ways they will continue to suffer in silence.  While the legislation is welcome it is only as good as the funding and support services that are provided in order to underpin it.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is most welcome.  The points I have raised on the operation of the Bill, <i>per se<\/i>, are technical points.  The goal of the Bill and many of its provisions are to be warmly welcomed.  It has the potential to have a significant impact on the lives of victims and how they experience the criminal justice system.  However, it is important that we get it right and ensure the strongest possible model is commenced.  In that regard I trust the Minister will be open to amendments from this side of the House on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200024#W00200","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488466800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I very much welcome this legislation.  There have been some positive developments in the area of victims of crime in recent years such as the establishment of the Victims of Crime Office, which was set up in 2008, and the development of a victims charter.  However, the developments are not legislatively based and are therefore less effective in protecting victims.  As Maria McDonald of the Victims' Rights Alliance stated:<\/p><blockquote>For the first time victims will have rights and for the first time they will be able to go to court to protect those rights.  We've had a victim's charter in this country since 2010 but it has no legal force.  This has legal force.<\/blockquote><p>I would like to raise one issue that has also been raised by other Members.  The impact analysis indicates that this legislation has no additional cost to the Exchequer.  While that may be true on the face of it, I wonder whether sufficient consideration has been given to the additional cost of training staff in many State agencies such as the Garda and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  If victims are to be supported as they should be they will need proper advice, referral and support.  To do that in an efficient and effective manner staff working in the State agencies involved will have to have sufficiently trained.  I know the Minister is cognisant of that and has increased funding to both the Victims of Crime Office and Cosc.  I would just request that this issue be kept under review to ensure that we have sufficient resources to effectively implement the spirit and letter of this legislation.  The legislation is a very positive step forward for victims of crime in this jurisdiction and I very much welcome it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200026#Y00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1488466800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>For far too long in this country the victims of crime have been ignored and they certainly have not been supported appropriately.<\/p><p>Crime has many victims and causes huge psychological and emotional trauma and anguish, as well as the other more obvious physical, and in many cases, financial effects.  Victims have to go to court to bear witness to look for justice not just for themselves but for the community in which they live.  They then become witnesses, often feel that they are the ones on trial during cross examination and have to relive their difficult and often traumatic experiences.  Our victims deserve and need support, dignity and appropriate protection.  This is especially true for victims of sensitive crimes such as rape and domestic violence as well as children themselves.<\/p> <p> This Bill introduces for the first time statutory rights for victims of crime.  Those three essential rights are the right to information, the right to protection and the right to support.  One of the interesting features of the Bill relates to a visit I paid not too long ago to Dolphin House where I saw the archaic situation facing services relating to our family courts in Dublin.  One of the things that struck me was the lack of privacy for victims and the fact that they were in the same small packed space in halls as those accused of perpetrating crimes against them.  I found this quite appalling.  I can only imagine the difficulty this visited on those people who were, in the main, women.  I am glad to see the provision that there must be a separate waiting area for victims as opposed to those accused of crime.<\/p> <p> I compliment on Rape Crisis Network Ireland on its comprehensive submission, which contained many recommendations.  In particular, the recommendation that there be a victim ombudsman certainly has merit.  There is also a lot of merit in the 14th recommendation, which involves having pre-recorded submissions in certain instances.<\/p> <p> The State and all of us must encourage everybody who is a victim of crime to report it.  It is sometimes not a very easy thing to do but there is an onus on every victim to do that because that supports other potential victims down the line.  It is certainly not easy for people to waive their anonymity but I applaud those who do so to help others.  The case of Anna Ilnicka is one we have all read about.  The letter she wrote to Members of the D&aacute;il described in harrowing detail how victims of crime can be utterly failed by the health and justice systems in this country.  Anna wants and deserves an inquiry into the events surrounding how she was treated by State agencies following the brutal physical and sexual assault she experienced in 2006.  There was no sexual assault examination despite the recording of an allegation of sexual assault in hospital.  No interpreter was provided to take her statement nor was one provided later when the accused was in court on the assault charge.  No effort was made to keep her informed about the progress of the case.  The DPP decided that no prosecution would take place.  In her case, she alleges negligence and reckless disregard of basic requirements in dealing with her complaints of rape and sexual and physical assault.  This vulnerable woman was failed at every turn and her case raises serious issues about how we treat the victims of crime.<\/p> <p> The State has already missed a November 2015 deadline to put into law the European Union's victims' directive, which sets out the minimum standards of protection a victim of crime should receive so this Bill urgently needs to be discussed and improved to ensure no more victims of crime endure this type of treatment by the State.  It is important that a victim should not be treated by the courts as just another witness.  A victim should receive support and protection to enable them to participate in legal proceedings without feeling further victimised by the system.  Victims of crime deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, to be provided with information about the progress of any investigation or court proceedings and to be able to avail of interpretation services when they need them.  Two of the most important rights this Bill gives victims is the right to be informed about any decision not to institute a prosecution of the offence and the right to request a review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200026#Y00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488467400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>We discussed this Bill during a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality this week.  It is blatantly obvious that this is a massive area with so much at play.  There are so many issues to deal with.  I looked at the comments from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  The commission said that services to victims should not be dependent on the victim making a formal complaint or an offender being prosecuted or convicted.  The commission reported that there were 4,831 un-met requests for emergency accommodation for victims in 2016 alone.  There is one women's refuge in Wexford with four family bedrooms serving a population of 150,000.  The refuge receives on a regular basis women presenting with serious physical injuries resulting from assault along with traumatised children.  In 2014, the Wexford refuge turned away 338 women and 259 children.  In 2016, it accommodated 35 women and 45 children but turned away 244 women and 353 children.  The vast majority of women who contact the women's refuge in Wexford are victims of domestic violence.  In other words, they are victims of a crime but support services receive nothing in the way of State support.  As the figures show, this refuge is only able to deal with a fraction of the demand placed upon it by the most vulnerable in our society.  I have no doubt that it is not just a problem in Wexford.  When Wexford Women's Refuge submitted for a second time a comprehensive funding application through the capital assistance scheme to buy a property that would be converted into a facility with 12 self-contained rooms, the application disappeared - vanished off the face of the planet.  That is over a year ago and the refuge's application is still in a state of paralysis.  That will give you some indication of what we really think of victims of crime in this country.<\/p>  <p>  Another major issue is faced by victims of domestic violence, namely, the interpretation of what constitutes a victim of any crime.  The Bill states that a victim is a natural person who has suffered harm, including physical, mental or emotional harm or economic loss which was directly caused by a criminal offence.  In respect of harm being directly caused by a criminal offence, is an offence simply the reporting of a crime, does a charge have to be brought in respect of the reporting of a crime or does there have be a conviction in respect of the reporting of a crime?  I can understand that it is very hard for the State to record a crime if it is never reported.  We have a big challenge then.  We need to improve the level of reporting of crime.  If you never hear about it, you certainly do not know it happened unless the entire country is bugged.<\/p><p>Looking at some of the statistics, according to the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, less than 25% of women who suffer severely physically abuse report the incident to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Twenty-nine per cent of women who have suffered domestic abuse in some form or other report the incident to the Garda.  A Cosc study shows 213,000 women have been the victims of domestic abuse in Ireland alone but, based on its own figures, 150,000 of these women did not report the incident to the Garda.  These 150,000 women are still victims of crime but, because they did not report the offence to the Garda, they will not be entitled to the supports, services and protection that goes with being a victim.  That is 150,000 victims who are not victims.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has recommended expanding the definition of \"victim\" to ensure that a person may be considered a victim regardless of whether an offender is identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted, and that makes sense.<\/p> <p> We need to encourage more victims, especially those vulnerable to the risk of repeat and secondary victimisation, to report the crime to the Garda but in order to do so, we also need to build trust in the Garda and transparency in how it operates.  The Garda Inspectorate's report showed a massaging downwards of crime figures and a massaging upwards of detection rates.  The Garda Commissioner rejected this assertion but it must be wondered how she got away with rejecting the Garda Inspectorate report.  The massaging of figures was reconfirmed by both GSOC and the CSO in their respective 2014 reports.  The CSO went so far as to suspend publishing of crime statistics for a full year because of the unreliability of the figures.  That Commissioner is still in place.  Sadly, too many Members in here still seem to think that she is fit for office.<\/p> <p> The conclusions of the O'Higgins report reconfirmed serious issues detailed in the Garda Inspectorate report of 2015.  These issues include poor investigation techniques and detection rates, the absence of proper record or note taking, the absence of proper supervision and training, the appalling treatment of victims of crime, and the massaging of figures and PULSE records by garda&iacute;.  I am painting a sad picture but I am not making it up.  It is a difficult situation for so many people.  I am sorry, but we will not get people coming forward in a positive healthy fashion without reservation until we have total confidence in the police force.  The present Commissioner was prepared at the O'Higgins commission to send her legal team back in with false statements about Sergeant Maurice McCabe with regard to a meeting in Mullingar and was prepared to stand over it.  According to the O'Higgins report, this was done in a fairly blatant manner.  How, in God's name, will we expect people to come forward in trust with a police force that operates in the manner it does?<\/p> <p> Sometimes we expect too much of the police force in general.  I like to think that the majority of Members disagreed with closing so many local Garda stations, but I remember when there was a garda in the nearest village to me at home and everyone in the place knew him.  If one was robbed, one went to him because we trusted him and we had faith in him.  We expected to be served well by him, and we were.  It made such a difference knowing the garda.  He was part of the community and reporting a crime to him would be as natural as day.  Domestic violence is clearly a different area and there were always challenges there.  As a State, we have serious problems around openness in many matters around that but the disappearance of the local garda and the local Garda station has not helped.  I wish this Government or the next would rethink it.  While in the case of some stations it did not make any sense to have them open because there was not enough going on, there are many stations that should be open but which have been closed.<\/p> <p> If we are to introduce better measures in this area of helping the victims of crime, we will have to provide more resources to the Garda as well.  It is not only about IT.  There are extra resources going to them at present but these are generally IT-based.  More needs to be done.  There are a lot of garda&iacute; interested in doing their job properly irrespective of the fact that the hierarchy is rotten.  There are many good garda&iacute; in this country and they are not being well served by the system.  They will need more resources if we are to have the sort of police service that we would like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200027#Z00200","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488468000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>The fact that we have the Bill is welcome, as are many of its provisions, but in the limited time available I will concentrate on the number of significant omissions and gaps in the Bill, which is supposed to transpose the Victims Directive into Irish law but excludes some of its most crucial ingredients.  Other Members have made points around the issue of special measures for victims, the issue of restorative justice, the definition of a victim of crime and complaints by victims.  The Bill is lacking on all of those fronts in that it does not fully transpose the directive and leaves us open to infringement proceedings by the EU Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday we were privileged to have an excellent presentation at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality by Ms Maria McDonald of the Victims Rights Alliance.  Ms McDonald cited the shocking figure that 72% of the victims of crime feel re-victimised by the criminal justice system.  It is particularly shocking when compared to the fact that 49% of them feel re-victimised by the accused.  Therefore, victims are more oppressed by the State and its criminal justice system than the offender.  We have seen countless examples of the harm being done to victims of crime in the litany of reports, such as Guerin, O'Higgins, the 2014 Garda Inspectorate report and the Victims Rights Alliance report on the implementation and enforcement of the directive.  All of them categorically state the wrongs done to victims, particularly around issues such as the failure by garda&iacute; to record crimes, the failure to provide information to victims, and cases of victims finding out about the outcome of a case involving them, either through the media or through the grapevine.  They show the appalling treatment of those who have already been victimised.<\/p>  <p>  The O'Higgins report was stark about victims being let down by the Garda.  It is interesting that the Minister, at the time of its publication, referred to the findings being unacceptable as it was disheartening and that those concerned must take all measures open to them to ensure that these shortcomings are not repeated.  However, they are being repeated.  We would all be naive to think that the necessary reform outlined in the report has been delivered because it has not.  I raised earlier, at Leaders' Questions, a number of the cases of those who have been the victims of appalling crime and have been re-victimised by the treatment they got when they turned to the Garda to get help in having those crimes investigated.  If we do not deal with the issue of the urgent need for Garda reform we will not get the appropriate treatment for victims that they deserve.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the Bill's provisions the issue around not including restorative justice, from the point of view that the victims should be informed on first contact with the Garda of the available restorative justice services, should be addressed.  Article 12 of the directive provides that where restorative justice services are available safeguards must be put in place to protect against repeat victimisation to ensure that victims have access to safe and competent restorative justice systems and to ensure that they are put forward in the best interests of the victim.  All of this should have been provided for in the Bill because this is a most important provision, not only in terms of empowering the victim to confront his or her perpetrator in the appropriate surroundings but because it can have a profound effect on the offender as well in making that person understand the damage of the offence that he or she has caused.<\/p><p>If we get that right and implement it properly we will have fewer victims, which is the point we want to reach.<\/p> <p> The point made that these services are not available on a nationwide or on a statutory basis is not a good enough excuse because we know that members of the Judiciary have put forward recommendations.  In fairness, a very unsuitable one was cited at the justice committee yesterday where a judge asked a victim in a child sex abuse case to engage in the restorative justice system with the perpetrator who had not accepted the facts of the case, rejected the guilty verdict and clearly was somebody who had not acknowledged the damage he had done.  Asking the victim to engage in that process was incredibly wrong, inappropriate and harmful.  That is not the goal of restorative justice.  The way the process is set up is very important but we need to put more resources into that.<\/p> <p> The other area is the problematic definition of the victim that has been highlighted by other Deputies.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has made the point that the Bill should be amended to broaden the definition of a victim.  We agree with that.  Doing so would ensure that the services for victims provided for in it would not be dependent on the victim making a formal complaint or an offender being prosecuted or convicted.  This is in line with the victims directive, which requires states to ensure that access to support services is facilitated at the earliest point following a crime and that access is not dependent on a formal complaint.  The tight definition in this Bill is a significant failing which will have to be addressed at a later stage.<\/p> <p> That is particularly pertinent in the area of domestic violence.  We know from the 2014 Garda Inspectorate report the litany of the manner in which victims had been treated.  They include garda&iacute; being called out and saying, \"There's two of them in it\" or \"Just don't annoy him and he will not come back\".  A really shocking example was where garda&iacute; answered an emergency call to a home where a woman was being threatened by her husband and one of the garda&iacute; said to the woman, \"We've enough to be doing.  The next time we won't call back\".  Later that day, the husband returned home, stabbed his wife in front of their child who was also injured protecting his mother.  Both victims were taken to hospital, and it took three days to get a statement from that woman.  Broadening this Bill to take in victims like that woman and her child would have a profound effect on garda&iacute; in cases like hers.  It would highlight and intensify their obligations and would work to ensure that such catastrophic errors would not be repeated.  It is vitally important that we would examine that.  We know that victims of domestic and sexual violence in particular are very hesitant to make a complaint.  The inspectorate, in its many reports, provided several examples of where an investigating garda was directed by a district officer to put pressure on victims to make up their minds about whether they wanted to make a complaint, which is inappropriate.  If victims had access to support and services to protect them, that would protect them from pressure from garda&iacute; and would support them in their decision as to whether they wanted to complain formally.  The victims directive refers to indirect victims of crime, for example, children who witness domestic violence.  They should have the same access to support services.<\/p> <p> On the other areas, Garda training and increased funding is absolutely necessary if it is to be meaningful.  More funding and more resources are necessary.  The evidence given yesterday at the committee was that clicking on the link of the victims support services on the Garda website brings one to a defunct commission of victims of crime service.  That is wholly unacceptable in this day and age.  We know that 64% of victims said they were not informed by the garda&iacute; about victim support services, therefore the issue of resourcing must be addressed.<\/p> <p> The area of training for the Judiciary is critical.  Article 25 of the directive provides that officials likely to come into contact with victims should get specialist and general training appropriate to their level of contact with victims of crime to enable them to deal with the situation appropriately.  I am aware there are plans to develop training for lawyers and so on but that must be extended to the Judiciary itself.<\/p> <p> The other gap is section 16, which deals with special measures for very vulnerable victims.  The section states that these may be used but the directive states that they shall be used.  These supports include a victim to be interviewed by someone of the same sex in a sexual violence case and so on.  There are many good reasons those should be mandatory and limited only by overall considerations.<\/p> <p> The final point is to support the call made by the Rape Crisis Network and the Victims' Rights Alliance for the establishment of a victims ombudsman as a central point of contact for dealing with complaints.  As it stands, the Bill provides for information to be given on how to complain to the Garda, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, but those organisations would not be fit for purpose in this regard and an Ombudsman office would be far preferable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200028#AA00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488468600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I listened with interest to what Deputies had to say about the Bill over the past two hours.  I thank everyone who contributed to the debate and I am pleased to see the Bill has wide support.<\/p>  <p>  I will respond briefly to a few of the issues raised by Deputies this afternoon but I know the T&aacute;naiste is open to proposals which will improve the Bill and the rights and protections for victims where it is possible.  All of the points raised in the debate will be considered.<\/p>  <p>  On the definition of \"victim\", some suggestions were made by Deputies in the debate, and in submissions to the T&aacute;naiste on the Bill, that the definition of \"victim\" should be expanded, clarified or qualified in various ways to ensure that victims can avail of the rights under the Bill without a specific offence or offender being identified.  The definition of &ldquo;victim&rdquo; is the cornerstone of this Bill and of the EU directive and was very carefully considered in the context of both.<\/p>  <p>  A wide range of rights flow from the definition.  These include rights arising before a formal complaint has been made, during a trial and after an offender has been convicted.  The decision was made to include in the Bill a single broad and inclusive definition of \"victim\" mirroring that in the directive to ensure it is appropriate to every circumstance.  Deputies will note that individual sections of the Bill make clear that the victim&rsquo;s rights arise as soon as they make contact about an alleged offence and no proof of harm is required.  This approach also ensures that the Bill will be interpreted in line with the directive now and in light of any future rulings of the European Court of Justice.<\/p>  <p>  Restorative justice was mentioned by Deputies and concerns were raised about the omission of restorative justice provisions in the Bill as published.  I can assure Deputies that the T&aacute;naiste and I intend to make provision for the rights of victims who participate in restorative justice practices in this Bill.  Some legal issues have arisen around the most appropriate text for the provision, given the non-statutory nature of restorative justice practices available.  The issue is being considered, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and appropriate amendments will be brought forward during the progress of the Bill.  I thank Deputies for raising concerns about it.<\/p>  <p>  It is something of a new departure for our criminal law to focus on the needs of the victims of crime, but it is not unique. As the T&aacute;naiste noted yesterday, the Bill marks the single biggest step towards providing statutory rights to victims but there is a range of other legislative measures which will also enhance victims&rsquo; rights.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, enacted earlier this month, provides additional protections for victims of sexual violence and the Domestic Violence Bill 2017, which commenced in the Seanad yesterday, provides for a range of additional supports and protections for victims of domestic violence.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will provide victims of crime with information and support to help them through what is inevitably a very difficult time.  As colleagues here have recognised, it is an important step forward in supporting victims of crime and protecting victims, in so far as possible, from further victimisation.  I urge Deputies to support the Bill's passage through the House and on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Another point was raised in the debate about implementation.  A consultation group that was put together has been working very closely with the T&aacute;naiste on this issue and that group will continue to work throughout the implementation process.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200029#BB00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488468600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016: Referral to Select Committee","time":1488468600,"counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200029#BB00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1488468600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 149(1).<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200029#BB00500","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488468600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Mediation Bill 2017: Order for Second Stage","time":1488469200,"counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200030#CC00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488469200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Bill entitled an Act to facilitate the settlement of civil disputes by mediation, to specify the principles applicable to mediation, to specify arrangements for mediation as an alternative to the institution of civil proceedings or to the continuation of civil proceedings that have been instituted; to provide for codes of conduct to which mediators may subscribe; to provide for the recognition of a body as the Mediation Council of Ireland for the purposes of this Act and to require that Council to make reports to the Minister for Justice and Equality as regards mediation in the State; to provide, by means of a scheme, an opportunity for parties to family law proceedings or proceedings under section 67A(3) or 117 of the Succession Act 1965 to attend mediation information sessions; and to provide for related matters.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1488469200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200030#CC00300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488469200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Mediation Bill 2017: Second Stage","time":1488469200,"counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200030#CC00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1488469200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to introduce the Mediation Bill 2017 and I look forward to the discussion in the House on its early enactment.  The general objective of the Bill is to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs, speeding up the resolution of disputes and relieving the stress and acrimony which, as we know, often accompanies court proceedings.  The Bill also forms part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle the issue of legal costs.<\/p>  <p>  The mediation service is very important.  More than 20 years ago, when I was chair of the National Women's Council, we had a fledgling mediation service under Maura Wall Murphy and the Government of the day intended to abolish it.  I intervened and ensured it was allowed to continue and we have seen its progress over the years.  It gives me particular personal satisfaction to bring forward the Bill today.  I saw the potential of mediation 20 years ago and I see it today.  It has a vital role to play in reducing stress levels for people involved in various disputes and in providing a speedier, more efficient and less costly alternative to going to court.<\/p>  <p>  Support for the development of mediation as an alternative to court proceedings has been building in recent years.  In its 2010 report entitled Alternative Dispute Resolution: Mediation and Conciliation, that great body, the Law Reform Commission, once again reviewed the development and effectiveness of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and recommended the enactment of legislation.  The Bill takes on board much of what the Law Reform Commission had to say at the time.  Meanwhile, revised rules of the Superior Courts, which facilitate and encourage the referral of disputes to a process of mediation or conciliation, have come into operation.<\/p>  <p>  This matter has been discussed by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and no doubt members of the committee will have comments to make on the various consultations done by the committee.  Many of them have been taken on board.<\/p>  <p>  Mediation is defined in the Bill as a facilitative voluntary process in which the parties to a dispute, with the assistance of a mediator, attempt to reach a mutually acceptable agreement to resolve their dispute.  I emphasise use of the word \"voluntary\" in this context.  Mediation is, and must remain, a voluntary process although, of course, the court can recommend it and court proceedings can be put aside when people take part in the mediation.  Moreover, while the Bill seeks to promote mediation as an effective and viable means of resolving disputes, it is inappropriate for certain types of disputes, such as claims against the State for alleged infringements of fundamental rights or proceedings concerning children under the Child Care Acts.  The Bill outlines the areas where we feel it is not appropriate for mediation to be used.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan will be interested in the next aspect, and I look forward to hearing his practical experience on it, and this is with regard to the obligation it puts on solicitors and barristers with regard to mediation.  Put simply, the Bill requires solicitors to advice their clients to consider the use of mediation.  I have no doubt many solicitors and barristers already do this and anecdotal evidence certainly suggests this is so.  The Bill also requires them to provide their clients with information on available mediation services before embarking on court proceedings.  It makes this provision for solicitors and it will apply to barristers if and when in future they are permitted to issue proceedings directly on behalf of clients.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also requires that solicitors make a statutory declaration that the obligations placed on them by the legislation is discharged.  We also make provision in the Bill for the development of a mediation council.  This is not part of the general scheme of the Bill, but the legislation contains an enabling provision so such a council could be established.  As we know, various bodies are involved in mediation.  If they come together and, at a future date, the then Minister with responsibility for justice is satisfied that body can do the work of regulation in this area and develop an appropriate council, the Bill contains an enabling provision for this to happen.<\/p>  <p>  We want the main provisions of the Bill to come into operation at the earliest possible opportunity but specific orders will be required at a later stage.  We have various definitions in section 2.  I have already spoken about the fact that the Bill will not apply to disputes arising in certain areas such as those covered by the Workplace Relations Commission; matters under tax and customs legislation, child care, domestic violence, judicial review and proceedings against the State in respect of alleged infringements of fundamental rights.  Nothing in the Bill is intended to replace a mediation or other dispute resolution process in any other statute or in any contract or agreement.  The Bill also contains a number of standard provisions on expenses.<\/p>  <p>  Section 6 makes it clear that participation in mediation must be voluntary and it is for the parties themselves to determine the outcome of the mediation.  The approach includes qualifications for mediation, an outline of how the process will be used, the role of the mediator, the actions the mediator must take prior to the commencement of a mediation and how the mediator must behave during mediation sessions.  A mediator may, exceptionally and at the request of all parties, make proposals for the resolution and the Law Reform Commission stated this could happen, but generally speaking it will be for the parties to the dispute to agree the resolution.<\/p>  <p>  For the first time we will have a code of practice in statute for mediators.  Everyone will agree this is important.  This may be prepared and published by the Minister.  If another body comes into existence at a later time that body can draw up regulations and the Minister can approve them.<\/p>  <p>  Confidentiality is very important in mediation.  All communications by the mediator with the parties and all notes and records relating to a mediation will be confidential and cannot be used in other proceedings.  However, there are some exceptions.  There is also a section dealing with enforceability.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to section 12, I have already spoken about the possibility of a mediation council, which would be known as the mediation council of Ireland, having a role.  The section also provides that there can only be one mediation council in existence at one time and the council must be sufficiently representative of mediation interests and must also meet the minimum requirements provided for in the schedule to the Act.  There is also the possibility of revocation.  If such a mediation council comes into existence, it could make reports to the D&aacute;il or Minister to outline its work.<\/p>  <p>  Section 14 is a key provision which imposes obligations on a practising solicitor regarding mediation.  It specifies the advice and information regarding mediation which a solicitor must provide to his or her client prior to the initiation of court proceedings.  The section further provides the originating document to commence proceedings must be accompanied by a statutory declaration.  This will be outlined in court and a statutory declaration will be written and signed.  We must be absolutely clear that those who could benefit from mediation will be told this by a solicitor or, in future, by a barrister.<\/p>  <p>  Section 16 empowers a court to invite parties in civil proceedings which have already commenced to consider using mediation to resolve their dispute.  Under this provision a court may, on its own initiative or following an application by a party to the dispute, invite the parties to consider using mediation to settle the dispute.  This is a very important section.  If the section is used a report will be made back to the court.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 18 to 22 deal with the technical way mediation will be approached and fees and costs of mediation are also dealt with.  The Bill also makes a technical amendment to the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 whereby mediation could be used for personal injuries actions on occasion.<\/p>  <p>  Part 5 of the Bill is about the provision of mediation information sessions in certain circumstances.  The Law Reform Commission underlined the potential benefits of mediation in family law proceedings as an alternative to adversarial court proceedings and recommended that parties be required to attend information sessions in advance of the commencement of such proceedings during which the benefits and advantages of mediation could be explained, and section 23 gives effect to this.  The Minister may, for the purpose of ensuring the availability of such sessions at a reasonable cost and in suitable locations, prepare and publish a scheme for the delivery of such sessions, or approve a scheme for the delivery of such sessions by another person or body.<\/p><p>The Legal Aid Board is, for example, already involved in the provision of a free family mediation service, the benefits of which are widely acknowledged.<\/p> <p> This Bill is intended to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings.  I believe that enactment of the Bill will speed up resolution of disputes, reduce legal costs associated with such disputes and reduce or avoid the stress involved in adversarial court proceedings for many people.  It is an extremely worthwhile Bill and I hope it will get widespread support across the House.  It offers great potential for people in the circumstances which I have outlined and is a very positive alternative to court proceedings for certain situations.  It will not be universal and I have described the variety of areas to which it will not apply, but there is potential to help many people who would otherwise face costly adversarial court procedures.  Many people have trained in this area and it is well established.  I look forward to the mediation council for which the Bill allows.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200030#CC00600","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488469800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2017: Message from Select Committee","time":1488469800,"counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200031#DD00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1488469800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Health has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimate for Public Services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2017 - Vote No. 38.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200031#DD00400","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Priority Questions","time":1488469800,"counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200031#DD00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","time":1488469800,"counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200031#DD00700"},{"type":"question","time":1488469800,"counter":133,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[10593\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200031#DD00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of properties currently owned by the State or under a long-term lease to the State that are currently vacant; the attempts that are being made to fill them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The future use of the former Garda stations will be determined once the review of closed Garda stations, currently being undertaken as part of A Programme for a Partnership Government, has concluded.<\/p><p>The OPW has a clearly defined policy relating to vacant State properties that are identified as surplus to requirements.  The policy with regard to non-operational, or vacant, State properties and sites, including former Garda stations, is: to identify if the property is required or suitable for alternative State use by Departments or the wider public sector; if there is no other State use identified for a property, the OPW will then consider disposing of the property on the open market if and when conditions prevail, in order to generate revenue for the Exchequer; and if no State requirement is identified or if a decision is taken not to dispose of a particular property the OPW may consider community involvement subject to detailed written submission, which would indicate that the community or voluntary group has the means to insure, maintain and manage the property and that there are no ongoing costs for the Exchequer.<\/p><p>The Commissioners of Public Works have engaged with key local authority stakeholders and other State bodies to ensure that property is not disposed of when it might be deemed suitable for alternative State use.
