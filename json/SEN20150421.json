While I have great respect for the Minister of State, there is something fundamentally wrong when we table a Commencement debate directed at the Minister for Health only for it to be taken by a different Minister who may not be familiar with the issues involved.  We should change the way in which Commencement matters are selected to allow Senators to defer a Commencement matter if the relevant Minister is not available.<\/p> <p>There are serious concerns about the future and direction of mental health service in County Roscommon.  Morale among psychiatric nurses in the county is at an all-time low.  One of the causes for concern is staffing at Knockroe House, which is a high support unit for patients with challenging psychiatric behavioural issues.  At present the unit is only staffed by one nurse and one care worker during the day or at night, whereas previously it was operated by four specialist psychiatric nurses.  Two serious incidents occurred in the unit in recent times, both of which were of a sexual nature.  The first incident involved two patients and the second involved a patient and a member of staff.  These incidents were not reported to the Garda but they were investigated by the HSE.  I do not agree with the practice of the HSE investigating itself.  The Mental Health Commission is now investigating the incidents, which I welcome.<\/p> <p>The main reason I tabled this Commencement matter is to discuss a plan by the HSE to close the Rosalie unit in Castlerea, County Roscommon, which houses 25 long-stay psychiatric patients.  In the 1980s, mental health service policy was based on a document called Planning for the Future.  Under the policy, we established day care centres for psychiatric patients, supervised hostels and unsupervised hostels.  As these options were not suitable for certain categories of patients, we also established a long stay unit to provide for their needs.  The Rosalie unit fits the criteria under A Vision for Change to would allow it to remain in operation because it contributes to the 50 long stay beds available to a population of 300,000 between counties Roscommon and Galway.  However, the HSE has vetted the 25 patients at the unit with a view to discharging them to private nursing homes.  If they were wrongfully placed in the unit in the first place, can they now sue the HSE 25 years after their admission?  I recently observed a patient with dementia who was staying in a private nursing home.  She was uncontrollable and was attacking staff in the unit.  I do not believe that a private nursing home is the appropriate place for these patients.<\/p> <p>Staff in County Roscommon are highlighting areas of concern.  They are like whistle blowers but the HSE is not listening to them.  The same thing happened in Aras Attracta after a patient died but it was only when the HSE finally investigated the issues arising that the staff members who raised the issue were vindicated.  A further 34 staff have since been appointed to Aras Attracta but HIQA have indicated this increased staffing level is not sufficient in itself.<\/p> <p>It would be wrong to close the Rosalie unit in Castlerea.  It has been a family home for between 20 and 25 patients for the last 25 years.  All of the patients are elderly.  I will not allow these patients to be discommoded because that would be grossly unfair.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Kelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2348\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2348&amp;amp;pid=JohnKelly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Will the Minister of State convey my concerns in the strongest possible terms to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch?

I am taking it on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is in Latvia on Government business today.  She has asked me to convey her apologies to the Senator and the House.<\/p> <p>Recent years have seen the Health Service Executive's mental health services nationally tackle the challenges of reorientating from a hospital and bed-based focus to developing the structures and processes required for enhanced community-based provision in line with national policy under A Vision for Change which  recommends that integrated care be provided for service users in their local community and delivered primarily through community mental health teams, each of which would typically cater for a population of approximately 50,000 to be effective.<\/p> <p>Galway-Roscommon mental health services are committed to full implementation of A Vision for Change.  As such, their guiding principles are patient centeredness, equality, access to quality care that is focused on recovery, and integration with other mental health and mainstream health services.  Recognising the need to reconfigure services in line with A Vision for Change, the HSE in Galway-Roscommon appointed an expert group to review local community mental health services.  The report of the expert group was published in June 2014, with a focus on residential care settings and resources across both counties.  The key goal of the report was to make recommendations that would ensure service users maximised their full potential and saw improvements in the quality of their lives.<\/p> <p>The HSE in Galway-Roscommon provides an inpatient and community mental health service for a population of 314,000.  It is at an advanced stage in the implementation of A Vision for Change and has moved into population sectors of 50,000, appointed team co\u00adordinators and developed an overarching clinical governance model.  There are six general adult team sectors which are clinically led by two consultant psychiatrists and a multidisciplinary team, as highlighted in A Vision for Change.  Each sector has its own unique service needs, based on identified population, age groups, culture, etc.  There are 12 consultant general adult psychiatrists across the two counties which, again, is in line with A Vision for Change.  Recent initiatives include the development of a psychiatry of later life team, the provision of an intensive home treatment team for the Roscommon area, the opening of an adolescent day hospital and the provision of a 20-bed child and adolescent inpatient unit with a 24-hours admissions policy.<\/p> <p>In addition, Galway-Roscommon mental health services were successful in securing 58 additional new staff posts through development funding since 2012, of which 45 are in place.  The remaining 13 posts are at various stages of recruitment.  The make-up of these posts includes additional consultants in the areas of general adult community mental health teams, psychiatry of later life teams and rehabilitation and recovery teams, as well as occupational therapists, community mental health nurses, social workers and psychologists.<\/p> <p>In the light of the above and consistent with the approach of reconfiguring services across all areas, it is not proposed to undertake the type of review suggested by the Senator.  However, if he has any specific issue he wishes to pursue, he should contact either Galway-Roscommon mental health services or the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#C00200","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The word \"reconfigure\" has been bandied about by the HSE for some years.

Every time I table parliamentary questions, which I have done since 2011, the  waiting times are getting worse.  I will not judge the Government on my standards or Sinn F&eacute;in standards but on the standard that the Government and the Minister for Health have set themselves, which is that no patient should be waiting longer than 12 months to see a consultant, yet the figures for University Hospital Waterford show that 24,274 patients are on waiting lists.  Of those 8,478 are waiting longer than 12 months.  In the specialty areas, 835 are waiting for dermatology, 722 for general surgery, 736 for ophthalmology, 2,375 for orthopaedics and 1,939 for ear nose and throat services.<\/p> <p>The reason for this - I have had this argument over and again with the Minister for Health and the previous Minister for Health - is that since 2009, University Hospital Waterford has lost more than 300 staff, 130 of whom were nurses.  It also lost two surgical theatres, a ward, critical bed places and generally capacity has been reduced.  Year on year the funding has been cut.  The reduction in capacity from staff, beds and surgical space has meant that the hospital is not in a position to meet the needs of patients.  In addition, many hospital consultant posts l have not been filled.  A number of cancer specialists have been very critical of the lack of consultants in the dermatology unit.  Orthopaedic surgeons who work in Waterford regional hospital or University Hospital Waterford are critical of the lack of orthopaedic consultants.  It is clear there is a serious lack of capacity in the hospital that needs to be filled as is clear from the figures.  It is unacceptable that nearly 8,500 patients are waiting longer than 12 months to see a consultant.  Will the Minister explain to me and the people of Waterford and the south east why these people have to wait longer than 12 months to see a consultant?  Why do patients have to wait for so long?  Will he acknowledge that it is current Government policy that all patients should be seen within 12 months?  Will he outline what extra resources will be put in place, the consultant posts that need to be filled and when those vacant consultant posts will be filled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#D00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue which has been raised on many occasions, including during my recent visit to Waterford.<\/p> <p>Improving waiting lists for scheduled care is a key priority for the Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael Ring:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Under Future Health<i>, <\/i>significant structural changes are envisaged for the acute hospital sector, with the formation of hospital groups and the reorganisation of services to improve both quality and access.  These structural changes are under way but will take some time to fully implement.  In the meantime, operating pressures remain on acute hospitals.  The House will be aware that an additional &euro;74 million was announced earlier this month to tackle delayed discharges and emergency department overcrowding.  This was on top of additional funding of &euro;25 million provided at the start of the year and an additional &euro;3 million provided in late 2014.<br\/><br\/>As regards waiting lists, I understand the HSE has put in place specific measures to address waiting times.  These measures include observation of the national waiting list protocol, adherence to the relevant HSE national clinical programme guidelines and prioritising day of surgery admission, where this clinically appropriate.<br\/><br\/>I note that the special delivery unit indicates that there is still significant potential to improve performance in hospitals.  It is important, therefore, that hospital performance is closely monitored.  The House will recall that a revised accountability framework for the HSE was published as part of the 2015 service plan.  The framework requires a formal performance management framework for hospitals to include access, quality, outcomes and financial performance.  I am assured that waiting list performance will be assessed within the revised framework.<br\/><br\/>It is also important that we know the true extent of the waiting lists to facilitate better planning and management.  In that regard, an exercise to validate inpatient waiting lists to establish more precise information on the volume of people awaiting care has commenced.  In addition, the HSE has started to publish waiting lists at consultant and specialty level; therefore, it will be clear to all where the bottlenecks are.  <br\/><br\/>Taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, the Minister for Health has put in place a target that by mid-year nobody will wait more than 18 months for inpatient and day case treatment or an outpatient appointment.  By the end of the year the target will be revised to a waiting time of no more than 15 months.  The HSE is working on an implementation plan to achieve these targets.<br\/><br\/>I understand University Hospital Waterford has worked on a local plan to tackle its waiting lists which is being considered within the south-south west hospital group.<br\/><br\/>With regard to consultant appointments, I am advised that two consultant urologists are expected to take up posts in the coming months and that progress is being made in the recruitment of two consultant dermatologists.  The hospital is also in the process of recruiting a temporary part-time ENT consultant to assist with the management of the waiting list.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has confirmed that his Department will continue to work with the HSE to ensure issues relating to hospital waiting lists are addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#D00300","speaker":"1074","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>With all due respect to the Minister of State, he did not write that script.

It is also associated with many suicides and instances of rape, domestic violence and child abuse.<\/p> <p>Our alcohol problem is serious and decisive and innovative action is required to address it.  In February the Government approved and published the general scheme of the public health (alcohol) Bill.  This legislation forms part of a comprehensive suite of measures to reduce excessive patterns of alcohol consumption, as set out in the steering group's report on a national substance misuse strategy.  The aim is to reduce alcohol consumption in Ireland to 9.1 litres per person per annum by 2020 and reduce the harm associated with alcohol.

Excessive drinking creates problems in the home, for society and the health of individuals, while there is also a cost to the State.  The Government is serious about tackling the problem and will bring forward legislation in the very near future.

I began the discussion last week when I raised with the Minister for Social Protection the important issue of councillors' PRSI contributions.  Councillors receive a representational payment of &euro;16,950, from which the Government deducts PRSI for which councillors receive no benefit, a pension levy for which councillors receive no pension and USC, although the payment is not considered to be a salary.  To add insult to injury, the representational payment made to councillors no longer compensates them for the responsibility they take on and the extent of the work they do.  <\/p> <p>Taking the average payment made to councillors, to say we are treating local elected representatives in a shabby way is an understatement.  I am a trade unionist and have always sought fair play for those I represent.  In this House I represent city and county councillors.  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 was described by the then Minister, former Deputy Phil Hogan, as representing the most radical reform of local government in over 100 years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

Constituencies are now very large with fewer councillors to do the work.<br\/><br\/>The pace of change has been fast and effective.  Speaking in January, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, hailed local government as the engine behind recovery and said that by the end of 2015 local economic and community plans will have been formulated by all 31 local authorities.  If local government is the engine behind recovery who are the real drivers of this engine?  Who does the Minister of State believe translated this ambitious legislation into a working reality?<br\/><br\/>Our local government administrative structure is well-resourced and well-staffed with some very highly paid senior positions and we commend its work.  The elected members, however, have been the real drivers of change as that was what the legislation envisaged.  The former Minister, Phil Hogan, said, &quot;The strength of the new municipalities will be founded not on corporate status, but on the role of their elected members&quot;.  All over Ireland city and county councillors have embraced the immense challenges of reform with hard work, energy and commitment but how have they been treated in return?<br\/><br\/>To establish the exact position, as I am not given to hearsay and speculation, I undertook an empirical survey of every councillor in the country and here is a little of what they had to say: One councillor said, &quot;I work 50 hours a week as a newly-elected councillor.  This includes attending events.  I receive &euro;600 a month net after deductions&quot;.  Another said, &quot;I have to take a significant amount of time off work for meetings which are all held in the morning.  This means that I have had to take 12 days' special leave from my annual holidays.  In addition I have had to take unpaid leave to make up 24 to 30 meetings a month.  It is simply unsustainable; I am lucky with my employer [but] how many employers would be so patient?  I believe that we are closing out working class people from challenging for public office&quot;.  Another said, &quot;If Government is serious about attracting more women and particularly younger women who want to represent their communities as councillors then Government needs to start paying a living wage and ensure that councillors are entitled to a contributory pension.  I have a BA an LLB and a first in an MA hence I'm well educated and I am sure that if I wanted to I [could] get paid more in the private sector&quot;.  Another woman said, &quot;As a woman in politics I have to fund my child care cost from council salary&quot;.  This is something that we in the trade union movement fund for women who are members of the national executive.<br\/><br\/>One councillor said:<blockquote>I am struggling to find enough hours to do everything.  I cannot afford not to work in a full-time job as I have a mortgage and three young children.  If the council remuneration is not increased to a decent, fair level the council chambers will fill with those people who can afford not to work or those with pensions.  Representation will not be balanced, in a time of gender quotas, Government are ensuring that the squeezed middle, as the Government likes to call us, will not be represented going into the future.  A lot of my fellow councillors are thinking about resigning.<\/blockquote>Another said, &quot;Councillors work seven days a week 52 weeks of the year including Christmas day and are taken for granted also the general public think that we get a pension and that we are on a very large salary&quot;.  Another said, &quot;I'm a full time County Councillor and I hold 40 clinics a month&quot;.  One said, &quot;I work At least 70 hours a week to serve my constituents in a very large municipal district of west Mayo&quot;.  The Cathaoirleach will I am sure have some sympathy with that councillor.  Another one said, &quot;The public is totally unaware that we are paid close to or below the minimum wage for weeks averaging in excess of 45 hours.  We have no secretarial support, no research support&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The statistics are stark.  Some 26% of the respondents were female; 25% had only part-time work and 34% had no work at all; 37% had no income outside their council income; and 45% had no pay related social insurance, PRSI, other than class K, which means in effect after up to 40 years' service some will retire with absolutely nothing to show for their work.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

It is absolutely scandalous that some 47% of them, members of local authorities who must travel all over their constituencies, have no permanent health insurance.  In the event of an accident or disablement, they have nothing to look forward to.<\/p><p>I am coming to an end now and ask the Cathaoirleach to indulge me for a moment.  Some 33% of councillors said they work more than 40 hours per week and 64% claim to work between 11 and 40 hours.  Some 2% had over 30 years service and 67% had less than ten years.  More then 50% of those surveyed had less than &euro;10,000 to show for their service.  The greatest insult of all is that when they get their phone bill and separate their personal calls from their council calls.

In response in the House, the Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, indicated he will work with interested parties to see if a fair resolution can be reached in this area.  Perhaps it is to that the Senator is referring when he suggests he would like to see a working group set up.  The Minister of State has indicated he is willing to work with all interested people.  I understand very well the issue the Senator is referring to because I came up through the local authority system.  <\/p> <p>On the issue of salaries, Senators are already aware of the extraordinary number of hours elected councillors contribute in carrying out their wide range of functions in order to provide the optimum level of service possible to the public.  Being an elected member of a local authority is not a job of limited hours.  Councillors are continually called on by their constituents.  The ending of the dual mandate had an additional impact, increasing pressure to provide services to constituents on local authority issues.  Indeed, elected councillors may be financially disadvantaged in representing citizens, particularly where this necessitates them taking time off from their full-time employment.  <\/p> <p>A range of financial supports is in place to assist councillors in their work.  These supports include the annual representational payment of over &euro;16,000 which is set at 25% of a Senator's salary.  Annual expense allowances, retirement gratuity, mobile phone allowance and an allowance for chairmen are also provided.  The representational payment represents a recognition of the work councillors choose to undertake when they stand for election and, subsequently, serve their community.  This payment is not and never was meant to be a salary.  Elected councillors have a commitment to their role that extends beyond the financial; councillors know that the annual representational payment is not fully commensurate with their workload, yet they continue to undertake their functions with an admirable degree of dedication.<\/p> <p>The House is aware that significant changes have recently been made to local government structures by the provisions of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  My colleague, the Minister, has indicated that he intends to have a review carried out on the operation of the new structures and arrangements generally.  This appraisal will be undertaken by a broadly representative advisory group and a working group for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ann Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2293\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2293&amp;amp;pid=AnnPhelan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The review will provide a sound evidence base upon which to consider any further changes to the operation of the local government system in Ireland.  The ultimate objective of that system must be to improve the quality of life of individuals and the welfare of local communities while delivering the best possible value for money.  To this end, it is of primary importance to ensure that the new systems in place, such as the provisions for enhanced policy making and stronger oversight powers for the elected council as a whole, are being operated effectively and as intended.<\/p><p>I have no doubt that the workload of local authority members in the context of the new structures and the associated financial arrangements will arise for consideration in the course of the review.  I assure the House that full account will be taken of all views expressed on this and other matters as the work proceeds.  I thank the Senator again for raising these very important issues.

Last week my colleague in the other House, Deputy Niall Collins, and I published our proposals in this area.  There is quite a bit on which all parties can agree.  The absence of a Minister of State with responsibility for drugs policy is a deficiency and has taken away the focus required in dealing with substance and alcohol misuse.  I am chairing the north Dublin regional drugs and alcohol task force and aware of the need to properly resource this initiative.  There have been drastic reductions in the numbers of garda&iacute; in drugs squads across the country.  I am not saying this as a criticism but calling for a refocusing to recognise that the priority afforded to this issue has waned somewhat.  <\/p> <p>The types of drug being abused have also changed.  Taking Dublin as an example, the number on methadone has remained static in the past ten to 15 years, while in many areas the number abusing heroin has actually reduced.  However, synthetic drugs are now being used such as synthetic cannabis which is causing desperate damage, particularly to young people who are developing physically and mentally.  It is unfortunate that some Members of the other House and people abroad have the view that cannabis is actually safe - it is not.  The chemical make-up of the synthetic cannabis being sold is and has proved to be very dangerous.  I have met young adults who are in residential detox programmes as a result.<\/p> <p>I would welcome an opportunity to debate a national drugs policy with the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  The fact that he is charged with responsibility for this issue presents a problem because it requires the specific focus of a Minister of State.

It is an appalling human tragedy.  That was only one of the tragedies, as there have been quite a number of others.  It is important that we have concerted action on this at EU level.  A summit is being held on Thursday.  I ask that we request the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come into the House in the coming weeks to address us on the measures in this respect that are proposed to be taken at EU level and whether we will see a strengthening of search and rescue services, a reinstatement of the type of <i>Mare Nostrum<\/i>Operation that the Italian navy had been carrying out last year and perhaps an increase in the number of those cases settled.  In particular, we should address in this House what Ireland's response to this human tragedy will be.  There is a concern that a small number of EU countries are bearing a huge burden in terms of trying to deal with the terrible human tragedy of drownings and of human trafficking and that many of the northern European countries, including ourselves, are not so directly concerned.  We should be doing more on this and, in particular, taking in more refugees from war-torn countries such as Syria, Libya and so forth.<\/p><p>In this context, we should also address the issue of EU immigration law, the idea of a fortress Europe and, in particular, the Dublin Convention, which has caused a huge problem and the title of which, unfortunately, has the name of our capital city.  The difficulty arising from the Dublin Convention has been a cause of many of the  problems in dealing with the issue of immigration at EU level and the fact that the first country in which somebody arrives in the EU is the country that takes ownership of the issue.  We need to address all these issues with the Minister.<\/p><p>I wish to echo Senator O'Brien's comments on the drugs and alcohol strategy.  It would be a good move to have a debate on that in this House.  We have had some debate on it at the justice committee but clearly this is more an issue about health than about justice.  It would be good to have the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in attendance to address that issue and also to address the possibility of a junior Minister being appointed with direct responsibility for this area.  There is concern that the drugs and alcohol strategy has not been sufficiently prioritised given that there is not a designated junior Minister for this area.

This is a major issue that the entire international community must address.

They are charged 60 cent per &euro;100 to do so and they are, therefore, finding alternative ways.  If it was not for the credit union movement, many of these businesses would have to close.

I was reminded of this when the recent EU report indicated we have done quite well, comparatively, in regard to the cleanliness of our beaches.  Only five of them did not reach the necessary level, and that is one of the top rankings in Europe.  The reason beaches have done well is, in general terms, not as a result of Government or the local council.  In most cases, it is the individuals living near the beaches who have done something.  Across the country we see people who say that they want their own tidy town.  They say they want to do it themselves.  They are not going to ask the Government or the local council to do it for them.  They decide that if they are going to achieve it, they are going to achieve it themselves.<\/p> <p>In regard to the environment, if we are going to do things ourselves, there are definite things we can do.  There has been a spate of poisoning of some very valuable birds which we have had introduced.  That is horrific.  I do not know why this has happened but education may be a factor.  A debate should take place and this would be a good week for it as it is the week during which the Brent geese go home again.  They go home on 23 April every year and they arrive on 23 October.  It is amazing to think of the journey, all the way from Canada, and to think that they arrive on the one same day and go back on the one same day every year.  The swallows only arrived last week.

The State must seriously consider - I do not want to say crudely getting rid of them - selling off to other estates in Ireland in the first instance or within the British Isles the sika deer.

I am seeking an all-party approach to the issue.  We all know how the system works.  The Government will ultimately decide whether it will concede to giving better pay, conditions and pension rights to our county and city councillors.

Those advocating the legalisation of cannabis should see some of the people who have been affected by their addiction to cannabis and the dangerous synthetic drugs that are currently on the streets.  I will endeavour to have the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, attend the House as soon as possible for a discussion on that matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik and others referred to the migrants who were drowned in the Mediterranean.  This is a dreadful tragedy and there is a need for a unified, EU-wide approach.  We saw some of that yesterday, and one hopes EU leaders will get together on Thursday to address this major humanitarian issue.  Sharing responsibilities is an important part of that.  Senator Daly mentioned having it discussed at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, but that is a matter for that committee.  I am sure it will be addressed there by the Minister, but I will also try to get the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to attend this House to provide us with an update on the matter.<\/p> <p>Senators Barrett, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others raised the forthcoming retirement of Donncha &Oacute; D&uacute;laing who has had a notable career in broadcasting.

She also noted the possibility that the couple might visit Sligo, including Mullaghmore, the scene many years ago of the dreadful murder of Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Lady Brabourne and young Paul Maxwell.  When people recall that dreadful tragedy, Lord Mountbatten is the only victim mentioned.  It should not be forgotten that three others were callously killed on that day.  I am sure all Senators will welcome the visit of Prince Charles and his wife following the successful visit of the Queen and the President's successful visit to the United Kingdom. <\/p><p>Senator Mark Daly proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, that non-Government motion No. 15 be taken before No. 1.  The motion deals with the issue of PRSI and benefits for councillors.  Senator Gerard P. Craughwell raised a similar issue in the Commencement debate last week and the matter has been commented on by many Senators on this side of the House and Senator Diarmuid Wilson and others on the Opposition side.  I will respond to the point made by Senator Diarmuid Wilson.  I have no problem in accepting the motion which should be passed unanimously.  I, therefore, accept Senator Mark Daly's proposal that non-Government motion 15 be taken without debate before No. 1.<\/p><p>Senator Michael Mullins and his cousin, Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, called for a debate on banking charges for small businesses.  As Senator Michael Mullins noted, credit unions are helping many small businesses.  I take Senator Feargal Quinn's point that competition is key in the banking sector.  More competition is the only thing that will stir the banks into taking action on charges. <\/p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn also called for a debate on the environment and referred to the good news today on the cleanliness of the country's beaches.  He also spoke about the work done by local people, who take pride in their beaches and communities, including through Tidy Towns committees.  Voluntary effort is delivering very good results in this regard.  I also take on board the Senator's point about the poisoning of birds of prey which are protected species.  These are dreadful acts. <\/p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the gorse fires in Killarney National Park and the serious devastation caused.  As he noted, the emergency services are overstretched.  He also expressed concern for native red deer.  I note the points he made about sika deer. <\/p><p>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; called for an update on the new postal code system.  Senator Sean D. Barrett has raised this matter on several occasions and it has been debated at length by the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  I note the point made by Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; about the codes not being in sequence and will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White.  I will try to have the Minister come before the House to provide an update, but, as I stated, the matter has been comprehensively debated by the joint committee.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke mentioned the crisis in the Mediterranean Sea, to which I alluded, and stressed that we all had to play our part in finding a solution to this human tragedy.

The NTA has determined the tendering for about 10% of the market presents little if any risk to Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann's overall operations while giving the opportunity to test market pricing, offer opportunities to improve efficiency and customer service, as well as the possibility, subject to the outcome of the competition of bringing new operators into the market and enabling benchmarking.  I refer Senator Cullinane to the comprehensive reply I gave to those matters as raised by other Senators last week.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell asked about the Newbridge house fires.

I stressed that the Minister would meet the representative associations which is key.  I agree with Senator Wilson's sentiments that we should have a united approach and I think this House has a united approach on this issue.  Even Sinn F&eacute;in at the LAMA conference agreed with the united approach on this issue.  What has upset councillors is the circular issued only a couple of weeks ago with regard to subsistence payments.  If a councillor goes to a conference and a meal is provided, the councillor is docked about seven hours subsistence, amounting to about &euro;35.  This is a crazy situation and I am sure it does not pertain to the officials in the Department or any other officials when they attend conferences.  This matter will need to be addressed as part of those negotiations.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, stated that she would ask the Minister, Deputy Kelly, to meet the representative associations because that would be a first step.

The applicant must demonstrate an entitlement and the deciding officer will then make a reasoned decision from a position of neutrality and objectivity.  The submission noted that the outworking of this change would see more eligible applicants having to go to the appeals office to secure their entitlements, with the lengthy wait and hardship this would involve.

I refer specifically to an article by Victoria While in the <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>on 26 February 2015 in which she rails against this new policy change and makes the point that &quot;the Government will finish the job it began three years ago when it shunts a further 30,000 to 40,000 lone parents off their One Family Payment because their youngest child has turned seven&quot;.  She states further: &quot;Seven?  Who thinks children can fend for themselves at seven?&quot;  She believes, and I am inclined to agree with some element of this, that this initiative is about: &quot;getting single women into the workforce because that's what's good for them.  Implied in that idea is the belief that women at home raising children as lone parents are doing nothing.&quot;<\/p><p>It is important to put on the record that this is a trend that happened at the start of the Celtic tiger years at the beginning of the millennium where changes were made to tax laws by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government when Charlie McCreevy was Minister for Finance.  It was all about getting more women into the workforce, forcing them in, if necessary, because of an expanding economy.  That approach does not seem to have changed.  I have often wondered why there does not seem to be the same regard or acknowledgement for women who choose to work in the home and why it is always about getting them out of the home.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paschal Mooney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Why, for example, would a Government not introduce financial incentives for women who choose to stay in the home rather than giving them incentives through tax breaks to go into the workforce?<\/p><p>The Minister of State is quoted as saying that since its introduction in 1997, the one-parent family payment scheme, which provides an important income support to lone parents, has been passive in nature.  In response, Ms White stated: \"\"Passive\" is the word used to describe raising a child, or even children, on your own.  How could any job be more \"active\" than raising a kid?\"  The Minister of State's reference to passive in that sense upset her, and it does raise its own queries.<\/p><p>Ms White went on to state that what makes an absolute nonsense of the idea that the Government's policy is going to assist lone parents \"into employment and financial independence\" is that its worst insult is to lone parents who are working.  She says it is cynical to suggest that the family income supplement restores the loss that will be incurred by lone parents, that it typically restores 60% of the loss, and that is not counting the fuel allowance.  She continues in similar vein.<\/p><p>I heard the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, say this in this House but the quote I will give now is from the D&aacute;il debate in April 2012.  She said that the changes would not be made until we had a child care system \"similar to what is found in Scandinavian countries\".  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, was not a Minister of State when that comment was made but it received widespread coverage at the time.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, made it absolutely clear that she would not further erode and reduce the money paid to lone parents under the scheme, as she has now done and which is the purpose of this Bill, until and unless there was, as she put it, a Scandinavian model of child care in place.  That has not happened.  In fact, the Government has been abysmal in its neglect of the child care sector.  That will come back and bite every Government Deputy and Senator at the next general election because people are angry over the high cost of child care, and nothing of any substance or significance has been done to reduce the financial burden on them.  In recent years we have heard promises about the extension of the free preschool year.  That has now been shoved back onto the next Government.<\/p><p>In the context of what this Bill is about I do not believe it can be interpreted in any way as progressive legislation.  It is affecting lone parents particularly badly.  It is a continuance of a Government scheme that started years ago, but this Government is forcing women out of the home and into the workforce for economic reasons.  There is nothing I can do to change this but I wanted to put it on the record.<\/p><p>I want to quote the Carers Association.  The Minister of State might clarify this information because since I got it there have been some changes, so I ask him to forgive me if I am incorrect.  The Carers Association, on the subject of section 6, challenge why the back-to-work scheme could not have been extended to include family carers returning to work, allowing them to retain any qualified child increases that had been paid while they were in receipt of carer's allowance and to act as an incentive to assist their transition from caring to work.  That is clear.  I understand that people who qualify for this scheme will get a weekly payment of up to two years equivalent to any increases for qualified children they were being paid while they were on jobseeker's allowance or a one-parent family payment up to a maximum of four children for the first year in employment, and that half that amount will be paid weekly for the second year.  The Carers Association is asking why it could not have been extended to include family carers returning to work, allowing them to retain any qualified child increases that had been paid while they had been receiving carer's allowance.  The Minister of State might clarify that for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#DD01000","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I support the sentiments of the previous speaker who has articulated the concerns many of us have about this issue.  We tabled an amendment on it which has been ruled out of order because it would pose a charge on the Exchequer, which it would, but there would also be a beneficial cost to the State in ensuring lone parents and single mothers and fathers have access to extra hours of work and the ability to work full-time if proper child care were provided.

It passed legislation in 2012, the purpose of which was to lower the cut-off age for the lone parents scheme from ten years to seven from this July.  We believe that is far too young, particularly in the absence of affordable and accessible child care, something that was promised by the Government.  It was not something about which the T&aacute;naiste spoke lightly when she made a commitment in 2012, both in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, to propose changes.  It was promised by the Government to support working mothers and fathers, but apart from cutting funding to community child care services, precious little was done about this issue.  In fact, the Government cut child benefit twice, which added salt to the wounds.<\/p><p>I am disappointed that the amendment was ruled out of order.  In the D&aacute;il Chamber in 2012 the T&aacute;naiste referred to an immediate incentive to increase the number of hours worked each week.  She stated individuals would then be financially better off.  Her logic was that it was an incentive for women and other workers to work extra hours, but in the real world that simply was not the reality.  What we have seen, contrary to what the Minister said, is an increase in the level of precarious and part-time work.  There are workers on low hour contracts who want to move from working eight, ten or 15 hours a week to higher hour contracts.  We saw this happen at Dunnes Stores and it is happening in the retail and hospitality sectors and elements of the child care service.  Many of the areas populated by women are affected by this issue.  People want to work more hours, but they are not being given the opportunity to do so by their employers or if they are, they are working the longer hours offered.  In some cases, as in the case of the Dunnes Stores workers, they are working 30 hours a week and will be over the course of four or five years but are still stuck on ten or 15 hour contracts, with all of the disadvantages for the workers.  The Government has done precious little about that matter either.  Workers want to work more hours, but the supports needed such as child care are not available.  There is a huge lack of investment in child care which is holding back economic growth and the ability of many who are returning to work.<\/p><p>I do not accept the logic of what the Government is doing with regard to the reduction in the one-parent family payment age limit.  In section 6 we are seeking to increase it to 12 years, which we believe is the correct age.  In tandem with this, we want to hear from the Government on the issue.  The Minister of State might be able to enlighten us on what the Government intends to do to invest in child care to ensure families will have access to decent and affordable child care facilities to enable people to work the hours they want to work.<\/p><p>The Minister of State might also be able to explain also what he intends to do about the issue of precarious work and low hour contracts and the exploitation in the sectors I mentioned, which disproportionately has an impact on low paid workers, including women.  What does the Government intend to do about that issue?  If the Minister of State was to enlighten us, we might be in a better position to look more favourably at what it is the Government is doing, but in the absence of that happening, I agree with the previous speaker that this is not something to be supported, rather it is something that, unfortunately, will have a negative impact on lone parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#EE00200","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>In response to the first contribution and the reference on the forcing of women to work, the Senator quoted from the article by the journalist in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>about being passive.  I represent an inner city community and the first point I want to make is that not all lone parents are women.  I have seen lone parents in their 40s who have received no training, support, education or assistance to return to employment.  Some of them have been out of the workforce for 20 or 25 years and probably have no prospect of finding employment because of the huge gap since they were employed previously.  In fairness, in 2004 the Government of which the Senator's party was part made significant investments in terms of throwing cash at lone parents, but the figures show that this did not assist them in getting out of poverty.  All of the reports state the best way to get lone parents and others out of poverty is through employment and that is what the Government has been trying to do.  The experience in my constituency is that there are numerous people who have not been able to find their way back into employment, even during the Celtic tiger period, because of the long gap since they were previously employed.<\/p><p>The Senator said the Department was passive.  It was.  In numerous budgets it failed thousands of lone parents either in terms of the provision of training, education or assistance to return to employment.  We have moved away from this position.<\/p><p>With regard to child care services, the Senator is very much aware that an interdepartmental committee is looking at the issue and due to report shortly.  Additional child care places have been made available.  <\/p><p>There is no doubt that there has been major emphasis on the approximately 30,000 lone parents who will be affected by this change.  Approximately 20,000 lone parents will experience no change or some gain in income after the transition.  The gain for some individuals will be in the range of &euro;10 to &euro;150 per week, depending on their level of earnings and the number of children they have.  The remaining 10,000 lone parents, based on their current circumstances, will suffer an income loss.  This will occur because they are already in receipt of family income supplement payments or will transition to a jobseeker's payment, for which the means test is less generous than that for the one family payment.  The real issue is engagement.  Group engagements have been taking place because this is not the first group to make the move.  Some of the facts are that those in the initial group have increased their hours and the income coming into the family.  <\/p><p>This has been a gradual change.  There is tension because approximately 30,000 are to transfer on 2 July.  The Senator's colleague made the same points on Second Stage.  Senator Katherine Zappone said there had a long debate in the House in which the T&aacute;naiste had engaged extensively with every Senator.  I do not intend to go through the details again because they can be read in the Official Report.

In her article last February, Ms White notes that when the one-parent family payment was introduced in 1997, it included an income disregard provision which meant that, by 2012, lone parents could earn up to &euro;147.60 per week while still claiming the full one-parent allowance.  That income disregard has been steadily eroded, Ms White points out, and now stands at &euro;90 per week for lone parents.  The suggestion that the family income supplement, FIS, restores the loss to lone parents is incorrect, she notes.  In fact, it restores only 60% of the loss, not counting the fuel allowance.  A lone parent in part-time work whose youngest child turns seven years of age on 2 July next may wake up on that day and find himself or herself worse off by &euro;60 to &euro;80 per week.<\/p><p>What is the situation for the 800 lone parents who care for another family member and are currently receiving the half-rate carer's allowance?  If their youngest child is aged over seven in July, will they be obliged to rely on a full-time carer's allowance, thereby losing as much as &euro;86 per week?<\/p><p>These are the facts of what is happening, as highlighted by the people who will be impacted.  However these provisions are dressed up, their effect will be to leave lone parents worse off than they are now.  Where are the jobs these people are supposed to take?  I do not want to repeat everything Senator Cullinane said, but there is ample evidence of people who would like to work more but cannot get the hours.  These measures are nothing more than a cost-saving exercise that is being dressed up as progressive legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#FF00500","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>The worst possible outcome for members of jobless households is to have no role model to which to aspire.  I have seen this in numerous families where there is an intergenerational history of unemployment.  I do not accept that we are doing our best for children if we facilitate a situation where they grow up in a jobless household.  We need children to see their parents actively involved in the workforce.<\/p> <p>For lone parents of children aged from seven to 14, we will not be actively pursuing them to engage with their local Intreo centre, but we hope they will choose to do so.  There will be no element of force in this, which was a word the Senator used.  I certainly would not go along with the idea of using force.  My experience of single parents is that the vast majority want to return to employment.  We have come through an extremely difficult economic period, with almost 500,000 people out of work at one point, which equated to a jobless rate of 15.1%.  Through the forbearance and hard work of the citizens of this country, the unemployment rate has been reduced to 10%, or approximately 360,000 persons, which, nevertheless, is still far too high.  I do accept there are issues to address and the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash, is addressing many of them, including the situation at Dunnes Stores.  These issues must be addressed quickly and I hope to see the vast majority of them dealt with before the Government's term is over.  As I said, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, is already making progress in a range of areas.<\/p> <p>I am sure the Senator will agree that the best thing for children is to see their parents going out to work.  There is no question but that the surest way out of poverty is through employment.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, indicated at the weekend that the report commissioned by this Department on this issue is close to being finished and will be brought to Cabinet shortly.  I look forward to its publication.  There are gaps in the provision of child care, but that should not paralyse us into inaction.  Far too many people have been left behind on the scrap heap.  We must have a robust welfare system that helps people back into employment.<\/p> <p>The Department of Social Protection has been totally transformed in recent years.  No longer a passive Department that simply pays people according to their entitlement, it is now proactive in trying to get people back to work, into a better financial position and in a situation where they are more involved with their communities.  We actively seek out employment opportunities, engage with employers and recruit from the live register.  JobsPlus has been exceptionally successful in helping the long-term unemployed into work and is just one of a range of transformational measures initiated by the Department.  For too long, the Department was a passive entity.  People received their entitlement and it did not matter if they stayed on the dole forever.  The view now is that the Department has entered into a contract with taxpayers to do everything in its power to help people who have had the misfortune to lose their job to find new employment.  When the child of a lone parent reaches seven years of age, the Department will assist that parent to increase his or her hours to 19 per week, and that person will see a significant increase in his or her take-home money.  We are working with the Labour Market Council to ensure there are opportunities for lone parents to increase their hours.  There is a small number of bad employers in the State, but that will be addressed in the coming year.  I am confident we will see a transformed landscape.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#GG00200","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>My core point, and I am sure the Minister of State will accept it, is that there will be a financial loss to lone parents as a result of this initiative.  In pressing the point that it is Government policy to help lone parents to find a pathway back to full-time work, he is ignoring the question of what will happen to the seven year old child who is left sitting at home because his or her parent does not have enough money to cover the extraordinarily high cost of child care.  Prior to the Minister of State's appointment, the T&aacute;naiste indicated that the types of changes set out in this legislation would not be made until we had a child care system similar to what is found in the Scandinavian countries.  That commitment is hanging over her head because, as we know only too well, there has been no improvement in child care provision that would alleviate the financial burden on parents.<\/p> <p>There is no balance in this legislation.  On the one hand we have a Government policy, as expounded by the Minister of State, of securing a pathway to work for lone parents.  The reality, however, is that lone parents have children who need parental nurturing, care and affection.  They will not get it if the Department insists on forcing people - I use the word \"forcing\" deliberately - into a situation where because there are insufficient financial supports for them, they must find work to supplement their State income.  What happens to the children in those circumstances?  This provision is far too premature and should be deferred until there is some type of response from the T&aacute;naiste.  I hope the Minister of State will use his influence to press home this point.  He is surely pushing an open door with his boss given her stated view that changes should not be made until we have improvements in child care provision such that the associated costs are no longer the overwhelming financial burden they currently are, not just for lone parents but for the parents of middle Ireland generally.

Recently we have lowered the age of eligibility to allow younger people to participate in the child care programmes in particular, which has led to employment for many.  I would be of the view that we should encourage as far as possible a greater involvement in CE child care programmes.

I am sure that every Senator is familiar with the role of the Department in the area of child care and the CE schemes that are operational in all 26 counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#HH00300","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I am reassured by the Minister of State's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#HH00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"vote","time":1429623000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 18; N\u00edl, 6.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators Paschal Mooney and Diarmuid Wilson.<\/p><p>Question declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#HH00500","aye":["1148","1138","1150","1151","1124","1158","1117","1172","1152","1173","1135","1132","1118","1187","1169","1171","1143","1176"],"nay":["1116","1133","1159","1128","1154","1164"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429623000,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Section 7 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 is ruled out of order as it poses a possible charge on the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#JJ00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429623000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429623000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Question, \"That section 8 stand part of the Bill\", put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429623000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Sections 9 to 12, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Amendments No. 3 and 4 are ruled out of order as they pose a possible charge on the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#JJ00800","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429623000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429623000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Question, \"That section 13 stand part of the Bill\", put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429623000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Sections 14 to 17, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429623000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Schedule agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429623000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":167,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Report Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#JJ01400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#JJ01500","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429623000,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Report Stage ordered for Tuesday, 28 April 2015.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":170,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#JJ01700","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1429623000,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Tomorrow at 10:30 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015042100002#JJ01800","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429623000,"counter":172,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 5.40 p.m. until 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, 22 April 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
