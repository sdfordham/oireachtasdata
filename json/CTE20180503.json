As the Chairman said, I am accompanied by my colleagues Ms Mary Keenan, who is the head of corporate affairs, and Ms Geraldine Butler, who is the finance officer.  The committee will have received in advance of this meeting a briefing document detailing the 2016 expenditure and outturn as per the appropriation account.  I want to briefly outline the role and structure of the Department in 2016 and give an overview of the 2016 appropriation account and our administrative and programme expenditure.<\/p> <p>  The year 2016 saw significant changes in structure arising from the formation of a new Government, the changed relationship between the Government and the Oireachtas and a response to the new challenges posed by Brexit.  The Department continued to engage in national priority issues, as directed by the Taoiseach, such as jobs, unemployment, housing and homelessness, health, justice reform, social inclusion, rural development and Brexit.  In addition to its existing responsibilities, the Department was assigned new responsibilities in areas as diverse as the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, the Creative Ireland programme, data protection, the renewal of Dublin&rsquo;s north east inner city and the establishment of several independent commissions of investigation.  The Department continued to be involved in the reform and renewal of the Civil Service through the work of the Civil Service management board.<\/p> <p>  The year 2016 was a particularly important year for the Department of the Taoiseach as it saw the successful culmination of several years of careful planning for the centenary commemoration of the 1916 Rising.<\/p> <p>  The core functions of the Department in 2016 are set out as follows: delivering the executive functions of the Taoiseach and the Government; providing the Government secretariat; supporting the Taoiseach in carrying out his duties as head of Government, including in relation to the Oireachtas, constitutional issues, protocol, the European Council, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council; working with the Office of the President and with the Oireachtas; engaging with the formulation and implementation of Government policy, mainly through the system of Cabinet committees, senior officials&rsquo; groups, the programme for Government office and the parliamentary liaison unit; support for the Office of the Taoiseach, as well as support for the T&aacute;naiste, although that changed during the year because the Government changed; support for Independent Ministers in Government which also changed during that year; support for the Office of the Government Chief Whip, who also has responsibility for the Central Statistics Office, CSO; and support for the Ministers of State assigned to the Department, which includes the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, the Minister of State with responsibility for data protection and at least for part of that year, if my memory serves me, the Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs.  We also support the Government press office; provide briefing and advice to the Taoiseach on the full range of domestic policy issues and international affairs, including through the work of the NESC, which as the Comptroller and Auditor General said, is one of the bodies under our aegis; and support the Taoiseach and Government in the formulation of Ireland&rsquo;s EU, Northern Ireland and international policies, including co-ordination across the whole of Government.  We also deliver support services through the corporate affairs division, including HR, finance, IT and other services as any other Government Department would deliver.<\/p> <p>  Across all areas of the Department we spend a lot of time on parliamentary questions, preparing material for use in the Oireachtas, freedom of information requests, answering letters and queries from the public, organising major events, preparing speeches for the Taoiseach and Ministers and responding to media queries.<\/p> <p>  The outturn for 2016 was &euro;22.58 million against an Estimate provision of &euro;29.35 million.  The lower than anticipated expenditure resulted in &euro;6.76 million liable to surrender to the Exchequer at the end of the year.  Significant variations relate mainly to the programme subheads.  The tribunal subhead was &euro;3.4 million less than Estimates due to the number of legal cost claims settled in the year being lower than expected.  We have no control over third party legal costs incurred by tribunals.  It is impossible to predict the timing of settlement of third party costs or the level of costs.  This moves around year on year as Deputies will be aware.<\/p><p>The commissions of investigation subhead was &euro;911,000 less than the Estimate.  Two commissions were active in the year and both are independent.  Their expenditure levels depend on their needs and are not a matter for our control.<\/p><p> Subhead A1 was also less than the Estimate due to delays in filling some vacancies and the transfer of functions relating to the diaspora and EU engagement to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the fourth quarter of the year.  Just over &euro;15 million was expended on pay and administration.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General stated, this accounts for our main spending, with the balance expended on programme expenditure as listed in the Appropriation Account.  The 2016 account was audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, in whose report he noted that the account properly presented the receipts and expenditure of the Department for the year.  He further stated that he had obtained all of the information and explanations he had required for the purposes of his audit.  In his opinion, adequate accounting records had been kept by the Department and the account was in agreement with those.<\/p><p> I will briefly outline the Department's administrative and programme expenditure in the year.  The lion's share is spent on salaries, with a total expenditure of &euro;11.9 million.  At the end of 2016, the total staff numbers were just over 200.  That this was much less than we had estimated was mainly due to the changes relating to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the EU division.<\/p><p> In line with other Departments, we have non-pay administrative subheads.  These are small and are as follows - travel and subsistence; training and development; postal and telecommunications; office equipment and external IT; premises expenses; consultancy services; and value for money policy reviews.  The non-pay spend was &euro;3.2 million against an Estimate of &euro;3.8 million.  The briefing document provides a breakdown of this expenditure across.  Some &euro;433,000 was allocated in 2016 to cover the exceptional costs relating to the centenary commemoration programme, which was mainly organised by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p><p> The Department's 2016 programme expenditure was broken down across the following subheads: the National Economic and Social Council figure was &euro;1.8 million; the tribunals of inquiry figure was just over &euro;1 million; the EU engagement figure was &euro;276,000; the figure for Irish personnel in EU and international institutions was &euro;1.553 million; the commissions of investigation figure was &euro;2.489 million; the data protection figure was &euro;248,000; and the figure for diaspora affairs was &euro;825,000.  The document provides further briefing on these elements.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention and am happy to respond to whatever questions they may have about the account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018050300002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Fraser","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525334400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fraser for his opening statement.

There is no doubt that there is a case to be made on that.  That function is a separate thing.  I do not disagree that that is needed.  I said that during some of the debate that occurred.  For example, we saw a high profile campaign on the national development plan and the national planning framework.  The thing about it is that a sizeable amount of the money for the unit was spent on that campaign alone.  It is not that both of those plans are not important but they would merit coverage in local media anyway by virtue of the fact that a plan would be something that would be happening over such a long period of time and there was going to be capital spending over 20 years.  There was something for everyone in the audience.  Local media would be very happy to cover that yet public money was spent on that campaign.  <\/p> <p>  Reading some of the claims made on the project 2040 content in the print media, the advertorials essentially looked like they were normal coverage.  In a lot of cases they had a little banner across the top and fitted in as though they were normal news items.  Even the perception that they are normal news items is a problem.  That was a very well planned campaign that was done across the country.  I am not saying there is not merit in communicating a new approach to the national planning framework or how the capital spending should happen in parallel with that, but is Mr. Fraser, as the Accounting Officer, comfortable with the way it was communicated and the amount of money that was spent?  In terms of how it might blend the political with the administrative, does Mr. Fraser think there was an appropriate separation there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018050300002#D00800","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525334400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I did a very long report on the matter.

Some\u00a0700 submissions were generated by the\u00a0publication of the Issues and Choices\u00a0paper\u00a0and over 1,000 submissions were received during the 6-week public consultation on the draft NPF.\u00a0 Finalisation of the NPF benefited substantially from these submissions.

Now there is more talk about whether we should have a tribunal or a commission.  Why are all of these being set up?  Does Mr. Fraser share my frustration that many of these issues arise because the system does not give us the information we need?  The information is there, obviously, but we are not getting it.  For that reason, we are scrambling to figure out what to do.  We are deciding whether to set up a commission or a tribunal, but we would not need to have all these commissions and tribunals if the Civil Service did its job in the first instance and subsequently, when mistakes are found to have been made, if the Civil Service was upfront about them and gave us the information.

The important point is that when one decides to use a particular system, one must look at it on a whole-of-life basis.  When one is originally selecting somebody to build a system or to customise it, one must take into account that it will be used for ten years.  One should be factoring into the evaluation and the business case for it the fact that it is going to be used for ten years, that one will be paying maintenance costs, an annual licence fee and so on.  One can approach the value for money issue at the beginning but what very often happens is that at the end of ten years, one continues to use the system and so every year one needs to be thinking about whether now is the time to look again and move to a new system.  Technologies move on and so on.  It is certainly something that is worth thinking about.  A serious mistake could be made where, for example, one looks at a three-year contract for something, the maintenance costs then become exorbitant but one is locked into the system and one has to incur a fairly major capital expense to change it.

Certainly, in my limited experience of two years, if questions were put and answered properly, we would not need tribunals or commissions of investigation.  I now want to focus on the State Claims Agency, the role of which Mr. Fraser kindly outlined.  I asked in the D&aacute;il on Tuesday how many cases other than that of Ms Vicky Phelan were with that agency but I got no answer.  That is one very practical example from Tuesday last.  Mr. Fraser might say that he is not here to answer those questions but he is, in fact.

I specifically asked about the State Claims Agency and the reporting mechanism therein.  Subject to checking the record, I think I was told it was an independent body.

On the face of it and based on what we have seen so far, if there is to be a tribunal, it will be under the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Department of Health will be a subject of the inquiry, as will the Department of Finance because of its handling of the State Claims Agency, as well as the agency itself.  The Department of the Taoiseach is the only one that has had no involvement in this.  The Departments of Health and Finance are involved, as is the State Claims Agency.  I would argue that neither the Minister for Health nor the Minister for Finance are the appropriate people to head up an inquiry or a tribunal.  It will probably fall back to Mr. Fraser, as Accounting Officer of the Department, to account for this when it comes down the road.  Does Mr. Fraser see the logic in what I am saying?  I cannot see that any other Department could take on a tribunal or commission of investigation or whatever transpires.  The Department has been through a tribunal process previously and it is most disappointing that it cannot put a final estimate on the outstanding costs of the first tribunal of inquiry.  Mr. Fraser has said that the Department must wait until all claims have been submitted but someone in the Department must be handling it and must know how many cases are still outstanding and have at least an estimate of what is out there.  I would hope that if Mr. Fraser and his Department are going to be responsible for a future tribunal or commission of investigation, they will put a good system in place to deal with costings, financing and so forth, before it is up and running in order that Mr. Fraser's successor and my successor will not be saying in ten year's time that they still do not know how much the tribunal or inquiry has cost.  That is not good enough for public confidence in the financial side of things.  Does Mr. Fraser take my point?

That is a good thing and one of the issues that has been lost in all of this is that this needs to be done to address the silo mentality we have.  I return to my earlier comment regarding the lack of a metric for measuring the performance of the unit and setting out the logic for such a unit, the reasons for its establishment, what it was trying to achieve and what would be the benchmarks and performance indicators.  Teachta Connolly noted there was something in a memorandum that was submitted to government.  We have not seen anything of that significance.  The valuable lesson that should be learned is the need to set out the logic, processes and benchmarks and measure these against the logic for setting up the unit in the first place.  That did not happen in the case of the strategic communications unit, which is the reason it was opened and shut down in a period of approximately five months.

We will discuss this now as part of the work programme.  The key item the Committee of Public Accounts must ensure is that proper systems are in place in all of the organisations subject to public audit and that proper corporate governance arrangements are in place for all these organisations.  The board of directors, or whoever the most senior people are, have a duty to ensure that proper procedures and systems are in place to account for public money.  One of the first basic elements of accounting for public money is to provide accounts that can be audited and discussed in public at this committee.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has done various reports on a number of organisations that were slow in producing their annual accounts.  Unless we receive financial statements from these organisations we are not even in a position to discuss what is going on in them.  Last December, at the request of the committee, I issued a letter to the approximately 250 organisations audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General stating we wanted them to comply with their statutory requirement to have their accounts with the Comptroller and Auditor General by the end of March.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has given us a list, which I will summarise but I will not read it all out.  We have been dealing with this every week for the past couple of weeks.  Out of the almost 300 accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, only 37 accounts have not been received by his office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018050300002#V00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525334400,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>They had not been received by 30 April.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018050300002#V00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1525334400,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>This means 87% of public bodies have submitted their accounts, which is a major improvement on last year, as a result of us highlighting that issue.

Our job is to examine systems, practices and procedures and costs to the State.  I am conscious that the most important issue is the cost to the women involved, of which we are all aware and conscious.  We have a specific role in that regard.  It might seem cold to people listening, but we can and have to examine where there might have been systems failures, process failures and procedural failures and how they could have cost the State money.   The first obvious one is that the system was outsourced, it seems against advice.  That outsourcing could potentially have cost the State money.  If there is a redress scheme, I imagine there will be a cost to the State.  A circular was issued to general practitioners, GPs.  We do not know who made the decision to issue it.  That seems to have been a failure that could cost the State money.  To say the very least, there were certainly breakdowns in communication.  There are allegations of a cover-up made by the solicitor of the lady who took the court case.  If that is the case and it costs the State money, it is obviously a difficulty.  Then there is the role of the State Claims Agency.  One of the issues at the heart of it is, unfortunately, that the woman concerned was dragged through the courts.  She had to fight every step of the way to get information that should have been made available to her.  <\/p> <p>  We are back to the point made in the earlier discussion with Mr. Martin Fraser.  The system seems to be at sixes and sevens in even being able to give us any information.  Either intentionally or unintentionally, deliberately or not, with the public, we are not in a position to get answers to questions.  The matter has been debated in the D&aacute;il and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health will examine it.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach will also look at it.  We have a very specific remit which we need to use because people need to be held to account.  There may be scoping reviews and, at some point, other investigations and examinations, but we have a particular role to play.  The starting point should be where process failures cost the State money.  I refer to the State Claims Agency and its role in fighting the case at greater cost to the State.  That is also an issue for us.  That is my recommendation to the Chairman.  I emphasise as strongly as I can that while I am talking about a cost to the State, I am deeply conscious of the cost to the women involved which is the most important overriding issue.  However, our remit is financial.  That is why I am emphasising that aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018050300002#W03500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1525334400,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>Deputy Marc MacSharry also has a letter.

I agree fully with Deputy David Cullinane.  This committee purely discusses value for money related issues.  Similar to Deputy David Cullinane, when the decision was made, if it was based on there being sufficient capacity, was there an examination of the scaling up of resources in the area of pathology, as opposed to having tests carried out abroad?  Could that have been done in parallel in order that we could have saved money?  We could be gearing up for other clinical programmes where there is already a lot of testing for various illnesses and there are plans for more.  Was that done and, if so, what did it show?  Was there a robust public procurement process to select the laboratories to be used?  What assurances about the level of competence were given in selecting the laboratories?  Did they form part of the procurement process criteria?  What is the nature and terms of the contracts in place?<\/p> <p>  There has already been a cost to the State in legal fees, communications fees and other fees.  We are only at the beginning of the crisis.  Clearly, there are going to be substantially more costs.  Within the contract, is the State eligible for compensation, as well as the individuals affected?  I refer to the cost and fallout of the problem.  The State will have to divvy up a huge amount of money, not just for redress but also for costs because this happened.  Do we have any comeback against the laboratories if, in fact, they are responsible?<\/p><p>I heard some criticism in the media today that the body politic is, with manufactured anger, jumping up and down to try to deal with this process.  However, if any of us can contribute in some small way to the very important need to restore confidence in testing and so on, we need to do so as quickly as possible.  Quite separate from scoping, commissions of investigation and whatever else is happening, we should do so pretty quickly because once this process starts, whatever form it may take, the shutters will come down and there will be no information at all for the public.  We have a small role on the value-for-money side that we could usefully fulfil, as Deputy Cullinane has said.

There could end up being a healthcare cost due to people avoiding screening, which in turn could result in another cost.  If one is talking about saving money, sometimes cutting corners, as opposed to investment, is not the way to do it.

There are things like that that jumped out, the fact that some of these things were established as pilots.  We need to understand how the process was then rolled out, and we need to understand the interaction with the State Claims Agency, which appears to be taking a different approach, judging by the apologies that are made outside the courts on a routine basis.  I still think, regarding the interaction between these two bodies, if they are not acting in symmetry in respect of the open disclosure approach, we do not have an open disclosure approach but an adversarial approach.  We need to square that circle or see where that conflict is happening because it is very obvious that it is playing out in public.<\/p> <p>  The other point we were talking about is how we reduce the legal costs in respect of settlements and stop putting people through the torment of court.

Deputy O'Sullivan made some remarks in 2008 during the debate on this matter.  I went back to the transcript to see what others had said and it was interesting that one Member, who was not known to me, said this was a decision that was penny wise and pound foolish and shortsighted.  I suppose we are now seeing the appropriateness of that remark - during a Second Stage debate I think - in terms of the prospective cost to the taxpayer.  As members of this committee, it should be important for us to note that the precise nature of the settlement of the case in respect of the extraordinarily brave Vicky Phelan was met by the US lab and not the taxpayer.  That is the first thing and it is an interesting point for us to note in the context of the discussion on a redress scheme being established.  Deputy Cullinane hit the nail on the head when he asked whether the laboratory will meet the cost.  Is there redress for the State?  These things will have to be discussed in the context of the HSE or the unit appearing before this committee.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am acutely aware that if wrong has been done - clearly it has - the committee, I am sure, does not wish to interfere in the establishment of facts, which is not for this committee, respectfully.  To Deputies Cullinane and MacSharry I say I am all for the HSE coming before the committee and answering questions on this subject matter, but at the same time we have to give, as I think the Taoiseach said, space and time in order that we can actually make the decision.  That decision will be made by Members of the D&aacute;il in consultation with the leaders and spokespersons and that is the most appropriate thing.  With that small caveat, I entirely support the call by Deputy Cullinane.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I think there are some questions that are perhaps not appropriate for this committee but I will put them out there anyway.  The overall cost to the taxpayer versus the provision of the service in this State was the point I read from the 2008 debate that I found most interesting.  It was a very common theme across most Members of the House, other than the Government, of course, but that is unsurprising.  The point was whether we had the capacity to provide this service within the State in an efficient manner.  As someone who looked at the options that are available to the women of this country in terms of the results of the smear tests, it is quicker to send them away.  There is a question there as to whether it might take longer but cost less and whether it is something that is extraordinarily time-sensitive in the context of this screening process taking place.  These are questions that we have to ask about the remit of this committee and whether it might not be more appropriate for us to at least have a State agency, a State-owned agency or a firm operating in this State to be able to come before us in the future, for instance, if we were to vary the policy as a result of the controversy surrounding this particular matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018050300002#X01600","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1525334400,"counter":1113,"content":"<p>I support Deputies Cullinane and MacSharry.  Deputy MacSharry has set out his serious concerns in his email.  I will not repeat them but they are clearly set out.  There are issues that must be looked at.  We should consider bringing the State Claims Agency in before the committee.  It comes under the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which has also come before us.  That is one avenue we could immediately look at to get clarification generally.<\/p> <p>  With regard to being penny wise and pound foolish, I sat on a health forum for ten years.  I was there when the decision was made to privatise the service.  I come from a city that had a first-class laboratory, which was used to roll out the first phase of the cervical smear tests because the laboratory was so good and it had such capacity.  The problem arose for two reasons.  First, the capacity of the public system was deliberately run down and the expertise was lost and second, a policy decision was made through a Progressive Democrats philosophy that outsourcing was good, cheaper, quicker and better.  I must clarify this because it is about more than being penny wise and pound foolish.  At the time we knew it was not.  This was not me; it was the experts who were busily engaging with us in 2008.  We clearly put this on the record, not because I was saying it or because I was on the left of the political spectrum, but because the experts were telling us that the decision was dangerous, wrong and would come back to haunt us.  It is a fact that these opinions were absolutely ignored.  Since then I have had details as to the expertise of the service.  Even I was not aware of how expert it was and that it was chosen as a pilot project.<\/p> <p>  On the role of this committee, I do not know how we are to tease this issue out.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General might help us.  In value for money terms, nothing was presented to us to show that the service was more efficient or faster.  No evidence of the sort was presented to us at the time.  I would like to see the documents for the business case for changing the service providers.  As with the business case for the strategic communications unit, what underpinned this outsourcing other than a philosophy that privatisation was best?  There is scope for us to look seriously at the State Claims Agency or the NTMA, or whichever is the appropriate body, to come in to the committee.  It is unacceptable that practical aspects were not answered two days ago in the D&aacute;il.  It now transpires there were 21 cases.  Ten are active cases, six have initiated proceedings, four have written letters and there is one other case.  The case numbers are rising on a daily basis.  None of that practical information was available in the D&aacute;il.

If a redress scheme is set up, I cannot see how a redress scheme set up by the State or by a Minister can force a private company to do anything.  It would be a civil matter between the private company and the individual.  I imagine that a redress scheme would look at the State's failure and the HSE's failure and how it impacted on women.  That will be a cost to the State.  Redress costs will not be borne by any private company.  There will be parallel processes with private civil court cases between the company and individuals, and the redress process looking at where the State messed up or, what the Taoiseach described as a cock-up.

The letter was from Ciar&aacute;n Breen, the director of the State Claims Agency.  If people would like to follow up on the correspondence it is reference No. PAC 32-1-708.  It was interesting because we had asked the State Claims Agency about the management of claims.  In that document, the agency told us that it had &euro;2.66 billion worth of claims on its books at that stage.  The vast majority of those claims related to clinical negligence.<\/p><p>The letter continued to give a breakdown of the payments in 2017.

As the Chairman mentioned, I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Jim Jennings, director of content, Ms Breda O'Keeffe, chief financial officer and Ms Eimear Cusack, director of human resources.<\/p><p>I hope that, between us, we will be able to answer any questions members may have.  I also hope they have had the opportunity to read the briefing material we prepared and submitted earlier this week.  As per the letter of invitation, the material covers in some detail how public funding in RT&Eacute; is used and accounted for, and the extensive regulatory and oversight mechanisms that pertain to RT&Eacute; and RT&Eacute;'s reporting.  As clarified last week, it also specifically covers how RT&Eacute; operates as an employer and sets out the context and issues in the recently published report on the future of RT&Eacute; orchestras.  I do not intend to go over the briefing material in my opening remarks, but we are happy to elaborate on any questions members may have.<\/p><p> I would like to outline the broader issues that are relevant to today&rsquo;s discussion.  I welcomed in the Chairman's letter of invitation the fact that the committee is supportive of the independence of RT&Eacute; and that matters of programming are not intended for discussion.  Editorial independence and impartiality is the bedrock of public service media in Ireland.  It is central to understanding why RT&Eacute;'s journalism and programming remains highly trusted by the public, and still retains such large audiences on television, radio, online and on mobile devices, despite the growth of many alternatives.  However, as the committee will surely acknowledge, what we can produce and commission, and the quality of all we do is inextricably linked to the resources we have.  It may appear to some that the organisation has plenty of money but given the scope and breadth of our statutory obligations, the range of services we must provide and the nature and scale of the competition we face, RT&Eacute; has inadequate resources.  Over the past number of years that has been confirmed by numerous independent reports and reviews that have examined in detail everything RT&Eacute; does, and is obliged to do.  As the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment conveyed in its briefing material to the committee, the cost of RT&Eacute;'s public service activities is substantially in excess of the public funding it receives in the form of licence fee revenue.  The balance comprises commercial revenue which, as members will note from the briefing material, has fallen by 36% or close to &euro;90 million over the past ten years.<\/p><p> The greatest risk to public service broadcasting in Ireland and many other countries is restricted funding at a time of unprecedented competitive threats and fast-changing media consumption habits.  It would be remiss of me as director general at a time of such turbulence in media, when so much of what we have relied upon for our news, information and culture is under such threat, not to impress on members the urgent and substantial financial challenges facing RT&Eacute; and, by extension, the broader sector that relies on a healthy RT&Eacute;.  Since 2008, RT&Eacute;'s overall annual funding has fallen by in excess of &euro;100 million or 23%, while, in parallel, our obligations to develop online and mobile services and to fund and deliver digital television have increased substantially.  This is why we are not investing enough in television drama, children&rsquo;s programming, arts and culture output, and Irish language television programming &ndash; programming that is essential if RT&Eacute; is to support and sustain Irish culture and Ireland's most talented writers, animators, directors and actors.  This is why RT&Eacute;'s investment in the independent production sector has halved from &euro;79.5 million in 2007 to just under &euro;40 million in 2016.   This is why we are finding it harder to sustain audience share and compete for commercial revenue against highly resourced competitors such as Virgin Media, SKY, BBC, ITV, Netflix, Amazon and a host of opt-out channels that take advertising from Ireland but invest little or nothing in Irish programming or the Irish creative sector.  This is why we do not have enough international-foreign correspondents at a time global and international affairs are affecting the lives of Irish people more than ever.  This is why we are struggling to maintain, let alone grow, our investment in investigative reporting and programming, which is essential to our public purpose but which is high risk, difficult to produce and expensive.  This is the context for the review we have just published on RT&Eacute;'s orchestras.  This is why we have had to restrict capital investment to 50% of depreciation for almost ten years now, which is unsustainable for any industry but particularly for one that is changing so quickly. <\/p><p> There is much RT&Eacute; can do and is doing to change the organisation to meet the challenges of the digital era.  We are completely restructuring how we operate, moving away from traditional media-based structures and reorganising around key areas of output across our services such as drama and comedy, arts and culture, news and current affairs, factual, sport, Irish language, and young people's.  We have sold a significant portion of land in Donnybrook, freeing up finance to invest in critical digital infrastructure and building fabric that has been in existence since the 1960s.  Anyone who visits RT&Eacute; today will see this change very much in evidence.  We reduced our costs substantially - by &euro;96 million or 22% - between 2008 and 2016 through a series of measures, including pay cuts and a large reduction in our workforce.  We have much to do but we are well under way.  This is a difficult process, particularly for staff, of whom much is being asked, but we are determined to ensure RT&Eacute; continues to remain at the centre of Irish public and cultural life as so much changes around us.<\/p><p> Just as there is, rightly, a responsibility on me, and on us, to modernise and change RT&Eacute;, surely there is also an obligation on policymakers and Government to modernise the television licence system, which is fundamentally unfit for purpose and unreflective of how people consume and interact with public service media and content today.  As we have detailed in our briefing note, television licence evasion currently stands at 15%, which results in a gross loss of approximately &euro;37 million annually; \"No television homes\", due to outdated television licence exemptions result in a gross loss of &euro;24 million annually; as a percentage of revenue received, An Post collection costs are at 5.5%; and evasion levels in Ireland are more than twice that of the UK while collection costs are more than double those of other European counterparts.  This is not something for which RT&Eacute; is responsible but it has a massive bearing on our capacity to plan for the future and invest in the type of programming that we know audiences want and have a right to expect from us.  Why is it acceptable that the television licence fee collection system is so inefficient that more than &euro;60 million goes uncollected every year?  The State is failing to collect what it believes is an appropriate fee for having a television licence and for the service that funding underpins.  That is not acceptable in any other area of the public finances and it should not be acceptable when it comes to public service broadcasting.  RT&Eacute; is not asking for additional money from households; we are simply asking that the fee the State believes is appropriate for television licensing be collected.  Aside from the lost revenue to a sector that badly needs increased investment, more than anything, the current system is fundamentally unfair on those who pay.<\/p><p> An all-party committee similar to this has made a series of clear recommendations, including the need for responsibility for collection of the fee to be ascribed to the Revenue Commissioners.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment published a comprehensive report following months of consultations and hearings that resulted in sensible and achievable recommendations.  All RT&Eacute; is asking for is that the recommendations in the report be implemented.  The broader sector, including the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, which represents commercial radio, Screen Producers Ireland, which represents the independent production sector, and the Screen Directors Guild of Ireland, which represent directors involved in the Irish and international audiovisual industry, shares this view.<\/p><p>If members believe the future of public media and quality Irish programming is important, we ask them to do what they can to support the implementation of the recommendations advanced by their colleagues.  <\/p><p> Much is now at risk.  If one talks to anybody in our sector, he or she will tell you the Irish media sector is in real trouble.  All of us who invest in quality Irish journalism and original reporting, all of us who invest in quality home produced programming &ndash; newspapers, commercial broadcasters and public service broadcasters &ndash; are struggling to sustain what we do.  <\/p><p> The only organisations that benefit from a severely diminished Irish media are international media groups, tech companies and international content providers, none of which invest in Irish journalism, culture or programming or in the Irish creative economy.  In television in particular, without reforms, Ireland will quickly become just an extension of the UK and the US markets.  Is that really the future we all want?  If not, there are options and there are solutions if there is political will to act.  I understand, for example, that the newspaper industry in Ireland is requesting that the VAT rate on newspapers, currently at 9%, be reduced to zero as it is elsewhere in Europe.  As for RT&Eacute;, one such solution is to ensure there is strong indigenous public media service at the heart of Irish life that has the resources, authority and trust to ask the tough questions and address as its priority the issues, challenges and questions facing this society.  It should be one that is strong enough to help sustain a vibrant indigenous culture, to support local programme makers and local creative talent and to ensure distinctive Irish voices on our airwaves, as well as ensuring we continue to have moments of shared national experience, available to all free-to-air, where all the expressions and iterations of ourselves have a home.  <\/p><p> For more than 90 years, although at times imperfectly, RT&Eacute; has uniquely and consistently connected journalism, politics, culture and communities in Ireland while retaining the trust of the public.  This role is as relevant and important today as it was when RT&Eacute; was established.  RT&Eacute; has reported net operating deficits for 2015 and 2016 and will do so for 2017.  If this continues it will have a devastating impact on both RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s dual funding model and on its schedules, its capacity to deliver on its remit and its relevance to Irish audiences.  Notwithstanding all we are doing, will continue to do and have done over the past decade, we are now at a point of decision.  It is simply not possible for RT&Eacute; to stabilise its financial position, continue to fulfil its role or act as an engine for the broader creative sector without addressing the issue of its resources and the TV licence system.  <\/p><p> This meeting will no doubt touch on many issues and we will do our best to answer members&rsquo; questions but I ask them to also bear in mind the broader challenges facing much of our national media today and the implications they have for much of what we in this country hold dear, including our culture and identity; our obsessive interest in news and current affairs; our creativity, our music and our stories.  It is surely in the national interest that this issue is urgently addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018050300002#JJ00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525334400,"counter":1194,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Forbes.

It is a fact of life in Ireland now that of every euro spent in digital advertising 80 cent goes to the big players.  <\/p> <p>  The market has evolved and it is a challenging place to be in.  In terms of our response to this, we have to ensure that we have a very compelling place for Irish advertisers to advertise and we do this by having really strong Irish content.  There is demand for it.  We hear every day from agencies that they want to have their advertisers surrounded by strong indigenous content.  When we do not have as much of that as we would like there is a problem.  Coupled with this, we do not have extensive dramas for sale on the external market.  It is the golden age of television.  Most countries in the world are investing heavily, particularly in drama.  Denmark and Israel are seeing big returns in this regard.  To benefit from this, one has to have a lot of volume and, obviously, quality.  We are not able to go there.  That said, we are doing everything we can.  We have to look at new revenue streams.  For example, sponsorship is a growing area, as is product placement in programming but it is not yet making up for what has been being lost.  The market is a very different place.  Everybody is being challenged in this area.  As I said, our best response is to have the best environment for the advertisers, which allows us to compete.  That is our challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018050300002#PP00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1525334400,"counter":1339,"content":"<p>People are choosing a different way to view content such as Netflix and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018050300002#PP00600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525334400,"counter":1340,"content":"<p>On commercial revenue, one of the other issues in this area, as well as the dissipation of audience, is the increased number of opt-out channels that are offering advertising in this market.

RT&Eacute; and I take this very seriously because that is the next generation that will come through.  What is incredibly said in all of this, given where we are as an organisation from a funding point of view, is that we typically work with the independent creative sector such that we make some programming in-house and we also contract out as part of our obligations.  A number of years ago we were spending &euro;80 million in the independent sector on programming coming to RT&Eacute; from outside.  This has halved over the years, again because of the reduction in funding.  I am concerned about the sector, as is the sector generally, because without RT&Eacute; being strong in this area the sector is under-developing.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the sector is desperate for a solution on the licence fee because the licence fee is one of big mechanism in this country to develop creative output but it is not being collected to the fullest extent.  This is a problem.  A few of us were in London last week at an event where the Irish ambassador was celebrating the great collaboration that goes on between the UK and the Irish creative sectors.  There was a lot of Irish talent there, including actors and comedians, because they do not have jobs at home.<\/p><p>They are there because we in particular are not able to invest like we should do in that sector.  That is a worry and is one of the biggest arguments that we as a society need to think about as we look to developing for the future.

I refer to the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, in the radio sector, Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, in television production, the Irish Film Board and the Screen Directors Guild of Ireland.  We have worked in partnership with these people to develop a strategy to enhance the creative sector in Ireland, create jobs and maybe bring it back to the level it was at.  My own view is that the sector that has been hardest hit in this downturn has been the independent sector, particularly in the television sector.  Halving the available revenue has hit a lot of families and a lot of people's jobs.  People have had to move abroad to find jobs in other sectors.

Let us put some context around it.  First, the cost of that talent to us as an organisation is 1% of our total cost base.  Some 99% of our costs go to other things.  That is the percentage that expenditure takes up.<\/p> <p>  The other thing that we really have to remember as we think about this is that we get half of our funding from the licence fee and half from commercial revenues.  It is incumbent on these presenters and broadcasters, who are the best in the country, to ensure that RT&Eacute; gets strong audiences, both from a relevance point of view and to be attractive to advertisers.  We should remember that there is an onus on those people not just to provide a public service but also to make us attractive from a commercial point of view.  One of our objectives as stated in the Broadcasting Act 2009 is to optimise our content from a commercial point of view.<\/p> <p>  The other thing to bear in mind is that there is a competitive marketplace for broadcasters.  It is not unnoticed, in this country and in others, that these broadcasters can command big audiences and are in demand.  There is a market for that.  Outside RT&Eacute;, some other broadcasters are being paid even more than some of ours but that is another discussion.  It is also important to bear in mind that my predecessor, Noel Curran, looked at the situation a couple of years ago and corrected the level of salaries.  They were significantly higher than they are today and were reduced by between 30% and 40%.  We have committed as an organisation to maintain that and I am committed to that.  When contracts come up for review, they will be assessed on the basis of the market at the time, as well as on a number of other factors.

Our assessment is that of the top ten broadcasters in the country, five work in RT&Eacute; and five are in the independent sector.  That is our honest assessment of it.<\/p> <p>  I will also add a further point.  The director general has noted that our top talent is really important to us but our top talent cannot produce programmes without the production team.

Certainly in a personal capacity, let me say that I want to support RT&Eacute;.  Public broadcasting is absolutely an essential tool of any democracy, so let me preface all my comments with that.<\/p> <p>  However, there is also a duty on the public broadcaster to show that they are providing value for money.

I think the broadcaster has a very important role in providing a different voice and a different ear.

It should be a very quick process to give a memo to the Minister to get them cleared.  I ask the witnesses to speed up this process.

A number of years ago the board decided that we should look at the sale of some land.  It was agreed that we could sell up to ten acres of unused land within Montrose.  Of course we had to go through the various Department consents.  That involved a combination of our Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We did all of that and we had consent to sell the land in March 2017, although it seems like it was longer ago.  As you said, Chairman, we received &euro;107.5 million for that land.  In the course of seeking the approval and consent we were required to have clear guidelines with regard to what the money would be spent on.<\/p> <p>  The guidelines fall into three categories.  One is around capital investment.  As we mentioned earlier, we have not been spending money on capital over the years because of the cuts.  Capital investment is much-needed in RT&Eacute; throughout the country.  The second area relates to paying down some debt.  We have some debt.  Again, we had to pay some of that down.  The third area was to allow us to restructure the organisation.  Again, we are cognisant of our costs in the organisation.  We launched a voluntary exit plan that was enabled by the land sale; it was an attempt to reduce our cost base.  These were the three areas of expenditure for which we could use the land money.  It is clear.  We have a clear process internally about how we do this.  The money is ring-fenced.  It is only for those purposes and nothing else.

There seems to be an issue and that is why I raised the issue of class, which is important to me, and that the public broadcaster is not seen as reflective of one class of society, but of society in general.  I welcome the fact that this is being reviewed, but I ask Ms Forbes, who certainly seems to be pioneering - I really commend her on the gender pay issue and some of the other work that is being done - that she look at this if possible.<\/p> <p>  I completely agree with the Cathaoirleach on Irish productions and the value of these and the spin-off from them.  I would encourage more of that because it is of real benefit in terms of keeping talent here, notwithstanding the cheaper costs of getting in some of the American franchise programmes, which can attractive to do and which may be easier, and that it is more expensive and more difficult to hone domestic talent.  I commend the director-general on that because it is very good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018050300002#XX00100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1525334400,"counter":1734,"content":"<p>I now call Deputy Catherine Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018050300002#XX00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1525334400,"counter":1735,"content":"<p>I will try to be brief.

I still think we have reason to be concerned about what the section might permit.  Article 23 of the GDPR is the relevant part.  It does not make an explicit distinction between the processing of personal and special categories of data but, throughout the GDPR, we are told that special categories of data should be treated with special care, hence we are attempting to separate it in amendment No. 56 and in the related amendments, for example, amendment No. 52, separating the two categories of data, personal data and &quot;special categories of personal data&quot;.<\/p><p>I accept that Article 23 of the GDPR refers to the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, which is inserted in the Bill in section 38(<i>b<\/i>).  The problem these amendments try to address relates to the scope the word &quot;preventing&quot; introduces with regard to criminal offences, particularly relating to special categories of personal data, such as religious beliefs, political opinion, ethnicity and so on.  Section 38 of the Bill is not part of Part 5 of the Bill, which relates to processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes.  The processing of data referred to in section 38 does not apply to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for example.  The kind of processing proposed in section 38 might well be done by private companies.  Section 38 essentially permits racial profiling if we include the processing of special categories of data.  A body other than the Garda, for example, can profile a person based on ethnicity, religion and political opinions in the name of preventing, in the broadest sense, a criminal offence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050300002#B01000","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1525352400,"counter":1789,"content":"<p>The last amendment is listed as being in section 39.  It is actually section 38, as the line numbers would indicate.  Under the GDPR in general, processing of personal data for purposes other than that for which it was initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were collected in the first place.  In other words, if one gives Twitter one's phone number to verify when one is connecting from a different device, it cannot start ringing that person about other stuff.  That is straightforward but there is some wriggle room according to Recital 50, on processing for purposes which are incompatible with the basis on which the data were initially collected.  That can be allowed in two circumstances.  First, where somebody gives consent for that to happen and, second, when the \"processing is based on Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public interest\".<\/p> <p>  Section 38 tries to give effect to this wriggle room but it goes a little too far because it allows for the processing of both sensitive categories of data, including the serious stuff about political opinions, sexual orientation and so on, and the general personal data, for reasons other than the purposes for which it was collected, in order to prevent a threat to national security, to prevent, investigate or prosecute crimes and for getting legal advice and legal proceedings.<\/p> <p>  In amendments Nos. 52, 53 and 55, we are proposing that further processing of personal data would be lawful for all of those reasons with the tweak that, rather than it being for preventing crime, we would use the tighter wording of \"avoiding prejudicing the prevention\" of crime.  There is a further small tweak in amendment No. 53, that further processing would be allowed only if \"having regard to the fundamental rights and legitimate interests of the data subject\".  It is necessary and proportionate for various crime and terror-fighting purposes.<\/p><p>The wording for our first amendment is taken from the British wording and our second amendment is a balancing requirement.<\/p><p> In amendment No. 56 we propose that further processing of very sensitive data would be permitted for all of the aforementioned except the prevention for crime.  Our reason is that the GDPR does not apply to competent authorities like the Garda.  What section 38 asks us to prove is a right for public bodies or companies to collect or compile databases on things like people's political opinions, trade union membership, religious beliefs and so on for the purposes of preventing crime, which is a bit broad.<\/p><p> For example, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, has loads of documentation and data about people.  Let us say the Garda says there is crime afoot, they think it is linked to an area where there is a higher concentration of immigrants, for example, and want to hoover up all of the data, closed circuit television, CCTV, surveillance and so on that is linked to an immigrant community in a particular area.  That is racial profiling.  It is very hard to see how information held by private companies or public bodies would be so important to prevent a crime yet outweigh the balance of people's individual rights and so on.  That is where my colleague and I are coming from.<\/p><p> On balance, other information about political opinions could be important.  Let us say there was an urgent situation to prevent a threat to public security and a bunch of neo-Nazis threatened to set off a bomb in Dublin and the Garda needed to get information from a social media site, such a situation would not be hampered by our amendments.  I wish to stress that our amendments do not prevent the reuse of personal data in general, just special category data.  Names, phone numbers, addresses, emails and all of that can still be reused for a crime prevention aim.  We do not seek to stop that but we want to prevent the more personal and sensitive information being abused.<\/p><p> We think the terminology &ldquo;avoiding prejudicing the prevention, investigation or prosecution of&rdquo; is stronger.  Again, our amendment is based on the British wording.  Anybody can say something is for the prevention of crime.  A controversial CCTV scheme is being introduced on that basis even though there is no evidence that extra crime has taken place in that area.  If there is an immediate incident of a likelihood of crime, then that is a different situation.  I have outlined our motivation for tabling our amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050300002#B01100","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525352400,"counter":1791,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 54 is a ministerial amendment and all of the other amendments were tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.

I note the point made by the Chairman regarding amendments Nos. 54 and 55.  In any event, I am unable to accept amendments Nos. 52, 53, 55 and 56 and I shall give my reasons.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 53, in section 38, has a provision for the processing of personal data for certain public interest purposes for which the data were originally collected but only to the extent that such processing is necessary for and proportionate to the purpose, and that acts very much as a restrictor.  The position is as follows.  Statutory provisions that permit, or require, further notification or disclosure of personal data are to be found right across the Acts of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  Let me give a brief example.  Section 42 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 refers to a range of designated persons such as financial institutions, auditors and property service providers who know, may suspect or may have reasonable grounds to suspect, on the basis of information that they have that another person has been or is engaged in an offence of money laundering or terrorist financing.  Of course there is an obligation that such knowledge or suspicion on those grounds be reported not only to the Garda but also to Revenue.<\/p> <p>  Under sections 2 and 3 of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, it is an offence to withhold any information on offences referred to in that Act.  The Children First Act 2015 requires a range of mandated persons, including health practitioners, teachers and youth workers, who know, believe or suspect that a child has been harmed, is being harmed or, indeed, is at risk of being harmed, to report that to Tusla.<\/p> <p>  I am sure that committee members would agree that the public interest in such cases should not in any way be jeopardised or compromised.  This section provides an effective and appropriate safeguard in the words \"necessary and proportionate\".  I cannot accept the proposals in amendments Nos. 52 and 56 to remove the reference to special categories of personal data in section 38 and add a new section.  Neither can I accept insertion of the words &ldquo;having regard to the fundamental rights and legitimate interests of the data subject&rdquo; as an addition in amendment No. 54, because this would place an additional burden on, for example, a youth worker reporting suspected harm to a child or perhaps even a bank official reporting his or her suspicion that certain transactions may from time to time be linked to money laundering or illegal activity.<\/p> <p>  I see where Deputy Daly is coming from but I think there are adequate safeguards.  If I were to accept her amendments, I would be jeopardising long-standing obligations on persons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050300002#C00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1525352400,"counter":1793,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1525352400,"counter":1794,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 53:<\/p><blockquote>In page 29, line 4, after &ldquo;that&rdquo;

There are many discussions in the public domain about recent data breaches in significant media outlets in this State that have caused a lot of concern about potential interference with journalists and what they do.  That is wrong.  It is a matter of concern for free media and democracy in this country, so it is vitally important that journalists and their sources are protected.

I have doubts as to whether this is the correct location for a far-reaching statutory provision of this kind.  I ask Deputies to appreciate that the potentially far-reaching nature of this amendment, and the provision of proposed subsection (3) whereby the High Court could permit identification of confidential sources of information where a journalist is the subject of investigation for suspected commission of a serious criminal offence, raise several important issues, not least what is meant by a serious offence.  Does it cover dangerous driving or domestic violence?  There is no definition of any kind and the result is that journalistic privilege may in effect be put at risk rather than be safeguarded.<\/p> <p>  Balancing the rights of journalists to protect their sources with other sources is rightly a matter for the courts.  For example, the European Court of Human Rights has underlined that protection of confidential sources is an essential means of enabling the press to perform its important function as a public watchdog.  That should not be interfered with except in the most exceptional of circumstances where some vital public or individual interests may be at stake.  I do not disagree with the points raised by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire but I am very concerned about the imported consequences of the amendment in the form of the text as it is.

There is a view, which I share, that section 45 creates a loophole in allowing companies from other jurisdictions to operate here.  It essentially creates a position where companies not dissimilar to Cambridge Analytica or other organisations which are mining and exploiting data in that way could operate and use data gathered here, provided they did not interfere in electoral activity in the State.

We might be deemed to be wiser to oppose it and adhere to the GDPR in full, rather than trying to shape the section.  My amendment is a fall-back position if the section is not completely opposed.  We would like to return to it on Report Stage.  Article 9 of the GDPR is very clear that the processing of political opinion is prohibited without the full and informed consent of the data subject, except in certain and very limited circumstances.  Section 45 of the Bill is a bizarre attempt to carve out an exception for the processing of political opinion that is simply not provided for in the GDPR.  We could write it into Irish law via section 45, but it would simply be superseded in any case by the GDPR.  The phrase \"subject to suitable and specific measures\" appears many times in the Bill and points us back to section 35, to which the Minister referred as a toolbox for processing and protecting the rights of the data subject.  Section 35 and the suitable and specific measures therein are extremely important and, in the case of the most important, lifted from various parts of the GDPR.  The section does not require explicit consent, which is optional.  Ministers do not have to use the toolkit in the section.  Section 45 is a bizarre attempt to carve exemptions to the GDPR, particularly in the light of the Cambridge Analytica story and the fundamental threat to democracy that such companies pose.<\/p> <p>  Removing section 45 would not affect the use of the electoral register or the work of the Referendum Commission.<\/p><p>Article 13 of the GDPR explains the necessary steps we should take in terms of electoral activities such as door to door canvassing to adhere to the GDPR.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner recently published guidelines on how canvassers would have to adapt.  It will not affect polling companies or the use of focus groups or market research, only in the sense that consent will be required from the person being polled.  Obtaining this consent should not be especially difficult or onerous.  In any case, the GDPR absolutely requires the seeking of this consent, as per Article 9, in processing special categories of data such as political opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050300002#E03500","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525352400,"counter":1855,"content":"<p>I do not see any legal difference between the current wording of \"any right or obligation\" and \"specific rights or obligations\".

This means that the wording would read \"exercising or performing specific rights or obligations which is conferred or imposed\".  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 66 brings us back to the Seanad where I introduced amendments to ensure the processing of political opinions for electoral purposes would apply only in the course of elections within the State.  That was an issue.  Of course, the content is based on Recital (56) of the GDPR which makes it quite clear that, where in the course of electoral activities the operation of the democratic system in a member state requires political parties to compile personal data for people's political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons to do with the public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established.  I am at a loss to determine the consequences of what Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire has in mind.  I do not recognise circumstances in which such personal data would be shared with a private company.  They would more likely be used during the course of an election campaign when parties were canvassing and seeking reactions to election manifestoes or questionnaires and the voting intentions of constituents.  I am not sure whether the amendment is needed and even if I were minded to accept it, I am not clear on the actors and entities involved.

All that has to happen is for consent to be gained to note somebody's political view, only if someone is planning to use it with the person's name and address or IP address in the course of one or other of these activities.  It is not really a big ask.  Notably, there was a letter yesterday in the newspapers from Digital Rights Ireland, Data Compliance Europe, Dr. T. J.

They have taken successful legal actions against the State.  Because of their knowledge, they are warning us and arguing for the removal from the section of the blanket exemptions in the processing of personal data which reveals political opinions.  That is why we are pushing to oppose the section.  The State will pay heavily if we do not delete the section.  Parties and candidates will still be able to run an analysis of election results in granular form.  They will still be able to have super sophisticated analysis of polling data.

I acknowledge that section 47 invokes suitable and specific measures which revert to some of the safeguards provided in section 35, but Recital 52 of the GDPR makes absolutely no references to occupational pensions, for example, as is the case in respect of section 47(c) or to the mortgaging of property, as provided for in section 47(d).  This section essentially provides for exemptions from the requirement for explicit consent under the GDPR for the processing of special or sensitive categories of data.  That is fine, as long as we adhere to the possible exemptions provided for in the GDPR.  However, we are surely overstepping the mark in this section and going beyond services provided under the health insurance system, as per Recital 52 of the GDPR.  Why could consent not be sought in the instances given in section 47(c) and (d)?  Surely obtaining consent in these instances would not be too onerous or difficult.  The proposed insertions in amendment No. 70, subsection (2)(a) and (b), even stipulate that processing might take place without the consent of the data subject if the data controller could not reasonably be expected to obtain consent for whatever reason.  In other words, obtaining consent should be a reasonable step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050300002#G04100","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1525352400,"counter":1886,"content":"<p>The provisions of the GDPR provide for exemptions from the requirement for consent for processing with a view to safeguarding public health, but that is not necessarily what health insurance companies do.  The processing of health data is not necessary for the management of the health service.  It obviously has some function in that regard, but I do not think it should do so without having to ask for our permission.  For example, VHI is running a TV advertisement campaign asking members to sign up to be DNA tested by it in order that it can help an individual to find out what future ailments to which he or she might be genetically disposed, but that is not the reason it is doing it.  It is doing it in order that it can charge higher premiums to individuals who are predisposed to something that could trigger an illness later.  It wants our data in order that it can levy higher premiums.  It is not doing it for the good of the health service.  There is no reason we should give such data to it; it should have to obtain an individual's consent first.  That is all we are asking for.<\/p> <p>  It is an even bigger problem in the case of the banks because this allows for an exemption for the banks to process health data in the case of mortgage applications.  The Government's proposal is that the banks can do this without obtaining the consent of the person concerned.  That is ludicrous.  Everybody knows that when he or she fills in the application form for a mortgage, he or she will have to fill in numerous forms.  I do not think one of them being a consent form would be too onerous.

The matter also arose during the preparation of legislation in a number of other member states, of which we are aware.<\/p> <p>  The matters referred to in section 47, paragraphs (a) to (d), inclusive, insurance or life assurance policies, pensions, annuities and mortgages, are normally the subject matters of a detailed contract between the data subject and an insurance company or a financial institution.  In order to determine contributions, it may well require obtaining information on the health of the data subject, or his or her welfare or disposition.  Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR permits the processing of non-sensitive personal data.<\/p><p>Article 9.2 does not permit the processing of such personal data for contractual purposes.  The question then is whether the explicit consent of the data subject in Article 9.2(a) provides a sufficiently robust ground for securing the benefits of such a contract.  The difficulty that arise relates to the strict definition of \"consent\" in Article 4.11 of the GDPR.  It prescribes that for the consent to be valid, it must be \"freely given\".  Recital 43 states that consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data \"where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller\".  My concern, which is shared by a number of other member states, is that the insurance company or financial institution may in certain circumstances, in the absence of this section, seek to resile from the contract with the data subject on the basis that the consent of the subject could not have been freely given.

Deputy Daly will be glad to know that the advertisements that the VHI or other health insurers run and any tests they may perform as regards a predisposition to various conditions and diseases under law can have no effect on the premium they charge because of community rating, which means health status and categories of illness are immaterial when it comes to premium pricing.<\/p> <p>  There is a difficultly with the amendments.  The Minister stated that one of the grounds for the purposes of a contract is that consent be freely given.  Life insurance has always been risk-rated as opposed to community-rated and there is a difficulty in this regard.  For instance, when completing a proposal form, one is required to outline various health conditions and information which is necessary for actuarial pricing for the performance of the contract.  Under the amendment, there is the possibility of the data subject withholding consent.  I do not know how that would work if a contract has been signed.  If a client filled out a proposal form to take out a life insurance contract and at a later stage withheld consent for the use of this information, how could a claim be processed if no one has access to the information that was the subject of the contract in the first place?  The amendments are well-intentioned but they are problematic and I do not see how they could work.

The section replaces section 2B(1)(b)(II) of the 1988 Act.  However, the original wording of section 48 was narrower in scope than section 2B(1)(b)(II) and it did not extend to personal data in respect of criminal convictions and offences.  This is because data relating to criminal convictions and offences fall within the definition of &quot;sensitive personal data&quot; under the 1988 Act whereas it forms the subject matter for a separate Article 10 under the GDPR.  The purpose of the amendment, therefore, is to bring section 48 more fully into line with the 1988 Act.  Yesterday, I outlined some of the statutory instruments made under the corresponding section 2(B) of the 1988 Act in respect of the historic institutional abuse inquiry in Northern Ireland, the coroner's inquest into the death of Arlene Arkinson, and the coroner's inquest into the Kingsmill massacre.  The processing of personal data under those regulations could involve the processing of personal data in respect of criminal convictions or offences or the alleged commission of an offence.  These are matters of great importance and they necessitate the making of regulations to facilitate processing of sensitive personal data.  The provisions of section 48 will permit the making of similar regulations in the future where that is justified for reasons of substantial public interest such as those I have outlined.<\/p><p>I will not accept amendments Nos. 72 and 73 because they seek to narrow the scope of the regulation-making power under the section.  If I was to confine the scope of the section to the processing of data by public authorities in cases of urgency, it would mean that the making of regulations such as those we made to facilitate the McAleese committee and its important work would no longer be possible.

The Sinn F&eacute;in position is similar.  We propose that regulations under the section should be examined by a body or organisation that has data protection expertise.

Any decision could only be made by a Minister and now perhaps requires prospective sanction by the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Any decision that is made by elected representatives has to be based on gathering the information available, evaluating it, and then taking the decision.  The expert in these matters will be the Data Protection Commissioner.  The commissioner's say on what additional exceptions and special categories might be required to be processed is necessary information, even with the prospective approval of the D&aacute;il.

Paragraph 2(b) of Article 22 permits such processing where it is authorised by the European Union or national law but subject to appropriate safeguards.

On automated processing the GDPR says that minimum safeguards must provide an explanation of the decision reached and a way for the data subject to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.  This Bill refers to making what are called representations.  It is not clear at what stage the data subject can make representations and there is no guarantee that he or she will get a human intervention if it is wanted.  There is no obligation on a controller in this regard.  We have to see this in the context of the fallibility of machines.  It is crucial that there needs to be a clear right for people in Ireland to get a human intervention and an appeal process for any decisions that are made by the machine.  This is what our amendment provides for.  We have to be cognisant that over the next ten years, automated decision-making is going to become much more prevalent.  There is a problem with the wording of the Bill in that the rights enshrined in the GDPR are somewhat circumscribed by this.

This section is intended to contribute to the formation and maintenance of an informed electorate in the State as part of our democratic system of government.

We do not know who the funders are, the information is not verified and the publishers of the information are not identified.  We have a Constitution that has established that the people can elect people to the D&aacute;il.  We have a process whereby democracy manifests itself.  People might not like it and they may believe it is not democratic enough, but it is the method by which the people of Ireland elect the Government.  Unless we start standing up for the democratic structures in the State, we will expose ourselves to the threats to democracy that have had an impact in other countries.  We should not be embarrassed by the fact that candidates in an election, be they members of a political party or independent, can market themselves to tell people to vote for them.  It is an integral part of the democratic process.  The more we keep undermining ourselves and apologising for our existence, the more we undermine democracy.

I am aware that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is opposing the section, and Deputy Wallace and I support him in that regard.  However, on the basis of the debate on the section in the Seanad, we did not think that approach would be heard or accepted and have, therefore, taken a harm mitigation approach.  However, we support Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on the section other than in that regard.<\/p><p>As discussed in regard to amendment No. 6, section 57 allows for the restriction of rights under various articles for the purpose of so-called important objectives in the public interest.  Amendment No. 85 proposes to change the rights which can be restricted under the section to those outlined in Articles 12 to 21 of the GDPR rather than Articles 12 to 22.  It is not a major change but would mean that people would have the right not to be subjected to automated decision making or profiling under any circumstances under the section, which is important.  The British legislation on this matter includes a provision similar to that which we are proposing and it is important in that regard.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 90, as previously mentioned, section 57 proposes that the Minister would have wide discretion in limiting the rights of persons under Articles 12 to 22 in respect of certain circumstances that are united under the vague banner of being in the general public interest.<\/p><p>The section also proposes to give the Minister wide discretion in limiting the rights of persons if he or she believes it is necessary to do so for the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others to do so.  While this provision appears to be fair, the section does not include an obligation on the Minister to balance the rights and freedoms of data subjects with the rights and freedoms of others in circumstances in which he proposes to restrict the right of access to information under this section.  I am concerned that the provisions under this section could be used to deny adopted persons' requests for information about where they come from on the basis that another party is involved.  To oblige the Minister to balance rights would not be a great imposition.  It is important that he should be obliged to do so.<\/p><p>This ties in with amendment No. 90 where the Minister also has the power to limit the rights of data subjects in respect of personal data kept for or obtained in the course of the carrying out of social work by a public body.  On the face of it, this appears to be vaguely acceptable.  However, if one scratches a little deeper, it becomes obvious that the restriction of rights could and, given the history of the State, probably would be used to refuse information to adopted children about their natural parents.  If this is not the Minister's intention, I ask him to review these provisions and improve the wording.  As matters stand, I propose to press the amendment. <\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 92 and 94 limit the Minister's right to invent a new public interest objective with a view to restricting rights.  The key word in this context is \"indicative\".  The 14 objectives listed are only some of the public interest objectives the Minister may use as a basis for restricting rights.  A Minister can, at any time, add to these objectives without consulting elected representatives.  As matters stand, restrictions of rights could be justified on any basis.  Data centres, for example, have been justified on the basis that they are crucial and in the public interest.  Given that a caveat could be applied in respect of anything, it is necessary to introduce some checks and balances.  For this reason, we propose to restrict the public interest objectives by providing that a Minister who wants to designate an objective that is not already listed in the Bill as one that is of general public interest will be required to submit the proposal to the Oireachtas for approval.  The amendment introduces a check on the Minister's powers in this regard. <\/p><p> Amendment No. 95 requires the Minister to consult the Data Protection Commission before making regulations and present to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality his rationale should he ignore the advice of the commission.  In that respect, the amendment is in line with previous amendments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050300002#M02900","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525352400,"counter":2004,"content":"<p>Of the 12 amendments in the group, six are in my name.  The purpose of section 57 is to protect the public and other objectives of general public interest.  I state categorically that it does not restrict, nor will it be used to restrict, the data protection rights of citizens.  For example, the Medical Council or the Property Services Regulatory Authority may have good reason to investigate a doctor or estate agent on foot of a complaint by a patient or client alleging unfitness to practice or otherwise.  If the data protection rights of the individuals in question are not restricted on a temporary basis while the complaint is investigated, the doctor or estate agent could apply to have his or her data rectified, restricted or erased in certain circumstances.  Any of these actions would put pay to an investigation, which would be to the detriment of the complainant and the regulatory body charged with supervision.<\/p><p>Regulations made under this section will permit regulatory bodies to carry out their statutory obligations to conduct inquiries or investigate complaints in the knowledge that those being investigated will not be permitted to exercise data subject rights in a manner that could jeopardise the regulatory body's performance of its statutory functions.  Persons under investigation will not be permitted to exercise rights to rectification or erasure of their personal data while the investigations are ongoing.  I say this against the background of the importance of meeting the conditions set out in Article 23 of the general data protection regulation in the text of section 57. <\/p><p>Subsections (1) and (2) give effect to the introductory text of Article 23.1 of the GDPR.  Subsection (3) restricts the exercise of data subject rights.  These are important issues and include Cabinet confidentiality and parliamentary privilege.  We need to be mindful of many examples, including in the context of protected disclosures and other whistleblowing activity.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 86 is a drafting amendment that substitutes revised text for subsection (2).  Amendment No. 87 removes reference to judicial independence and court proceedings from subsection (3)(<i>a<\/i>)(i), while amendments Nos. 194 to 196, inclusive, make more detailed provision for restrictions on the exercise of data subject rights in the case of courts acting in their judicial capacity.  Amendment No. 89 inserts reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General alongside the Data Protection Commission and Information Commissioner.  This will protect investigations and inquiries undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the performance of his or her constitutional and statutory functions.  <\/p><p>As regards other amendments, my position is as follows.  While I cannot accept amendment No. 85, which is not in line with Article 23 of the GDPR, I can accept amendment No. 88 tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.  Amendment No. 90 is unnecessary in light of the requirement in subsection (10) that any regulations must &quot;respect the essence of the right to data protection and protect the interests of the data subject&quot;.  I cannot accept amendment No. 91, which seeks to delete subsection (5)(<i>b<\/i>), nor can I accept amendment No. 92, which seeks to limit the scope of &quot;important objectives of general public interest&quot; contrary to Article 23.1(e) of the GDPR.  As regards amendment No. 94, it repeats the content of the existing subsection (8) and paragraph (<i>b<\/i>) duplicates the content of subsection (11).  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.  I will accept amendment No. 95.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 97 would, if accepted, breach the GDPR insofar as the controller or processor is responsible for carrying out impact assessments.  This is not a task for the data protection authority, not least because it would erode the authority's independence, which is important in the context of the legislation.  As I stated in respect of section 48, the cumulative effect of the provisions proposed would be excessive and disproportionate.  The making of regulations could take six, eight or nine months or perhaps longer.  There are circumstances in which we would find that to be less than acceptable.  In view of the issues I have outlined, I will not accept amendment No. 97.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050300002#N00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1525352400,"counter":2005,"content":"<p>As with several other sections, the phrase \"public interest\" can be used to justify many things.

The Minister did not mention his own amendment, amendment No. 87.  Will he tell us why he is removing judicial independence as one of the important objectives of general public interest?  Is it because the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has asked him to do so?  Perhaps not.  I would be interested to hear the logic behind that provision.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in amendment No. 92, proposed by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.  Subsection (7) of section 57 sets out important objectives of general public interest referred to in subsection (6).  It is better to have it slightly vague so that paragraphs (a) to (n) are not exclusive and that one can go beyond them.  The way this could be challenged in court, we could have a large corporation challenging regulations that have been made by the Minister and approved by the Oireachtas.  If it is the case that subsection (7) states that the important objectives can only include (a) to (n), that is a good opportunity for them to say the regulations are not valid because they do not come within that list.  On balance, we are better off not limiting the scenarios pursuant to which general public interest can be identified.  It is very broad.  If we limit it, there may be a situation that we have not envisaged whereby regulations in respect of public interest are introduced.<\/p> <p>  A lot of the time here, we are thinking of situations that will arise where a villainous Minister is issuing regulations supported by an oppressive Government and the rest of us are trying to oppose them.  The reality is that it will be large corporations trying to challenge regulations that have been brought in by the State.<\/p> <p>  I will be supporting amendment No. 95.  Amendment No. 96 is effectively provided for because of amendment No. 5.  I do not think it is necessary for that reason.  Amendment No. 97 is proposed by Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire.  I would make the same point again.  It is legislation that is being made by way of regulation although it is referred to as secondary legislation.  We should do it.  I understand Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point.  We are not farming it out to the Data Protection Commissioner.  We should make our decision based on what we view as being in the public interest.  The elected Members of the Oireachtas are much more in tune with what is or is not in the public interest than any statutory body established by us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050300002#O00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1525352400,"counter":2011,"content":"<p>In response to an issue raised by Deputy O'Callaghan in respect of amendment No. 85, removing reference to judicial independence and court proceedings, that provision in fact reappears in amendment No. 195, which is probably more appropriate.

The intention is to ensure the controller retains overall control over the processing chain, especially where the processor needs to obtain the assistance of a sub-processor.  A very simple example is where, for example, the Garda, acting as a controller, obtains documents in a foreign language and transmits them to a translation service, which would be a processor, for translation into the English language.  If that translation service does not have the necessary expertise to translate the particular language into English, it may need to obtain the services of another service with the necessary translation expertise, which would be the sub-processor.  The proposed amendments to section 77 are technical in nature, but the intention is simply to ensure the controller which in my example is the Garda retains control over the personal data contained in the documents.  That will enable it to retain control over the data and facilitate the exercise of data subject rights.  It will also enable it to demonstrate compliance with the requirements in Part 5 of the Bill to the Data Protection Commission if called upon by the commission to do so.

As I mentioned in the Seanad when dealing with a similar amendment, I am unable to accept an amendment which would insert a new subsection (9) in section 84.<\/p> <p>  Under section 84 there is already an obligation on a controller to inform a data subject where there is a high risk to the data subject's rights and freedom arising from a breach.  In such a case, the controller, in clear and plain language, must notify the data subjects of the nature of the breach, its likely consequences and a description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken to mitigate its possible adverse effects.  The proposed amendment refers to a data breach which affects a data subject.  It is far from clear what it is intended to mean.  Under the GDPR and the law enforcement directive, the thresholds for informing the Data Protection Commissioner of a data breach and informing the data subject whose data protection rights have been breached are defined in terms of risks for the data subject arising from the breach.<\/p> <p>  If a data breach involves a high risk for the data subject, then the data subject must be given all relevant information and may require further information.  I should add that acceptance of the amendment would also create a confusing and perhaps even undesirable divergence between the reporting thresholds in the section and the corresponding provision in the GDPR.

Second, while the term \"frivolous or vexatious\" has a specific meaning in our law when used by the courts, that is, that the claim is unsustainable in law and is bound to fail, the term is not understood in other member states, except possibly in a common law jurisdiction such as the UK.  On the contrary, to a data subject or a data protection authority in another member state, use of the word \"frivolous\" suggests that the matter is not regarded as sufficiently serious for investigation, while \"vexatious\" suggests that the complaint is seen as a deliberate intention to cause annoyance.  The scope for such misunderstandings will be much greater under the \"one-stop-shop\" mechanism because the data protection commission will be acting as lead supervisory authority in many cross-border cases.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, the term \"frivolous and vexatious\" is used in section 10(1)(b) of the 1988 Act and it has created confusion and misunderstandings in recent years, especially in cross-border cases.  In the Schrems judgment, Judge Hogan commented that the wording of that provision \"is somewhat unfortunate and perhaps even unhelpful\".  Its use was widely misinterpreted and misunderstood in the aftermath of that case in which Mr. Schrems successfully contested the adequacy of the safe harbour mechanism.  His original complaint concerning the shortcomings of the safe harbour mechanism had been rejected on the grounds that it was frivolous or vexations, that is, unsustainable in law because of the European Commission's decision to recognise the adequacy of privacy safeguards provided by the safe harbour mechanism.<\/p> <p>  The risk therefore of misinterpretation or misunderstanding will be very much greater in future because of the expected increase in the number of \"one-stop-shop\" cases handled by the data protection commission, which have originated in other member states.  As I said, I cannot accept the alternative models put forward in the amendments to the complaints-handling mechanisms in Chapters 2 and 3 of Part 6.  I ask for the understanding and support of the committee in the avoidance of any reference to the term \"frivolous and vexatious\".  I believe that the robustness and effectiveness of the mechanisms outlined in Part 6 will be compromised by the introduction of a filter based on the commission's opinion as to whether a complaint it has received is \"frivolous or vexations\".<\/p> <p>  As regards amendments Nos. 140 and 161, a reference to consent of the parties is not required because an amicable resolution cannot take place without the consent of the parties in any event.<\/p><p>On section 108, I am not in favour of replacing reference to 107(5)(<i>e<\/i>) with a general reference to section 107(1) as proposed by amendment No. 147, where a complaint, following an examination by the commission under section 107(1), has been rejected or dismissed under 107(5)(<i>a<\/i>) or (<i>b<\/i>), a data subject has a specific right to appeal against that decision under section 148(<i>a<\/i>).  Where the commission, following an examination of a complaint, has already issued an enforcement notice on the controller or processor in any of the situations referred to in section 107, the carrying out of a further inquiry would be unnecessary.  The same applies where a data subject has been provided with advice by the commission, for example, where a data subject is seeking compensation and the commission explains that compensation remains a matter for the courts.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 149 and 170, which seek to insert new sections into the Bill, contain provisions that are taken from surrounding sections without deletion of those provisions.  This would give rise to confusion and legal uncertainty.  I cannot accept the amendments as drafted but I am happy to come back to them on Report Stage.The word &quot;where&quot; is correct and is consistent with usage throughout the Bill.  I cannot accept amendment No. 171.<br\/><br\/>In summary, sections 107, 108, 120 and 121 of the Bill provide, in my view, a coherent and streamlined approach to the future handling of complaints by the Data Protection Commission and I am not disposed to accepting amendments that would militate against that coherence or streamlined frame that is envisaged under the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050300002#S03300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525352400,"counter":2180,"content":"<p>In regard to the Minister's response to amendments 137 to 139, inclusive, I am sure that like me the other Deputies involved were of the view that these amendments would strengthen the obligations rather than weaken them or create any greater discretion, particularly, in the first instance, the word \"investigate\" as opposed to \"examine\" and, in the second instance, the reference to a formal decision, except where a matter is frivolous or vexatious.  As mentioned by the Minister, the words \"frivolous\" and \"vexatious\" are frequently used in respect of cases which fail to reach a fairly low threshold.  I note what the Minister says but it appears to me that as things stand in the Bill there is greater discretion and flexibility than would be the case were amendments Nos. 137 and 138 accepted, in regard in particular to the requirement for a formal decision, which, I think, is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050300002#T00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1525352400,"counter":2181,"content":"<p>The thinking behind these amendments is, in part, based on what has been told us by the chairperson of GSOC, namely, that a lot of complaints come in at a very low level and her preference would be that those complaints, which are work-related complaints, be dealt with by senior officers of the garda against whom the complaint is made.  The intention was to give the commission some leeway to reject complaints that appeared to be frivolous or vexatious.  I appreciate the Minister's point that this has a legal connotation.  I am happy if the Minister commits to look at this again on Report Stage.  I think some mechanism and statutory power needs to be given to the commission to allow it deal with complaints that it believes do not merit extensive investigation.  If this is not done, the commission will be bogged down in that it will have to investigate every complaint made, irrespective of how small it is and irrespective of the cost of any investigation in that regard.

I would like to speak to amendments Nos. 155 to 158, inclusive.  Section 115(7) of the Bill as drafted permits not-for-profit bodies such as, for example, Digital Rights Ireland, to bring an action on behalf of a data subject when it has been mandated by the data subject to do so.  However, as argued by Dr. T.J. McIntyre during the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the Bill should provide that not-for-profit bodies also be allowed to independently bring actions without their having to be mandated by an individual data subject to do so.  Amendment No. 155 seeks to remedy this.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, will explain why the Bill excludes this as I understand Article 80 includes this possibility as a discretionary provision, although in such cases compensation for damages would not be awarded unless the Article 80 body was specifically mandated by a data subject to bring the action.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 156 is an attempt to address the lack of provision in the Bill for a not-for-profit body of the type described in Article 80 of the GDPR, for example, Digital Rights Ireland, to bring an action for compensation for damages on behalf of a data subject.  I do not understand why this is prohibited.  Dr. T.J. McIntyre made a compelling case for it during the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  He said that, without it, there would be a gap in protection for data subjects.  We must remember that when a data subject seeks to take a case for a data breach or violation of his or her data rights, he or she would in many instances be forced to discuss sensitive personal data publicly.  Therefore, many people would be reluctant to come forward and become the public face of an issue.  There is also the fact that many, if not most, individuals affected would not have the financial ability to bring an action themselves.  Class actions are not permitted in Ireland as of yet.  If a large number of people are affected by a single data breach, it makes sense on a practical level that they could be represented by a single Article 80 body instead of them taking cases individually, which the courts would not be equipped to handle.  Surely it would make sense that Digital Rights Ireland, for example, should be allowed to act on behalf of such people if it is mandated to do so, as the GDPR permits, without taking the possibility of compensation off the table for complainants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050300002#T02300","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525352400,"counter":2203,"content":"<p>There are eight amendments in this grouping, all of which are in the names of Deputies Daly and Wallace.

Section 115 makes provision for a judicial remedy in the case of infringements of the GDPR.  Article 80.2 of the GDPR recognises that a member state may allow in its national laws for a not-for-profit body, association or organisation to take action on behalf of a data subject without the data subject's mandate.  However, that is not part of our law and compliance with the GDPR does not require such a provision.<\/p> <p>  The restrictions in the Bill on the taking of compensation claims by a not-for-profit body, association or organisation is understandably intended to discourage speculative compensation claims, especially where the data subject will be relieved of any risk that costs of the action might be awarded against him or her.  There are sound public policy reasons for discouraging the growth of a compensation culture in respect of data protection claims, which is reflected in the Bill's provisions.  As Deputy Wallace may be aware, there is already concern at the level of compensation claims, which is contributing to increasing insurance premiums and affecting business, especially SMEs.  I am very conscious of this matter when I wear my other ministerial hat.<\/p> <p>  I cannot accept subsection (8) as proposed in amendment No. 155 or subsection (9) as proposed in amendment No. 157.  The same applies to amendment No. 136, which seeks to make provision for the taking of action on behalf of a data subject without a mandate, or permission, from him or her.  Deputy Wallace referred to amendment No. 156.  I cannot accept it, as it would allow courts to award compensation to data subjects in cases taken under section 115 by a not-for-profit body, association or organisation on their behalf.<\/p> <p>  Regarding amendment No. 158, the position is that Article 55 of the directive, unlike the GDPR, does not provide for actions to be taken on behalf of data subjects without their permission.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment, which would allow a not-for-profit body, association or organisation to take action on behalf of a data subject under section 118 without his or her permission.

When a draft report is prepared by an authorised officer on foot of his or her investigation under section 137 of this Bill, fair procedure rules require the contents of that report to be shared with the controller or processor concerned for any representation that he or she may wish to make.  The authorised officer is required to have regard to any such representations.  This, of course, does not necessarily require changes to the report.  The same considerations apply where the report is submitted to the commission for its consideration and for a decision under section 138.  I fear that the sharing of a draft report with a complainant - an individual, or a not-for-profit body, organisation or association acting on his or her behalf &ndash; could provide very strong grounds for a later challenge to the validity of any decision reached by the commission and to any corrective action or fine it imposes on the controller or processor concerned.  If significant sanctions, especially administrative fines, are to be imposed, it will be important to ensure high standards of due process and the integrity and independence of the investigative process are maintained throughout the investigation and adjudication process.  Specific references to these aspects of the matter are included Articles 58.4 and 83.8 of the GDPR.
