With effect from 1 January 2011, the salaries of all new entrants to the public service, including teachers, were reduced by 10%. In addition, all public servants were required to start on the first point of the relevant pay scale.<\/p><p>4. With effect from 5 December 2011, a cap on the payment of qualification allowances was introduced. Teachers who entered teaching on or after that date were eligible for combined qualification allowances up to a maximum of honours primary degree level. Both new entrants and existing teachers are not eligible for further qualification allowances above this level if they acquire further qualifications after that date.<\/p><p>5. With effect from 1 February 2012 and as a result of the allowances review, a new pay scale was introduced for new entrants to teaching, as these teachers are no longer eligible to be paid qualification allowances. The first point of this new scale is equivalent to the fourth point of the existing scale. In addition, certain allowances are withdrawn or modified for new beneficiaries with effect from that date.

Ireland attaches great importance to the 57th session of the CSW, which is taking place from Monday 4 to Friday 15 March, as a centrepiece of our activities at the United Nations during our Presidency of the Council of the European Union.   Ireland is being represented at the CSW by Ms Kathleen Lynch T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Health and the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence with responsibility for Disability, Equality, Mental Health and Older People.   Extensive preparatory and outreach work has been undertaken by Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York.  This focuses both on ensuring coherence in EU positions and on the building of cross-regional coalitions so as to maximise the possibility of a strong outcome to this year&rsquo;s session.<\/p><p>  The 57th session has as its priority theme the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls.  The outcome being aimed for in this regard is a set of agreed conclusions, which are negotiated by all States and which must be adopted by consensus. The review theme of this session is the equal sharing of responsibilities between women and men, including caregiving in the context of HIV and AIDS, based on the agreed conclusions of the 53rd session in 2009.  The emerging issue of this session is an exploration of how key gender equality issues can be reflected in the UN post-2015 development framework.<\/p><p>  An EU strategy paper to which Ireland has contributed sets out the objective of achieving strong agreed conclusions which preserve and strengthen the international agreements and commitments on gender equality and the empowerment of women,  pursuing a rights-based approach to gender equality and the empowerment of women and countering attempts to undermine international human rights obligations.   <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s focus is firmly on practical measures and we hope to see a number of concrete actions and best practices reflected in the agreed conclusions.  The EU is represented in the negotiations on these conclusions by the EU Delegation, supported by the Irish Presidency.  Ireland is also co-sponsoring a number of side events.  We are closely involved in the organization of an event entitled &ldquo;Mobilising communities to prevent and respond to violence against women &ndash; lessons learnt from Uganda&rdquo;.

The focus was very much on the most appropriate steps for the EU to take in support of ongoing efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict.  Against the background of escalating fighting between the Syrian army and opposition groups, and with no military resolution in sight, it is increasingly evident that a negotiated solution is the only realistic option to bring about an end to the appalling violence (which has so far cost close to 70,000 lives) and to start a genuine process of political transition.  The Council made clear, in its Conclusions, that the EU welcomes and supports all efforts to bring about a peaceful solution to the violence in Syria.    <\/p><p>  These objectives are central to the mission of the UN\/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi. The Council reiterated its full support for Mr. Brahimi&rsquo;s efforts.  We also welcomed the offer made to the Syrian authorities by the President of the National Syrian Coalition, Dr Al Khatib, to start a political dialogue leading to a peaceful transition.  The sanctions which the EU is applying at present are an essential means of maintaining strong pressure on the Syrian authorities so as to persuade them to stop their campaign of repression and brutality against the Syrian people.  I welcome the fact that the Council was able to agree on renewing the full range of existing sanctions for a further period of three months. <\/p><p>  Accountability is very important in the context of the many war crimes and human rights violations that have been committed by all sides during the conflict.  Ireland has lent active support within the EU to calls for the situation in Syria to be referred by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court.  The Council has called on the Security Council to urgently address the situation in Syria in all its aspects, including the question of a possible referral to the ICC.  <\/p><p>  The role of the UN is also key in coordinating international relief efforts to address the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation.  Ireland was represented at the high-level pledging conference on Syria which UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon chaired in Kuwait on 30 January and at which in excess of US$1.5 billion was raised to support ongoing international relief efforts. My colleague, the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Mr Joe Costello T.D., announced additional emergency assistance of &euro;4.7 million at the conference, bringing total Irish aid to Syria in the past year to &euro;7.1 million. Total EU assistance to date, both from the Commission and Member States, amounts to some &euro;580 million.  <\/p><p>  The Council, at its meeting on 18 February, explicitly reaffirmed the leading role of the UN in providing assistance to Syria as well as to those neighbouring countries who are so generously hosting the estimated 900,000 refugees from this conflict. The Council Conclusions also committed the EU to take steps towards providing humanitarian assistance to all areas in the country, including those currently not reached by humanitarian aid.  The conflict in Syria will remain a major priority for Ireland at all levels of our international engagement.  We will use the influence available to us in our current EU Presidency role to support European and UN efforts and initiatives towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700053#WRG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700053#WRG01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Exemptions","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700053#WRG01050"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[12186\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700053#WRG01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a waiver or reduction in the amount of household tax will be made available to senior citizens, particularly those with a disability in view of the fact that many senior citizens in this category do not have the resources to meet additional household payments; if he has any plans to introduce or consider introducing a waiver or reduction for senior citizens and or senior citizens with a disability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>While there is no specific exemption from or reduction in the charge to Local Property Tax (LPT) for senior citizens or senior citizens with a disability, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 and the recently published Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013 contain certain provisions that may be relevant, depending on the particular circumstances involved.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT is a self-assessed tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  As property values are organised into valuation bands for the purposes of LPT, property owners will not be required to provide a precise value for their property.  The Revenue Commissioners have prepared valuation guidance which, taken together with the owner&rsquo;s own knowledge of the property, will assist him or her in assessing its value.  The guidance includes an on-line guide that provides indicative property valuation bands depending on the property type, age and location.  I am advised by the Commissioners that this on-line guidance will shortly be available on the Revenue website.<\/p><p>  The guidance also draws property owners&rsquo; attention to the publicly available property price register produced by the Property Services Regulatory Authority which provides an actual sales price for all properties sold since January 2010.  Owners are also encouraged to refer to other sources of information relating to local properties such as the property section of local newspapers, information from local estate agents and property websites.  Alternatively, owners may choose to obtain a valuation from a competent professional valuer.  If property owners have purchased their property or obtained a professional valuation in recent years, they may use this valuation and adjust for any change in property values in their area since the date of this valuation. <\/p><p>  When using Revenue&rsquo;s valuation guidance, the property owner should consider the specifics of his or her own property &ndash; for example, if the property has certain unique features, is smaller or larger than the average property in the area, or is in a significantly poor state of repair &ndash; and these factors should be taken into account in the owner&rsquo;s assessment of the valuation of the property.  If the property owner feels that the guidance is not indicating a reasonable valuation, they should make their own assessment.  As I have previously advised the House, where the Revenue guidance is used in an honest manner, the property valuation made by a property owner will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter and, consequently, additional charges will not be applied.  <\/p><p>  Finally, I am advised by the Commissioners that the initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013 will be valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any improvements made to the property, or any increase in property prices, during this period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700053#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Funding","counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700053#WRG01650"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[12089\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700053#WRG01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the percentage of the proposed property tax that will revert to the local authority; the criteria that will be used in assessing same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":155,"content":"<p>Section 157 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act, as amended, provides that, in each financial year commencing in 2014, the Minister for Finance shall pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the local property tax, including any interest paid thereon, paid into the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof during that year.

Properties securing NAMA&rsquo;s loans continue to be owned and managed by their existing owners or, in the case of enforcement, on their behalf by duly appointed insolvency practitioners.  I am advised by NAMA that there are NAMA debtors and appointed insolvency practitioners who own\/manage properties which are leased to State Agencies and who derive income from them.  The properties are leased to the State by these debtors\/appointed insolvency practitioners on an arms-length basis.  NAMA has no legal role in relation to the contracts between property owners\/appointed insolvency practitioners and third parties. Any discussion on rent reviews is a matter between for the property owner\/appointed insolvency practitioner and the tenant, and these discussions will be dealt with on a commercial basis and in accordance with the NAMA Guidelines.  The Deputy is aware that NAMA, in its role as secured lender, is agreeing rent abatements through its debtors and insolvency practitioners to support small businesses around the country  that are struggling to survive because of the current economic environment.<\/p><p>  NAMA advises that the income arising from the rental by state bodies of approximately 82 NAMA debtor and insolvency practitioner properties is of the order of &euro;30 million per annum.  NAMA advises that 48 properties are located in Dublin and the neighbouring counties of Wicklow, Kildare and Meath; these account for 76% of total rental income.  There are 24 properties located in counties Limerick, Cork and Galway and these account for a further 21% of total income.  The residual properties are located throughout the rest of Ireland and account for 3% of rental income.  The further breakdown by number and county sought by the Deputy would lead to the identification of specific properties, breaching Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act, under which NAMA is prohibited from disclosing confidential details relating to its debtors or their properties, and the obligation on its debtors and insolvency practitioners to uphold the confidentiality of agreements entered into with third parties.  In addition, details regarding the terms and duration of individual leases cannot be divulged for reason of commercial sensitivity.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is aware that NAMA&rsquo;s mandate to achieve the best possible return for the taxpayer from the management and sale of its acquired bank assets and that the NAMA Board has a mandate to independently frame its decisions in this context.

In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears is a key framework that governs the relationship between mortgage holders experiencing difficulty and their bank and it offers very worthwhile protections for mortgage holders who are in arrears or pre-arrears.  The Code provides that a mortgage lender must, in the case of mortgage difficulty, consider all options for alternative repayment arrangements and must not apply to the Courts to commence legal action for repossession of the borrower&rsquo;s primary residence until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative arrangement.  It also provides that where a borrower co-operates with the lender, the lender must wait at least twelve months from the date the borrower is classified as a MARP case before applying to the Courts.

My Department played a key role in the successful implementation of this plan with a number of initiatives that were monitored on a regular basis to track progress.  These initiatives were implemented in conjunction with several other Government Departments and Agencies to ensure that the country's workforce receive relevant training and upskilling through a variety of further education and training programmes which is a vital element of this country's recovery from the current downturn.<\/p><p>  As I am sure the Deputy will be aware the Government launched its 2013 &quot;Action Plan for Jobs&quot; last month.  This Plan will build on the success of the 2012 plan and will support employment creation and provide targeted assistance to those who are unemployed to help them access the labour market.  My Department will play a central role in this Plan in providing relevant education and training to assist the unemployed to enter or re-enter the workforce.  With a rapidly changing economy, the measures the Department will take this year are focused on aligning the education and training system with labour market needs, addressing skills gaps where there are real opportunities for employment and also targeting youth and the long-term unemployed.<\/p><p>  To complement the &quot;Action Plan for Jobs&quot;, the Irish Government also introduced a new Integrated Employment and Support service entitled 'Intreo', which is being managed under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection.  The services and supports involved were previously provided by three distinct State services and the innovative integration of these supports has facilitated the development of a co-ordinated structure which provides unemployed people, particularly the long term unemployed, with options and assistance in finding jobs or referrals to appropriate education and training. In doing so, &quot;Intreo&quot; provides a &quot;one-stop-shop&quot; service.<\/p><p>  In addition to these policy initiatives, and despite reducing resources, the Government will fund up to 430,000 education and training places across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors in 2013.

This Plan has a specific section on driving entrepreneurship and start-up companies, and includes a commitment to publish a National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement.<\/p><p>  To deliver on this commitment, a comprehensive work programme is being developed that will involve research and consultation with interested parties and relevant stakeholders and will include examination of the development of a national skills register.  I will shortly be launching a public consultation as part of an assessment of the current environment for entrepreneurship activity.  This focus on entrepreneurship is particularly timely given the work currently being undertaken to restructure the County Enterprise Boards and establish Local Enterprise Offices in Local Authorities to reform the system for delivery of support to start-ups and micro enterprises.  The proposed National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement will complement this major reform programme, to ensure that the operating environment is more coherent, responsive and conducive to entrepreneurship.<\/p><p>  Several Government Departments have a role to play in enhancing the entrepreneurial dynamic.  Given the whole of Government approach to the Action Plan for Jobs, this is an ideal opportunity for a National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement to underpin the importance of entrepreneurship as an explicit policy priority for job creation.

Hedgerows are an important reservoir of biodiversity and habitat for birds, insects, wild flowers and other wildlife during the summer breeding season.

The Public Service Reform Plan is not solely focussed on monetary savings but also on creating efficiencies and streamlining services and structures.  In this context, my Department developed a comprehensive and practical approach to the implementation of the various Government Decisions in this area, which was endorsed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>  As part of that process, my Department conducted an examination of the board structures of the National Library of Ireland (NLI) and the National Museum of Ireland (NMI), as well as the issue of shared services.  My Department also examined the issues that would be involved in merging the National Archives of Ireland (NAI) and the Irish Manuscripts Commission (IMC) into the NLI, while maintaining separate identities.  Arising from this, the Government has decided that the boards of the NMI and NLI will be discontinued and, as board fees totalling over &euro;80,000 were paid out to members of these boards in 2012, direct recurring annual savings of that order will be made as a result.  In addition, the current provision by my Department of shared corporate support services to the NAI will be extended to the NMI and NLI.  This will lead to significant savings on administration, as it will facilitate greater sharing of staff and expertise, as well as freeing up staff of the institutions for frontline and core services.  Savings of approximately &euro;200,000 are expected to be achieved in staff costs, with a further &euro;350,000 in savings to be achieved through additional shared services.<\/p><p>  No specific additional costs were generated by my Department or by other bodies (such as the Office of the Attorney General or by the Oireachtas) in the development or implementation of these Government Decisions.

The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30 Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  Specifically, it commits to:<\/p><p> - 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015,<\/p><p> - At least 40 Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and<\/p><p> - A minimum of 30 Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. <\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as, Oldtown, Ballyboughal, Naul and Garristown will have at least 30 Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRQ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[12275\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will confirm if the feasibility of using the existing electricity grid network for the provision of broadband internet services has been examined; if so if his policy favours the use of using such technology to bring broadband internet access to remote locations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>It has been Government policy for some time that State entities should avail of commercial opportunities to facilitate the deployment of infrastructure to the telecommunications market.

I am aware that the Electricity Supply Board (ESB), for example, recently sought a joint venture partner to deploy and manage, as a wholesale service provider, access to a fibre-to-the-building network capable of providing next generation broadband services, using the existing electricity network infrastructure.

KCS was developed by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department following a review of relevant international literature which is referenced in Appendix D of the document.  A collaborative process was used between central and local government in developing KCS, including expert input by Chief Fire Officers and fire services personnel; stakeholder consultation and engagement by the National Directorate with relevant technical organisations to ensure the best fit between up-to-date thinking and Ireland&#8217;s needs.  The document was recommended for adoption as national policy by the Management Board of the Directorate.<\/p><p><br \/>  KCS is based on the systems approach to safety management in set ting out the guidance and core standards for fire authorities to achieve the objective of keeping communities safe from fire.  The systems approach is recognised internationally and is applied in many safety spheres.  The Risk Management approach, which is described in Chapter 2 of KCS, is generally seen to involve five stages including identifying hazards and evaluating the risks these hazards pose, mitigating these risks by trying to reduce the probability of the event and\/or its consequences if it does occur, planning and preparing to deal with the risk, responding to an event, and reviewing events with a view to learning for the future.<\/p><p><br \/>  A common understanding in relation to terminology in risk management is important, hence the inclusion of relevant definitions in Appendix E of KCS.  In particular, the term &#8220;Risk Assessment&#8221; as used in KCS is one stage of the risk management process outlined above.  The National Directorate prepared a series of &#8216;Task Analyses&#8217; to show how the recommended initial &#8216;Pre -determined Attendance&#8217; (PDAs) responses may safely undertake tasks normally associated with the common range of fire scenarios set out in Appendix A to the document.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under Section 19 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 , the phrase &#8216;risk assessment&#8217; has a particular meaning, and requires employers to carry out risk assessments of their work activities.  Guidance on relevant aspects of risk assessment for fire services, and meeting this legislative requirement, is provided through a number of approaches.  The concept of &#8216;Dynamic Risk Assessment&#8217; at fire service operations is embedded in the National Incident Command System introduced in 2007.  The Fire Services Ancillary Safety Statement, also from 2007, developed generic risk assessment processes for fire services, and the Fire Service Standard Operational Guidance (SOGs) developed specific situational risk assessments for fire services activities. It is expected that individual fire services will prepare any additional risk assessments, which may be necessary to comply with their statutory responsibilities as employers on foot of changes arising from implementation of KCS, based on the Task Analyses referred to above.

I have particularly asked for his recommendations or views on how the registration of practically trained architects can be further encouraged. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRS00800","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Bord Plean&aacute;la Appeals","counter":442,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRS00900"},{"type":"question","counter":443,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[12279\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRS01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a list of all An Bord Plean&aacute;la decisions where the board has overturned the decision of the local inspectors report on a project in the years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012; the number of times local groups who were opposed to the projects have paid for their submissions to the process including the amount each of them paid in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":444,"content":"<p>The information sought is not available in my Department.

On its publication, I referred the discussion document to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.

Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&#8217;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation. Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:<\/p><p><b>&quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland. Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.<\/b><\/p><p><b>  There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement. It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot;<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister added that:   <b>&quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole. It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course. Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so. It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.<\/b><\/p><p><b>  My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.<\/b><\/p><p><b>  This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate. I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received. I expect it is likely that the Committee&#8217;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.

I have been working to encourage more new entrants to take up farming as a career.  Budget 2013 saw the extension of key reliefs that were already in place for young new entrants (such as the 100% relief from Stamp Duty and the 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers).  These provide an incentive both for early inter-generational farm transfer and also encourage young qualified farmers to expand their enterprise.  Extending these reliefs is not straightforward given that there is a requirement for EU State Aid approval for such measures.  The deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in budget 2012 to encourage earlier inter-generational land transfers.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am delighted that the number of applicants for Teagasc courses has greatly increased the last two years.  Teagasc has responded well to this demand have introduced new courses to cater for a variety of needs.  For example, last year Teagasc has launched a new Professional Diploma in Dairy Farm Management (Level 7) in association with University College Dublin (UCD).  Teagasc have also developed a new<i><\/i>Level 6 Specific Purpose Certificate in Farm Administration course to help meet the training requirements for full-time or part-time farmers. <\/p><p><br \/>  Measures to provide targeted support to young farmers are part of the current negotiations on the reform of the CAP and will I hope form part of any final agreement.  I have strongly supported the proposal for a top-up for young farmers under pillar 1 of the CAP, and indeed Ireland was one of the first countries to suggest this measure in the negotiations.  I am also happy that the new farm restructuring CGT relief has been announced in the 2013 budget, subject to EU State Aid approval.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old stamp duty consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.<\/p><p><br \/>  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land. A recent EU Commission study found that &#8216;<i>younger[farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force<\/i> &#8217;.  Ireland has a very low level of land sales, with most land staying within the same family for generations. Only 0.4% of land changes hand in any given year.  Young farmers that want to expand need to be able to access land.  According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.

This virus causes mild transient disease manifesting as a drop in milk production, fever and sometimes diarrhoea  in adult cattle. When infection occurs in animals that are not pregnant, the impact is very limited. However if ruminant animals are infected during the early stages of pregnancy, they may subsequently abort or give birth to malformed offspring. <\/p><p>  It would be impractical to attempt midge control measures, except for valuable breeding stock.  Exposure of non-pregnant animals to the virus may, in fact, be beneficial pending the development of an effective vaccine. Exposed animals develop a strong immunity and are unlikely to suffer any ill-effects if exposed to the virus on a subsequent occasion. If this viral infection becomes endemic, the ill-effects are likely to be confined to younger animals and cows and ewes that have not been previously exposed. Based on Australian experience in vaccinating against a similar virus\/disease (Akabane virus infection), the expert view is that vaccination is likely to be an effective tool in control of the SBV infection. The development of a vaccine is in progress and my Department will continue to monitor developments closely. <\/p><p>  Meanwhile, farmers are advised to contact their veterinary practitioner if they encounter cases of aborted foetuses or newborn animals showing malformations or nervous signs and also in  cases where lambs or calves cannot be delivered naturally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRW00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Appeals","counter":568,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRW00950"},{"type":"question","counter":569,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[12233\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRW01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a revised decision will be made on as application for disadvantage area scheme payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":570,"content":"<p>The person named is one of a number of applicants under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, whose cases are impacted by the requirement of a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare and who applied for and were refused derogation in this regard.

For the purpose of the CCS programme, disadvantage and low income are determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  <\/p><p>  My Department also implements the CETS programme which was introduced in September 2010.

It will be implemented as a joint venture by my Department and the Department of Social Protection.

I am glad to say that my Department will be part of the network and I look forward to working with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection and other colleagues in relation to the Social Investment Package and the European Commission Recommendation on Investing in Children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adoption Legislation","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRX01150"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[12143\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she has considered the recommendations of the Adoption Rights Alliance regarding adoption legislation; if measures will be taken to address the 44 recommendations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>I have received detailed submissions from the group which outline suggested amendments to the Adoption Act, 2010 and proposals in relation to information and tracing for those affected by adoption. I am currently examining a number of proposals in relation to amendments to the Adoption Act, 2010. I intend to bring forward any changes to the legislation in conjunction with the draft Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2013. <\/p><p>  Work is ongoing on the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, which will provide for a structured and regulated approach to providing access to adoption information and will facilitate contact for those affected by adoption, including in circumstances where an adoption order was not effected.  It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to have access to all adoption records. The Bill will provide for a National Index of Adoption Records to be maintained by the Adoption Authority containing information as to where all known adoption records are located within the State. It is envisaged that only the Authority, the HSE and accredited bodies will hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records. <\/p><p>  It is also intended that the Bill will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis. The purpose of the Register is to allow persons affected by adoption to register their names with a view to receiving information about a person from whom they have been separated as a result of adoption and will allow for registering a preference, as to whether or not,  they want to have contact with that person.  <\/p><p>  A National Tracing Service will be established, the operation of which will be subject to guidelines which will be set out in regulations. It is intended that the Tracing Service will be made available to adopted persons, birth parents and relatives with the Adoption Authority having the overarching responsibility for the service.  It is intended that prior to the release of adoption information, counselling will be offered by the Adoption Authority, the HSE or by an accredited body to an adopted person, a birth parent or to an adoptive parent if, in the opinion of the Authority, the HSE or an accredited body, such counselling would be beneficial in the circumstances, or if such counselling is requested by the applicant seeking the adoption information.<\/p><p>  Complex issues have arisen during the course of the preparation of the Bill  including the criteria for balancing an adopted person's right to information about his or her identity as against a birth parent's right to privacy. My own view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries.  Consideration of legal and policy issues is ongoing and once these have been satisfactorily resolved, I intend to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill. It is my intention to bring this Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","counter":605,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRX01350"},{"type":"question","counter":606,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[12179\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRX01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will clarify if the tax free exemption of &euro;15,000 for voluntary notified child minders will remain in place following the abolition of the child minding advisory officers; if she will clarify who currently provides the voluntary notified certificate to the child minders which is a requirement for them to avail of this scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":607,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[12180\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRX01450","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if the tax exemption for child minders will be available for new entrants; the way this will be administered; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[12181\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRX01475","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will outline the way current child minders can continue to avail of the exemption for child minders; if she will outline who will administer the schemes at a local level; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":609,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 to 228, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  Section 58 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides for exemptions for certain categories of childminders from the provisions of Section 51 of the same Act  which requires a person carrying on a pre-school service to give notice to the Health Service Executive (HSE) of their service.  Those childminders exempted under Section 58 of the Act can voluntarily notify the HSE of their service and avail of a range of benefits and supports that enables them to improve the standards of their childcare service.  These supports include the Childminders Tax Exemption scheme which provides for a tax exemption for those childminders who have satisfactorily participated in the Voluntary Notification process and whose annual income from childminding does not exceed &euro;15,000.

It has been in use in the west of Ireland since July 2012.  Under the protocol, if patients can be transported to a primary PCI centre providing 24\/7 treatment of STEMIs within 90 minutes of diagnosis, then they are brought directly to that centre. The primary PCI centre in the west of Ireland is the cardiology centre in University Hospital Galway (UHG). This unit has 2 cardiac catheter laboratories and a dedicated team of interventional cardiologists, nursing, technical and radiography staff on call 24\/7. Based on international best practice, a unit such as this will serve the population of the west of Ireland for management of STEMI.<\/p><p>  If transport to UHG within 90 minutes is not feasible, then STEMI patients are taken to the nearest emergency department equipped to stabilise patients, such as Mayo General or Portiuncula Hospitals, for thrombolysis (administration of clot-bursting drugs) to stabilise the situation. They are then transferred to UHG for assessment as to whether further immediate intervention is needed. This is accepted international best practice for management of STEMI patients, particularly in remote areas.  In addition to the national protocol, the Code STEMI Protocol, approved by the Medical Director of the HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) and through the HSE Clinical Care Programmes, outlines the actions required by hospital and NAS staff when a STEMI patient is to be transferred from a hospital to a PCI centre. <\/p><p>  The incident raised by the Deputy was reported to the National Incident Management Team at national and regional level for review. The  NAS also carried out an internal review and in parallel requested an independent review, which was conducted by the State Claims Agency. A review was also conducted between the NAS and Mayo General Hospital to ensure that the CODE STEMI protocol is followed for this type of incident.<\/p><p>  The outcomes of the reviews have been raised with the clinical programme lead of the Acute Coronary Syndrome Programme, and the Director of the NAS and actions highlighted by these reviews have been implemented. These include training of staff, a written protocol between Mayo General Hospital and the NAS, additional auditing of calls within the Ambulance Control and the re-circulation by the NAS of the Code STEMI protocol. Since this incident, all such transfers are treated as an emergency and six STEMIs have occurred in Mayo General, all following the protocol.<\/p><p>  In relation the incident itself, the NAS has informed me that, at 19:30 on 17 August 2013, the patient began to experience symptoms and, about an hour later, self-presented to Mayo General Hospital Emergency Department, where an ECG was carried out. At 21.06 the NAS received a call from Mayo ED to organise an emergency transfer from Mayo to Galway for a patient with a myocardial infarction. However, the patient was described as for angioplasty, not as a Code STEMI, and the CODE STEMI protocol was not initiated. At 21.20, an ambulance was assigned. Mayo ED was notified that an ambulance was en route, but the ED advised that the patient was being thrombolysed and the ambulance was not required.\t<\/p><p>  The NAS has confirmed that there were two ambulances at Mayo General ED at the time of the incident. An ambulance is not available for further duty until the patient is transferred to medical staff in the ED and the ambulance is reported as available. Depending on the previous call, once the hand-over is completed, the ambulance may need to be restocked, refuelled or cleaned before being ready for duty. Both ambulances had responded to previous calls and the hand-over of patients had not been completed at that point. The ambulance based in Castlebar was available and was tasked, in line with the transfer request from the hospital, but was stood down on advice from the hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRZ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Staff","counter":653,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRZ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[12086\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRZ00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason six trainee medical scientists in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, who are close to the completion of their five month clinical placement which is a compulsory part of their training, have yet to receive their monthly trainee allowance of &euro;903.98 despite the Health Service Executive memo dated 6 February 2013 outlining that all trainees were entitled to such an allowance; and if he will give an assurance that this allowance will be paid prior to the completion of these trainees' placements","asker":"1018","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":655,"content":"<p>The HSE has in the past confirmed to all health sector employers that Student Medical Scientists on placement must be paid the monthly training allowance as set out in my Department's consolidated salary scales.

In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.

A small number, in the region of five to six per cent, will receive a not normal result and will require an additional test. They will be referred for a colonoscopy to a Screening Colonoscopy Unit within a hospital contracted by the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) for provision of this service.<\/p><p>  Over half of the initially selected fifteen candidate screening colonoscopy units have been accredited to date, giving geographic spread to support the screening programme, and maintaining service requirements for symptomatic patients within national targets. The remainder of units continue to work to achieve this benchmark.  Also a number of additional units, including Roscommon County Hospital, are pursuing NHS Joint Advisory Group (JAG) accreditation and the NCSS continues to work in close partnership with Roscommon County Hospital in this regard.  The HSE is working to develop the appropriate capacity in colonoscopy services nationwide to support the introduction, sustainability and growth of the screening programme, while maintaining and enhancing the capability of the symptomatic endoscopy service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRAA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":697,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRAA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":698,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[12284\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for a medical rehabiliation centre at Roscommon County Hospital.","asker":"1085","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":699,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[12285\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRAA01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his plans for a medical rehabiliation centre at Roscommon County Hospital includes a capital development; and if so,  the costings.","asker":"1085","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":700,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[12286\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRAA02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a consultant inmedical rehabiliation will be posted at Roscommon County Hospital in view of the fact that interviews for the post have now taken place.","asker":"1085","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":701,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258 to 260, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service matters they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRAA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":704,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[12287\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for a new eight bed Palliative Care Centre at Roscommon County Hospital.","asker":"1085","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":705,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRBB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":707,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRBB00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taxi Regulations","counter":706,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRBB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":707,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[12048\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRBB00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the current number of SPSV license holders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":708,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[12049\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the number of enforcement officers attached to the National Transport Authority to invigilate the taxi sector; the number of enforcement officers as a percentage of the total number of taxi license holders, that is, the number of enforcement officers per head of the taxi population; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":709,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 263 together.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) that the current number of SPSV driver licence holders\u00a0is\u00a033,717 and there are currently 22,830 SPSV vehicle licences.

Additionally, &euro;32,234.50 of Free Travel Pass funding has been allocated to Westmeath Rural\u00a0Community Transport Association Ltd from January to June, 2013, with a further proposed, allocation of &euro;32,234.00 from July to December. This represents a total 2013 allocation of &euro;323,174.50, of combined RTP and FTP funding for the provision of the RTP service in Westmeath. <\/p><p>  My aim is to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making \u00a0the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  \u00a0 Since\u00a0becoming Minister for Public and Commuter Transport the developments I have initiated\u00a0have been aimed at ensuring that into the\u00a0future there is a more complete and cost effective transport service offering in rural areas that better meets the transport\u00a0needs of all users. To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1 April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0 I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.<\/p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community. \u00a0However, given\u00a0 resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. To not do this would mean that vital services would be threatened.  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline. <\/p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Coordination Units be established. \u00a0I would emphasise that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure\u00a0later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs. <\/p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector. \u00a0Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.  \u00a0 While I can understand and fully appreciate that this restructuring creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently. I will work with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRBB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cycling Facilities","counter":722,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRBB02100"},{"type":"question","counter":723,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[12173\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700057#WRBB02200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he is currently reviewing the application of traffic regulations that apply to cycle tracks; if he will clarify if traffic regulations SI 181\/97, 182\/97, 273\/98, 274\/98 define a cycle track in the same manner as other traffic lanes and if they define a duty to yield for other traffic crossing the cycle track; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":724,"content":"<p>The 1998 Regulations to which the Deputy refers amend the 1997 Regulations in order to provide a uniform definition of a cycle track as 'part of a road, including part of a footway or part of a roadway, which is provided primarily for the use of pedal cycles'.\u00a0 Cycle tracks are defined on the ground\u00a0by signage, including\u00a0markings on\u00a0roads or footpaths as set out in the\u00a0Road Traffic (Signs)\u00a0Regulations 1997-2012.<\/p><p>  A cycle track is specifically called a track in the regulations and is not identified as a 'lane'.\u00a0 I presume that the Deputy's\u00a0reference to a duty to yield refers to Regulation 8 of S.I.

The Department establishes the risk and exposure of fraud and error within its schemes by conducting fraud and error surveys at regular intervals.

Hedgerows are an important reservoir of biodiversity and habitat for birds, insects, wild flowers and other wildlife during the summer breeding season.

The Public Service Reform Plan is not solely focussed on monetary savings but also on creating efficiencies and streamlining services and structures.  In this context, my Department developed a comprehensive and practical approach to the implementation of the various Government Decisions in this area, which was endorsed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>  As part of that process, my Department conducted an examination of the board structures of the National Library of Ireland (NLI) and the National Museum of Ireland (NMI), as well as the issue of shared services.  My Department also examined the issues that would be involved in merging the National Archives of Ireland (NAI) and the Irish Manuscripts Commission (IMC) into the NLI, while maintaining separate identities.  Arising from this, the Government has decided that the boards of the NMI and NLI will be discontinued and, as board fees totalling over &euro;80,000 were paid out to members of these boards in 2012, direct recurring annual savings of that order will be made as a result.  In addition, the current provision by my Department of shared corporate support services to the NAI will be extended to the NMI and NLI.  This will lead to significant savings on administration, as it will facilitate greater sharing of staff and expertise, as well as freeing up staff of the institutions for frontline and core services.  Savings of approximately &euro;200,000 are expected to be achieved in staff costs, with a further &euro;350,000 in savings to be achieved through additional shared services.<\/p><p>  No specific additional costs were generated by my Department or by other bodies (such as the Office of the Attorney General or by the Oireachtas) in the development or implementation of these Government Decisions.  The preparation of the relevant proposals for consideration by Government and the implementation of the Government Decisions in this area are part of the routine duties of the relevant civil and public servants involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700060#WRO01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Websites","counter":814,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700061#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":815,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[12154\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700061#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he intends to update the organisation chart posted on his Department's website and dated January 2012 to reflect changes in personnel and organisation since that date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":816,"content":"<p>I would like to advise the Deputy that the organisation chart referred to has now been updated and posted on my Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700061#WRP00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Appointments","counter":817,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700061#WRP00350"},{"type":"question","counter":818,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[12155\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700061#WRP00400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if further to the critical review of Culture Ireland he has appointed a Director at Principal Officer level within his Department; if he has as stated, acted to underpin the independence of his role by ensuring as promised that a Delegation Order under the Public Service Management Act 1997, from the Secretary General to the\u00a0Director has been made; if he will publish the delegation order; the name of the Director and also state whatever if any other functions that person has within his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":819,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that an officer was appointed on 20 June 2012, at Principal Officer level, to act as Director of my Department's Culture Ireland Unit.

The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30 Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  Specifically, it commits to:<\/p><p> - 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015,<\/p><p> - At least 40 Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and<\/p><p> - A minimum of 30 Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. <\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as, Oldtown, Ballyboughal, Naul and Garristown will have at least 30 Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700062#WRQ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":844,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[12275\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700062#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will confirm if the feasibility of using the existing electricity grid network for the provision of broadband internet services has been examined; if so if his policy favours the use of using such technology to bring broadband internet access to remote locations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":845,"content":"<p>It has been Government policy for some time that State entities should avail of commercial opportunities to facilitate the deployment of infrastructure to the telecommunications market.

I am aware that the Electricity Supply Board (ESB), for example, recently sought a joint venture partner to deploy and manage, as a wholesale service provider, access to a fibre-to-the-building network capable of providing next generation broadband services, using the existing electricity network infrastructure.  These initiatives are consistent with the National Broadband Plan (NBP) which reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to using State Assets to help accelerate the roll-out of next generation high speed broadband.<\/p><p>  The NBP also recognises that Government intervention will be required to ensure a minimum marketed speed of 30 megabits per second will be available in those parts of the country the competitive market will not serve.

Over that period some &euro; 99.9 million was recouped to local authorities in respect of improvements carried out to 7,762 dwellings.<\/p><p>  This year I will be focusing investment on improving the quality and standard of the tenanted social rented units. This will be done through a range of measures including regeneration, estate-wide remedial works and energy retrofitting of older houses and apartments.  I am bringing in a new measure which will specifically target older properties and involves the insulation of attics and walls, draught-proofing of windows and doors and the fitting of heating controls.<\/p><p>  Last week I allocated &euro;111.4 million for a programme of works ranging from large scale regeneration works to a retrofitting scheme aimed at improving the energy efficiency of these properties. My Department also provides capital funding to local authorities to assist with the provision of necessary adaptations and extensions to their properties to meet the needs of tenants with a disability.<\/p><p>  A second focus this year will be to undertake an audit of the 130,000 social housing units in conjunction with the local authorities , in order to better understand the quality and distribution of the national social housing stock and to facilitate the future planning of sound and robust improvement works programmes.  This will provide a comprehensive database to inform future targeted interventions aimed at further improving the stock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700062#WRQ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Service Issues","counter":849,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700062#WRQ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":850,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[12050\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700062#WRQ01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide the detailed data and risk assessment that his Department used to base its finding for Keeping Communities Safe document; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":851,"content":"<p>The recently published <i>Keeping Communities Safe<\/i> (KCS) sets the future direction of fire services in a way that aligns fire services and fire safety in Ireland with international good practice.  KCS was developed by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department following a review of relevant international literature which is referenced in Appendix D of the document.  A collaborative process was used between central and local government in developing KCS, including expert input by Chief Fire Officers and fire services personnel; stakeholder consultation and engagement by the National Directorate with relevant technical organisations to ensure the best fit between up-to-date thinking and Ireland&#8217;s needs.  The document was recommended for adoption as national policy by the Management Board of the Directorate.<\/p><p><br \/>  KCS is based on the systems approach to safety management in set ting out the guidance and core standards for fire authorities to achieve the objective of keeping communities safe from fire.  The systems approach is recognised internationally and is applied in many safety spheres.  The Risk Management approach, which is described in Chapter 2 of KCS, is generally seen to involve five stages including identifying hazards and evaluating the risks these hazards pose, mitigating these risks by trying to reduce the probability of the event and\/or its consequences if it does occur, planning and preparing to deal with the risk, responding to an event, and reviewing events with a view to learning for the future.<\/p><p><br \/>  A common understanding in relation to terminology in risk management is important, hence the inclusion of relevant definitions in Appendix E of KCS.  In particular, the term &#8220;Risk Assessment&#8221; as used in KCS is one stage of the risk management process outlined above.  The National Directorate prepared a series of &#8216;Task Analyses&#8217; to show how the recommended initial &#8216;Pre -determined Attendance&#8217; (PDAs) responses may safely undertake tasks normally associated with the common range of fire scenarios set out in Appendix A to the document.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under Section 19 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 , the phrase &#8216;risk assessment&#8217; has a particular meaning, and requires employers to carry out risk assessments of their work activities.  Guidance on relevant aspects of risk assessment for fire services, and meeting this legislative requirement, is provided through a number of approaches.  The concept of &#8216;Dynamic Risk Assessment&#8217; at fire service operations is embedded in the National Incident Command System introduced in 2007.  The Fire Services Ancillary Safety Statement, also from 2007, developed generic risk assessment processes for fire services, and the Fire Service Standard Operational Guidance (SOGs) developed specific situational risk assessments for fire services activities. It is expected that individual fire services will prepare any additional risk assessments, which may be necessary to comply with their statutory responsibilities as employers on foot of changes arising from implementation of KCS, based on the Task Analyses referred to above.  A Fire Services Safety Management System (SMS) support document is being developed as <i>part<\/i>   of the KCS implementation process to ensure that occupational health and safety in fire services is fully aligned with recently adopted local government SMS policy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700062#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Septic Tank Registration Scheme","counter":852,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700062#WRQ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":853,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[12055\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700062#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if septic tank registration will have to be renewed every five years;

Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&#8217;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation. Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:<\/p><p><b>&quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland. Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.<\/b><\/p><p><b>  There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement. It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot;<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister added that:   <b>&quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole. It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course. Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so. It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.<\/b><\/p><p><b>  My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.<\/b><\/p><p><b>  This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate. I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received. I expect it is likely that the Committee&#8217;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. The report received by me from the Joint Oireachtas Committee will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary new legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course.<\/b><\/p><p><b>  I look forward to the results of the consultation process.&quot;<\/b><\/p><p>The discussion document will be made available on the Department&#8217;s website, <i>.  <\/i>This discussion document does not favour any particular approach but simply tries to assist reflection.

I have been working to encourage more new entrants to take up farming as a career.  Budget 2013 saw the extension of key reliefs that were already in place for young new entrants (such as the 100% relief from Stamp Duty and the 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers).  These provide an incentive both for early inter-generational farm transfer and also encourage young qualified farmers to expand their enterprise.  Extending these reliefs is not straightforward given that there is a requirement for EU State Aid approval for such measures.  The deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in budget 2012 to encourage earlier inter-generational land transfers.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am delighted that the number of applicants for Teagasc courses has greatly increased the last two years.  Teagasc has responded well to this demand have introduced new courses to cater for a variety of needs.  For example, last year Teagasc has launched a new Professional Diploma in Dairy Farm Management (Level 7) in association with University College Dublin (UCD).  Teagasc have also developed a new<i><\/i>Level 6 Specific Purpose Certificate in Farm Administration course to help meet the training requirements for full-time or part-time farmers. <\/p><p><br \/>  Measures to provide targeted support to young farmers are part of the current negotiations on the reform of the CAP and will I hope form part of any final agreement.  I have strongly supported the proposal for a top-up for young farmers under pillar 1 of the CAP, and indeed Ireland was one of the first countries to suggest this measure in the negotiations.  I am also happy that the new farm restructuring CGT relief has been announced in the 2013 budget, subject to EU State Aid approval.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old stamp duty consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.<\/p><p><br \/>  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land. A recent EU Commission study found that &#8216;<i>younger[farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force<\/i> &#8217;.  Ireland has a very low level of land sales, with most land staying within the same family for generations. Only 0.4% of land changes hand in any given year.  Young farmers that want to expand need to be able to access land.  According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.  Young farmers will now have an opportunity to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am hopeful therefore that the measures that I have both retained and introduced will encourage more young people into farming and address the age profile imbalance in Irish farming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700068#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harbour Authority Properties","counter":1016,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700068#WRW00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1017,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[12134\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700068#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the proposed parking plan at Howth, County Dublin.","asker":"1017","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1018,"content":"<p>The documents enclosed are further submissions from the Howth Sutton Baldoyle Chamber of Commerce and the Howth Yacht Club addressing the issue of pay parking within the Fishery Harbour Centre at Howth.

This virus causes mild transient disease manifesting as a drop in milk production, fever and sometimes diarrhoea  in adult cattle. When infection occurs in animals that are not pregnant, the impact is very limited. However if ruminant animals are infected during the early stages of pregnancy, they may subsequently abort or give birth to malformed offspring. <\/p><p>  It would be impractical to attempt midge control measures, except for valuable breeding stock.  Exposure of non-pregnant animals to the virus may, in fact, be beneficial pending the development of an effective vaccine. Exposed animals develop a strong immunity and are unlikely to suffer any ill-effects if exposed to the virus on a subsequent occasion. If this viral infection becomes endemic, the ill-effects are likely to be confined to younger animals and cows and ewes that have not been previously exposed. Based on Australian experience in vaccinating against a similar virus\/disease (Akabane virus infection), the expert view is that vaccination is likely to be an effective tool in control of the SBV infection. The development of a vaccine is in progress and my Department will continue to monitor developments closely. <\/p><p>  Meanwhile, farmers are advised to contact their veterinary practitioner if they encounter cases of aborted foetuses or newborn animals showing malformations or nervous signs and also in  cases where lambs or calves cannot be delivered naturally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700068#WRW00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Appeals","counter":1025,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700068#WRW00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1026,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[12233\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700068#WRW01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a revised decision will be made on as application for disadvantage area scheme payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1027,"content":"<p>The person named is one of a number of applicants under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, whose cases are impacted by the requirement of a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare and who applied for and were refused derogation in this regard.

The Policy Framework is expected to be published in mid 2013 and will build on Our Children - Their Lives, Ireland&rsquo;s first Children&rsquo;s Strategy which was published in 2000.  This is relevant to the National Early Years Strategy as the Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework. <\/p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is already under development and is expected to be completed and published later this year.  It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, including physical and mental development, vaccination programmes and population health issues such as nutrition and exercise, as well as parenting and  family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education, including literacy and numeracy.<\/p><p>  The Strategy will bring together and consider a significant amount of international and domestic research on the importance of early years for child development, including findings from the 'Growing up in Ireland' study.  It will also be informed by the evaluations from the Prevention and Early Interventions Projects which have been funded jointly by my Department and philanthropic organisations, as well as an analysis of existing service provision and associated resources.  The major programme of institutional change which is currently underway, including the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency, will also be taken into account.  The results of a public consultation, undertaken as part of the development of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework, is currently being analysed and will inform both the Framework and the Early Years Strategy.   A further, focussed consultation with key stakeholders in relation to the Early Years Strategy, is also proposed.<\/p><p>  My Department provides funding to support three childcare programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme - which provide a range of supports to parents of preschool children and also after-school care for children older than 6 years. <\/p><p>  The CCS programme is provided through community-based childcare services and enables those services to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, disadvantage and low income are determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  <\/p><p>  My Department also implements the CETS programme which was introduced in September 2010.  The eligibility criteria under which trainees and students qualify for the programme is determined by F&Aacute;S and the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs) and &euro;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places is provided by my Department to those deemed qualified.  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.    <\/p><p>  The ECCE programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   <\/p><p>  A new School Age Childcare initiative was announced in Budget 2013 as part of a packet of measures to support children and families.  It will be implemented as a joint venture by my Department and the Department of Social Protection.  Under the initiative, over 6,000 after school childcare places will be made available for children of parents availing of employment opportunities.  My Department has been given a full year allocation of &euro;14 million to provide for the scheme which is expected to be fully rolled out in September 2013.  This Department provides in the region of &euro;260 million annually to support parents with the cost of childcare under these programmes and despite the budgetary situation the programmes have been maintained and expanded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700069#WRX00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Poverty","counter":1056,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700069#WRX00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1057,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[12142\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700069#WRX01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the measures that will be taken between her Department and the Department of Social Protection to end child poverty here, in line with the new EU recommendations Investing in Children: Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage 2013; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1058,"content":"<p>The European Commission Recommendation \"Investing in Children - Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage\" is part of the \"Social Investment Package\" published by the European Commission in February.

The Bill will provide for a National Index of Adoption Records to be maintained by the Adoption Authority containing information as to where all known adoption records are located within the State.

Those childminders exempted under Section 58 of the Act can voluntarily notify the HSE of their service and avail of a range of benefits and supports that enables them to improve the standards of their childcare service.  These supports include the Childminders Tax Exemption scheme which provides for a tax exemption for those childminders who have satisfactorily participated in the Voluntary Notification process and whose annual income from childminding does not exceed &euro;15,000.

It has been in use in the west of Ireland since July 2012.  Under the protocol, if patients can be transported to a primary PCI centre providing 24\/7 treatment of STEMIs within 90 minutes of diagnosis, then they are brought directly to that centre. The primary PCI centre in the west of Ireland is the cardiology centre in University Hospital Galway (UHG). This unit has 2 cardiac catheter laboratories and a dedicated team of interventional cardiologists, nursing, technical and radiography staff on call 24\/7. Based on international best practice, a unit such as this will serve the population of the west of Ireland for management of STEMI.<\/p><p>  If transport to UHG within 90 minutes is not feasible, then STEMI patients are taken to the nearest emergency department equipped to stabilise patients, such as Mayo General or Portiuncula Hospitals, for thrombolysis (administration of clot-bursting drugs) to stabilise the situation. They are then transferred to UHG for assessment as to whether further immediate intervention is needed. This is accepted international best practice for management of STEMI patients, particularly in remote areas.  In addition to the national protocol, the Code STEMI Protocol, approved by the Medical Director of the HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) and through the HSE Clinical Care Programmes, outlines the actions required by hospital and NAS staff when a STEMI patient is to be transferred from a hospital to a PCI centre. <\/p><p>  The incident raised by the Deputy was reported to the National Incident Management Team at national and regional level for review. The  NAS also carried out an internal review and in parallel requested an independent review, which was conducted by the State Claims Agency. A review was also conducted between the NAS and Mayo General Hospital to ensure that the CODE STEMI protocol is followed for this type of incident.<\/p><p>  The outcomes of the reviews have been raised with the clinical programme lead of the Acute Coronary Syndrome Programme, and the Director of the NAS and actions highlighted by these reviews have been implemented. These include training of staff, a written protocol between Mayo General Hospital and the NAS, additional auditing of calls within the Ambulance Control and the re-circulation by the NAS of the Code STEMI protocol. Since this incident, all such transfers are treated as an emergency and six STEMIs have occurred in Mayo General, all following the protocol.<\/p><p>  In relation the incident itself, the NAS has informed me that, at 19:30 on 17 August 2013, the patient began to experience symptoms and, about an hour later, self-presented to Mayo General Hospital Emergency Department, where an ECG was carried out. At 21.06 the NAS received a call from Mayo ED to organise an emergency transfer from Mayo to Galway for a patient with a myocardial infarction. However, the patient was described as for angioplasty, not as a Code STEMI, and the CODE STEMI protocol was not initiated. At 21.20, an ambulance was assigned. Mayo ED was notified that an ambulance was en route, but the ED advised that the patient was being thrombolysed and the ambulance was not required.\t<\/p><p>  The NAS has confirmed that there were two ambulances at Mayo General ED at the time of the incident. An ambulance is not available for further duty until the patient is transferred to medical staff in the ED and the ambulance is reported as available. Depending on the previous call, once the hand-over is completed, the ambulance may need to be restocked, refuelled or cleaned before being ready for duty. Both ambulances had responded to previous calls and the hand-over of patients had not been completed at that point. The ambulance based in Castlebar was available and was tasked, in line with the transfer request from the hospital, but was stood down on advice from the hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700071#WRZ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Staff","counter":1110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700071#WRZ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1111,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[12086\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700071#WRZ00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason six trainee medical scientists in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, who are close to the completion of their five month clinical placement which is a compulsory part of their training, have yet to receive their monthly trainee allowance of &euro;903.98 despite the Health Service Executive memo dated 6 February 2013 outlining that all trainees were entitled to such an allowance; and if he will give an assurance that this allowance will be paid prior to the completion of these trainees' placements","asker":"1018","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1112,"content":"<p>The HSE has in the past confirmed to all health sector employers that Student Medical Scientists on placement must be paid the monthly training allowance as set out in my Department's consolidated salary scales.

Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. In addition, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing for prescribed drugs and medicines.

Additionally, &euro;32,234.50 of Free Travel Pass funding has been allocated to Westmeath Rural\u00a0Community Transport Association Ltd from January to June, 2013, with a further proposed, allocation of &euro;32,234.00 from July to December. This represents a total 2013 allocation of &euro;323,174.50, of combined RTP and FTP funding for the provision of the RTP service in Westmeath. <\/p><p>  My aim is to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making \u00a0the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.  \u00a0 Since\u00a0becoming Minister for Public and Commuter Transport the developments I have initiated\u00a0have been aimed at ensuring that into the\u00a0future there is a more complete and cost effective transport service offering in rural areas that better meets the transport\u00a0needs of all users. To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the RTP, was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0with effect\u00a0from 1 April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.\u00a0 I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee\u00a0in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport.<\/p><p>  I am well aware of the very valuable work done by the RTP Groups in identifying and delivering the transport needs of their local community. \u00a0However, given\u00a0 resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is\u00a0necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. To not do this would mean that vital services would be threatened.  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline. <\/p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be &quot;aligned&quot; with local authorities and that a number of Coordination Units be established. \u00a0I would emphasise that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure\u00a0later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs. <\/p><p>  I will be ensuring that any future structure for the RTP will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector. \u00a0Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.  \u00a0 While I can understand and fully appreciate that this restructuring creates a level of uncertainty for RTP groups, I am hopeful that the outcome will be a better service delivered more efficiently. I will work with all involved over the coming months to make any transition as smooth as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700073#WRBB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cycling Facilities","counter":1179,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700073#WRBB02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1180,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[12173\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030700073#WRBB02200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he is currently reviewing the application of traffic regulations that apply to cycle tracks; if he will clarify if traffic regulations SI 181\/97, 182\/97, 273\/98, 274\/98 define a cycle track in the same manner as other traffic lanes and if they define a duty to yield for other traffic crossing the cycle track; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1181,"content":"<p>The 1998 Regulations to which the Deputy refers amend the 1997 Regulations in order to provide a uniform definition of a cycle track as 'part of a road, including part of a footway or part of a roadway, which is provided primarily for the use of pedal cycles'.\u00a0 Cycle tracks are defined on the ground\u00a0by signage, including\u00a0markings on\u00a0roads or footpaths as set out in the\u00a0Road Traffic (Signs)\u00a0Regulations 1997-2012.<\/p><p>  A cycle track is specifically called a track in the regulations and is not identified as a 'lane'.\u00a0 I presume that the Deputy's\u00a0reference to a duty to yield refers to Regulation 8 of S.I.
