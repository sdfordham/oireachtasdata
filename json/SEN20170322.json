The treatment of sarcomas requires integrated multidisciplinary care, with the involvement of many different clinicians.  St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital has provided highly specialised and individualised treatment to sarcoma sufferers for a number of years.  St. Vincent&rsquo;s has access to all of the relevant specialties for treatment, including surgery, medical oncology, radiation oncology, radiology and pathology.  It is the largest provider of surgical procedures for soft tissue sarcomas in the country.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive is committed lo providing a high quality, responsive and sustainable service for sarcoma patients.

The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 makes it mandatory for people working with children or vulnerable adults to be screened by the Garda National Vetting Bureau.  This provision is necessary and prudent and is welcomed by all organisations working with the young and with vulnerable people.  It means that adults in roles such as teaching, youth work, sports coaching and nursing, those working in church organisations and many others are now obliged to have Garda clearance.  While this is positive, the fact an individual has to make a unique application for vetting clearance for each organisation seems an unnecessary duplication of effort and is an example of how the procedures are designed to suit the system rather than to accommodate the volunteer or the staff member.<\/p> <p>A young woman I know had to have Garda vetting for her college course.  She had to be vetted again because she is involved in a church group, vetted a third time because she is involved in the Irish Girl Guides, vetted a fourth time because she teaches English as a foreign language in her spare time and, would you believe, vetted a fifth time because her family keep Spanish students.  All of these accreditations are identical.  They all say that she has no criminal conviction and that there is no concern she will harm a child or put a child at risk.  They all say the exact same thing.  When she asked me why she cannot just have one card that proves she has been vetted and cleared, I could find no logical answer for her.  At the moment this woman, who has much to offer her local community and who understands and supports the need for vetting, is being asked, like many others, to jump through multiple hoops unnecessarily.<\/p> <p>This can be offputting and serve to discourage people from taking additional voluntary roles in the community.  I will agree that the application procedure has speeded up considerably in recent years, particularly with the introduction of online application vetting.  However, with 3,000 applications a month, I believe it makes more sense to have a single vetting card issued to an individual which would be valid for a fixed period of time and would be used in multiple contexts, as happens in other countries.<\/p> <p>There is an issue which is coming to a head at present involving 32,000 teachers who have worked in the same schools since before 2006, when vetting became compulsory.  They all now need to apply for vetting before the end of the month.  The Teaching Council is concerned that, based on current trends, as many as 600 teachers may lapse from its register and, therefore, face loss of salary.  Many of these 32,000 teachers already have Garda vetting clearance for other activities in which they are involved.  It seems ridiculous that this cannot be used for their teaching.<\/p> <p>Vetting is essential but unnecessary complication is not.  There are lots of excuses as to why a more streamlined vetting system cannot be put in place but there is no good reason.  I ask the Minister of State, the line Minister and the Department to review the current procedure without delay with a view to making it more user-friendly.  We need a system that not only protects children but one which removes unnecessary barriers for those wishing to help and support those same children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#B00600","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>On behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank Senator McFadden for raising this issue in the House.  Unfortunately, she cannot be present and I am here in her place.<\/p> <p>As the House will appreciate, the primary purpose of Garda vetting is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Every effort is made to make the system as efficient as possible but that cannot be at the expense of the core objective.  In accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016, vetting is conducted by the Garda National Vetting Bureau in respect of a range of employments and services where persons would have substantial and unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults.  It is necessary for the Garda National Vetting Bureau to conduct full vetting checks for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up to date.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to inform the Senator that the vast majority of vetting applications are now submitted and processed via the eVetting system and that 80% of the applications are now being processed by the Garda National Vetting Bureau in five working days.  In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the problems presented in individual cases of re-vetting or vetting transferability are very significantly reduced.  This sustained improvement in processing times has come about primarily as a result of significant investment by the Government in the Garda National Vetting Bureau and, in particular, following the launch in April this year of the new eVetting system.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->All organisations are encouraged to avail of this service and indeed 85% of organisations registered for vetting are already using it.  Some individual cases will of their nature take longer than the average to complete when, for example, more extensive inquiries are required.  However, these cases are in the minority.  It is important to note also that the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 provide for a degree of flexibility which may lessen the administrative burden in respect of vetting for the management of organisations that work with children and vulnerable adults.<\/p><p>Section 12 of the Acts makes provision for certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure in respect of an individual application where there is agreement with the vetting applicant.  This is a particularly important flexibility in respect of persons working, for example, in the health or education sectors as locums or substitute teachers.  Section 12 of the Acts also makes specific provision in respect of persons who may be employed on a recurring but non-continuous basis.  This could comprise persons who might provide services in a school or a number of schools on a regular basis.  The vetting obligations in respect of these persons shall be regarded as satisfied where the registered organisation received a vetting disclosure in respect of the individual for the initial engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#B00700","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I appreciate that this is not necessarily her portfolio.

I particularly want to raise with her the issue of Rush Garda station, which is located in north County Dublin.  Rush Garda station closed down in 2012 under the last Government.  I call on the Minster of State to strongly consider Rush for inclusion in the pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations, which is imminent.<\/p> <p>The closure has left a serious void in the policing of north County Dublin.  When it was closed in 2012, we were reassured that a 24-hour service would be provided in the nearby Lusk Garda station, but this never occurred.  In fact, the hours in Lusk Garda station have since been reduced.  As I said, this has left a very big void in the policing of north County Dublin.  Fingal is the fastest-growing county in Ireland.  The population of Rush itself is 10,000 and Lusk has almost 10,000.  We are being policed from Balbriggan Garda station, which is the nearest 24-hour Garda station.  That is over 14 km from Rush and has a population itself of 26,000.  That station is seriously overstretched and it is not able to provide an adequate service to the people in Rush in particular, as well as in nearby Lusk.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, we have seen an escalation in both violent and serious crime in north County Dublin as well as anti-social behaviour, particularly in or around the Rush area.  I believe there is a strong correlation between the lack of a Garda service in the town and this increase in crime.  I come from a Garda family myself.  I am very well aware of the vital service community garda&iacute; provide to the community and the impact that visibility of garda&iacute; on the streets of a town can have on the level of both serious crime and anti-social behaviour in the area.<\/p> <p>As per the programme for Government, there is a commitment to review the Garda station closures, which occurred during the lifetime of the last Government.  More than 100 Garda stations were closed nationwide.  This review is currently being undertaken and is due to report in May.  As I mentioned, there was a commitment in the programme for Government that six Garda stations would be opened on a pilot scheme basis.  Recent media reports have suggested that the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, has already secured the reopening of the Stepaside Garda station, which is in his own constituency.  According to media reports, he is so confident of this that he already has newsletters ready to be distributed around the constituency.<\/p> <p>I know that the Minister of State is not the direct line Minister of State but I appeal to her to pass on the message to the Minister for Justice and Equality to include Rush in this pilot scheme.  We do not have a senior Cabinet Minister or any Minister in north County Dublin.  I feel therefore that we are going to get left behind and that south County Dublin will benefit because it has a Minister.  I appeal to the Minister of State on the basis that Rush is a large and growing urban area with a surrounding rural hinterland.  As I said, it is among the fastest-growing areas within the fastest growing constituency and county in Ireland.  Therefore, we really need the reopening of Rush Garda station.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consider Rush Garda station in the pilot scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#C00600","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Clifford-Lee for raising this commencement matter.

As the Senator will be aware, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na district and station rationalisation programme gave rise to the closure of some 139 Garda stations, including Rush Garda station, in 2012 and 2013, following the completion by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a comprehensive review of its district and station network.  The review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase effectiveness and streamline practices within the organisation.  The T&aacute;naiste has been informed by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front-line garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to targeted police operations.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.

In this context, the T&aacute;naiste has requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions, to identify six stations for reopening on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  The pilot will feed into the wider review being undertaken by the Garda Sioch&aacute;na inspectorate at the request of the Policing Authority of the use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities.  I understand that work is continuing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify the six stations for inclusion in the pilot and that consultations have taken place with relevant stakeholders, including the Policing Authority.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In this context, I am sure the Senator would agree that a comprehensive and evidence-based analysis should be carried out taking account of all the relevant factors before a final decision is made in respect of the stations to be reopened by the Commissioner.

The school has seen significant development, as has the village of Ballinspittle, over recent years.  The school was put on the six-year capital building programme in November 2015, which was a very positive step for Ballinspittle and the entire community.  In the original proposal, it was supposed to go to construction in 2017.  This is one of the key issues we are fighting for this morning.  We want to see this school progressing and we need the project to go to construction in 2017.  For the 2017 commitment to be met, it must go through detailed design, planning and tendering this year.  It is now March, time is ticking and the need for the school is very important.  The site is available.  There are at least three and a half acres around the school so there is no issue with the site itself.  Numbers in the school have increased.  By 2018, 230 pupils will be going to this school.  There are two autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classrooms that are a very important part of the school and its ethos.<\/p> <p>One of the key issues with the school building is that it is maximised at every level, be it a store room, the general purpose, GP room, the community hall or the hall itself.  The GP room is divided in two so there are two resource teachers in that room.  As the GP room is taken up with resource teachers, there is no drama or PE in the school.  A total of 19 children need sensory space, sensory time and sensory breaks, which are very important.  The only way they can get them is to get them in the hallway, which is not appropriate.  It is a big issue for the community, the principal and the parents of children in the school.  It is a thriving community that will do its utmost for its children.  It needs this project to be moved forward.  It is in the building programme but time is ticking.  It will need another teacher for the academic year starting in 2018.  There is no room at the moment for that teacher.  If the store room and GP room are being used and if there are children who need to use the hallway for sensory time, there is no capacity at any level to take another teacher in September 2018 so we need this project to be moved forward at pace.<\/p> <p>We need a site visit, the project to be progressed and the detailed design, tendering and planning to be done.  We need to get somebody on site in order that in the next year and a bit, this school will be completed.  In many ways, Ballinspittle national school is like many schools that need upgrades in a very short period because the community has grown rapidly.  The special needs aspect is probably the heartbreaking part.  We need to move urgently and the matter needs to be prioritised.  I realise that the Minister of State is not directly involved but she could give some hope to the community that this project will be progressed in the short term and completed by September 2018 because these are the very strict and tight deadlines that the community is unfortunately under.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#D00800","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills who is unavailable.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the Department's position regarding the provision of a major building project for Ballinspittle national school in County Cork.  The Senator will be aware of the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years, including in the Cork area.  In that regard, the six-year construction programme aims to prioritise new building projects and major extensions, including special schools, in areas where demographic need has been established.  In addition, the capital programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools, including special schools, where an immediate accommodation requirement has been identified.  In that regard, it is open to schools to apply for funding for additional classroom accommodation where required.<\/p> <p>The Senator will be aware that Ballinspittle national school is a co-educational Catholic ethos primary school catering for boys and girls from junior infants to sixth class.  In recent years, Ballinspittle national school has experienced significant growth in enrolments of almost 50%, with pupil numbers increasing from 145 pupils in 2010 to 214 pupils in 2016.  As a result, it requires a major extension to the existing school to meet current and anticipated future demand for school places.  In light of this increase in enrolments, it was agreed with the school that it would be allowed to grow from an eight-classroom to a 12-classroom school.  In addition, the Department has been in regular contact with the National Council for Special Education in respect of special education requirements in the Cork area, and provision will he made in the project brief for Ballinspittle national school for a three-class ASD unit.<\/p> <p>The Department is aware of the specific accommodation needs of the school, and in that regard, the building project for Ballinspittle national school is included in the Department's six-year construction programme.  In the context of progressing this project, the Department is undertaking an analysis of the school's architectural plans in advance of a technical site visit.  The Department will also be contacting the school shortly with a view to scheduling a date for the technical site visit after Easter.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter and confirm the Department's commitment to progressing the building project in the case of Ballinspittle national school.

The anniversary falls in a moment that is particularly complex in light of the internal and external challenges that face the European Union.<\/p> <p>The economic and social benefits generated by the membership of the EU have been incalculable for Ireland.  All we have to do is look at the visible investment that the EU has put into our roads network, the opportunities presented to small and medium-sized businesses in Ireland to access European markets, the explosion of European tourism due to low-cost travel and the common currency, the ease of mobility for our citizens to study and work across Europe and the list goes on.  We also cannot forget the fact that for the past 60 years there has been peace in Europe and that the concept and reality of war has been unknown for more than three generations.  For the past decade, however, the mood in Europe has changed with some countries feeling that the European Union has fallen below their expectations.  This has materialised in a Brexit referendum in the UK and next week, the British Prime Minister will trigger Article 50 in a planned exit from the European Union.<\/p> <p>The challenges that face the EU include globalisation, the technology revolution, the recent global economic crisis and the biggest political crisis, which has been generated by the vast migratory flows of people from neighbouring countries.  Millions of people have abandoned their countries of origin and fled to Europe to escape oppressive regimes, grave political strains, climate disasters and poor economic prospects.  They seek a brighter future in Europe.  Unfortunately, the inward migratory flow has engendered fear in many Europeans and been one of the main stimuli in the Brexit campaign.  I believe such a reaction was wrong and this is a view shared by many of my colleagues in this Chamber.  The real reason for the fear is a lack of knowledge and I believe that fear to be unwarranted.  <\/p> <p>As we all know, Europe is changing.  Ultimately the benefits of our EU membership massively outweigh any perceived concerns.  I look forward to participating in the Brexit debate in the Seanad Chamber and, over the course of the programme, examining the White Paper that has been prepared by the EU on the future of Europe.  I also look forward to debating our membership of the EU and how we can play an active role as a committed member.  <\/p> <p>The second issue that I wish to raise is legal aid.  The legal aid system in Ireland is known as free legal aid but in fact is not free because there is a small fee, starting at &euro;130, for those in receipt of standard social welfare payments.  Many women, especially those in violent situations, stay in their homes and do not seek the protection of the courts due to the fee being too high for anyone surviving on a low income.  <\/p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality attended a conference in Geneva the week after we passed domestic violence legislation.  One recommendation made at the conference was to grant an automatic waiver to anyone who finds himself or herself in a domestic violence situation.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste to initiate such a waiver programme, as it would allow women in domestic violence situations to seek the protection of the courts.  A waiver would remove a cost that acts as a barrier.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to urgently implement the waiver as it will assist people in domestic violence situations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#G00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Yesterday I advised that I might discuss issues relating to the Defence Forces here.

The programme aims to provide second-chance education, often for students from poor socio-economic backgrounds.  What is happening is alarming and discriminatory.  Dublin Institute of Technology is singling out a cohort of students and determining, for some reason, that they need to be Garda vetted.  I wrote to the president of the institute, Professor Brian Norton, whose response was unsatisfactory.  He admits that, in terms of the blanket collection of data, only 10% of the students will undertake restricted access courses.  They will be Garda vetted when they start their degree programmes.  Will the Leader invite the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Dara Murphy, who has responsibility for data protection to come to the House to discuss the issue because I believe Dublin Institute of Technology is in breach of data protection laws.  In the response I have received from Professor Norton he admits that the information is being collected on the basis that it \"might\" be relevant for a percentage of students in the future if they choose to continue their studies in the institute.  Under sections 2A and 2B of the Data Protection Act, sensitive personal data may only be collected where it is necessary for a particular purpose.  It is clear that Garda vetting in gaining access to education is not necessary for a particular purpose.  I have written to the Data Protection Commissioner to request that his office look into the matter.  I have also written to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission about it.  However, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Dara Murphy, both have a role to play, particularly given the promises made by the former to increase access to education for those from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds.  This measure is counterproductive in the context of the work the Minister is trying to do in this regard.  If I were telling the House that a group of Travellers or non-nationals had been singled out for Garda vetting, Members would be saying it was racist and discriminatory.  However, because this involves class discrimination, the matter is not receiving the attention it deserves.  It merits a conversation.

It is my understanding general elections take place every five years.  The fact that Ms Forbes said the general election in 2016 was unforeseen leads one to question her capability.

I do not think many of the populist moves that were made necessarily resonated with the public in the way that might have been expected.<\/p> <p>The World Health Organization, WHO, recently published a list of priority pathogens that are resistant to antibiotics.  The list, which comprises 12 families of bacteria that pose the greatest threat to human health, highlights extremely dangerous bacteria that have built-in abilities to resist treatment.  It is increasingly concerning that these bacteria can pass along genetic material that allow other bacteria to become resistant to drugs as well.  The introduction of penicillin in the 1940s heralded the antibiotic era.  We are now in the era of antibiotic resistance or antimicrobial resistance.  I was shocked to read that, according to a recent review on antimicrobial resistance commissioned by the UK Government, 700,000 people across the world die from antimicrobial resistance-related infections each year.  It is predicted that this death toll will reach 10 million by 2050, which would make antimicrobial resistance the world's largest cause of death, surpassing cancer.  In the case of a woman in the United States that was documented recently, none of the 26 available antibiotics worked on the incurable infection - the superbug - that eventually killed her.  We must address, as a matter of urgency, the fact that antibiotics will one day not work anymore.  A four-year project is currently probing the potential of coatings that might repel and eliminate micro-organisms that come into context with everyday hospital textiles such as bedsheets and gowns.  These antimicrobial coatings could also be used on solid surfaces like walls, floors, beds and tables.  Although this endeavour is not a silver bullet, I believe the HSE should do everything it can to support it, especially when it is investing in new hospitals.  I am calling on the Minister for Health to examine the list produced by the WHO and to allocate funding for research into the development of new antibiotics here in Ireland as a matter of priority.  If the Minister for Health is coming to this House in the near future, I will be very keen to raise this issue with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#K01000","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; tar &eacute;is ceisteanna a ard&uacute; maidir leis na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la agus an cine&aacute;l maoirsi&uacute; a dh&eacute;antar orthu &oacute; thaobh na Roinne de.  I would like to raise the way the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government oversees local authorities.  Since we debated the Putting People First strategy, which proposed to give extensive new powers to the CEOs of local authorities, it has come to my attention that there are irregularities in Galway City Council regarding the income from parking meters.  I have been informed that the discrepancy could be to the tune of a couple of hundred thousand euro.  I am concerned that even though this was apparently brought to the attention of senior management in Galway City Council over three years ago, we did not find out about it until now.  Why has the whole thing been kept a secret?  I have also been told that all the machines in Galway are out of action, which means badly needed money is being lost to Galway City Council.  People constantly come to my office to say they have issues with housing and estate maintenance, etc., but when I contact Galway City Council, I am told no money is available for such matters.  The broader question of the level of oversight of local authorities that is in place within the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government arises in this context.  Is there is a flagging system that ensures the Minister and the Department, as the overseeing body through which the Government provides funding, are told when things like this are happening?  Is a criminal investigation pending in this scenario?  My understanding is that it involves a new parking system which was put in place a couple of years ago.  I think it is worth raising these issues with the Minister.  Perhaps that can be done in the context of the review of the implementation of the Putting People First strategy.<\/p> <p>I thank those who were able to attend the presentation on the International Protection Act 2015, which took place in the audiovisual room yesterday.  We were told that there are serious implementation issues with the 2015 Act.  Many speakers at the presentation said there are huge problems with the provision of legal support services to people who are applying for asylum as a result of the introduction of a complicated new 30-page questionnaire.  We were told that Google Translate has been used to translate the questionnaire in a manner that is nonsensical to native speakers of the various languages involved.  It appears that the only aspects of the McMahon report that are being implemented are the prosecutorial elements.  It seems that the positive elements of the report setting out the changes people need are not being implemented.

I have raised this point before, but I must say that the number of people employed in management and administration over the past two years has increased by the total sum of 1,789.  More than 700 of those have been in senior management.  For instance, the number of directors has gone from 201 to 272.  That is an increase of 71 directors, who are at the top end.  That is an increase of 35%.  The number of senior managers has gone up by 20.22%, which is an increase of 195 people.  We are now talking about slimming it down.  The HSE seems to be a juggernaut going down the road with no one in control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#L00500","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Who is in charge?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#L00600","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I am really concerned about this matter.

The summit in Rome this week is a very important one.  The Senator is correct and I hope we will have a debate on the future of the European Union, not just within the Brexit Seanad committee, but as a House.  Senator Ardagh is correct to raise the point that there is a mood change within Europe.  We need to reflect upon that and the many issues she raised.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The White Paper on the future of the European Union, along with the achievements of the past, offer an opportunity for us to reflect on what membership of the European Union means and what direction the Union should take.  The communiqu&eacute; regarding the White Paper raises the point of what future we want for ourselves, our children and the European Union.  In that context, given the triggering of Article 50 on 29 March next it is important that we continue to prioritise our position following Brexit in terms of trade, the economy, the peace process, the common travel area and our future within the European Union.  The summit in April will be important and I hope we will all wear the green jersey on that occasion.<br\/><br\/>The issue of insurance raised by Senator Craughwell will be discussed tonight.  Both Senator Ardagh and Senator Craughwell raised free legal aid.  I will be happy to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to the House to discuss that.<br\/><br\/>We join Senator Conway-Walsh in offering our compliments and thanks in respect of the community and voluntary effort being undertaken in Mayo.  It is a very difficult time for everybody involved and especially for the families.  We continue to pray that the three missing crew of helicopter R116 will be found and brought back to their families.  I join the Senator in commending Commander Brian Fitzgerald and the crew of <i>LE Eithne<\/i>on the work they are doing.  I am also happy to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to the House to discuss the issue the Senator raised regarding the statutory instrument and the Coast Guard.<br\/><br\/>Senators Ruane and Dolan raised the Garda vetting for students on DIT's Access programme.  I am not familiar with the situation.  It might be more appropriate to raise it as a Commencement matter.  The matters the two Senators raised are important because, as Senator Dolan noted, the Access programme has worked well.  It does not sit well that we are introducing vetting for some people and not for others.  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, was in the House earlier to discuss Garda vetting.  All of us wish to have proper vetting, protection of data and not to have people labelled or have a stigma attached to them.  We also acknowledge the importance of, and need for, Garda vetting but there must be flexibility in how it operates.  I cannot answer the Senators on the issue they raise but they should pursue it.  They will have the support of the House on the matter.  I can invite the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, to the House to discuss data protection in general.<br\/><br\/>Senator Humphreys raised the sale of RTE land valued at approximately &euro;75 million.  I agree with the Senator that the sale of State land should be carried out, because it is an asset.  However, where the proceeds go is a matter for discussion because it is a matter of public policy.  I understand from radio commentary and from the remarks of the director general who appeared before the Oireachtas committee recently that there is a need to return RTE to financial viability.

During the oral hearing last year the Air Corps made a presentation on the flight path to Haulbowline and the location of this incinerator.  There is a huge need to allay the safety concerns that were expressed at that hearing.  In addition, if there is any doubt regarding the safety of Air Corps personnel or of any aircraft flying overhead, the application should be refused.

My most recent information is that it is with the Office of the Attorney General where it is undergoing scrutiny.  However, I will refer back to the Senator on it.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke about ICTU and income inequality.  I accept that we need income equality and that we must raise people out of poverty.  However, 140,000 taxpayers are paying more than 45% of the income tax and USC yield.  That is &euro;9 billion in cash and 18% of all tax collected.  The top ten corporate taxpayers are paying &euro;3 billion.  As a nation, we are reliant on &euro;1 out of every &euro;4 collected in taxes.  I remind the Senator that the last Government and this Government increased the minimum wage and took many people out of the universal social charge net.  Now, people earning up &euro;13,000 are paying no universal social charge, a third of earners are paying no income tax and 30% are paying no income tax or universal social charge.  The most recent CSO figures show that annual disposable income increased by 6.2% in 2015 and that income is being more equally distributed in the country.  Finally, 920,700 people are exempt from paying income tax.  That includes the unemployed and pensioners.  The question we should debate, which some members of the Senator's party oppose, is how we can increase the tax base whereby we can pay for services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#M00500","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>We are not opposed to that at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#M00600","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>The Senator's party is for high spending and high taxes-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#M00700","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Bring on the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#M00800","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>-----but it cannot live in that utopian bubble all the time.

They have never really regarded it as a national resource for the people of Ireland.  Over many years, I have listened to people talking about how much we got out of the European Union and so on, while neglecting the fact that about &euro;200 billion of Irish fishing was handed out over the years to European Community fishing.  <\/p><p>In this legislation, the Government is trying to push through new legislation which is aimed at reinstating what was determined to be an unlawful provision under which millions of pounds of Irish shellfish were taken out of Irish waters by British companies.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Norris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->An upstanding Irish citizen, Paul Barlow from Dunmore East, who is a shellfish fisherman and three other shellfish farmers successfully challenged what had been happening in the Supreme Court.  The practice of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine of allowing some British vessels to fish inside an area specifically designed for Irish fishing vessels was undermining Irish sovereignty and taking away what amounted to Irish natural resources and putting local shellfish fishermen out of business.  That is very serious.<br\/><br\/>The policy was to set aside the law and not prosecute fishing vessels particularly if they came from Britain or Northern Ireland.  The policy was called <i>voisinage<\/i>, which with my limited schoolboy knowledge of French I take to amount to neighbourliness.  It is not terribly good neighbourly behaviour to fish out local shellfish resources.  Various Ministers responsible for the marine alienated marine natural resources on the absurd principle that these fish and shellfish species were not a natural resource and did not in some fashion belong to the State.  The Supreme Court decided in favour of the shellfish fishermen and declared positively and specifically that marine shellfish were a natural resource and belonged to the Irish people.  I remember the principles enunciated by a former Minister that Irish resources belong to the Irish people and should be treated as such and it is a pity we have departed from this principle.<br\/><br\/>During the 50 years and more of this practice, British vessels were in fact fishing illegally in Irish waters.  Parliamentary questions were asked and misleading or inaccurate answers were given.  A stock answer was that this arrangement existed under a 1964 convention, which was very misleading.  After the Supreme Court judgment the Minister is trying to readjust the situation and bring back in the process that the Supreme Court determined to be illegal.  He is frustrating a decision of the Supreme Court, which is wrong.  The provision I am opposed to states: <\/p><blockquote>Subject to section 9, a person on board a foreign sea-fishing boat shall not fish or attempt to fish while the boat is within the exclusive fishery limits, unless he or she&mdash;(a) is on board a sea-fishing boat owned and operated in Northern Ireland while the boat is within the area between 0 and 6 nautical miles ...<\/blockquote><p>This once again provides for British vessels to fish up to the shores and all around the Irish coast and not be liable for prosecution for doing so.  I think we are remarkably tolerant of all these invading species, not only the British and the Northern Irish but the Spanish, who have fished out their own waters, are coming in here.  Our own record is appalling.  I remember when we built the <i>Celtic Dawn<\/i>, the largest factory fishing vessel in the world.  It was so devastating to fish stocks that it was banned from European waters.  It went off to Africa and fished out the resources for local African people, putting the tribal fishermen out of business.  They were jobless and came to Europe where they were described dismissively as economic migrants.  It is perfectly legitimate to be an economic migrant.  If the financial circumstances in one's country are so very bad and difficult it is perfectly natural to go somewhere where there are resources and jobs available.<br\/><br\/>This Bill provides for a British vessel to fish up to the shores all around the Irish coast and not be liable for prosecution.  There is no clarity on what vessels will make use of this provision.  Has there been an impact assessment of how this unqualified fishing will have an impact on the small national fleet that relies so heavily on this area or of the impact on fish stocks because we could be in danger of fishing out certain species?  The four people who took this action risked their personal livelihoods to safeguard a national asset.  We should salute them for so doing because they were extremely courageous in taking a case to the Supreme Court, which can be expensive and difficult if it goes against one.  They were from Waterford, Donegal, Limerick and Wexford, which essentially covers the entire island.  I will be pushing this amendment to delete the offending paragraph. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#AA00400","speaker":"1392","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":140,"content":"<p>The Minister knows the Labour Party's position on this legislation.  We rehearsed the arguments in some detail on Second Stage.  I support the views expressed by Senator Norris.  I am concerned that this Bill is being tabled without pre-legislative scrutiny.  My amendment No. 2 seeks to make an unfair situation for the owners of Irish vessels slightly fairer.  If the State is preparing to copperfasten in law access rights to the zero-to-six nautical mile limit, which gives a right to foreign vessels to fish our inshore, it is incumbent on us as public representatives and on the Minister to establish ways in which we can restrict and manage that access as best we can, and to lay down transparent qualifying criteria that can be understood by everybody.  We have to police this arrangement properly and I am sometimes at a loss to understand how.  If this legislation is to pass, and I would prefer if it did not, we do not want to hand an unfair advantage to our competitors for all of the reasons I outlined on Second Stage.  Restricting the size of the vessel is one way to do that.  I look forward to the Minister's response to that.<\/p> <p>Related to my amendment is the idea of regulating vessels from Northern Ireland, as the Minister clearly is committed to legislating for this.  Even if, in the spirit of genuine North-South co-operation we were to figure out a way to do this, it is not clear to me that we can in some way define what constitutes being owned and operated in Northern Ireland.  To the best of my knowledge, and I have researched this extensively in recent weeks in co-operation with some vessel owners, we cannot be specific about what comprises a Northern Irish vessel.  These vessels are registered in the United Kingdom.  There is no clear Northern Irish designation.  Can the Minister reassure me and the vessel owners to whom we are accountable in the Republic of Ireland that this can be done logically and in law?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerald Nash:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He might address in his response any consideration he has given to an option I wish to see pursued, namely, the keeping of a register of vessels that would be open and accessible to members of the public, the citizens and vessel owners of the Irish Republic.  That register could be compiled and made available and could be checked in real time to establish not just the whereabouts of foreign vessels, if I can use that phrase, but those that are qualified or otherwise to be here.  We need to be clear about that.  We need some reassurance about that.  I am not convinced, from what I know about the registration of fishing vessels, that we can establish whether the vessels we are talking about are actually owned and operated in Northern Ireland or somewhere else.  I have come across one case in particular in recent days of a vessel from across the water that is owned by a major Dutch company, is operating out of Belfast and was fishing and accessing mussel seed from beds on the Republic of Ireland inshore.  In nobody's language does that mean Northern Irish vessel.  The Minister might try to reassure Members about how he can confirm and clarify the qualification criteria he will lay down for vessels that would be able to benefit from this legislation and, most importantly, whether that is feasible and possible in law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#BB00200","speaker":"1398","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

I have said in the House on a previous occasion that I would have preferred to see this measure go through pre-legislative scrutiny, where we could have had proper discussion and an in-depth conversation about the impact this will have on the mussel beds on the east coast.  The conversation is happening in a vacuum.  We are trying to respond to this and I do not think any of us would claim that our amendments are 100% correct or that there are no unknown consequences relating to the amendments concerning the Common Fisheries Policy.  However, I do not believe the Minister can provide any certainty either about the unknown consequences of putting this into legislation so quickly.  I appeal to the Minister to take a week or two and put this back into a D&aacute;il committee and allow interested bodies to give evidence - be they inshore fishermen or Northern Irish fishermen - where they can be given what I would call a fair hearing.  I support Senator Norris's remarks about how brave the fishermen themselves were and how they put their own financial future at risk by taking this to the courts.

Can the Minister give me an undertaking that this is not happening?  The evidence that is being presented to many Members of the House is quite the opposite.  Are we opening up this questionable legislation to the rape and pillage of our mussel beds along the east coast and making them financially unviable for our own fishermen?<\/p> <p>Can the Minister reassure me that Northern Irish shellfish farmers were not allocated thousands of tonnes of mussel seed in the Republic of Ireland without a fishing licence or even a boat?  What are the safeguards to prevent that from happening with regard to this legislation?  <\/p> <p>Senator Norris touched on the issue of invasive species.  We already have invasive species in Belfast Lough.  The slipper limpet has already smothered UK species.  It has out-competed native species in many European countries and is in Belfast Lough.  This is the very area where we are proposing to give licences for boats coming down from Northern Ireland to our mussel beds on the east coast.  The Minister has said there are safeguards.  Where are they?  This has destroyed mussel seed beds right across Europe, yet we are now opening up our mussel seed beds without proper consideration.  <\/p> <p>I do not have enough knowledge to support this Bill.  I believe it needs further consideration.  We should have the good manners to allow people who earn their livelihood from this sector to come in and give evidence and then let us make an informed decision.  I do not believe we will be making that informed decision today.  Amendments have been tabled, including by my party, concerning the reduction of the size of boats.  I am not necessarily 100% sure that it is the right way to go.  We certainly could tease it out if we allowed the experts to come in and give evidence.  Then perhaps we could do the right thing by our fishermen because for decades we have sold them out.  Let us try and support a small group of fishermen who are engaged inside the six-mile zone.  Let us support them and ensure that they get a fair hearing.  Let them come before a D&aacute;il committee for pre-legislative scrutiny and let us take this in good faith and see if we can progress it.  Even if the amendments were accepted I would have to oppose this Bill today, because it is rushed, there has not been due consideration and the very people this will affect have not had an opportunity to make their case to the Minister or ourselves on Committee Stage.

That is why I think his amendment is probably the safest way to proceed in the absence of clarification.<br\/><br\/>The Minister knows that coastal communities believe Irish fishing waters have been given away to a large extent under European treaties and the Common Fisheries Policy.  There is a real sense that we have not benefited from this immense resource as an island nation.  The Supreme Court's decision which confirms that there is no legal basis whatsoever to <i>voisinage<\/i>offers an opportunity to go back to the drawing board and make sure the natural resource within the zero to six mile limit is protected and used for the benefit of coastal communities.<br\/><br\/>This legislation is premature and rushed.  It should be agreed to on an all-Ireland basis.  We should seek reassurance about the residency of people who could avail of that opportunity, that is, licence holders based in Northern Ireland.  All of these matters are currently absent, which is why I support the proposition that we go back to the drawing board.  Perhaps the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, on which I serve, with several of my fellow Senators, might look at this matter in more detail and make recommendations to the Minister.  Unfortunately, the legislation as presented is not in line with the Good Friday Agreement because it is open to exploitation.  Its loopholes could be exploited by foreign multinationals, as they have done in recent times, to the detriment of coastal communities.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late moment, to consider withdrawing the legislation.  I am sure everybody in this Chamber agrees that the Minister should announce that he is withdrawing the legislation for further consideration by an Oireachtas committee or him, subject to consultation with all stakeholders, particularly fishermen around the coast who have not been involved in this process so far.

It stated it was an appropriate area in which to have co-operation, as envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement.  Taking Senator Norris's Southern Unionist partitionist approach is baffling in this context.  If his amendment is carried, it will be the death knell for the <i>voisinage<\/i>arrangements which might be considered good in some quarters.

For many good reasons, primarily because this operated successfully for nearly 50 years, because it is the right thing to do for our neighbours in Northern Ireland, because it is not partitionist and is all-island, because it was envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement and because it would be strategically and politically wise in the context of Brexit to do so, we should not say that they cannot come down any longer.<\/p><p><i>Voisinage<\/i>was a good idea in the 1960s and it continues to be a good idea.  As I said, the world in the 1960s was a much simpler place.  Ownership was a much simpler structure.  Under EU regulations, I can go to the UK, reside there and set up a business there.  I can go to Germany and to Holland.  That arrangement is reciprocal in the sense of their movement of goods and services.  That is part of what we wholeheartedly embrace as members of the European Union.  What the Senator wants to do now is simply to cherry-pick that and say that by this legislation we want to revert back in some way to the 1960s and ensure the man who owns and operates his boat and lives in Northern Ireland is the only person who is entitled to benefit under <i>voisinage<\/i>.  That view of the world changed very significantly as the European Economic Community and the European Union evolved with the free movement of goods and services, establishment rights, residency rights, etc.<\/p><p>Points were made about the resource itself and invasive species and all that.  I am getting drawn into a specific view of the world here that is dominated by mussel seed.  This is not the only fishery that is affected by this legislation.  Let us deal with it.  We have a joint managerial approach North and South for the management of the mussel fishery.  It involves regulations around gear, closed and open periods, consultation and co-operation between two jurisdictions.  It is a template for how we could do greater things and have greater co-operation with Northern Ireland.  Why would Senator Norris want to tear it up and walk away?  I think that would be calamitous in terms of what we could do and achieve together.  Yes, it needs to be regulated and managed as a resource.  That has been the case all along.  There is a management approach to this, as I said, that has closed periods and restrictions on gear.  It operates on a North-South basis and I believe it operates pretty well.<\/p><p>On the issue of registration for mussel seed, there is a requirement for a secondary authorisation from the Northern Ireland authorities to operate specifically in the mussel fishery areas.  One can register in the UK, but to be a part of the mussel fishery operation, which is one element of the <i>voisinage<\/i>fishing arrangements inside the zero to six nautical mile zone, there is a secondary authorisation required in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>Senator Norris spoke with what I appreciate is a widely held view of the history of our fishing industry, the European Union and all that.  I ask him to bear in mind that when we joined the European Economic Community back in the 1970s, the Irish fishing industry was a fraction of the industry we have today.  We now catch 40% of that industry's effort in UK territorial waters.  The access the EU has given to us means our industry is much bigger.  I accept that we would like it to be even bigger still, but in the EU we share our resources.  Part of the threat we face in our nearest neighbour leaving the EU are the resources it takes with it.<\/p><p>I cannot say what the landing spots are going to be in the context of those Brexit negotiations.  Obviously, whether this legislation passes is in the gift of this House.  I cannot determine whether this amendment or legislation will pass.  At a later stage post Brexit, it may be opportune to revisit this when we see where those negotiations are.  However, I think it would be folly in the extreme now to undermine gratuitously our negotiating position.<\/p><p>That aside and Brexit aside, on the basis of an all-island approach, it was right in the 1960s to have reciprocal arrangements and it is right to continue those today.  I hope I have dealt with most of the issues that were raised on the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#EE01100","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>The Minister is all sweet reasonableness.

He was here on 8 March when I said I had serious concerns about this Bill.  I am fully in support of Senator Norris.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact the island of Ireland has a coastline of about 7,500 km whereas Northern Ireland has a relatively small part of that coastline.  We are talking about the history of this, whereas I would rather let the history go and talk about the future.<\/p> <p>I am extremely concerned that this Bill is opening up the whole area from the cliff and the shoreline at Tramore right out to six nautical miles, or from the shoreline of Dublin or Donegal out to six nautical miles.  It is being opened to Northern Ireland fishermen, which I can understand, and there is no doubt the Minister is passionate about this and really wants it to happen.  He said that what is happening at the moment is illegal and he would like to legalise it, and I understand that also.  However, as I said on 8 March, it is British-registered vessels which are operating out of Northern Ireland, which means the whole of the UK can potentially have access to the whole of Irish waters from the east coast of Northern Ireland right around the south, the west and on to the north.  For me, we are giving away much too much in this situation.<\/p> <p>I have spoken with fishermen and with different sectors of the fishing industry.  The lobster fishermen of Dunmore East have done a lot in terms of working to earn an income for their families but they have also worked to conserve the lobster by using the notching method, so they are looking after the resource.  A fisherman said to me that we could potentially have fishermen from Northern Ireland and perhaps from England, Scotland and Wales coming in right around that edge line of the Irish coast.  I do not think it is a fair deal.  I simply ask that we stop this Bill in its tracks - can we just stop it?<\/p> <p>We have the Brexit negotiations coming up and we are putting the cart before the horse again.  The Minister has not engaged enough with the public.  He has engaged with some of the sectors but, having spoken to fishermen from different organisations, we know they feel there has not been sufficient consultation.  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Norris.  I think there is a principle here and I do not believe the Irish public are aware of what the Minister is planning to do.  What he is planning to do at this stage is create a situation where that strip out to six nautical miles will be opened up.  If we were to measure that zone right around the coastline, it would be clear we are handing away a huge amount of our resources.  We might be talking about particular sectors here, such as mussel or lobster fishing, but there are other sectors that are also a resource.  My heart is always in favour of share and care, and so on, but I believe we are not looking after the fishing industry and fishing families.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister said the industry is doing better than ever, but for whom?

The Minister's Government keeps talking about supporting rural communities and so on, but this legislation actually rasps away at potential incomes.  I appeal to him to put the Bill aside until he sits down at the Brexit negotiating table and the resources begin to be considered.  At this point, I am afraid the implications of what he proposes are not being fully researched or considered and I believe, from speaking with the public, that there are concerns in this regard.  I do not think the Minister has done his homework in informing the public.  If we are to go forward as a democracy, empowering people to understand the natural resources we have, the Bill is an absolute disgrace.  This statement might not make me popular, but the Bill before us, albeit concerning matters underwater, reminds me of the Heritage Bill.  It is poorly put together.  I therefore fully support what Senator Norris said and I hope the Minister will take time to consider what has been said here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#FF02500","speaker":"1385","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Tell them they can have this arrangement if there is a united Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#GG00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I have read the Supreme Court judgment in great detail over the past few days.  It says many things, and we can all selectively quote from it to back up our arguments.  I am not necessarily accusing the Minister of doing so.  The judgment ventilated the idea that laws must be made in public, by the elected Oireachtas, and promoted and mediated in public and that people need to be aware of what it is we are considering.  I do not think we can say with sufficient confidence that the public at large is aware of the implications of what it is we are deciding upon here.  For this reason, I support what my colleague, Senator Humphreys, said earlier, namely, that this should be delayed and that we should scrutinise in detail the provisions of the legislation and its impact on the fishing industry and coastal communities in this country.<\/p><p>I wish to make a further point directly related to one the Minister made in his earlier contribution when he referred to and quoted from the Supreme Court judgment, which makes very interesting reading.  The Supreme Court judgment states that the <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement does not have any legal foundation.  This decision was made for the right reasons, and I think everybody accepts that.  However, the judgment does not instruct the Minister to make that agreement law.  It is up to this Legislature to decide what becomes and does not become law in this country, and it is to the fishermen and their families who took the case that we are accountable - nobody else - and we need to be mindful of that.  There is absolutely no requirement that the Minister give legislative foundation to the arrangements reflected in the <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement - and I use that term advisedly.  Neither, from what I can establish, was there any degree of reciprocity.  We can see here illustrated very clearly on a Marine Institute image from 2016 very limited activity around the Northern Irish coast.  <i>De facto<\/i>, and from what I am told, there is no fishing - at least, very limited fishing - going on in this area by vessels registered in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#GG00300","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":209,"content":"<p>From the image I see, though, I do not think the activity is occurring inside the zero to six nautical mile limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#GG00400","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":210,"content":"<p>It looks damn close to me, to be perfectly frank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#GG00500","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>It is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#GG00600","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I am open to be advised on that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#GG00700","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>It is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#GG00800","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":214,"content":"<p>-----but this image is from 2016, a period which mostly predates the Supreme Court judgment at the end of 2016, which stated quite clearly that this had no legislative foundation and that, therefore, from that date, any fishing by Northern Irish vessels in the Republic of Ireland's zero to six nautical mile zone was not lawful.  It is a moot point whether there is any reciprocal arrangement in place now at all because once the arrangement is undermined and once it finishes, surely, by definition, the reciprocal arrangement falls as well.  I am very concerned about the haste with which the Minister is moving to give this legislative foundation when there is absolutely no requirement to do so and the Supreme Court has not said there is a requirement to do so.  The Supreme Court would never tell the Legislature, given the division of powers in the Constitution, that we must legislate in a certain way.  It is a ministerial decision, an Executive decision, to propose legislation to this House, and this is legislation about which we are very concerned.<\/p> <p>The point the Minister made earlier about the ownership model moving on is very interesting, and it has moved on from the 1960s.  If the ownership model has moved on and is more complex now than it was in the 1960s, why are we seeking to legislate for an arrangement that was applied in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and so on?  This is absolutely open to exploitation and abuse and is not in the interests of Irish fishing vessels and the Irish fishing industry.  The system has moved on and we are trying now to legislate for an arrangement that was in place in the 1960s and reflects 1960s behaviour and a 1960s industry, not an industry dominated, as it is now, by large corporations.  Those corporations have been active in Irish waters and have been foreign-owned.  They may very well have had licences from the North.  I remain to be convinced about that but I accept what the Minister says at face value and I accept his bona fides in that regard.  It is very interesting that a vessel can be owned by a company in the United Kingdom but is required to get a mussel licence from Northern Ireland to access mussel seed in Republic of Ireland waters in that zero to six nautical mile zone.  I am not convinced the Minister has answered my earlier question about reassuring me as to how we can have a proper registration system to establish the bona fides of Northern Irish vessels fishing down here.  This confuses me.  We are co-opting out management of this to another nation because we do not appear to be able ourselves to define what is Northern Irish-owned and operated and what is Northern Irish-registered.  That will be someone else's problem, it appears to me, and that is no way to do business.<\/p> <p>I will conclude by saying something I said the other day.  It is absolutely bizarre and reckless, although the Minister clearly does not agree, that we would make and copper-fasten arrangements such as this in our legislation a matter of days or a week before the triggering of Article 50 and the Brexit negotiations.  I do not support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#GG00900","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>We did not mean to imply in any way an anti-Six Counties or anti-UK sentiment earlier.

I am sorry I started that.  I should not try to correct the Senator.  <\/p> <p>The agreement reached by Terence O'Neill and Se&aacute;n Lemass was very much of its time.  As the Minister has rightly pointed out, as a result of globalisation, it is now difficult to legislate and regulate.  This attempt to move a good neighbour agreement reached in the 1960s into legislation will have untold and unintentional consequences.  We have not had an opportunity to assess this.  I would not compare this Bill to the Heritage Bill 2016.  It is not quite as bad as that, but it is going in a similar direction.  We have to protect the rights of our fishermen.  We also have to protect the environment.  The last time the Minister was in the House, he mentioned the Marine Stewardship Council's certificate.  The first time it was introduced in relation to Irish bottom mussel seed production was in 2013.  The source of the data for 2000 to 2060 values is Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  We have seen a significant decrease since 2004 or 2005 and there has to be concern.  The regulations were not being enforced and there was no sign of their enforcement.  I have to return to that point and sincerely urge caution in that respect.  I accept the good intentions of the Minister in pointing out that there are problems with Senator David Norris' amendment.  Members of this House have had to react to the Bill without having an opportunity to be properly informed on it.  That is why I repeat that this legislation needs to go back to Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn's committee for indepth scrutiny.  All Members of the House who are being fair will join me in urging the Minister to take a breath and allow time for a proper investigation before making an informed decision on the legislation he is proposing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#HH00900","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>The Minister has challenged the veracity of the Marine Institute's map as it pertains to the zero to six-mile limit.  What evidence has he presented for the scale of fishing by vessels registered in this state that has been ongoing in waters off the North of Ireland since the Supreme Court's decision?  Does he have evidence of the scale of fishing taking place?  He has made an argument about reciprocity.  If he looks at the <i>voisinage<\/i>letters - I refuse to refer to an agreement because it is my view that an agreement should be grounded in law - he will see that it is clearly stated on the British side that this arrangement will apply as long as the authorities of the Republic of Ireland continue to accord to Northern Irish vessels the same treatment accorded to vessels of the Republic of Ireland in the waters around its coast.  In their opinion, this arrangement, as they refer to it, is clearly based on its continuing to be adhered to by this side.  Therefore, there is no arrangement.  According to the letters to which the Minister is referring, there is no arrangement as we speak.<\/p><p>I query the issue of reciprocity, which is obviously fair to do.  Of course, reciprocity is central to all-Ireland co-operation and the Good Friday Agreement.  I ask what is happening.  How many boats registered in this state are actually fishing in Northern waters at this time?  How much fishing has been taking place since the Supreme Court's decision?  According to the actual letters about which the Minister has spoken, the basis of the goodwill in this area, the arrangement ceases.  That has to be the case following the Supreme Court's decision.  Obviously, the Supreme Court's decision is sovereign and has to be respected by the Government.  The Supreme Court interprets the Constitution and laws.  It is for that reason, based on the actual <i>voisinage<\/i>letters, I suggest this arrangement is null and void.  It no longer applies.  Therefore, we are back to the drawing board and if we are going back to it, that takes me to my next point.<\/p><p>The Minister quoted from the Supreme Court's decision on all-Ireland co-operation and suggested this was in line with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  Of course, that is positive.  As I said in my earlier comments, if Irish fishermen resident on the island of Ireland were utilising the resource around the island of Ireland in a managed and sustainable fashion, surely the Minister would be positive about it.  I will explain my frustration.  The Minister referred to all-Ireland co-operation.  I accept that point in so far as it relates to residents of the North of Ireland.  The difficulty is that a glaring loophole in the licensed registration process in the North allows foreign multinationals to access a precious natural resource which is under profound pressure.  The Minister can see the numbers.  The reduction in the productivity of the bottom mussel seed industry, for example, in recent years is unchallenged.  This natural resource is under serious pressure.  As a result of the loophole I have mentioned, this resource which has immense potential to create jobs and prosperity in coastal communities is being handed to foreign multinationals.  That is not in line with the Good Friday Agreement, rather it takes advantage of the goodwill of the Agreement.<\/p><p>This legislation is way too premature.  If we are serious about the Good Friday Agreement and all-Ireland co-operation, we should make sure the Northern authorities are asked to ensure the registration process for their legislation guarantees that those who avail of these licences are resident on the island.  I have no problem with the Minister receiving advice from his officials to enable him to respond to the points I am making and believe he is sincere.  I accept that he believes in the all-Ireland markets provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.  He is sincere in his appreciation of the importance of all-Ireland co-operation in ensuring the resources of this island benefit all of the people on the island.  The difficulty is that there is a huge loophole that has yet to be closed fully.  This legislation invites that loophole to be exploited yet again.  The Supreme Court's decision closed that loophole, but this legislation provides for it to be reopened, which is not prudent.  We should have engaged in negotiations and discussions with our Northern counterparts to ensure there would be a level playing pitch for all fishermen on the island.  I refer, for example, to differences in licensing.  It is not fair that one can obtain a licence in the North way cheaper than in this state.  We should make sure those who avail of these licences are resident in Ireland and contributing to the economy on the island, in line with the Good Friday Agreement.  I am not going to argue that they should have to be Irish citizens.<\/p><p>If ever there was legislation that should be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, this is it.  The Bill should have come through the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We should have been able to bring in the stakeholders - the fishermen around the coast - to make an argument about the reality for them versus that for those who will benefit from the Bill.  I remind the Minister that the <i>voisinage<\/i>letters are very clear.  There is no other way to interpret them.  Following the Supreme Court's decision, the arrangement is null and void.

Let us bring the Northern departmental officials and all the fishing interests to the Oireachtas committee.<br\/><br\/>This is premature and smacks of senior Department officials, frustrated at the Supreme Court's decision, deciding to use taxpayers' money to defend their position and utilise these Houses to teach a lesson to the people who took the case.  This is clearly rushed because the Minister is creating a loophole.  The court cases are not concluded and certain matters have to go through the High Court.<br\/><br\/>The people involved took the case because of the exploitation of Irish natural resources by foreign multinationals.  That is a laudable reason to take a case and I know of nobody in coastal communities from Donegal to Louth who feels we are getting full justice from Irish waters or from our huge resources as an island nation.  I have no problem with coastal communities across the island of Ireland sharing our resources but in the zero to six km and zero to 12 km zones there is exploitation by foreign multinationals of an Irish natural resource.  I will not stand for it because I do not believe we got a fair deal outside those limits.

I want to be their voice as they feel their livelihoods are being threatened and that they will be forced to give up fishing and to give up the legacy to their families.  I do not know if the Minister has seen the film &quot;Atlantic&quot; but I would encourage him to watch it because it shows what fishermen in coastal communities have to deal with.  The Irish Fish Producers' Organisation has stated that there has been no consultation with it about the Bill and that it is a departure from the norm and a breach of the Common Fisheries Policy.  I ask the Minister to enter into meaningful discussion with fishermen whose livelihoods will be impacted by the legislation.  It is detrimental to them and the Minister should see for himself what it is like for them.<\/p><p>The Bill will decimate the inshore stocks and destroy local inshore fisheries which our coastal communities depend heavily on.  My father comes from Rathlin Island, the only island in the Six Counties and I go there four or five times a year as we still have the old farmhouse there.  I know all the fishermen and some members of my family are fishermen from the North.  I am not opposed to them fishing in our waters.  This is not about nationality but sustainability.  These are relatively delicate areas that can only withstand certain amounts of extraction.  The concerns of the fishermen were expressed to me by Gerard Kelly, who is in the Gallery, when he said:<\/p><blockquote>I am also concerned on the disadvantage and inequality that the Minister will inflict on all Irish fishing vessels.  Firstly on reciprocity, the six-county coast is about 16% of the coast of Ireland and usually they find an excuse to keep it to themselves.  Why would any Irish fisherman wish to swap 84% for 16%?  A Minister may get good relations but angry fishermen back at home.  But the inequality is actually worse.  If the Irish Minister introduces legislation to allow a six-county fisherman or fishing boat access to all the waters around Ireland then that six-county fishing boat will have access to all the fishing waters around the whole coast of the 32 counties and all the coast of the UK.  At the same time the Irish fishermen, represented by their Irish Minister, are telling the 2,100 Irish fishing boats &quot;you will have a UK fishing fleet in your foreshore and you 2,100 Irish vessels owners can have access to the coast of the six counties&quot;.  Any six county or any foreign Minister would welcome a deal like this.  Please let us not be duped again.<\/blockquote> <p>It would be very courageous on the part of the Minister to put this Bill off for a short period of time until we sit down and listen to the fishermen of our country tell us of the devastation this will cause to their lives, their families and coastal communities.

Article 50 is going to be triggered by the British Government soon.  Would this not have been a useful bargaining tool during upcoming Brexit negotiations?

I am not confident and do not see how we can meaningfully regulate and be sure of regulation and meaningful accountability when we simply have a right to swoop in and move back, potentially to ports in the United Kingdom, for example, that will potentially be outside our jurisdiction and without even the protections, such as may exist, related to a common EU exchange.

We are making ourselves vulnerable to potential lawsuits from multinational corporations that may happen to register themselves at a point of convenience.  Unfortunately, both Ireland and the United Kingdom have had experiences in the past with the brass plate company, the registered corporation and the multinational company.  It is very legitimate and reasonable to ask whether we are laying ourselves open in a new way to potential lawsuits from companies if we try to regulate in the future and impose limits.<\/p> <p>I share the concerns expressed here.  It is very reasonable to postpone, at least until after Easter, thus giving the Minister an opportunity to speak to others on this.  It would give us a chance in this House to debate these very important issues as part of our wider discussion on Brexit.  There needs to be much more clear guidance and consultation not only on how the law would be applied to the letter and on regulation but also on the practice and what will and will not be viable.  A risk analysis is needed.

I am very grateful for and delighted about that news.  I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of Dr. David Parris and Mr. Gerhard Scully and I thank them for being here to support the Bill and for their bravery and courage in raising publicly the important equality issue it seeks to address.  The Bill is the Pensions (Equal Pension Treatment in Occupational Benefit Scheme) (Amendment) Bill 2016.  I am delighted to be proposing it on behalf of Labour Party Senators.

I also acknowledge the support of Ms Marguerite Bolger, senior counsel, who acted in the legal case that forms the impetus for the Bill.<\/p> <p>Let me outline the background to the Bill.  It seeks to address the very small number of cases in which retired employees who, because of their sexual orientation, were not legally permitted to marry the person they desired to marry before a particular date were deprived of certain pension or survivor benefits as a result.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was drafted, as I have said, in response to a particular case which I know the Minister is aware of, namely, the case of David Parris <i>v<\/i>. Trinity College Dublin before the European Court of Justice.  Judgment was given on 24 November 2016.  In that case, David Parris had argued that the Trinity pension scheme was discriminatory as it provided that a Trinity employee's partner would only be entitled to a survivor's pension where the employee had married or entered a civil partnership before reaching the age of 60.  The Bill seeks to address the issue that arose in that case.  It will provide that if a pension scheme makes a survivor's pension entitlement dependent on the employee having married or entered civil partnership before a certain age, this would breach the principle of equal pension treatment on the sexual orientation ground where the reason the employee did not comply with the requirement was because he or she was legally incapable of marrying prior to the entry into force of civil partnership law.<br\/><br\/>Before I turn to the provisions of the Bill I will outline the facts of the Parris case in a little more detail.  The applicant had been living for over 30 years in a stable relationship with his partner.  His employer's pension scheme provided for the payment of a survivor's pension to the spouse or civil partner of a member.  However, the survivor's pension was payable only if the member had married or entered into a civil partnership before reaching the age of 60.  <br\/><br\/>This is a clause sometimes referred to as an anti-gold digger clause, essentially based on a very sexist stereotype prevailing in universities at the time but hopefully no longer.  The idea was that a younger woman, perhaps a student, might marry or seek to marry an ageing male lecturer in order to gain access to his lucrative pension entitlements upon his death.  I am no pensions expert but I understand it is not a commonplace clause.  It is an unusual clause because it precludes entitlement unless marriage or civil partnership was entered before a particular age.  It appears to be premised on that rather bizarre notion.<br\/><br\/>It caught Mr. Parris and his spouse in this case because he was not legally able to enter a civil partnership or marry prior to his 60th birthday.  As a result, the survivor's pension was denied or it was predicted that it would be denied in the future to his spouse.  He retired in 2010 and made a request to Trinity at that point that on his death his then civil partner, now spouse, would receive a survivor's pension.  That request was rejected in November 2010.  His appeal to the Labour Court was referred to the European Court of Justice, ECJ, which is where the EU law case arose.  However, while the EU court found against Mr. Parris, it did not preclude national law changing the position.  That is an important point.  Paragraph 59 of the Parris judgment states, &quot;Member states are free to provide or not provide for marriage of persons or alternative form of legal recognition, and if they do so provide, to lay down the dates on which such marriage or alternative form is to have effect.&quot;  While the court did not find in favour of Mr. Parris under EU law, there is nothing in the judgment that precludes us from making this legal change to our law.  There was a very strong advocate-general opinion on the 30 June 2016 in support of Mr. Parris's claim.  I understand there is also currently litigation in the UK Supreme Court on a similar point.<br\/><br\/>To turn to the provisions of the Bill, the Title provides it is a Bill to amend the provisions of the Pension Act 1990 and so on.  Section 1 provides, crucially, that Part VII of the Pensions Act 1990 is amended in section 72.  It inserts a new subsection (5) which says, essentially, that it would be a breach of the principle of equal treatment on the sexual orientation ground for a scheme to fix a requirement that employees would have married or entered civil partnership before a certain age in circumstances where persons were unable to do so because they were not legally entitled to marry because they were in a same-sex relationship.  <br\/><br\/>A further clause has been inserted into subsection (5), stating that the employee must have married or entered into a civil partnership with the beneficiary, the potential survivor, within three years or 36 months of it being lawfully possible to do so.  We have put that in on the basis that we understand a reasonable time should be provided for, that people would have had to marry or enter civil partnership within 36 months of it being legally possible to do so in order to avail of the exemption from the clause.<br\/><br\/>There is a standard form section 2 as well.<br\/><br\/>These are the sections of the Bill currently before the House.  I was pleased to be able to meet with some officials from the Minister's Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are happy to continue to engage with the Minister and officials to improve upon the drafting and to amend the Bill, if required.  We have already discussed that.<br\/><br\/>I want to deal with two particular points that have been raised with me by way of potential objection to any further progress of the Bill.  First, the issue of retrospectivity and, second, what I call the floodgates issue: that there would somehow be a large number of people who would seek to benefit from this Bill.  On the retrospectivity point, which was also raised in the European court, it must first be acknowledged that all pension entitlements, and particularly survivor benefits, are to some extent retrospective since they do look back at contributions made during employment.  However, this Bill is not retrospective in any real sense, and certainly we say it is not of retrospective effect.  I am grateful to Professor Wintermute for giving his legal opinion which I am happy to supply to the Minister and his officials.  In this particular case, it is not a retrospective application, as David Parris is still alive-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#KK00600","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>He is not dead yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#LL00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Precisely.  I thank Senator Norris for his comment and his support.  <\/p><p>David Parris does not seek recognition of his relationship prior to 2011 when it was possible to be legally recognised in civil partnership, he only seeks prospective recognition following his death, which hopefully will be many, many years away.  It is not in any sense retrospective in his case, nor do we say is it retrospective in any general sense because it does not provide for survivor's pensions for same-sex partners of employees who died before 2011 and who were therefore never able during their lifetimes to enter a civil partnership or a legal marriage.  It simply provides a temporary exemption for lesbian and gay employees from this particular rule that they must have entered a civil partnership or marriage before they turned 60.  The exemption applies to employees who were legally unable to enter a marriage or civil partnership at the time they turned 60 and it gives them this small window of 36 months or three years to do so from 2011.  We understand that there will be people who will not be able to avail of it, who were unable to enter civil partnership or marriage but who simply are not caught by that provision.  Some, for example, may have entered a civil partnership between 2011 and 2014 and then died.  The effect of the exemption is to make the rule that the employee must enter civil partnership or marriage either before his or her 60th birthday or within three years of being able to do so legally.<\/p><p>There is a strong legal argument that the exemption is required by a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, which has also ruled on this.  While David Parris's case went to the ECJ, there is further case law from the ECHR under the convention.  The case of Taddeucci and McCall <i>v. <\/i>Italy in 2016 involved a family member residence permit for a non-EU citizen.  I would argue, as Professor Wintermute has argued, that it would suggest that this exemption is required, namely, that same-sex couples who are legally unable to marry must sometimes be treated differently from unmarried different sex couples who are in a different situation because they are legally able to marry.  <\/p><p>The reason I raise that case is because of the floodgates argument.  It has been suggested to me that one reason to oppose the Bill might be because there would be a large quantity of persons in other categories who might seek to avail of it, for example, opposite sex couples who simply did not get around to getting married before they turned 60, and then their spouse is then unable, of course, to get the survivor's benefit.  Can they then seek to avail of an exemption?  I argue they cannot.  Taddeucci and McCall <i>v. <\/i>Italy says they are in a different position.  They were legally capable of getting married.  Just because they did not choose to do so at the time or did not get around to it does not mean they can avail of an exemption.  Similarly, just because people were single until they reached 60, and only met their life partner after the age of 60, clearly they too cannot avail of an exemption like this because it will only apply to those who were legally incapable of marrying before that time.<\/p><p>We did try to think of other groups of people who might have had legal incapacity to marry, but we cannot think that there is any other group to whom an exemption like this could be applied.  There are rules governing capacity to marry based on age, blood relationships and so on, but they are in a different league and there is no change to those capacity rules.<\/p><p>There is one further floodgate argument that has been raised with me, which is that there may be quite a number of other gay couples who are in a similar position and would be able to avail of the exemption.  Without being an expert on this, I understand this is not a commonplace clause and that there could only be a small number of couples who would be in a position to avail of it.  I understand the Department of Social Protection is doing some work in terms of demographic breakdown to see how many couples could potentially avail of this were such a clause to be in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#LL00300","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Look at the number of marriages.

Today's Bill is another example of trying to advance the agenda for progressive social change in this country, which I very much welcome.<\/p> <p>This legislation, as eloquently outlined by Senator Bacik in a very lucid and comprehensible manner, was inspired by the experience of David Parris and his partner, Gerhard Scully.  In my opinion they have been deprived of an entitlement that should rightfully be theirs.  I recall late last year having to turn up the volume on my radio to listen to an interview given by Dr. Parris on the \"Drivetime\" programme on RTE.  I was very moved by what he had to say and I am sure that anybody who listened to the broadcast was moved.  When we listen to such an experience, we must put ourselves in that citizen's shoes and consider what we would do if we found ourselves in a situation where a clear anomaly needed to be addressed to make this country a better, more fair and more tolerant place.  I am pleased that my colleague has sponsored this legislation.

Marriage equality is something to celebrate.  It is something the Minister, I and my Labour Party colleagues and most people in this House, with a small exception, have worked extremely hard on.<\/p> <p>We have unfinished business.  In a way we can describe this legislation as an important housekeeping matter and, as Senator Bacik has described, it is a legacy issue.  If we are to finish the business of at least aspiring to full equality in this country, these are the types of anomalies we need to address.  We are dealing with an anomaly that in many ways probably was not anticipated when the legislation was drafted.  How could it have been?

The Labour Court found that the requirement to marry or enter into a civil partnership to obtain a benefit under a pension scheme is liable to affect significantly more LGBT employees than heterosexual employees in circumstances in which the right to marry is reversed for opposite sex couples and civil partnership is not available.<\/p> <p>In terms of the position of the Government, the introduction first of civil partnership and then of marriage equality has made a huge difference for many of our fellow citizens.  The Bill introduced by Senators Bacik, Humphreys, Nash and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in seeks to deal with an important legacy issue for a number of couples.  The Government is sympathetic to the Bill and has, therefore, chosen not to oppose it.  The Bill, as drafted, raises serious legal and technical problems as well as a number of policy issues.  These would need to be dealt with and teased out during further consideration of the Bill.<\/p> <p>There are two conditions under the Bill that must be met for a same-sex spouse to be entitled to a spouse's pension.  The conditions are that on or before the date on which the employee reached pension age, he or she could not have married the beneficiary because both parties were of the same sex, or because he or she could not have entered into a civil partnership with the beneficiary and a foreign civil partnership would not have been recognised, and after the employee reached pension age, he or she married or entered into a civil partnership with the beneficiary within 36 months of it being lawfully possible to do so, or his or her foreign civil partnership became recognised in Irish law.  Apart from the same-sex couples included in those two conditions, the Bill would affect pension schemes and the scheme's stakeholders.  It is possible that where pension schemes unexpectedly must pay spouses' pensions retrospectively, those schemes may seek to reduce benefits for other classes of beneficiaries.  Affected pension schemes might take a legal action to challenge the Bill if it is passed.  It is right that this legacy issue be dealt with but it is crucial that a Bill with adverse or unintended consequences is not put on the Statute Book without understanding and accepting those consequences.  A number of issues would therefore need to be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#MM01100","speaker":"1423"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I commend Senator Bacik on bringing this Bill before the House.

At the age of 73 it is rather unlikely that I will get married, although I am open to offers.  I spent so much time pushing the boat out that I forgot to jump on and saw it going out of the harbour with little figures waving at me while I was stuck on the strand.  This is a measure to tidy up some of the remaining anomalies after the passage of various items of civil partnership and marriage equality legislation.  We talk about marriage equality but marriage is not equal as long as this anomaly arises.<\/p> <p>It is really an extraordinary anomaly.  I have raised it repeatedly in this House since the first civil partnership Bill was introduced because I spotted it and I was contacted by a few members of the public who were affected by it.  It is a truly Kafkaesque situation.  People could not apply for a pension because they did not marry but they could not marry and, therefore, could not get their pensions.  It is utterly revolting.  People were forced to contribute to a pension from which they did not benefit.  That is patently unfair.  In the old days when I raised this I was told it was a question of expense, that it would cost the Exchequer too much - rubbish.  There is no price on equality.  It is a principle and it has to be guaranteed.<\/p> <p>It is absurd that people who were not in a position to marry are penalised for this.  I would think the number of cases is extremely small.  I very much doubt that any pension funds would be endangered by it.  I do not think I am breaking too many confidences in saying that I bumped into the Minister and mentioned this to him and he said that it could affect small pension funds relating to approximately four people.  I rather doubt it.  I do not think there are very many.<\/p> <p>Since the passage of the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Act 2015, there have been only a couple of hundred marriages.  That is a tiny number.  It is ridiculous that we are halting the State machine in its majestic progress for the sake of a couple of hundred people.  How terribly mean-minded.<\/p> <p>I am glad to say that I have lived in this country through such a period of change.  I have no gaydar.  I am incapable of telling whether somebody is a fairy or not.  It is wonderful that we have a Government with two openly gay Ministers.  It should not matter a damn to anybody but at the stage we are at I take courage from the fact that two outstanding members of the Cabinet are openly gay and nobody bats an eyelid.  That is exactly the way it should be.  It gives this country something it never had during my youth, namely, somebody to look up to and to take as a gay role model.  It also shows that people can be successful and happy and contribute to public life.  When they contribute, however, they should be rewarded and there should be no discrimination in terms of pensions.  I commend Senator Bacik and the Labour Party on introducing this legislation.  I remember times when this was not a popular political message, to put it mildly.  Now, it is taken as a matter of course.  The Irish people, who are fair-minded and decent, would say that, yes, this matter needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#NN00300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and Dr. Parris and Mr. Scully, failte go dt&iacute; an tSeanaid &Eacute;ireann.

I commend Senator Bacik on bringing this Bill to the House.  Dr. Parris's case highlights the fact that, despite substantial strides, including marriage equality, we still struggle in many instances to provide legislation and procedure by the LGBTQI community.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that Dr. Parris was discriminated against and that his and his husband's marriage deserves to be treated equally.  The marriage equality referendum was fought on the basis of equal marriage rights.  It is clear that Dr. Parris has not received that.<\/p> <p>The referendum was intended to allow two people of the same sex who love each other express that love in the same way as everyone else.  There were legal obstacles that were of great importance during that campaign that denied LGBT people security in certain circumstances, for example, married couples could adopt as a couple whereas only one gay partner could adopt and the other had no parental rights that could be expressed in cases of emergency or separation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Another significant legal right was the right of succession where, in the event of a death, the surviving spouse would have an automatic entitlement to his or her husband's or wife's property intestate.  That gave security to widowed parties and allowed LGBT couples to be treated as equal.  I mention transgender citizens also because the divorce requirement for gender recognition was conditionally removed on that referendum's passing.<br\/><br\/>While this Bill, as admitted by Senator Bacik, provides for a very small number of people, and will provide for fewer as time goes on, it is important that we, as legislators, do what we can to express the wishes of the marriage equality referendum and provide civil and legal rights to LGBT people equally to those of heterosexual married couples represented through legislation.<br\/><br\/>As legislators, we must also consider how best to achieve equality for those marginalised but also how we redress the inequality of our past and provide justice for those affected.  What this anomaly will show is the need to equality-proof legislation effectively for those denied marriage rights in the past and those who wish to get married in the future.<br\/><br\/>In response to a Sinn F&eacute;in parliamentary question on gold digger clauses, the Department of Social Protection stated:<\/p><blockquote>Private pension schemes (such as occupational pension scheme) are matters for pension scheme members, their employers, and the scheme trustees.  My Department does not hold records of individual pension schemes and their rules (such as any &ldquo;gold digger clause&rdquo; in specific pension schemes).<\/blockquote><p>As the Department does not hold data to ensure compliance with pension law, the Minister might respond on how this Bill's implementation will be monitored by the Department if pension procedure is not monitored.<br\/><br\/>My hope is that this Seanad continues to explore how best to achieve LGBT equality and that we have further conversations to determine how much is left to be done in terms of providing gender recognition for all, combatting homophobic, bi-phobic and transphobic bullying, the increase in hate crime, LGBT visibility, acceptance and much more.  I believe all Members and parties should use their time here wisely, however long this Seanad remains, and I call on all parties and groupings to bring forward legislation that will progress LGBT equality as there is so much to be done in that regard.<br\/><br\/>I also want to remember Declan Flynn, whose anniversary was on Saturday.<br\/><br\/>I commend Senator Bacik on highlighting this anomaly in the legislation.

I join everyone in thanking the Labour Senators, especially Senator Bacik, for bringing this short and important Bill before the House and for using their Private Members' time to highlight this issue.  I also welcome the work of Senator Norris on this issue because if I recall correctly, he tabled an amendment to the Government's Finance Bill just before Christmas with the same policy intention as this Bill, so it is great to finally see some progress on it.<\/p> <p>I first became aware of the issue highlighted by this Bill in January when I received an e-mail from David Parris, a retired Trinity College lecturer, who is here with us today, in which he gave a heartfelt and comprehensive account of his struggle to see his pension entitlements extended to his same-sex partner under his pension plan due to their inability to marry before the age of 60 in the absence of legal civil partnerships or marriage in this country, and the tenacity he showed in challenging this unfair policy by eventually taking his case all the way to the European Court of Justice.  He went on to outline how the detailed and clearly argued decision by the court found against the college on all counts and showed that discrimination had taken place on the grounds of age and sexual orientation.  Nevertheless, the court decided against him, proclaiming that the married-before-60 rule was not legal under European law.  The ordeal that the letter described is a tale of unfair treatment, inequality and discrimination and I am glad we are here today to take the first step in rectifying that inequality.<\/p> <p>Other Senators spoke to the incredible change the passage of the marriage referendum in 2015 represents in how Ireland views and treats its LGBT community.  It will always be the case when such a significant and transformative change happens so quickly in one day, being the national referendum, that there will follow a period in which the State institutions must work to reflect and incorporate such a change across many public policy areas.  It is unfortunate that what is essentially an administrative anomaly was not dealt with in the post-referendum legislative period but I am glad we are dealing with it now.<\/p> <p>As I said, this is a short Bill of just two pages but it is great to know that such a short amendment to the Pensions Act 1990 is what is required to give equality in respect of private pension systems to LGBT citizens.  This issue speaks to a wider debate we need to have in the Oireachtas on equality-proofing of legislation and budgets across a range of areas, whether it be in terms of gender, sexual orientation, disability or socioeconomic class, as well as the need to ensure we are cognisant of all the potential knock-on effects of the decisions we make in national referenda and in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>I express my strong support for the Bill and applaud the tenacity of David Parris in pursuing this issue.

It is timely legislation and ensures we are progressive in terms of making Ireland a more fair and equal place in which to live and grow old.  The Bill rightly has support across the House.<\/p> <p>Pensions are very important as eventually we will all get to our third age when we can live well - as we were expected to - and reap the benefits of what we have paid into over a lifetime and not be discriminated against.  The Minister thinks I am always being a grinch when I speak here, although I probably need to be more of a grinch, but while I welcome this Bill, there is a big job of work to do on the entirety of pensions legislation.  The gender gap with regard to pensions remains one of the highest in Europe.  We need urgent reform of the State pension scheme, which is unstable.  Those who reach the age of 65 are now contracted to retire at age 67, and later at the age of 68.

There is absolutely no reason for it not to move speedily through the Houses as far as possible, and I urge all Senators to support this.  There are wider questions that are not dealt with in the Bill, and so they should not as they are wider questions.  There are concerns about the injustice and inequality to the LGBT community represented by clauses such as - I hate even to use the term - the apocryphal gold-digger clause.  There are issues of age discrimination in respect of those who find relationships later in life.  There are also issues of discrimination in respect of marital status.  Many people can be in meaningful relationships for decades of their lives without choosing to marry.  There are other questions we could consider another time.  What is important is that a pension should reflect the life someone has lived, the partnership he or she has had and the contributions a couple has worked together.  The precedent of the spousal pension is a recognition that people come together, contribute to each other and support each other in a life together.  This is a wider question.  For now, I recognise that the focus of the Bill is narrow and specific in order to ensure that it can effectively move forward and be passed.  However, I urge greater equality-proofing of our pensions legislation.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield mentioned the Department's treatment of private pension systems.  We give very considerable tax reliefs to many private pension systems.  There is a question for the State as to whether it might not want to send a small signal of what we expect in terms of good practice in other future occupational pensions.  The Bill represents an opportunity to do so in a way.<\/p><p>This is a very well thought-out, carefully worded, measured Bill which will make a significant difference and fix an anomaly in our system, and I support it.  I recognise that the Minister very kindly accepted an amendment I tabled in respect of voluntary contributions to the pension system.  It was a small change and it did not affect a huge number of people but it made a difference to people.  People feel they are more able to plan for their future and are recognised for the contributions they have made.  These small changes can make a very big difference and send a very positive signal that the State recognises relationships and contributions made.  I thank Senator Bacik again.  I look forward to seeing the Bill back before the House very soon and I hope it will move very speedily through both Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#OO00400","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The introduction first of civil partnership and then of marriage equality has made a huge difference for many of our fellow citizens.  The Bill introduced by Senators Bacik, Humphreys, Nash and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in seeks to deal with an important legacy issue for a number of couples.  I join with Senator Norris in recognising the Labour Party for its long-standing interest and commitment to equality for LGBT citizens long before it was mainstream.  The Government is sympathetic to the Bill and has therefore decided not to oppose it.  The Bill as drafted, however, raises some legal and technical problems and policy issues that need to be considered.  These would need to be dealt with and teased out in further consideration of the Bill.<\/p> <p>These provisions have been presented in different guises over the past few years as amendments to various pieces of legislation such as the Social Welfare and Pensions Bills, Finance Bills and equality Bills.  The core issue is retrospective pension rights for same-sex couples.  Under the provisions of the Pensions Act, people in civil partnerships, same-sex marriages and opposite-sex marriages are treated equally.  The principle of equal pension treatment is that there shall be no discrimination on any ground in respect of any rule of a scheme compared with other members or prospective members of that scheme.  Broadly speaking, pension scheme rules may provide that spousal pension benefits will be paid where the member has married or registered a civil partnership at the point of retirement within a specified time before or after retirement or at the point of death.  As Senators have mentioned, these rules are sometimes referred to as gold-digger clauses, designed to protect older people and other scheme members from having to pay out spousal pensions that could stretch long into the future.  Of course, such a clause could as much apply to a young man seeking to marry an elderly female, as in the example described previously, although perhaps this would be a graduate clause rather than a gold-digger clause.<\/p> <p>As the law stands, there is no difference between opposite-sex and same-sex couples.  In a scheme whereby spousal pension rights will be paid where the member is married at the point of retirement, if either a same-sex or opposite-sex couple marries subsequent to the member's retirement, no pension would be payable.  In a scheme whereby spousal pension benefits will be paid where the member is married at the point of death, where a same-sex or opposite-sex couple marries subsequent to retirement, a spousal pension would be payable.  In 2016, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that it was not discriminatory for a pension scheme to refuse to grant a retrospective spouse's pension to a same-sex partner or spouse if civil partnerships were not recognised by the State during the relevant period.<\/p> <p>There are a number of reasons the Bill gives rise to difficulties.  Provisions that are discriminatory cannot be introduced, and any changes to a pension scheme might have to apply equally to persons in civil partnerships, same-sex marriages or opposite-sex marriages.  The Bill could also give rise to constitutional issues.  Article 15.1.1&deg; of the Constitution states: \"The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.\"  It is possible that this Bill, if passed, could be challenged on these constitutional grounds by affected pension schemes.  There is also the principle of non-retrospectivity.  Pension schemes cannot give benefits to members to which they are not entitled, and entitlements must be given by reference to the law in force at the time, not what we believe it should have been.  Enacting retrospective legislation in this case could raise precedent issues in that it could be seen to offer an avenue to others who feel they have been historically discriminated against to demand subsequent law changes to seek redress at the expense of others.  However, having listened to the debate, I think Senator Bacik has done well in her Bill to avoid retrospection and has tried to create a window of opportunity during which people could regularise their statements, this not being possible or legal previously.  To disregard the European court's ruling that there was no discrimination in the circumstances in question is also a significant matter and could lead to calls to do the same in other cases.  However, again, it is of course a matter for the Oireachtas to decide this on a case-by-case basis, and this could well be such a case.<\/p> <p>Private sector pension schemes must have sufficient funding in place to provide the promised scale of benefits.  They are unlikely to make provision for an occurrence that might not take place.  Schemes do not in general make provision for the payment of a pension to a spouse or civil partner who does not exist at the time of retirement.  There could also be additional legal, actuarial and administrative costs for such schemes.<\/p> <p>Many pension schemes are struggling at the moment without the addition of further costs to the schemes.  However, I accept that the numbers involved may be very small.  Even in a very small scheme, however, many of which we have in Ireland - in fact, half of the occupational pension schemes in Europe are domiciled in Ireland - the costs may not be minor.  For example, in the case of a small scheme designed on the basis that it will have seven or eight members, adding one or two more members to the scheme could have a very serious impact on what is left in the pot for the seven or eight who had been in it from the beginning.<\/p> <p>There are thousands of people in both public and private pension schemes who are not covered for spousal benefits.  Many of these made decisions about pension coverage based on their circumstances at the time, often for very understandable reasons.  For example, a person who was separated and had no prospect of remarriage prior to 1996.  Unfortunately, there are no \"do-overs\" in these circumstances, regardless of changes in society since they made their decisions.<\/p> <p>The Bill would also make changes only for same-sex couples affected by these conditions.  This could be viewed as preferential treatment for same-sex couples and might lead to opposite-sex couples requesting equal treatment.  Although the Bill is for defined benefit, DB, occupational pensions, it could also create an issue for same-sex couples with annuities.  If a person in a defined contribution scheme bought an annuity without a spouse's pension, would he or she now feel he or she should be able to purchase a spouse's pension as well?  While I may personally feel that these clauses should be changed in all pension schemes, rules in general are a matter for the trustees, and changing them may have a significant financial impact, which we need to understand.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Leo Varadkar:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2192\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Trustees may also argue that the legislation interferes with the property rights of their members.  Equally, it could be argued that trustees should make these changes to their schemes.<\/p><p>I recognise the problems of the particular past circumstances of the people for whom the Bill has been designed.  I am keen to find a way forward.  One of the next steps is for the sponsors of the Bill to conduct a regulatory impact assessment.  The Bill contains some drafting errors which they need to rectify.  I am sure they will want to do so.  Consideration needs to be given to how this legislation will interact or conflict with other provisions included in the Pensions Act.  Cost implications are difficult to quantify on the basis of the Bill, as published.  Unexpected or unintended costs arising from the Bill - costs to the pension scheme and future pensioners, rather than the Exchequer - could have effects on private and public sector pension schemes.  These costs need to be calculated.  My Department will certainly assist in that process.<\/p><p>It is right for this legacy issue to be dealt with.  I am sure the sponsors of the Bill and all Senators will agree that it is crucial that a Bill with adverse or unintended consequences is not put on the Statute Book without understanding and accepting what the consequences might be.  I urge the sponsors of the Bill to consider carefully the points I have made as they consider how best to make further progress with it.  My officials and I will be available to assist in preparations for Committee Stage, or perhaps with a view to devising an agreed amendment to the forthcoming social welfare and pensions Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#PP00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank the many Senators who spoke to the Bill.  I thank Senators Gerald Nash and Kevin Humphreys, who seconded the Bill, and Senators Ray Butler, Catherine Ardagh, Victor Boyhan, David Norris, Fintan Warfield, Lynn Ruane, M&aacute;ire Devine and Alice-Mary Higgins for expressing their support for it in such strong terms.  I think everyone acknowledged the bravery of David Parris and his husband, Gerhard Scully, in taking the case and bringing the issue to wider attention.  I reiterate that acknowledgment.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for his generally positive response to the legislation.  I thank him for acknowledging the track record of the Labour Party in delivering measures aimed at achieving greater equality.  Like Senator Gerald Nash, I should have mentioned that a legacy Bill in the Senator's name, Convictions for Certain Sexual Offences (Apology and Exoneration) Bill 2016, is before this House.  That Bill seeks to ensure people with convictions from the time homosexuality was a criminal offence will have them expunged from the record.  We hope to make progress with that Bill.<\/p> <p>I pay a particular tribute to Senator David Norris in this context.  Senator Lynn Ruane reminded me that Senator David Norris had tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill to seek to deal with David Parris' case.  Obviously, he has been a tireless worker on these issues during the years.<\/p> <p>Senator Gerald Nash accurately described the Bill as dealing with \"unfinished business\".  It is about trying to find a way forward to deal with the legacy of continued discrimination.<\/p> <p>I want to address a couple of key points raised by Senator Ray Butler and the Minister by way of partial objection.  I acknowledge their general support for the Bill and the principle on which it is based and thank them for that support.  I am concerned, however, that both of them referred to the possibility of small pension schemes taking action on the basis that bringing new people within the provisions of such schemes will impose additional costs on the members of these schemes.  Frankly, that is a spurious argument.  The same argument could be made against a group of employees who organise a Lisdoonvarna-type dating festival, aimed at employees in their 50s who are close to the age at which they have to be married in order that their spouses might benefit from these arrangements, if that results in more people coming under a pension scheme.  It is clear that pension schemes with these age restriction clauses have to take the risk that as people approach the age of 60 years, they will get married in a rush in order that their spouses might benefit.  I do not agree that action can be taken by existing trustees or stakeholders in a small pension scheme when something results in more people becoming eligible to claim spousal benefit.<\/p> <p>The Bill does not seek to abolish the age restriction clause in general.  I acknowledge the point made by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins which was accepted by the Minister that there is something rather offensive about age restrictions in a general way.  That is an issue for another day.  The Bill does not undermine the existence of age restriction clauses.  It simply seeks to create a small temporary exemption.  As the Minister said, the 36-month window provision seeks to ensure the effect of this legislation will not be fully retrospective.  It will be capable of allowing exemptions for a very small number of people only.<\/p> <p>That brings me to the retrospective point more generally which we have tried to address through the 36-month provision.  I am very familiar with the provisions of Article 15.5.1&deg; of the Constitution.  I represented the State in a case in the past, arguing for legislation to be applied retrospectively.  As we succeeded in that case, it is not an absolute principle.  As a result, sex offender registration provisions can be applied to people convicted prior to the entry into force of the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  There are exceptions to the non-retrospectivity principle, even in criminal law where it is at its most robust.  We have to look at the retrospectivity point.  I do not see it as precluding us from bringing forward legislation of this type because there are ways around it.<\/p> <p>Just because the European Court of Justice has stated there is no discrimination in EU law does not mean that we cannot say there is discrimination in our law in the case of same-sex couples.  I think anyone would say the reality is that patently there is discrimination.  As people were unable to get married, they were blocked in their spouse achieving survivor's benefit because of the age restriction.<\/p> <p>I take the Minister's point about the need to engage with his officials.  I will be very happy to do so.  With my Labour Party colleagues, I will be delighted to engage with them to see how best to make progress with this principle.  We are not wedded to the exact provisions included in the Bill.  We would be very happy to amend them.  I have a good track record in working with officials in other Departments to have Private Members' legislation passed and would be happy to consider an amendment to the social welfare and pensions Bill as an alternative route.  I am not sure whether the Labour Party group in this House can conduct a regulatory impact assessment without the support of the State.  The Minister would have more resources to undertake such an assessment and we will be happy to work with him in that regard.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Fintan Warfield for pointing me to the parliamentary question tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in on the existence of age restriction clauses.  It is helpful to know that the State does not have this information.  This makes it hard to assess the numbers involved.  I know that the Minister intends to do this in another way by looking at demographics.  Clearly, that might be a much bigger figure than the number who might actually be caught by the age restriction clause.  We do not know how many of these clauses there are.  We will have to work together to consider how best to establish the impact required.  We all acknowledge that while the number of people affected by this problem is small, it is hugely important as an equality issue for individuals and couples such as David Parris and Gerhard Scully for it to be resolved.<\/p> <p>Senators have spoken eloquently about the need to acknowledge the change that has taken place in Irish society by moving towards a more inclusive and equal recognition of loving partnerships.  It was put very eloquently by Senator David Norris when he said \"marriage is not equal as long as this anomaly arises\" in our law.  That is true.  Senator Fintan Warfield has made the point that we need to give effect to the wishes of the people, as expressed in the referendum in 2015.  I suggest bringing through this sort of legislation is a way of respecting the decision made by the people two years ago.  I think everyone acknowledges that this an important legacy issue.  I ask the Minister and his officials and the officials in the Department of Public Enterprise and Reform to work with us to make speedy progress in bringing the Bill through the Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#QQ00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1490178600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#QQ00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#QQ00500","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1490178600,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 28 March 2017.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1490178600,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 6.15 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Reports on Motor Insurance Costs: Statements","time":1490178600,"counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#WW00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the opportunity to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann this evening on the cost of insurance working group's Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, which was published in January and on which implementation has already commenced.  I will also refer to the Report on the Rising Costs of Motor Insurance of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in my address, which covers similar ground to the working group's report.<\/p> <p>As everybody here is aware, the cost of motor insurance is an important issue that has had a significant impact on society as a whole.  Throughout the country people have been paying significantly higher premiums for insuring their motor vehicles and many are struggling to afford what is, after all, an essential requirement for day-to-day living.<\/p> <p>I take this opportunity to again acknowledge the work on motor insurance undertaken by the Oireachtas joint committee chaired by Deputy McGuinness.  There are considerable overlaps between our respective reports, which ultimately share the same basic aim of delivering fairer insurance premiums for all consumers.  On some issues, the recommendations in the Oireachtas joint committee's report are almost identical to those contained in the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance; for instance, in providing more information to consumers regarding the breakdown of premiums and reasons for large increases, ensuring that the use of pre-action protocols is extended to personal injury cases and establishing the Personal Injuries Commission.  In addition, there are further recommendations in the two reports which are broadly aligned such as recommendations to establish fully functional databases relating to both uninsured drivers and insurance fraud and to expedite the development of the master licence record.  Therefore, in implementing the cost of insurance working group's report recommendations, a process already well under way, we will address many of the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas joint committee's report.<\/p> <p>Essentially, there are five to six key priority reforms that I believe need to be made to improve the functioning of our motor insurance market.  The cost of insurance working group report contains 33 recommendations, with 71 action points, which present a roadmap to achieving these reforms - one can see how we will get there, when and who is responsible.  I will outline the key aspects in detail, as well as providing updates on the work already done.  One of the key findings of the working group's report is the need to enhance transparency and facilitate the use of data sharing and collection to the level that we see in other jurisdictions.  This was a common theme which arose in discussions with a wide range of stakeholders and is a matter which needs to be addressed.  Currently in Ireland, claims data related to motor insurance are available from a variety of sources.  However, no organisation is currently responsible for the collection of data from insurers for the purposes of improving transparency on emerging risks within the market, thus representing a clear information gap.  <\/p> <p>Pricing of insurance premiums reflects a current view on the likelihood and cost of claims into the future.  Transparency of claims data could feed into insurers' current view of future risks, thereby improving their ability to price more accurately and reducing the cyclicality of their pricing.  The working group has developed a phased approach to progress this matter.  In the short term, it recommends commencing the publication on a quarterly basis of a number of key aggregated claims-related metrics to be provided by the insurance sector.  A subgroup formed in order to progress the implementation of this recommendation has met on six occasions to date and a request for data will issue to insurance undertakings before the end of this month for completion.  The metrics will then be published for the first time at the end of the second quarter of this year.  This publication of initial metrics will act as a stepping stone to the establishment of a national claims information database by the middle of 2018, which will provide more detailed claims information and, therefore, should lead to better quality in-depth data analysis.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Central Bank will hold this database.<br\/><br\/>It is expected that the national claims information database will provide data on what claims are being made against property or for personal injuries, the legal and other costs that are being incurred, as well as the channel of resolution and what impact that has on the final settlement, among other things.  It should assist in identifying emerging risks in the market relating to claims, trends and costs, for example.  The information will be collected and stored at an aggregate level.<br\/><br\/>The second area where data availability is a live issue is in the field of uninsured driving.  Figures from the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, show that the level of uninsured driving in Ireland rose from less than 5% in 2013 to 7.1% in 2015.  The bureau is responsible for meeting the claims of those who have been in a collision involving an uninsured or untraceable driver.  It pays out approximately &euro;50 million to &euro;60 million annually to meet such claims and this cost is passed directly to motorists.  The insurance industry estimates that this adds about &euro;30 to each motorist&rsquo;s premium.  It is imperative, therefore, that we tackle this issue without delay.  The working group has recommended the establishment of a fully-functioning database to identify uninsured drivers to enable garda&iacute; to check motor insurance compliance effectively.  A project group has been established between the MIBI and Insurance Ireland to create a central database which will contain information required by the Road Traffic Act 2016, such as the driving licence number and policy number of each insurance policyholder.  The ultimate aim is to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a mobile app, on an authorised user basis, to allow for roadside access to the database.  The report sets a deadline of quarter 3 of this year for the database to go live <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>privately owned vehicles.<br\/><br\/> Fraud, like uninsured driving, has been highlighted as an area where the availability of more quality information can lead to a reduction in its negative impact on the cost of premiums.  While the vast majority of claims are genuine, there is a public perception that insurance fraud is a victimless crime.  However, nothing could be further from the truth and fraudulent claims, whether of an opportunistic and exaggerated nature or facilitated by highly-organised crime rings, need to be made as difficult as possible to get away with.  In this regard, the insurance industry has estimated that fraud costs it in the region of &euro;200 million each year, adding approximately &euro;50 to each premium.  To deal with this problem, the report recommends the establishment of a fully-functioning integrated insurance fraud database by the end of next year to enable the industry to detect patterns of fraud.  It is likely to be modelled on an equivalent UK system and will be funded by industry but managed by an independent not-for-profit body.  This will be progressed in tandem with actions to ensure any data protection issues are appropriately addressed.<br\/><br\/> Another core recommendation is the establishment of a personal injuries commission to investigate and make recommendations on processes in other jurisdictions which could enhance the claims process in Ireland.  The terms of reference for that commission are set out in the report and they include the commissioning of medical research, bench marking of international awards for personal injury cases, analysing and reporting on international compensation levels and compensation mechanisms and reporting on systems where detailed grading of minor personal injuries is in operation.  The need to begin this work immediately has been recognised by Government and on 10 January, the former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, was appointed as chairperson of the commission.  The other members are stakeholder representatives from the medical, legal and insurance sectors as well as relevant Government Departments and agencies.  The commission met for the first time on 10 February and has agreed a work plan.  The second meeting took place on 3 March, with the next one scheduled for 7 April.<br\/><br\/> While the aforementioned measures could be seen as the core recommendations, the report should be seen as a package of reforms which, when implemented together, will provide for greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and help to prevent the volatility that we have seen in the market in recent times.  In this regard, another bundle of measures addresses the issue of protecting the consumer through, for example, the extension of the current renewal notification timeframe by five working days.  Additionally, the Department of Finance is working with Insurance Ireland to develop protocols to require insurers to set out reasons for large increases in premiums and to assist returning emigrants by requiring insurers to accept driving experience from abroad where a person has previous driving experience in Ireland.  Another part of the recommendations centres on reducing costs in the claims process in tandem with the running of the personal injuries commission.  These actions will seek to maximise the usefulness of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and to improve the book of quantum.  Further reviews will also take place to examine the impact of the changes in the court jurisdictional limits, the setting of the discount rate in personal injury lump sum awards and the introduction of periodic payment orders.  The implementation of the recommendations of the review of the motor insurance compensation framework is also ongoing as we speak, with heads of a Bill to be brought to Government by the second quarter of this year.  Actions have also been recommended to develop a protocol requiring insurers to seek proof of an up-to-date national car test, NCT, or certificate of roadworthiness and to promote compliance with road safety legislation.  Insurance Ireland will also present the working group with a report on the use of telematics in Ireland by the end of the year.<br\/><br\/> I appreciate being given the opportunity to discuss the important objective of reducing the cost of motor insurance and I look forward to hearing the comments of Senators here today.  It should be noted that the ongoing progress of the working group can be followed through the quarterly updates which will be published on the Department&rsquo;s website from quarter two.  I have also provided the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach with an initial progress report following my recent appearance before it and this has been published.  While I have said on a number of occasions that there is no single simple method to immediately stem or reverse premium price rises, I believe that with the effective and timely implementation of these reforms and with high levels of co-operation and commitment from all stakeholders, we can create a more accessible market which can deliver fairer premiums for consumers without unnecessary delay.  We can achieve this for the consumer while also protecting the stability of the insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#WW00200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to debate the report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the rising cost of motor insurance and the report of the working group on same.  Almost immediately following the establishment of the aforementioned Oireachtas committee last June, the unsustainable rising cost of motor insurance was identified as an urgent issue for the committee&rsquo;s attention.  I serve as Vice Chairman of that committee and it is fair to say that the Chairman, Deputy John McGuinness, and its members, including Senator Kieran O'Donnell and others, did a lot of in-depth work on the issue of motor insurance.  The committee engaged with many different stakeholders over many meetings and produced a very good report last November, much of which dovetails with the Minister of State's working group report.<\/p> <p>The rising costs of insurance were confirmed by CSO figures which, over a three year cycle, showed increases of up to 70%, with many consumers experiencing even higher increases.  We all know that the rising cost of motor insurance continues to have a very negative impact on Irish society.  We also know that this rate of price increase is not sustainable and, in the opinion of the Oireachtas committee, not justified.  The cost of motor insurance poses a risk to national competitiveness and the performance of the overall economy at a time where the country is facing other serious challenges which are beyond our direct control, including the possible impacts of the US Government's policies on foreign direct investment, FDI, and of Brexit.  The high cost of motor insurance - and insurance generally, which we are not discussing today but which is being discussed by the Oireachtas Committee-  must be tackled.<\/p> <p>As one of its first tasks, the joint committee undertook to examine and establish the underlying factors contributing to the rising costs of motor insurance and to make recommendations to reverse this trend.  The committee held a series of public hearings on the matter.  As Vice Chairman, and on behalf of the joint committee, I would like to thank all the witnesses who came before the committee and for their respective contributions.  I also wish to thank the wider public, many of whom contacted the committee and supplied submissions on this issue.  This evidence gave the committee valuable information and insight on this very critical issue which impacts directly on Irish citizens and businesses.<\/p> <p>The importance of the public nature of the committee hearings cannot be overstated.  It meant that members of the public could hear first-hand from the main players and draw their own conclusions.  It is the job of public representatives to represent citizens and during these hearings the committee heard, time and again, of the impact on citizens of the rising cost of motor insurance, with young and older drivers feeling particularly targeted.  The committee heard that other safe drivers had also experienced inexplicable price increases which were completely unrelated to their driving records.  My experience, and doubtless that of many of the other committee members, was one of frustration at the end of the public hearings on this issue.  Having reviewed extensive documentation and heard from a range of perspectives, the committee identified many factors as contributing to the huge price increases in insurance premiums, such as the frequency and cost of claims, fraud, operating losses of insurers, legal and regulatory factors, including insolvency issues, and the need to reform the PIAB.  However, it remains my opinion that another critical factor is the lack of transparency of and access to insurance data, particularly data on claims.<\/p> <p>The committee repeatedly heard that 10% of claims end up in court, 20% are adjudicated through the PIAB and the remainder are never seen by anyone other than the insurance companies and individual claimants.  The committee also discovered that there had been no significant increase in the cost of the claims paid out by the courts or the PIAB.  Therefore, we have to believe, on the basis of what we heard from the insurance companies and in the absence of any independent method of measurement, that all of the increase in premiums relates to the 70% of claims that are settled outside of the formal settlement systems.  We also heard about losses incurred by the insurance companies in the past, solvency ratio changes, administrative inefficiencies and so forth.  The lack of transparency and of access to insurance data is absolutely critical and must be dealt with properly.<\/p> <p>In that context, I welcome the speech from the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I also welcome the time he has devoted to this issue.  The Minister of State is a man of great integrity who is doing his very best on this issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I can speak from personal experience.  The Minister of State might be lucky in that my insurance policy was up for renewal.  The premium went from &euro;390 to &euro;520 last year, an increase of exactly one third.  It had increased from &euro;330 to &euro;390 the year before and was below &euro;300 the year before that.  This year it came in at &euro;820.  That quote was for the same car and driver with no claims or penalty points.  I managed to get it back down to &euro;580 after discussing it with the insurance company, but it is still an iincrease of more than 10%.  However, it is not the &euro;300 increase that it would have been otherwise.  If I am seeing these increases, I imagine many other consumers are too.<\/p><p>This issue is urgent.  It is all well and good to say we do not want to have water charges or increases in property tax.  However, these increases are major and affect people on a daily basis.  They are far greater than any being suggested in the television licence fee or water charges, if we had to pay them.  They need to be tackled at an aggregate level.  We need to understand what is going on.<\/p><p>I am Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  The committee made 71 recommendations, far too many to outline in detail in the two minutes I have left.  While some of them would be relatively easy to implement, others would require detailed consideration.  Greater transparency is crucial.  We have recommended that the insurance industry give raw data and that the Government collect them.  The Minister of State alluded to how a database would be set up and managed.  I hope that over time it will show us the blips and the issues that need to be tackled.  I also hope it will encourage new competition.  We hear that competitors have no wish to come here because the market is too unpredictable.  They believe they would be paying for the losses of companies that folded and so on.  That issue needs to be looked at.<\/p><p>The report also recommends the greater sharing of data between the insurance industry and the various statutory agencies.  It recommends that consumers receive greater detail in renewal documents.  An increase in the powers of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is important.  We talk about the book of quantum being important, but we need to understand it is simply an historical document reflecting what has been paid out.  It should not be a target in the sense of future claims being the same as previous ones.  We have heard much about the change in the discount rate.  Equally, we have heard of solvency ratios.  Customers need to understand why their premiums are going up.  However, they do not and cannot because the documents simply state what the premium was and what it will be.  We need to understand why.  I realise this is not within the remit of the Minister of State.  Apparently, road safety was not within the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport when he was before the House.  Road safety and the enforcement of existing rules need to be dealt with, although I realise they are matters for the Department of Justice and Equality.  People need to know.  If there are fewer and less severe claims, there should be smaller pay-outs.  That is basic mathematics.  We need to ensure people are driving more effectively, whether by way of putting alco-locks on the cars of those who have been convicted of drink driving, tachographs in ordinary cars to track what the drivers are doing or using similar technology.  I imagine technology to track people while driving is already in existence.  It simply needs to be used.<\/p><p>I hope our report can contribute to reform of the motor insurance sector.  We have engaged with the Minister of State.  It is important that the Minister come back to the committee on a quarterly basis to discuss and tease out what is happening.  This is a vital issue.  I was the person who requested that the matter be debated in this Chamber because it had been discussed in the other Chamber on the day the Department's report was published.  It is important to have this debate.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State, his officials and the committee to try to ensure insurance premiums will not simply stay the same but fall over time.  They should fall because less is being paid out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#XX00200","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and compliment him on the work he has done in this area.  There are two reports on the issue, the first of which is the report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  The Minister of State also produced a report for his Department.  Many of the points we had raised fed into the final document produced by the Department.<\/p> <p>It goes without says this problem has some key features.  First, we really do not know what happens with 70% of claims since they are settled outside the courts and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  Second, there is no database.  Certain insurance companies have internal databases that they use, but there is no transparent public database to allow people to see exactly how premiums are arrived at or how risks are factored into premiums.  The book of quantum needs to be updated far more.<\/p> <p>I note one feature that we found when we worked on the report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  I note that the clerk to the committee is in the Visitors Gallery.  The myth was that the only reason motor insurance premiums were increasing was the making of exorbitant awards and legal fees.  That was the sole reason proffered, but we found, when we drilled down, that this was not the case.  Are these factors?  Yes, they are.  Are they the primary factors?  No, they are not.  The report makes for interesting reading.  It found that the appeals court had been established to enable insurance companies to appeal to a higher court.  In essence, a special court was set up and, effectively, the associated rulings formed precedents.  We found that in the previous six or 12 months awards were for significantly smaller amounts than those granted in the courts, yet there was no correlation in a fall in motor insurance premiums.  The insurance companies maintained that the size of awards and legal fees were the primary contributory factors.  However, that was not borne out by the empirical evidence during the previous six or 12 months.  In many cases, routine awards were falling by one half.  I did some forensic work on the matter.  That was something about which I felt strongly.<\/p> <p>I made a presentation at the Limerick Seniors Forum a week ago.  It had organised a seminar for older people on the motor insurance industry.  I had to read through the reports and look at the up-to-date position.  They made for interesting reading and the feedback from the older age groups was interesting.  I am referring to them as older age groups rather than in any other way.<\/p> <p>A feature of the industry is how the industry players are shifting the goal posts once again.  The danger is that this is what they will continue to do.  Two particular cases stand out.  A man had a claim against his insurance policy approximately two years ago.  His premiums went up marginally in the past two years.  However, this year in the initial quote it went from &euro;500 to &euro;1,300.  He was operating through a broker who eventually got the figure down to &euro;1,100 with the same company.  I decided to do some forensic work.  We went through all of the insurance company websites to see whether we could find a lower quote.  The answer is that, systematically, all of the quotes were higher.  We went directly to the company with which the man in question was insured and found that it was charging a premium far higher than the broker was quoting.<\/p> <p>A second person came to me in recent days.  Their premium had jumped to an alarming level over a year ago, almost to &euro;1,800.  Companies are now finding ways to do this.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is examining cartels in the motor insurance industry.  A person made a claim over two years ago and it had relatively little impact on his premium in the past two years.  Suddenly, this year the quote from his existing company, through the broker, was by far the cheapest of the quotes received.  The only company with which he could be insured was his existing company, but it was jacking up the rate.  However, it was jacking it up at a lower rate than other companies.  Why was that?  We need to look under the bonnet to find out what is going on.  This issue is extremely urgent.  Whatever is required, whether it be legislation or other measures, we need to fast-track it to force motor insurance companies to provide a publicy available database that will be under the control of the Central Bank.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It can be on a no names basis, but they must give a number and the reason for the quote.  How can an insurance company justify the premium of an individual who had an unblemished record all his life until a car accident over two years ago going up in the normal way following the accident but suddenly in the third year going sky high?  The question that has to be asked is why he cannot get motor insurance from any company bar his existing company which is charging an exorbitant rate.  The only way we will address that is to prevent all insurance companies from issuing a motor insurance policy until they release the details of every single motor insurance policy they issue.  If that was done, it would bring some level of reason.  My worry is that when they cannot blame it, they are going to go after the soft targets.  Motor insurance is the only obligatory insurance.<\/p><p>The empirical evidence shows that insurance companies are not getting with the programme in terms of providing transparency and reasonably affordable motor insurance policy premiums.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#YY00200","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I will first talk about the issue of databases in insurance in general and in the motor insurance industry.

If one goes to buy health insurance in the morning, one can pick any specific grouping that has a special deal and decide to be part of that.  Why is it not possible to do the same with car insurance?  We hear of youngsters who buy cars for &euro;2,000 and are asked to pay &euro;5,000 insurance.  We then ask ourselves why there are uninsured drivers on the road?<\/p><p>I heard a very interesting debate recently about an apprentice whose mother was complaining that he could not drive alone on his provisional licence and he had a long way to go to work.  I understand the problem but I do not agree with her point.  The bottom line is that a learner driver should not be in a car on their own.  Where learner drivers or uninsured drivers are found on the road in their cars, the car is a lethal weapon and should be taken off them on the spot.  That would cause problems in rural Ireland but those problems are nothing to the problems of a family who lose a loved one because an inexperienced driver takes a corner too fast or because a car crashes, killing the driver.<\/p><p>I accept Senator O'Donnell's point on legal fees.  However, we must also be aware that many, many clients when they go to a solicitor - not all solicitors, I hasten to add - to represent them at the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, are told that the solicitor can get them a better award.  This leads to the nonsensical four and five year delays where the client of the solicitor and the insurance company engage a plethora of medical professionals to carry out medical assessments maybe ten times between the time the claim is lodged and the time the claim is settled.  However, 70% of claims are settled without ever going inside the door of a court.  It is time we stopped the nonsense.  There is no reason a personal injuries claim cannot be settled within a year if the parties to it are going to settle.<\/p><p>I recall an organisation down in Senator O'Donnell's country that sent a letter to every solicitor within a 100 mile radius and told them that if a solicitor took on a no foal, no fee case against that organisation, it would fight that solicitor to the Supreme Court if necessary.  This killed off all the nonsensical claims overnight because nobody was prepared to chance bringing a no foal, no fee case all the way to the Supreme Court.  One had to be damn sure of one's grounds before taking such a case.<\/p><p>There are spurious claims and they need to be weeded out.  In the case of those who are genuinely injured, however, we need to expedite the claims process to get them whatever compensation they need.  Compensation is not paid out willy-nilly in this country.  People have to prove their case.  The notion that one has to wait four years to do it does not make sense.  If somebody goes to the PIAB, the board values his or her injury at &euro;20,000, the claimant goes to court and is offered less than that, then that is what he or she gets.  A very strong case would have to be made - I do not wish to tie the hands of the Judiciary - to get a valuation higher than the PIAB award.<\/p><p>I am delighted to see the appeals system is in place.  I agree with Senator O'Donnell that the appeals system has not resulted in reduced policy figures.  That is something that we need to look at.<\/p><p>I will finish on the issue of social responsibility.  This morning I brought up the issue of first responders who act as first aiders in rural Ireland.  The first case that arose was in Donegal.  First responders were informed by their car insurance company that if they are using their car to respond to an emergency call out, they are not insured.  To cover emergency call-outs, the insurance company looked for a premium on top of the premium.  That is just milking the system.  These people are prepared to give up their time voluntarily to their community by, for example, bringing a defibrillator to a person lying on the street.  All of a sudden they are going to have to pay a price for it.<\/p><p>That caused me to look into the situation with regard to county councillors doing their duties.  A county councillor may very well find that he or she is not covered if he or she has an accident.  If that councillor explains that he or she is a county councillor and was <i>en route<\/i>to visit a constituent in Bruff when the accident occurred, the insurance company can claim that the councillor was not on private business in his or her private car but rather was on a business trip and should have informed the insurance company of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#ZZ00800","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>They could have been going to Lough Gur as well, which is on the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#ZZ00900","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>They could have been going to Lough Gur.

He said that he was prepared to put pressure on those who were holding up progress or refusing to co-operate.  It is worthwhile to quote at length from what he said:<\/p><blockquote>There is absolutely no point in this committee or the working group publishing reports if we do not have a detailed timeline around it.  I have met the insurance companies and Insurance Ireland on this and have said to them that we are going to come with an ambitious and a detailed timeline for the implementation of every single recommendation we put forward.  We want to show a determination that we are serious about this to all the players in the market.  That is why when I talk about it, and I hope the committee sees this, and when we come to publish the working group's report with the detailed timeline reflecting all the good work done by the Oireachtas committee and in showing the determination to get things done and to take action, it will have a calming influence on the recent spikes we have seen in the cost of motor insurance premiums.<\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the problem with this report and the implementation of the recommendations is that the onus is placed almost entirely on the industry.  This is the same industry that is responsible for the unexplained and reckless 50% increases in premiums.  It is the same industry that my colleagues spent many weeks questioning and cross-examining at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in order to get answers.  I have heard from a colleague that her insurance premium has gone up &euro;800 in four years, all of which were no-claim years.  She has held her licence for six years.  I know of a person who saw a 50% increase, once again without any explanation given.  Premiums that rise without any documented explanation annoy people the most and leave them fearful of the next quotation from their insurers.  The report from the finance committee stresses that this matter simply must be tackled head-on.  When he appeared before the committee, the Minister of State said that this issue is being dealt with by an implementation committee nominated by insurance company CEOs.  The very people who hiked insurance premiums are to sit around and decide if they did a bad thing in increasing their profits.  Even if, as is claimed, the CSO figures show a balancing off of increases, we are still left with a net 50% increase.<\/p><p>Another example of how this report defers to the industry is the proposal in recommendation 26 that the insurance industry should actually fund a section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I can understand the intention and one could argue that if there are major sporting or community events they have to provide a contribution towards that.  What is being put forward, however, is something different.  It is a specialised and dedicated insurance fraud unit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that would be funded by the industry.  This is not a contribution to the policing of a community event.  This measure would basically define those who are policing an event as a Garda insurance squad and the insurance industry would pay their wages.  I believe this to be a risky concept.  I can understand the sentiment behind it, which is to question whether the insurance sector should make a contribution or pay a levy.  When one has that type of direct engagement between members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the industry that pays them, it is quite risky and we should stop to consider what precedent is being set.  A freedom of information request my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, produced evidence that in August 2015 the Governor of the Central Bank was writing to the Minister for Finance pointing out that a number of non-life insurance companies had taken a very optimistic view of the future economic outIook, had built up an unsustainable overhead and had followed an imprudent pricing and underwriting approach.  In other words, the industry made mistakes leaving itself exposed to shocks.  In an age of 0% interest rates, the old model of relying on returns from investments and bonds has failed them and us.  Of course, fraud, extra regulation and other factors contribute to the price of a premium.  The question is how much have these factors changed.  The answer seems to be very little.  The answer to why premiums have increased cannot be put down to these static factors.<\/p><p>Many of the solutions put forward by the industry are either pure distractions or completely unworkable.  Those in the industry willingly spin the need for the book of quantum to reflect international norms.  They know well that the book of quantum is merely a factual record of awards given.  It cannot it be made fit a certain narrative because the industry is uncomfortable with the facts.  Most brazenly of all, the insurers are still not prepared to accept that they have been less than transparent.  Backroom deals, unrecorded awards and a lack of information to consumers suits only one side, namely, the insurers.  Expert after expert has homed in on the lack of data and transparency as the key to bringing down prices.  Home, flood and health insurance are all now rising beyond inflation.  Motor insurance in the State is compulsory for all drivers.  A private industry that is being investigated for anti-competitive practices cannot dismiss the anger relating to and the social and economic effects of their decisions and mistakes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#ZZ01100","speaker":"1372","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome the report and its recommendations.  The key issue now is in its implementation.  I do not know if the recommendations go far enough.  If we go to the bone on this issue, we know that it is compulsory to have motor insurance so what greater business is there to be in, selling a product which is compulsory for consumers to buy?  The insurers can name their price.  This, in my opinion, is the root of the problem.  As Senator Craughwell said, there is a cartel in operation.<\/p> <p>Much of the information that has come forward regarding databases and the lack of information is a fallacy.  The State has improved conditions for insurance companies hand over fist in recent times.  We introduced the penalty points system, which is a check-and-balance system for the insurance companies each year in respect of the renewal of insurance policies in the context of the quality of drivers.  This has not helped.  It should have been an ideal guide for the companies.  I do not believe that anybody would argue over an increase in cost of an insurance policy because of penalty points, etc.  This measure, however, has not had an effect.<\/p> <p>Over 40 years ago, we put people on the moon.  Today, a person cannot tax his or her car unless he or she quotes an insurance policy number.  Every car in the State is registered by vehicle registration so that a computer can tell us when our motor tax is due.  That computer can also tell if a person has not taxed his or her car and a red light goes on if the car is not taxed.  If it is taxed, then a person has an insurance policy number so that it is insured.  If it is taxed with an invalid insurance policy number, another red light should light up somewhere that this car is not insured.  All of these computers have the ability to talk to one another.  That is joined-up thinking.  As Senator Craughwell quite rightly stated, insurance companies are sharing information and have been doing so for a long time.  I shall give an example.  I am involved with the National Ploughing Association.  A man who was partaking bought an old second-hand tractor for competition ploughing in Northern Ireland.  It was never going to be on the road and was just for use in competitions on private lands.  He did not register the tractor in Ireland but he did obtain a third-party insurance policy for fear of injuring somebody during an event.  He received a letter from Revenue six months later saying that it knew he had the tractor and that it was not registered in Ireland.  Where did Revenue get that information?  It was because he insured the tractor.  Who was sharing that information and what database is there?  We need to dig much deeper into this matter.  There is nothing in the recommendations that would help to reduce the price of insurance for a young driver next year who may have been quoted up to &euro;5,000 for insurance cover on a car valued at &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000.  I do not see anything in the recommendations for that person.  The two figures quoted so far as the reasons for increases are an average breakdown of &euro;30 per policy for uninsured drivers and an average of &euro;50 for exorbitant claims.  That is &euro;80, which is 10% of an &euro;800 policy.  This would mean that a quotation on the same policy next year would be &euro;880 - not &euro;4,800.  While I welcome the recommendations, I would look monitor very closely how they are implemented and what results are forthcoming.  There is a lot more to be done to get to the root of the problem, which is cartel-driven pricing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#AAA00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and I congratulate him.

Despite competing commitments at home, I stayed on to contribute to this debate because I wanted to say this to the Minister of State and also because this issue is of huge importance to the people in the constituency in which I live, which does not have a rail service, just an effective bus route on the N3.  In most of County Cavan and County Monaghan, people have no alternative but to use their cars to go to work, school and on social outings.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The cost of motor insurance is more than a casual matter in that kind of environment.  I have a point that I might discuss privately with the Minister of State.  There has been a huge hike in public liability insurance for business people.  I came across a case of a small retailer where the cost increased from &euro;1,800 to &euro;3,300.  This is happening across the board.  That is not what we are here for.  We are here to discuss motor insurance.  I commend the Minister of State's work.<br\/><br\/>Of course, it is important to eliminate fraud.  The Minister of State has identified fraud as costing &euro;250 million per year, which is very significant.  As Senator Craughwell said, the core of a database does exist but a database of claims is critically important.  The insurance companies concede fraudulent small claims rather than confront them because of the cost of doing so.  It is cumulative.  The Minister of State will have to talk to the companies and they will have to stress test and challenge many claims for a while until the culture changes.  I know many cases of this.  I am aware of one scenario where a person puts in what can only be described as a spurious claim for tissue injury or minor injuries and that claim is conceded because it costs &euro;7,000 or &euro;8,000 to do so whereas it would cost far more to challenge it.  A figure of &euro;10,000 settles it and those instances of &euro;10,000 being paid accumulate.  Confrontation and stress testing are needed here.  I commend this course to the Minister of State to see what he can do in this respect.<br\/><br\/>It has been said earlier that settling on the court steps years after an accumulation of costs is not a satisfactory <i>modus operandi<\/i>and the Minister of State needs to deal with this.  The company either concedes early on or fights it to the very end.  This must happen.  If companies are serious about their contention that fraudulent claims are an issue, they must be consistent and stay with this.<br\/><br\/>The issue of uninsured drivers is significant.  It is a chicken and egg situation.  I can tell the Minister about many youngsters in my area who, sadly, are pushed into being uninsured drivers, a situation I do not condone, because of the gigantic cost of insured driving and the necessity of driving.  It is not an acceptable position but it is almost like the children in Fagin's group in <i>Oliver Twist<\/i>who steal.  They do not have another option in some instances but it is not acceptable.  We must look at the way we deal with uninsured drivers.  I take the Minister of State's point that technology should be fit to produce a consistent database.<br\/><br\/>The Central Bank needs to introduce more control.  I wonder whether insurance companies hold an awful lot of trophy offices in very upmarket parts of cities and towns, whether these companies are wasting money in other spheres and whether there is a lot of nonsense here.  The Central Bank has a role to play here.  I would like the Minister of State to challenge the insurance companies about where our money is going.  It is not just about fraudulent claims and uninsured drivers.<br\/><br\/>The question of legal fees obviously arises.  I know it has been said that they are not the factor they were thought to be but they must be a consideration and they need constant monitoring.  I commend what the Minister of State is doing.  He needs to keep battling in the areas of claims, the immediate concession of claims, uninsured drivers and the cost of claims.  It is a well-travelled area but it is important that this work is done.<br\/><br\/>I would welcome it if the Minister of State agreed to come to this House possibly three times a year to update us because this issue matters.  People want to know what we are doing about this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#AAA00300","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I raised this issue in the House with him a number of months ago.  We are very much aware that the spiralling cost of insurance is placing a massive burden on motorists.  I have been contacted by many people who are struggling to pay insurance premiums.  As Senator O'Reilly pointed out, it is an issue that disproportionately affects rural areas where people do not have the luxury or option of public transport and, as a result, owning a car to get to work and do one's business is a necessity.  We know premiums have risen by up to 50% in some cases over the past year, and there is potential for further rises as we move through 2017.<\/p> <p>I know the Minister of State has been working extremely hard on this issue.  It is very positive that we now have a report which seeks to provide clear recommendations on tackling the rising cost of motor insurance.  We hope the national claims database will add greater clarity to the level of claims throughout the country and shed light on an area about which we know very little.  We have figures from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, but there are questions that need to be answered by the insurance industry in terms of claims and settlements being made outside those structures.  The personal injuries commission will provide an enhanced level of guidance on compensation in personal injury cases.  As the Minister of State noted, the fact this grouping has met on two occasions and that it has an agreed action plan is very positive.  The working group has recommended the establishment of a fraud database.  This coupled with the new number plate recognition system will help to recognise uninsured drivers and tackle fraud, which is necessary.<\/p> <p>I wish to highlight the plight of farmers who are informing me about big increases in their premiums.  Some of them are quite significant - up to 30%.  They tell me that the increases are not based on extra claim costs or increased risks such as large numbers of machines or tractors.  Farmers and contractors with small and large operations are seeing increases.  Farmers are battling with tight margins so trying to meet these costs is very difficult.  We also know the potential challenges posed by Brexit, especially in the area of the movement of goods across the UK.  It is essential that our road haulage companies have access to insurance premiums comparable to our European partners.  Irish-registered haulage companies relocating to other countries to reduce their cost base mainly due to high insurance premiums is not in anybody's interest.  We must ensure we are as efficient as possible to deal with any challenges we may face in a post-Brexit era.<\/p> <p>That swift action has been taken is very positive.  We need to see greater affordability for consumers.  That must be our key priority, but most of all, in terms of tackling the rising cost of motor insurance, we need to see evidence on the ground of greater transparency and greater fairness.  As the Minister of State is aware, I will be keeping a very close eye on it.  We need to ensure we support people and to ensure insurance is affordable for them.  I thank the Minister of State for his time and work on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#BBB00200","speaker":"1415"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I compliment the very good work carried out by the working group on the cost of motor insurance and by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.

It is also fair to say that the rise in insurance premiums is proving to be a major challenge for many people, and in some cases the ability to meet those rising premiums is threatening livelihoods and jobs.

That increase is way in excess of EU trends.  From talking to people in the insurance industry I know that motor insurance premiums here were discounted during the past ten years.  That may have been done for competition purposes.  The motor insurance companies would say they did not make money from the motor insurance market.  I do not know what happened but motor insurance was priced as a loss leader and now insurance premiums are increasing.  I do not know if the Minister of State is aware that premiums were discounted and perhaps that was due to what happened with Quinn Direct or dash for cash operations, but insurance companies did not make money from motor insurance.  It is unfair that premiums have increased by 50%.<\/p><p>We must remember that under EU law the Government cannot mandate the setting of premium prices.  That is the remit of the insurance companies.  However, the State can play an important role in helping to stabilise this volatile market.  In that context, this has led to some worthy recommendations by the working group in its research in terms of improving data availability, improving the personal injuries claims environment, reducing the costs in the claims process and reducing insurance fraud and uninsured driving, and promoting road safety.  I am delighted the Garda traffic corps is being provided with vehicle recognition equipment.  Northern Ireland is years ahead of us in that respect.  There are still issues in certain sectors in terms of staged crashes.  I have heard anecdotal evidence that sometimes insurance companies do not challenge those involved as much as they should have and, unfortunately, that has put the burden of the high cost of insurance on young people, businesses and motorists throughout the country.<\/p><p>A key element in protecting the consumer is to ensure we have increased transparency.  We have engaged in much head scratching wondering how insurance companies' premiums have increased to such a high level but more transparency in how insurance companies calculate premiums would be welcome and would also allow the consumer to make a more informed choice.  Insurance companies should have told people their insurance products were priced as loss leaders for the past ten years, not that anybody would have believed them.  It is an issue with the premiums now having increased by 50% but that is their business.  Some of the evidence on the rise in premiums makes for horrifying reading.  The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland pays out up to &euro;60 million annually to meet claims involving uninsured drivers.  This is where vehicle recognition equipment comes into play and more Garda traffic corps vehicles need to be fitted with that equipment.  We did not move quickly enough to sort out this problem.  We must also address the issue of insurance fraud.<\/p><p>I echo the sentiments made by the Minister of State during a similar debate in the D&aacute;il last month.  He said that the work on tackling high insurance costs is about bringing stability to the market and delivering measures to ensure fair premiums for customers.  There is now a determination on the part of the Minister of State, the Government and all parties to implement long-term measures to protect the consumer, while ensuring we have a stable, transparent and competitive insurance sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#BBB00300","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and take this opportunity to compliment him on his work on this important project.  The cost of motor insurance has been a blight on many people.  As Senator Hopkins rightly stated, it is a tax on rural Ireland in many ways.  If one lives in rural Ireland, one's ability to get anywhere depends on travelling by car.  The unfortunate rise in motor insurance premiums in recent years has had an awful knock-on effect.  I welcome the approach being taken by the Minister of State and the working group's report.  This is the type of proactive step that we need to see from Government.<\/p> <p>One of the issues raised has been that of the number of uninsured drivers.  That is a major issue for us and for the State, as is the issue of how we can tackle the pay-out of nearly &euro;60 million on claims with respect to uninsured drivers.  There has been movement towards getting a process in place to deal with that issue.  That process will be one of the key issues, as will dealing with the issue of uninsured drivers.<\/p> <p>As much as we have seen an epidemic in the rise of premiums in the motor insurance industry, we have also seen insurance prices rise in other industries in recent months.  I spoke to a person involved in the retail industry in Clonakilty in west Cork only last week and that person saw public liability costs for a shop increase from &euro;8,500 up to &euro;14,500 in one year.  We are seeing that trend of rising insurance costs throughout the entire market.  <\/p> <p>Senator Hopkins rightly raised the issue of farmers and, in particular, contractors who have been hit with excessive increases in insurance costs.  Regular farmers who are not contractors have also been hit with such increases.  There is an epidemic in terms of the rise in insurance costs.  It will be a big challenge for us to deal with it and the way we deal with it will be the key issue.  We have to follow on from this report in that they will have to be a report on insurance costs being borne by the retail and agricultural industries.  We must examine how those industries have been affected by the exorbitant insurance price increases in recent months.  They are feeling the brunt of what motorists felt a few years ago.  We must work with the organisations affected in retail and agricultural industries in terms of preparing a report along the lines of the working group's report that has been published in order to move forward to stem that major increase in insurance prices.  Insurance costs will be a major issue in terms of their competitiveness and taking account of Brexit and other issues.  This issue is creating an insecurity in the market and we need to deal with it.  It will be a major challenge facing us in next few months.  I hope the Minister of State can examine the retail and agricultural industries and that we can act to stem the major increase in insurance costs in those industries.  If we can do that, hopefully, we can stabilise the insurance market in the country.<\/p> <p>Senator Feighan hit the nail on the head when he spoke about insurance products being priced as loss leaders.  They might have been priced as loss leaders but other industries are now picking up the tab for that and that will be a major issue.  We have to turn the screw to see what we can do to ensure we can protect those industries.<\/p> <p>I compliment the Minister of State on grasping the nettle on this issue.  It has been a tough year but he has made a great deal of progress.  It would be appropriate for him to make a progress report to the House on this work in a few months because we need to examine the entire industry to enable us to stem the unfortunate price increases we have seen in recent months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#CCC00200","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Our final speaker, as of now, is my fellow member of the joint committee, Senator Paddy Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#CCC00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to the House.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach examined this issue and prepared a report.  As a member of the Oireachtas committee that examined this issue, I learned of the many problems involved and it opened my eyes to the many issues that were raised at our committee meetings.<\/p> <p>Various representatives appeared before the joint committee.  I am sure the issues they highlighted have been raised before I spoke.  Representatives of the legal profession, insurance companies, road hauliers, vintners in Dublin and rural vintners appeared before the committee and it appeared that this issue was nobody's problem.  It is not the insurance companies' problem.  They have to increase premiums because they have lost money.  It is not the legal profession's problem.  They have not created an increase in insurance costs.  We heard that a new book of quantum was to come out and that it would be the be all and end all for claims, but that has not rectified the problem.<\/p> <p>Senator Hokpins is right in that rural people have suffered greatly as result of such increases.  The increases are putting an extra burden of cost on them.  Many households now need not one car but two cars.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Most families nowadays are a two-job household so they need two cars.  As each family now has to have different types of insurance, including house insurance, health insurance, car insurance, tractor insurance or public liability insurance, there are bigger and bigger burdens on families and all these insurance costs are increasing by the month.<\/p><p>There are one or two problems here.  The big problem is that there is not enough competition in the market.  We need to get more competition.  There are basically only six companies in motor and lorry insurance.  I was talking to a lady involved with the road hauliers today, who renewed her premiums last month for the next 12 months.  She has seen an increase of 300% on last year, which is outrageous.  She tells me that it is possible in Poland to buy a new lorry and to get four years' insurance at a fixed cost.  Were one to buy the same lorry in Ireland, the premium probably would go up by 50% or 100% next year, by another 100% the following year or perhaps by 300%, as happened to her and is probably happening to all hauliers.  It is making this country uncompetitive.  Our transport is mainly lorry transport, roll-on, roll-off, travelling through England or onto the Continent via the ferries in Cork and Rosslare.  These premiums are outrageous.  The hauliers can reflag in other countries if they want, at a much lower cost.  They spelled that out to us.  <\/p><p>There is not enough competition in the market.  Maybe there is a cartel there as well.  We cannot rule it out, given the limited options people have for their insurance.  While I welcome the Minister of State's speech today, this is a big problem which is not going to go away.  It is putting a huge burden on families and businesses.  In respect of commercial rates, there is a publican at home whose case I also highlighted at the committee meeting.  He is paying &euro;65,000 per annum for insurance for a small pub that does a little bit of food.  It is unsustainable.  It is worse than his rent, rates and all his other costs put together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#CCC00400","speaker":"1380","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Before I go back to the Minister of State, I would like to acknowledge that Eoin Hartnett, our policy adviser from the joint committee on finance, is in the Visitors Gallery.

I appreciate the opportunity to speak about the report and hear Senators' reflections on it, as well as what they are hearing from their constituents up and down the country.  A big part of how we were able to do the work was that people got in touch with their Deputies and Senators, who in turn got in touch with the working group or the committee to pass on the information we needed.  I thank those Deputies and Senators who fed that information through to us, as well as all the stakeholders who engaged with our working group and helped us put together the report.  I thank the working group itself, which is comprised of representatives from public agencies including the Central Bank, the State Claims Agency, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and various Departments.  The manner in which the work of the joint committee and the working group was done is a model for how the Government, Oireachtas and industry stakeholders can co-operate to get a meaningful outcome and a result that we can put into action and see delivered.  It also is part of keeping oversight over the Government to make sure we are living up to our commitments.<\/p> <p>These insurance increases of which we have been made well aware by people up and down the country and which we have experienced ourselves have undermined the personal gains people have made through wage increases or personal tax reductions as the economy has recovered.  They have also challenged competitiveness for businesses.  We need to keep a constant eye on our competitiveness to keep the economy fit, especially because of the Brexit challenges that are coming down the line.  We have moved from motor insurance, which was the first part of our work last year.  In our second phase we are looking at employer's liability, EL, and public liability, PL.  I will come back to that issue in more detail as Senator Lombard raised it specifically.  The reforms we brought in to the motor piece, particularly in respect of the Personal Injuries Commission, the transparency issue, and the stronger powers for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, will feed into EL, PL and other areas as well.<\/p> <p>The Acting Chairman, Senator Horkan's comments about transparency over claims and what we need in that regard hit the nail on the head.  The ability to negotiate is quite important.  We have to recognise that this is a market and, if they shop around, people will get a better deal.  One of the reforms in the action plan is to give more people time to shop around, as well as more information as to how their premium has been calculated and the reason for any increase that has been applied.  Consumers will then be better informed and better able to take advantage of the marketplace.  There are things we need to do to improve that marketplace and I will come back to them.  Senator Paddy Burke raised those issues.  <\/p> <p>On the public quantum, Senator Horkan is absolutely right that it is not and should not be a target for claims.  It is a historical reflection on claims that have been delivered.  That is why the work of the Personal Injuries Commission will be so important.  It is going to create that guide through the grading of different types of personal injury, the grading of whiplash and through the international benchmarking exercise it is going to carry out.  That will provide better information to guide the awarding of claims by the judiciary.  I thank the chairman of the Personal Injuries Commission for taking on this important piece of work.  He is very committed to it, as I know from my own interactions with him.  The terms of reference and timeline are given on page 100 of the report, as well as what they hope to achieve.<\/p> <p>The technology for tracking driving does exist.  The Port Tunnel in Dublin is going to have a camera at either end in order that one can tell the average speed through the tunnel.  People will be fined if they are seen to have breached that speed.  We can do that on parts of a motorway, for example, although a couple of refinements need to be taken on board.  There is no reason we should not be using technology to make our roads safer.  Road deaths are needless and we should do anything we can to prevent them from taking place. <\/p> <p>Regarding oversight of the implementation of the report, it is right that we put in place an action plan stating every single step.  It is right that we put in place the responsible actors for implementing those steps.  Too often in the past, when the Government has talked about doing something, we have not known who is responsible for achieving it.  It is right that I produce quarterly reports and attend the committee and this Chamber to be answerable on them.  The Oireachtas should play an oversight role for Government action.<\/p> <p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell talked about the 70% of claims over which we have no transparency.  That is a big problem.  How can we talk about what is actually happening and improve things in the future if we do not know what 70% of the claims environment looks like?  It was a key point in the joint committee's report, which focused on the transparency issue and made its importance quite clear.  The joint committee was able to do in public what we were doing in private as a working group.  It explained to the public what are the different problems, took away some of the cobwebs, demystified the issues and showed that it is a complex area in which the problems cannot be solved overnight.  That was very helpful.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Donnell puts a very high value on empirical evidence, and he is right to do so.  We have to be driven by the data, which lead us to where the actual problems are.  We must not be taken in by false narratives that are put out into the public domain, which would take us down blind alleyways and away from where we need to go.  As for the book of quantum, the Judiciary has an important role in this regard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In other jurisdictions they publish their own version of the book of quantum.  What we are hoping to do through the personal injuries commission and through the greater powers that we are going to give the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, is that we can get their joint work together on a more formal footing with the Judiciary.  That is key.  That is the ambition that is in the report.<\/p><p>A number of Senators raised the issue of cartels.  This is being worked at but not by the Department of Finance, it is not its responsibility.  That work is separate to mine, but I have raised my own concerns with the Competition Authority during the process last year.  The example which Senator O'Donnell gave sounds like something that might be for the declined cases process.  There is a section in the report which speaks to reforming that process by making it more transparent, more understandable and more accessible to consumers.  <\/p><p>We ought to be mindful as we seek to reform the market and bring in new transparency measures that we do not bring about anything which might lead to price signalling or price fixing in the market.  We have to recognise that these are individual companies which are competing in a market and we would not want to unwittingly help them to do something that they should not do through our own desire and zeal for reform.  <\/p><p>It is important to note that premiums were too low in this country.  They were unsustainably low.  In recent times we have also seen an unusual situation where there have been negative yields for investment companies which has affected their model.  It is important that we recognise that, as we seek to reform the insurance market and bring about fairer premiums for consumers, we will not go back to the very cheap premiums that we saw in the past because they were not sustainable.  <\/p><p>Senator Craughwell asked about the sharing of data publicly and how easy that should be.  He is absolutely correct.  Insurance companies collect a huge amount of data in a very professional way.  As we seek to put in place a national claims information database to be held by the Central Bank, we have to be mindful, first, that we do not get in the way of any data protection laws which might undermine that database once it was in place but, second, that companies define data in different ways.  They define incidents, cases and claims in different ways so we need to come to a single understanding in order to interpret that data so we can collate it and decide what the parameters are.  That work is already under way but it needs to be done before the database is up and running. For uninsured driving in the third quarter of this year, the uninsured drivers' database will go live for use.  Having that in place early will be a very important achievement.  <\/p><p>There is a long tail in the legal process and the claims process.  If we can make the Personal Injuries Assessment Board stronger, so that fewer cases fall out of it, if we can have things like pre-action protocols in place that will keep more cases from getting to the steps of the court or getting to a litigation phase, that would be beneficial to shortening that process.  In addition, if we are able to get greater consistency over awards - which is why the work of the personal injuries commission is so important - we should be able to shorten that process.  It would also help us tackle those exaggerated or fraudulent claims which increase the cost to all of us who drive.  <\/p><p>The goals of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board are: to increase the percentage of cases that remain within it; to make it quicker for the claimant, where there is a genuine and legitimate claim; to make it fairer for both sides in the process; to eliminate fraud; and make it cheaper for all drivers.  The quicker a fair claim is settled in a fair way for the claimant, the less of a cost there is for the insurance company and the less of a cost there is for all of us who drive.  <\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised concerns about first responders.  I am aware of this concern and understand the difficulties that some of them are facing in this area.  I know from the insurance agencies that they are weighing this as a higher risk considering some of the duties that may be performed as a first responder, such as the need for haste, and locations in the country and we need to be mindful that insurance companies must price their premiums based on the risk as they assess them.  As Senator Feighan pointed out, the Government cannot interfere in the pricing of insurance products because it is against EU law.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield spoke about the action plan.  It is important to stress that there are timelines and designated actions to designated Departments and agencies.  They have their responsibilities and we are already reporting on those actions.  Very recently, perhaps in the last couple of weeks, following its appearance at the joint committee, the Department published an update on what has already taken place and what we are already doing.  This is ahead of the quarterly reports.  I wanted to be clear to the committee that work has already begun and I am committed to making sure that work is done in accordance with the timelines set out in the report.  <\/p><p>Of course the insurance industry has a role.  I am not going to let anyone off the hook in that regard.  It is not a case of me saying to the insurance industry that I trust it to go ahead and put all of these reforms in place.  It is a piece of this, one stakeholder among others.  It is right that the Department of Finance, in the role that I have had chairing that working group across government, has identified the right reforms, who is responsible for implementing some of them and that we now drive those reforms according to the timeline that we have.  It is not about defending the industry or letting it off the hook in any regard.  We have put it at the centre of this initiative.  It is responsible for reforming itself and we will play the oversight role, with the help of the Oireachtas and with the joint committee to make sure it does so.  <\/p><p>Senator Warfield raised the issue of the formula.  This also came up in the joint committee and I told it then that it was under consideration.  We know it works in other jurisdictions and I have an obligation to examine things where they work.  I also understand the risks that are in place and we will not move quickly on this.  We will make sure that we are aware of all the concerns and we can have a proper debate in the D&aacute;il if we are to move to this new type of model for funding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's detection of fraud.  <\/p><p>Senator Daly raised a key issue in all of these things which is implementation.  There is no point in producing a report and letting it sit on the shelf.  A year later, when people ask what has been done, the Minister replies that it has been a bit of this and a bit of that.  That is why we have gone with this action plan model and have laid it out very precisely.  Someone said that 71 actions is too many, but if one takes some of those actions, seven or eight relate to one particular thing, one key priority that we wish to achieve.  The reason there are seven or eight actions is to show the exact steps so that if we miss a step, Senators can pull me in here and ask what is happening and why there is a delay. This is to avoid us missing it and six months down the line, I might say that four months ago there was a problem and I am sorry that I did not tell Senators about it then.  This means that Senators can better hold me to account and it makes sure that I can get my work done to the standard that there should be in government, which is transparency and accountability over the work as it does it.  <\/p><p>Do the recommendations go far enough?  There is a suggestion that the compulsory element of motor insurance makes it a great market to be in.  We know from the data, that most insurance companies and their motor sections, have not been recording profits in recent years.  It has not been a great market for them.  In addition, if it is such a great market, why is there not more competition, particularly in certain sub-sectors to which other Senators have alluded?   There have been suggestions of a cartel and I cannot comment on that.  However, the more data we have and the more transparent that data, that will let us know exactly how good a market it is and will prevent companies - or as some people here are suggesting the industry - from being able to protect itself from proper scrutiny and we can get a proper understanding of just how healthy the market is.  That is something that we do not have at the moment.  <\/p><p>Our reforms will bring those databases together.  Some databases talk to each other, others do not.  Some companies in the industry consult databases, others do not.  We must make sharing of data and the linkage of databases compulsory.  The master licence record, which we are now expediting, will be key to this.  All this information will be joined up and identified with one single number for one driver so it is possible to see what the situation is for drivers regarding their insurance, tax, road history and what car they are licensed to drive.  That is very important when we look at the commercial side of this, with companies operating fleets.  <\/p><p>Young drivers are a very difficult element.  Insurance companies will explain that they assess them as a higher risk and therefore there is a higher amount to be paid out.  If one looks at areas where there are not strong transport links, say in rural areas, and Senator Hopkins has spoken of her own constituency, a car is essential to young drivers as they become adults so they can go about their adult lives.  The intention is that the general reforms will help those younger drivers.  When we look at the declined cases agreements, and the reforms we want to introduce, those will help young drivers.  Telematics will help them.  Some insurance companies are using telematics in cars to help deliver lower premiums for young drivers.  I want to see every company do that.  I want to see young drivers taking those telematics on board to help get themselves lower premiums but it is not just a money issue when people are driving.  As new drivers come onto the roads, they will help them drive more safely.  Any death on the road is a needless death.  It does not need to happen and we are doing everything we can to prevent such deaths.<\/p><p>Senator Reilly spoke about drivers in rural constituencies and the difficulties that they, in particular, are having with premiums which are unaffordable.  It is not a casual matter.  This is a necessity and it is essential that we bring about these reforms to make sure that the insurance market is not pricing people off the road who need to be on the road.  Unfortunately, the evidence suggests that there has been an increase in uninsured driving.  It can only be related in one part to the fact that premiums are becoming so unaffordable in certain parts of the country.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator James Reilly raised the issue of public liability insurance.  As I referenced, that is the thread on which we are working.  When we looked at the fraud database<b><\/b>we wanted to put in place, we looked at a number of markets and models.  There is a claims underwriting exchange in the United Kingdom and it is the preferred model.  The insurance industry is to pay for this database which will be held by an independent body.  The key piece in getting it in place is data protection which is becoming more and more important as more and more data are digitised and put online.  When we have the fraud database in place, we will have to make sure no one will appear on it by accident because that would be defamatory and we would face legal cases.  It could risk several years work being shut down because we had moved too quickly and infringed on a person's rights.  We have to get it right, but we are going to do it in the two-year timeframe outlined in the report.<br\/><br\/>We need to remove the incentive for insurance companies to settle claims early.  Insurance companies talk about there being an economic incentive to settle a claim early, even when they think it might be suspicious.  I spoke about this matter earlier.  The reforms mentioned in the report will help in this regard.  We are also going to make it mandatory for insurers to consult policyholders before they settle a claim.  Too often we have heard from constituents and citizens how something innocuous in a carpark later led to money being paid out by an insurance company without consultation with the policyholder.  That is not fair; the policyholder needs to be consulted.  By strengthening the PIAB, bring forward pre-action protocols and bringing about consistency in the awards given, it will shorten the process.  <br\/><br\/>I spoke about uninsured driving, a matter raised by Senator James Reilly.  The database will go live in the third quarter of this year.  The Senator spoke about fees, legal and non-legal.  They are a consideration.  We are will keep looking at this issue and reviewing the position until the work is done.  As I said, we are in the second phase of our work, looking at employer's and public liability insurance, but we are driving on with implementation of the first piece of our work, the motor insurance piece.  As we do so, we are finding new reforms that we want to put in place.  Later in the year we will publish the addendum to the motor insurance report, the report on employer's and public liability insurance<b>, <\/b>and will be making a couple of changes to the motor insurance piece to include further reforms that we consider necessary and helpful to the market.<br\/><br\/>Senator Maura Hopkins has been absolutely dogged in her pursuit of this issue, as others in this House have been.  I compliment her on her work.  Not only has she raised the issue publicly, but she has also been in contact with me privately on a number of occasions to see how she can help and what work is being done.  That kind of help from Senators is very welcome.  The Senator is right to point out that there will be premium rises for some consumers this year.  There is no point in trying to fool people.  This problem will not be fixed overnight, but we are working day and night to fix it.  However, in the course of this year people will see their premiums going up and we need to be honest with them.  It is important that those of us who have worked for so long on this issue and know of its complexity be honest with people.  We are moving to fix this problem for them, but it will take a little more time.  The national claims information database will answer many of the questions concerning the 70% of claims mentioned by Senators Maura Hopkins and Kieran O'Donnell in terms of what is happening in the claims environment.  That will help to improve our understanding of how we need to tackle the issue further into the future.  As pointed out, the personal injuries commission is a vital piece of the puzzle.  I refer Members to page 100 of the report which includes the terms of reference and the timeline involved.  People will see exactly what it is to achieve.  I have spoken to the chairperson who is absolutely committed to getting things done quickly.  <br\/><br\/>We are, as I said, looking at employer's and public liability insurance.  As I have not yet met any representative from the farming community, if the Senator can help to identify the best people to whom to talk, I will meet them immediately.  Today I met representatives of business groups, individual businesses in the entertainment industry and the Vintners Federation of Ireland.  We had another working group meeting this week when we heard presentations by representative bodies.  As new concerns are raised with me, I need to meet the people concerned in order that we drill down into their data to gain an understanding of their concerns.  I would appreciate it if the Senator shared the names with me.  <br\/><br\/>I have met the representatives of hauliers.  They appeared in front of the joint committee and we are aware of their concerns.  It is a very challenging environment for them and it will be made even more challenging by the Brexit dimension.  The changes they want to see made in the market can only be made at a European level, but I have made a commitment that we will raise the issue at a European level to see if we can achieve some consensus on the insurance piece.  There is an insurance single market.  Insurance companies based in other jurisdictions can operate here on a freedom of enterprise or fservice basis, but they can only do so if they are willing to register and contribute.  That is the key piece.  They can operate here, but they need to make sure they operate to what the courts have determined in terms of their obligations.  They have several concerns about companies flying under a different flag to avail of the offerings of insurance companies in other jurisdictions.  This something we will have to raise at a European level.<br\/><br\/>Senator Frrank Feighan spoke about livelihoods and jobs and how they were being threatened.  It is very important that we work together to tackle this issue.  We need to work together on the legislation that will be brought forward this year as part of our work in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to fast-track it and make sure it will come through without unnecessary delays.  <br\/><br\/>The Senator is absolutely right when he talks about the massive correction in prices we are seeing.  What we are talking about are super cycles in the insurance industry which are incredibly damaging, not just for the industry - one might say damage to the industry is the least of our worries - but also for consumers.  Yes, they avail of lower premiums, which is very helpful when it happens, but that is no good to anyone if we are to see a 50%, 60% or 70% hike in premiums in a very short period of time.  There are a number of reasons we seem to have super cycles.  As they are listed in the report, I will not go into them.  Solvency II is one of the reforms on the back of the financial crisis.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell is nodding; he knows all about Solvency II<b>. <\/b>It is to help to protect us from super cycles, but the reforms mentioned will protect us too.  If they are introduced, we will not be back to paying insurance premiums of &euro;150 or &euro;200, which would not cover the cost of replacing a windshield.  That will not happen and we need to be realistic on that front.<br\/><br\/>We are almost there on the introduction of automatic number plate recognition technology, while the uninsured driver database will go live in the third quarter.  That is very important.  We are behind in how we use technology in tackling these issues, but the changes will come quickly now because there is a commitment from the industry to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department.  <br\/><br\/>We have been working for over one year to reform the insurance sector.  The working group I chair was set up last June.  I was asked to chair it by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the first piece of work was the compensation framework which needed to be addressed to deal with company failures, which  impact on all drivers because premiums are weighted with levies<b>.  <\/b>We needed to make sure there was a proper compensation framework in place.  That work has been complicated by an ongoing dispute in the courts, but progress has been made with the insurance industry on how we might bring certainty to what the compensation framework should be.  Once that piece of work was completed early last year, we had to look at the issue of flood insurance because of the experiences of people last year, in particular.  It was very important that that piece of work be completed and it was completed under the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney.  We were then able to move to the non-life sector.  The working group was set up and we decided to prioritise motor insurance because the issue was affecting everyone.  We are now moving to consider employer's and public liability insurance which is very important to business.  <br\/><br\/>Senator Tim Lombard spoke about this being a tax on rural Ireland.  It is very interesting that he put it that way because some of the suggestions from other parties which might be considered to be on the left of the spectrum would involve the State getting involved in providing insurance cover.  The models I have seen where the state provides insurance cover operate by means of an increase in the price of petrol to cover insurance costs.  I understand that the more one drives, the more one will pay.  That is not a fair way to do it, particularly if one is living in parts of the country where the public transport network is not good and one has to travel long distances to work.  That is why I am not in favour of the public models suggested, but we are continuing to look into the matter because I want to make sure we have not missed anything.  <br\/><br\/>The Senator also raised the issue of uninsured driving.  It is incredibly important and we are moving to address it. <br\/><br\/>To explain what is happening on employer's and public liability insurance, we finalised a report on motor insurance at the end of last year.  We moved to publish it once I was able to bring it to the Cabinet at its first meeting this year.  We have begun with the working group to work on the terms of reference for the employer's and public liability insurance piece.  We have engaged with a number of stakeholders which have been giving us very helpful information on what they are experiencing as employers.  Most of the work done so far has been on public rather than employer's liability insurance.  Earlier this week we heard about businesses such as pubs and hotels that might have hosted birthday parties or wedding receptions but which are now finding it impossible to get insurance cover at a price they can afford to continue to offer these services.  They have to take out that piece of the business offering and in so doing are undermining their business as a whole.  That is something we really need to address.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When we have finished this phase of our work, which will be in the next couple of months, and once I am clear I have identified everyone I need to talk to, we will produce an addendum to this report.  We will then probably reproduce the documents as one final report because there are a couple of changes I want to make to the motor section also.  I hope that work can be completed by this summer.  That is the timeframe we are working to.  The work on the personal injuries commission and national claims information database has already commenced.  All that will help because it is not particular to the motoring aspect; it is particular to data, injuries and everything else.  The report being called for will come.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their support and kind comments.  It is helpful when we can work together.  They are absolutely right to talk about Brexit and competitiveness.  That is key.  When in Canada as part of the Government mission around St. Patrick's Day, I was talking to people who wanted to return home and who have seen the improvements and the jobs that exist.  The jobs are not just in Dublin but also around the country.  The people are considering factors such as the cost of motor insurance and asking whether their no-claims history will be recognised and whether the fact that they have a licence and have been driving in Canada will be recognised.  It is a concern for them and absolutely needs to be tackled.  Where people want to return home to work, live in a community, play on the local sports team and bring life back to our communities, we need to ensure factors such as the cost of motor insurance are not stepping in their way.  This would be a really stupid thing - sorry, I cannot find a better word - to let get in the way of people who want to return home and make a positive contribution to their community once again.<\/p><p>Senator Paddy Burke referred to the amount of time the joint committee spent on this issue.  The public nature of the joint committee's engagement was very helpful in promoting public understanding of what the real issues are.  It has helped in trying to end the blame game we saw.  It is in no one's interest to have people in different parts of this industry and market going on air and publicly blaming one another at every opportunity.  We need to find the solutions for the future and drive those forward.  The committee's work was very helpful in that regard.  It was also very helpful in making us realise this is not a simple issue.  It is a complex issue and there is no silver bullet.  As the joint committee's report stated, along with the working group's report, there is a suite of reforms that need to be implemented.  Implementation takes time but as long as we are working together and there was oversight of both sides of the process, we can get it done.<\/p><p>The Senator is absolutely correct about insurance and how it is being viewed at the moment.  Insurance used to be seen as a necessary protection, be it for a business or a driver.  Now the insured is regarded as a target that encourages one to make a claim.  We need to move away from that kind of environment and culture completely.  We need a more transparent, stable and competitive market.  I agree with all the sentiments in that regard.<\/p><p>The Senator raised the issue of hauliers.  I am aware of his concerns, which he raised in the past.  The hauliers are looking for change.  We are trying to work with them to find the means of effecting the necessary change.  The difficulty is that the change they seek in many areas regarding insurance is change that requires consensus at European level.  Everyone knows consensus-building at European level takes time.  That said, the other reforms we are implementing should have a positive impact for the hauliers as they seek insurance in the future.<\/p><p>The Senator raised the issue of cartels.  That is not a matter for which my office has responsibility but we are aware the matter is being considered.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their engagement this evening.  I am more than willing to come into the Chamber to go through each quarterly report with Members as it is published.  This is to hold the Government to account and make sure we are getting this work done in the interest of citizens and consumers throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032200002#DDD00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490178600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his very comprehensive response.
