Prior to the examination, the Central Bank ensured a further 7,100 cases involving tracker mortgage issues were rectified and remedied.<\/p>  <p>  Given the size and complexity of the task, the system-wide examination is taking time to complete.  The Central Bank has advised that lenders are at varying stages of the process and that they are being challenged by the bank where the Central Bank is not satisfied with their reviews or redress and compensation proposals.  All relevant lenders have now provided phase two reports to the Central Bank.  However, the Central Bank's assurance work is ongoing and it is expected that additional accounts will be identified as this work progresses.  As the Deputies will be aware, since last month's Central Bank update, Bank of Ireland has now agreed to include 6,000 additional accounts within the scope of the tracker compensation scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Some lenders have commenced payment of redress and compensation to impacted customers, and the Central Bank expects that all remaining lenders will have implemented their redress and compensation programmes by the end of the year, with the majority of impacted customers receiving their redress and compensation by then.  The Central Bank's priority continues to be to ensure that lenders identify all customers affected by their unacceptable failings and that they pay appropriate redress and compensation.  The Central Bank will continue to pursue lenders accordingly, in line with the framework of the examination.  The timing has not changed.

For Ulster Bank, it is 12% for non-arrears and 13.5% to 20% for those in arrears.  Permanent TSB seems to be in the region of 10%.  My view is that the question of compensation should be entirely removed from the banks, and if that cannot be done on a mandatory basis then it should be done on a voluntary basis.  There is no consistency.  In instances where the harm is broadly the same, the compensation should be broadly the same, but it is not.  It can vary by two to three times.

This is why we have taken forward the class-action legislation.<\/p>  <p>  On a separate matter, I have brought to the attention of the Central Bank that it was a policy of Bank of Ireland, where customers with tracker mortgages sought to restructure loans, to add 1% to the tracker mortgage rate as part of the restructuring.  I teased this out with the Minister in parliamentary questions over the past week or so.  The answer obtained, through the Central Bank, was that this is not allowed unless it is the only viable option for the customer.  The matter would have to be dealt with individually, and each individual would have to deem it the appropriate action.  My information, which I have on good authority, is that what I describe was policy and standard practice within the bank.  It was absolutely wrong, therefore.  The Central Bank was not aware of this.  I am following this up with it.  I ask the Minister, on behalf of those customers whose mortgages were restructured and who had an additional 1% added to their tracker mortgage rates as a result, to take up this issue now instead of having to deal with it six or nine months down the line when we eventually force action on this matter.

As the company was incorporated in Malta, liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 25 May 2017 and overturned the previous decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, was liable in respect of third-party motor insurance claims made against the policyholders of Setanta Insurance.  The consequence of this is that the insurance compensation fund, ICF, has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third-party claims.  As a result, the industry has no liability for the residual claims outstanding following the liquidation.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the actuarial report on the liquidation of Setanta, the Deputy should note that it was the liquidator who commissioned actuarial consultants, Willis Towers Watson, to carry out an analysis of Setanta Insurance's claims reserves as at 30 June 2017.  The liquidator sought this report for the purposes of internal management reporting and to assist in determining the potential shortfall in assets available to cover the remaining liabilities as part of the liquidation process.  The contents of the report are commercially-sensitive in nature and were provided to me solely for the purposes of assessing the likely shortfall in the amount due to Setanta third-party claimants.  Consequently, I am not in a position to publish the report.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, as indicated previously, there is a legal concern that any Government intervention to fully compensate third-party claimants and then step into the shoes of these claimants to recover directly any balance due from the Setanta liquidation could result in the Government having a lower status in the creditor hierarchy and, thus, significantly reduce the amount it could recoup from the liquidator.

An economic rationale for this stamp duty increase was published on budget day.  On the recommendation of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I also announced an extension of consanguinity relief for a further three years and that the stamp duty rate applying under the scheme would be fixed at 1%.  Consanguinity relief is availed of in transferring farms to younger family members.  It encourages the early transfer of farms to younger generations and is mostly relevant where the transferee does not qualify for an alternative relief such as the young trained farmer stamp duty exemption.<\/p> <p> Following my Budget Statement I received correspondence from farming interests on a number of issues, including stamp duty.  Following further discussions with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine I decided that, in addition to extending the period of the relief and fixing the associated stamp duty rate at 1%, the age rule for consanguinity relief would be removed.  This means that it will be possible for all gifts and sales of farmlands to closely related family members who do not qualify for the 100% exemption available under the young trained farmer scheme to benefit from consanguinity relief at a stamp duty rate of 1%.<\/p> <p> The question of an age limit will be revisited when the measure comes up for review towards the end of 2020.  The young trained farmer relief will not be affected by the stamp duty rate change, as it provides for a full stamp duty exemption where the qualifying criteria are met.<\/p> <p> I have also responded to representations from the Deputy and other Deputies and reintroduced a scheme that allows a farmer to claim relief from stamp duty where he or she sells and purchases land for the purposes of consolidating an existing farm holding.  I have introduced these various reliefs in the expectation that they will be of benefit to the agriculture sector and in recognition of the importance of agriculture and the wider rural economy generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000005#C01300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512039600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I appreciate the move the Minister made after the budget Statement, having been contacted by many Deputies and farming organisations.

Dr. Thornhill made a number of recommendations in his report.  His central recommendation was for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by the Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historical yield.  This, in turn, would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and their application by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust the rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.<\/p>  <p>  The new system was recommended by Dr. Thornhill, with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.  The previous Minister for Finance subsequently proposed to the Government that the revaluation date for local property tax be postponed from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement meant that home owners were not faced with significant increases in their local property tax in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gives sufficient time for the other recommendations made in Dr. Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the Government.<\/p><p> The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gave effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes and also to two of the recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and for those occupied by persons with disabilities.<\/p> <p> I have consistently stated that my Department will consider issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Thornhill report in line with the 2019 timeline. The Government will make its position clear so that households will know well advance what are its plans for LPT.  In that regard, it is very important that the principle that formed a central part of the terms of reference for the 2015 review of LPT, that is, achieving relative stability in LPT payments of liable persons over both the short and long term, will inform our consideration of the matter.<\/p> <p> My Department will consider work on this matter in the new year in conjunction with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000006#D01800","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512040200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The Minister is indicating that the baselines will not be considered.

I appreciate the point on the amount that is retained and I have done quite an amount of work in seeking to understand the issue and the process behind the amount that goes into the equalisation fund.  As regards the self-funding element, in 2016, for example, there was &euro;108 million involved in self-funding, &euro;85 million of which came from Dublin.  That amount will increase because the Minister has not changed the baseline rates and is not counting new needs due to population changes.  Why do we have a census of the population?  Why do we advertise that a census is to be carried out because we want to decide where services are needed and yet the Minister does not factor that into the methodology of deciding where resources are allocated?  There is no doubt that there are new needs in places with increased populations.  There must be a way of building that into the system or there is a fundamental unfairness therein.

My objective is to ensure stability in regard to the LPT such that people know what their future liabilities will be and that organisations such as local authorities that are dependent on the LPT and the payments that come from it via the equalisation fund will know where they stand.  It is worth acknowledging that, to date, seven local authorities have voted to increase LPT and four have sought to reduce it.  The current broad trend is that more local authorities are deciding to increase the tax than seeking to cut it.

His broker told him that he could not get it any cheaper with the company.  He then went to a different broker who contacted the same company and was quoted the original price.  I cannot explain it.  When I put the case to the insurance companies and asked them to explain it, they were unable to do so.  There is an inconsistency which is creating a difficulty and adding to insurance costs.

When the capital allowances were introduced, to ensure that a measure of tax remained in charge annually, a restriction was provided to cap the amount of income that the allowances could be used against in any year at 80%.  The restriction did not deny the use of the capital allowances.  It merely lengthened the period over which they could be utilised.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is not unique in providing capital allowances for intangible assets and the tax treatment of intangible assets is similar to the approach taken in other countries, such as the UK and the US.  In the Finance Act 2014, the cap of 80% was increased to 100%, effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015.  The rationale for increasing the cap was to bring the tax treatment of intangible assets into line with the tax treatment of similar assets in other jurisdictions.  The change also ensured that the treatment of intangible assets was in line with the treatment of other capital assets in our tax code.  Noting a significant increase in the use of the capital allowances in 2015, the Coffey review recommended that to ensure some smoothing of corporation tax revenue over time, the 80% cap be restored.  The cap does not affect the overall capital allowances available but merely lengthens the timeframe over which they can be used.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding meetings, my officials and I meet a range of organisations and individuals regularly and I note that this subject was discussed at length on Committee and Report Stages of the Finance Bill.  As I noted on those occasions, as part of regular pre-budget meetings, I met with the American Chamber of Commerce but the subject of capital allowances for intangible assets was not discussed.  I did, however, have many meetings with my officials on this and other policy choices.  On the basis of these discussions, I implemented the recommendation of the Coffey review and re-introduced the 80% cap to capital expenditure incurred from budget night. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding meetings held at the time of the 2014 change, I gave an undertaking on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill to ask my Department to review its records from that time to establish the position with regard to that period.

Mr. Coffey said that if one ensured that all claims for this allowance was under the 80% regime, we would have an extra &euro;1 billion next year.  In 2015, a window was opened, through which Apple jumped, using Jersey and Ireland.  This was conveniently opened that year by the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan.  We need to know what lobbying took place, what discussions were undertaken and what the rationale was for increasing that allowance in 2015.

That is exactly what happened.  The Government was warned about it.  The Minister acts as though he is some sort of innocent and Apple got the better of him, but the change that the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, made in that budget resulted in them avoiding billions of tax, just as I said it would at the committee meeting.  The mechanism through which they did this has now been revealed in the Paradise Papers.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, met the CEO of Apple earlier that year, as did the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and in the 2015 budget which was presented in October 2014, the change was included which opened the window for this tax avoidance scheme.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that he did not know this would be the result, and that conveniently Apple would be allowed to onshore billions of euro of assets and, as S&eacute;amus Coffey pointed out, not pay any extra tax at all even though the profits in that year jumped by approximately &euro;50 billion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000011#J01100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1512043200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I have outlined to the Deputy the reason those changes were made.

As Fine Gael Deputies are willing to admit away from the microphones, the resignation of the former T&aacute;naiste was more than justified by the failure to acknowledge repeated briefings, the provision of misleading information and the detached attitude to vindicating the rights of a grievously-wronged citizen at a critical moment.

During the talks, the Taoiseach's predecessor promised us that there would be a huge change, a sea change, at administration level and in the public and Civil Service as a result of the election.  Sadly, that has not happened.  It has to happen.  This whole debacle, the Taoiseach's own admissions and those of the Minister for Justice and Equality yesterday, have made it blatantly clear that all is not well in the Department of Justice and Equality.  All is not well in many Departments.

We will be holding the new Ministers to account on many issues.  Above all, we must get the whole sea change, or at least some kind of a change, in the attitude of the public service.  There are thousands and thousands of excellent public servants, but when it gets to the top it seems that people are very powerful and very indifferent to Ministers, who are held accountable by the electorate.  If we cannot change the attitude, we will have to insist that the Secretary Generals be elected by the people.  They have to be held accountable in some shape, make or form.

The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, should work with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, to turn that report into a reality.

I am sure he is aware of the pressures on farming family incomes and the various challenges facing the sector not only because of the inclement weather over the course of the past year, with a fodder crisis facing many farmers in particular parts of the country, but also as a consequences of developments internationally, including the threat posed by the current Commission negotiations with the South American beef-producing countries in Mercosur and the very real challenges posed by Brexit.<\/p> <p> The particular issues I wish to focus on today are the communiqu&eacute; published yesterday on the post-2020 future of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP and, second, the question of spending under the current CAP programme until 2020.  Fianna F&aacute;il very much welcomes the communiqu&eacute; in many of its aspects, particularly the focus on small and medium-sized family farms and the agreement that the reduction in the maximum payment under the basic payment scheme will not happen until after 2020.  However, the key focus when considering the future of CAP must be on its budget.  Will the Government ensure every effort is made to protect the CAP budget post-2020, given that it makes up 75% of average Irish farm incomes?  In addition, will the Government undertake to ensure direct contributions are increased in order to achieve that objective?<\/p> <p> In regard to spending under the current CAP programme, the Government is clearly failing to live up to the promises that were made, including by the T&aacute;naiste when he was Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  During his tenure in that office, he gave a clear undertaking that &euro;1.4 billion would be spent on the various schemes, including, for example, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, an announcement that was welcomed by all the farming organisations.  However, replies to parliamentary questions I have submitted in recent weeks and months indicate that by the end of 2021, when all participants in GLAS have been paid the full amounts owing to them, just over &euro;1 billion will have been spent on the programme, which is &euro;380 million less than what the T&aacute;naiste, as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, promised the expenditure would be.  Those outstanding moneys should be directed towards reopening GLAS, providing additional funding for the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme, and bringing the suckler cow payment under the beef genomics and data programme, BGDP, up to &euro;200.<\/p> <p> Will the T&aacute;naiste address these two points in his reply, namely, the future of CAP funding and, second, the failure of the Government to live up to its standing commitments under the various schemes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000015#N00200","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512045300,"counter":157,"content":"<p>It is good to have an opportunity once again to talk about agriculture.  In regard to the future of CAP, the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan, has managed this issue in a way that is politically intelligent.  He has already launched a document on the future of CAP, which will allow us to have that discussion early in the context of the negotiation that will undoubtedly take place around the multi-annual financial framework for the EU budget post-2020.  This affords us an opportunity to address, at an early stage, the need to prioritise CAP.<\/p>  <p>  Payments under the Common Agricultural Policy contribute hugely to the economy, with the current round representing some &euro;12 billion in payments to Irish farming families over its lifetime.  That is broken down into direct payments and payments under the various rural development schemes, some of which the Deputy mentioned.  The last round of CAP facilitated a very ambitious transformation of agriculture in Ireland in terms of recognising environmental responsibilities, improving technology within the sector, and exploiting the extraordinary and sustainable opportunities in this country for growth and expansion in agriculture and farming generally.  We want to continue that progress into the next round of CAP.  We have an Irish Commissioner who understands that thinking, but it will be up to the Government to form alliances across the European Union with other countries which value and prioritise the supports that allow us to have a sustainable and growing food sector and to support farming families into the future.  That is partially a job for me as well as being a job for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and, at the highest level of EU summits and so on, a job for the Taoiseach.  We must seek to focus on how money will be spent in the future, particularly given the significant reduction in available EU funds that will arise due to the departure of the United Kingdom.  Brexit is estimated to create a shortfall in funding of between &euro;12 billion to &euro;14 billion per year, which is one of the pressing reasons that agriculture and the future CAP must be prioritised from our perspective.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the domestic delivery of particular schemes, I can get back to the Deputy if he has specific questions.

That solution is for the North to be granted designated status, or whatever term is used.

I shall first turn to the veto issue.  The talk of whether or not Ireland uses a veto misunderstands the reality we currently find ourselves in.  There is very strong solidarity across the European Union between 27 countries, including Ireland, around what is required to allow this process to move on to opening up phase two, which is about future relationships, trade and transition arrangement etc.  The idea of whether or not Ireland will stand alone and use its veto actually misunderstands the fact that we are standing with another 26 countries at the moment.  Yesterday I spoke with the German foreign minister who reconfirmed that position.  I also spoke with the Luxembourg foreign minister who reconfirmed that position.  When I represented the Taoiseach in Brussels last week I got that point reinforced to me, very strongly.  I spent over an hour with Michel Barnier last week who also said that the EU's challenge is Ireland's challenge.  They will not abandon Ireland on this issue.  This is why we are working together to ensure that three areas that require substantial progress actually deliver that progress.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly there has been a lot of progress although there is still some work to do on citizens' rights issues.  Then there are the Irish issues.  There has been very good progress on the common travel area.  We have had deep discussions and a lot of very detailed work has been done in ensuring Ireland can maintain, in full, the benefits of the Good Friday Agreement on this island.  That has posed very challenging questions on how we manage the Border questions in the future.  How do we ensure that we can protect what we enjoy today, which is largely an invisible border that has developed over time and which has allowed the normalisation of relationships through trade and movement on the island?  How do we protect that in the context of Brexit?  We have very strong support in doing this, as I have already said.  Between now and the meeting on 14 December we are looking for a language that reflects the need for credibility around how we are to approach this issue and solve it during phase two and the parameters within which that can be done.  We will not have all of the answers by the middle of December but we are looking for significantly more clarity than we currently have from the British negotiating team in order to support, with the other 26 countries and with Michel Barnier, the move to open phase two of the negotiations.

My concern arises around the position of the Government because it is a mistake to be ambivalent on any level on this issue.  It is a mistake to give any message other than that Ireland requires a resolution and an agreement that protects the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts and also protects Ireland's economy.  This requires the North to remain within the Single Market and to remain within the customs union.  There cannot be ambiguity on those matters as we move in to phase two.

We have been very clear on this issue and unlike others we have not changed our position for months.  Perhaps what has changed is the expectation of others that Ireland might, under pressure, change its position.  We have not done that.  I have been very clear that our first preference in respect of solving the Border issues and the North-South co-operation issues and so on would be for the United Kingdom as a whole to show a willingness and an appetite to want to remain part of the same customs union and the same trading platform as the rest of the European Union.  That is, however, a decision for the British Government and its negotiating teams to make.  In the absence of being able to solve the challenges, which run deep, that we face on the island of Ireland by a broad trade agreement in phase two between Britain and the European Union, then we have to recognise that Northern Ireland has unique challenges that will need tailor-made unique solutions.  We have made that very clear.  We have spoken about the need to avoid regulatory divergence because, essentially, if we had two jurisdictions on this island operating to different rule books for regulation it would be impossible in a practical sense to maintain the kind of relationships we have today.  This is why we have taken such a firm stance on this issue and we will continue to hold to that position.

This is all the more concerning now that we know the State Claims Agency carried out a number of health and safety management audits of the Defence Forces and that the Defence Forces can only offer speculative explanations for why prior inspection reports from Casement Aerodrome have gone missing.  That is unsatisfactory, especially in the light of the fact that copies of these documents are in circulation among politicians and the media.  Efforts to establish whether the documents were deliberately destroyed have amounted to asking the Defence Forces to investigate themselves.<\/p> <p> What action will the Government take to ensure every member of the Defence Forces will earn at least a living wage?  Will it commit to recognising Defence Forces' associations in pay negotiations?  Is it satisfied that the Defence Forces' members who met the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, to discuss these concerns are receiving the full protection warranted under the Protected Disclosures Act?  Has it considered the establishment of a commission of investigation to establish whether the health and safety management regime at Casement Aerodrome meets the standards of the day and whether the allegations have any credibility?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000017#P00500","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512046500,"counter":167,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked a lot of questions.

The public service stability agreement for the period 2018 to 2020 provides for a series of further pay increases in the next three years.  Given the ministerial offices Deputy Brendan Howlin has held, he will know of the difficulty in separating one sector from all others for special treatment in public sector pay, but that is what he is asking us to do.  There are other issues about what the Department of Defence can do about other supports available to Defence Forces' personnel.  There have been reviews in that regard.  There are many sectors in the economy and society that can make a very valid case for improved pay and working conditions.  I understand that, of course, the Defence Forces will make that case for themselves through the representative organisations and, in this case, private family members.  Of course, the Government will listen.  However, we have to operate within a certain pay structure across the public sector.  If we were to start to dismantle it for individual sectors, the Deputy knows of the chaos it would cause.<\/p>  <p>  As a former Minister for Defence, I record the Government's strong appreciation of the role the Defence Forces play.  I have visited many peacekeeping missions around the world and had the privilege to spend time with families who have lost loved ones in the service of the country in the Defence Forces.  They are valued.  We are building personnel numbers in the Defence Forces and the recruitment campaign is a success.  We are adding substantially more personnel to the Defence Forces than we are losing and will continue to see that trend develop into 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000018#Q00700","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1512046500,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I appreciate the T&aacute;naiste's reply and understand he cannot give me a comprehensive response on the Casement Aerodrome issues.

I say this in the full knowledge of how difficult it would be.  The shockingly low pay levels across the sector are having an impact on retention in key skills areas.  When these difficulties arose in the health sector, we managed to formulate a way to deal with them.  For example, we had a formula for skilled nurses.  We need to recognise what is happening.  The fact that the people concerned are not allowed to manifest their voices publicly does not mean that they should be ignored.  As such, I ask whether consideration will be given to a unique pay review within the Defence Forces and outside the Public Sector Pay Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000018#Q00800","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1512046500,"counter":174,"content":"<p>The Minister of State with responsibility for defence matters tells me that this is happening in the context of having special skill sets within the Defence Forces.

We are seeing an economy which can afford to pay the public sector more.  The bodies which represent members of the Defence Forces have bought into and want to be part of negotiations and their members are starting to benefit, but that is not to suggest there is no frustration in the Defence Forces.

There appears to be a lack of urgency in the Government's response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report, produced by the cross-party Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  The report, with its far-reaching recommendations for radical changes in this country's approach to health care, was published back in May, but we are still waiting for the establishment of an implementation office that will see its recommendations brought into action.<\/p>  <p>  If proof was needed of how much a major revamp of our delivery of health care is required, then one only needs to look at recent developments.  At a time when waiting lists for treatment in Irish hospitals are spiralling out of control, the recent RT&Eacute; \"Prime Time\" investigation revealed how a number of consultants were in breach of their contracts to provide a certain number of hours in the care of public patients, opting to boost their salaries with work in private hospitals.  One who was observed for eight weeks was found to be working fewer than 13 hours on average in the public system even though he was contracted to work 37 hours a week.<\/p>  <p>  Such scandalous behaviour, for which HSE and hospital management must also take their share of responsibility, no doubt at least partly contributed to the latest waiting list figures in our hospitals.  There were almost a half a million people, more than 494,000, waiting for outpatient treatment at the end of October.  That is an increase of 56,000 people on the same time last year.  Despite several undertakings to improve the situation, there has also been an increase in the number of people waiting for inpatient and day case operations and procedures compared with this time last year.  More than 80,000 people are on waiting lists as inpatients, also up on last year.  The number waiting for 15 months or more as outpatients has almost doubled, up by 88% to almost 92,000.  Add in those waiting this unacceptable length of time for inpatient or day case procedures, and there are little short of 500,000 people the length and breadth of Ireland facing absolutely unacceptable waits for a call from their local hospital.  They have been forced for more than 15 months, and much, much longer in some cases, to live in pain, to live in fear and to live constantly waiting for the postman to deliver a letter that will finally signal relief.  Meanwhile, the workload of nurses and other staff has increased to a point of great stress to them and to a point where questions should be asked about the level of care to some vulnerable patients.  They are simply being spread too thinly on the ground.  Resources are being stretched in most hospitals and the solution is not just a question of more beds.  The required additional medical resources in terms of staffing, equipment and theatre facilities must be allocated too.<\/p>  <p>  The Committee on the Future of Healthcare recommended that the implementation office for Sl&aacute;intecare would be located in the Office of the Taoiseach.  I understand that there was a worry among at least some members of the committee that the Department of Health might be given the responsibility for implementing the wide-ranging and radical changes recommended by the report.  They felt that such a move would hamper progress.<\/p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach confirm that the implementation process will be under the control of his Department and not the Department of Health?  Can he indicate when the process will be up and running?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000019#R00100","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1512047100,"counter":178,"content":"<p>On the last question, the progress report will be made to the Minister of Health but the Minister for Health reports to the Taoiseach in the context of the Cabinet subcommittee on health, which has a specific focus on Sl&aacute;intecare.  The Taoiseach holds the Department and the Minister to account on progress made.<\/p>  <p>  The concept of Sl&aacute;intecare is an all-party approach to ensure we have consistency in terms of providing decent health care across the country as Governments change and we are absolutely committed to this, as are other parties.  We are anxious to get on with the implementation process to which we have committed.  In July the Government agreed to move forward with the establishment of a dedicated programme office, specifically the recruitment of a lead executive.  This marked a critical first step in gearing up for the significant programme of reform and demonstrates the Government's commitment to this process.  Some &euro;1 million has been allocated to this office for 2018 in line with the report's recommendations.  The recruitment process for a head of this office is already under way and is being managed by the Public Appointments Service.  It is essential that we are positioned to attract candidates of real calibre who can be responsible for driving the reform programme in which the office will be involved.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel to this process the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is developing a response to the report and a draft implementation plan, which will be done and published by the end of this year.  This process seeks to translate the Sl&aacute;intecare report into a programme of action for the next ten years and will consider issues that arise in designing such a programme, including key actions, deliverables, costings, timelines and the interdependencies which will be necessary across Departments.  It was acknowledged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report that more detailed consideration of these issues would be required and this work is under way.  The process is being led at a most senior level in the Department and in the HSE and also involves close engagement with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The involvement of these Departments was a key recommendation of the report and that is why it is happening.  We will have an implementation plan, as recommended by the Sl&aacute;intecare report, by the end of the year and the Minister, Deputy Harris, is on schedule to get that done.  In parallel, we are putting in place a delivery office with people who have the motivation and talent to ensure we move the process forward into next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000019#R00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1512047100,"counter":179,"content":"<p>My own local hospital, University Hospital Galway, UHG, which is the busiest in the country, is an example of the woes of the current health system, with its growing waiting lists and overcrowded emergency department.  The situation has been made worse by the fact that leaking roofs over the operating theatres in Merlin Park Hospital have resulted in some procedures having to be carried out in UHG and, of course, the cancellation of many operations.  I appreciate that there has been some movement to reduce the inpatient and day case list but I find it disturbing that this hospital still accounts for more than a quarter of all the patients in the country who are waiting for more than 15 months for inpatient treatment that they badly need.  Put another way, one in 11 patients on the waiting lists for inpatient or day case treatment nationally have been waiting for more than 15 months.  In Galway that proportion is one in six patients.  It is shocking, for instance, that a total of 114 people have been waiting for more than a year in Galway for cardiac treatment, when this time last year there was just one patient in this situation.  There were 17 people last year waiting for more than a year and a half for oral surgery and this total has since soared to 570.

Additional capacity will be introduced in Galway in this respect.  A new 75-bed ward block was completed in 2016 and the new acute mental health department is expected to be operational by the end of 2017.  Galway is a pilot site for the national patient flow improvement programme and it is starting to work.

They informed it that eight out of ten of the highest earning companies in the country paid zero tax last year and that some even got tax rebates.  It is time the Minister for Finance came to the House to explain this.  This is not about whether we should have the 12.5% rate of corporation tax - that is a separate argument - it is about the companies that pay zero tax.

It builds on the work of Fiona O'Regan and the Law Reform Commission report on digital safety and harmful communications.  I understand that consideration is being given to similar proposals by the Government.  However, I am introducing this Bill with a view to moving the debate forward and encouraging the Government to deliver in respect of this matter.<\/p><p>The office of the digital safety commissioner would be a statutory body.  It would be responsible for the promotion of digital safety for all, supporting and implementing measures to improve digital safety and advising the Government of the day on policies relating to digital safety.  It is a new departure which would bring us up to date given the time in which we live and the risks experienced by users of the Internet, particularly children, and it would attempt to mitigate some of those risks.  It would also be responsible for the promotion of a positive online experience, which should be emphasised.  Crucially, it would be responsible for ensuring digital service providers, such as websites, social media platforms, apps and so forth, abide by minimum codes of practice and national digital safety standards.<\/p><p>Central to this would be take down mechanisms to remove harmful communications.  This could be appealed to the commissioner if they are not removed.  Failure to abide by the code of practice and national digital safety standards would see a code of compliance for the provider or platform revoked.  This is about providing timely, quick and effective remedies so people can be confident that the website or platform they or members of their family are engaging with will deal with abusive material, harmful communications or material posted without consent.  Many providers have good mechanisms, but some do not have any.  Certificates of compliance will ensure that users and parents can distinguish and choose.<\/p><p>Online safety, online bullying - which is becoming ever more prevalent - and the posting of harmful materials are among the biggest child protection issues of this generation.  The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, has been very enthusiastic about the potential of Bills such as this.  There must be a cross-Government approach to ensure these issues can be dealt with, including actions such as this Bill, additional offences, education programmes and the promotion of good behaviour online to make the Internet a positive place for all.  We are conscious of the tremendous benefits that online platforms can provide, so promoting active and positive online citizenship would be a central feature of the work of a digital safety commissioner.<\/p><p>We are also proposing the establishment of an advisory committee, 50% of which would be drawn from civil society, youth and children&rsquo;s groups and which would include specific youth members.  This would ensure that new developments, technologies, trends and platforms come to the attention of the commissioner quickly and that the office has the ability and scope to evolve and develop over time, as technology and online behaviour rapidly do.  This Bill would be a significant step in improving the online experience of all and in giving people more confidence in their safety from abuse and harmful material.  I look forward to discussing it on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000021#T02600","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1512048300,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000021#T02700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1512048300,"counter":240,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000021#T02800","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1512048300,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1512048300,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000021#T03000","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1512048300,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000021#T03100","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1512048300,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Planning and Development (Amendment) (Short Term Lettings) Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1512048300,"counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000021#T03300"},{"type":"speech","time":1512048300,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000, to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>This Bill seeks to initiate proper regulation of short-term lettings, which would bring more homes back into the conventional rental market.  The Bill provides for a 90-day limit on short-term lettings without planning permission.  These limits will only affect so-called professional lettings and portals such Airbnb, etc.<\/p><p>It is not necessarily geared towards affecting those who wish, if they have the opportunity to do so, to take advantage of the opportunities for short-term lettings during the course of a year in order to supplement their income.  The number of lets over 90 days being used in this fashion has increased significantly in recent years.  This has had a detrimental impact on the conventional rental market and has prevented the renting out of many homes that would otherwise be available to people.  If those homes were available to rent, it would have a positive effect in terms of the continuing crisis relating to the provision of housing and the rental sector.<\/p> <p> The Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government produced a report on this matter in recent months and the Bill reflects what is contained in that report.  It is one of a series of Bills we have introduced in recent months in an attempt to instill in the Government the sense of urgency needed to address various issues relating to the housing sector, create a positive impact and help the many people who are experiencing great difficulty in obtaining properties such as those to which I refer.  Similar legislation has been introduced to regulate matters in other cities across the globe.  We examined the position in those cities - for example, Berlin, Amsterdam, London and San Francisco - and are of the view that the Bill reflects the best of what is contained in the regulations put in place by the authorities there in an attempt to address this issue.  Of course, this is an issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of some urgency.  I encourage those of all parties and none to support the Bill.  It should move quickly to Second Stage and then be scrutinised by the relevant committee in order that it might have the desired effect which is so urgently required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000021#T03400","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512048900,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000022#U00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1512048900,"counter":249,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000022#U00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1512048900,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1512048900,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000022#U00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1512048900,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000022#U00600","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1512048900,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Proposed approval by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of Ireland\u2019s participation in two European Defence Agency Projects: Motion","time":1512048900,"counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000022#U00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1512048900,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves Ireland's participation in two European Defence Agency projects &ndash; (1) Joint Procurement Arrangement for EU SatCom Market and (2) European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, ECMAN, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.<\/blockquote><p>In commending the motion, I will briefly outline the function of the European Defence Agency, EDA, and the background to the programmes in which Ireland wishes to participate.

Its purpose is to support the member states and the Council in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European security and defence policy as it stands and as it develops in the future.  On 6 July 2004, the Government approved Ireland's participation in the framework of the EDA.  The agency is focused on assisting member states in capability development and obtaining better value for existing spending levels, improving competitiveness and securing greater efficiency, particularly in the area of research, technology and procurement of defence capabilities.  The primary reason for Ireland's participation in the agency is to support the development of Defence Forces capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management operations.  The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 prescribes that participation in projects or programmes in the EDA is subject to Government and D&aacute;il approval.<\/p><p>The proposal put forward by me today is to seek approval for Ireland to participate in two EDA projects - one in the area of satellite communications and one in the area of manual neutralisation capabilities.  The aim of this joint procurement arrangement is to provide commercially available satellite communications, fixed and mobile, as well as related services through the establishment of framework agreements on behalf of the contributing members, to promote ease of access and to improve efficiency.  The provision of strategic satellite services is an essential prerequisite for the major deployment of troops overseas and in support of other major operations.  It is vital that the Defence Forces maintain appropriate systems and procedures for the provision of strategic satellite services.  This project represents an opportunity not only to procure satellite services in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner but also to ensure security of supply and back-up in the event of any failure on the part of an existing supplier or an urgent operational requirement which cannot be met under Ireland's normal contractual arrangements.  There are no costs to the Exchequer arising from participation in this arrangement.  Costs only arise if the service is availed of on a pay-per-use basis.<\/p><p>I will now provide some detail on the second EDA project, which is the European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, ECMAN.  The ECMAN category B project is a follow-on activity of the EDA's category B programme on manual neutralisation techniques courses and exercises programme.  Ireland's participation in that programme was approved in 2013 and will finish in 2018.  The aim of this follow on project is to continue to develop manual neutralisation capabilities to the highest standards in order to retain capacity in dealing with improvised explosive devices when it is not possible to destroy or disrupt the device through other means, for example, a controlled explosion.  Participation in this project would provide explosive ordnance disposal personnel with access to a training system which is designed to continuously update and improve their safety when operating in an extreme environment.  It also enables those already qualified to maintain skill levels through an efficient relicensing arrangement linked to refresher courses.  This capability is highly specialised.  There is a lack of availability elsewhere due to its sensitive and classified nature and it is mainly developed through multinational framework arrangements.  The cost to the Exchequer of Ireland's participation in ECMAN is &euro;75,000 per year for six years - a total of &euro;450,000 over the lifetime of the project.  The costs will be met from within existing resources.  <\/p><p>Ireland's participation in the EDA affords us the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice and new developments in the defence environment, particularly as it impacts on multinational crisis management operations.  The Government's White Paper on Defence, published in August 2015, states that Ireland will identify opportunities to participate in multi-national capability development projects within the framework of the EDA in support of the Defence Forces' operations, capacity and capability.  These projects are prime examples of how the Defence Forces can develop their capabilities in satellite communications and in manual neutralisation capabilities.<\/p><p>I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000022#U00900","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1512048900,"counter":256,"content":"<p>At the outset, I acknowledge the wives and partners of members of the Defence Forces who are protesting outside the House today and who will be there for the next number of hours.  I will be joining them when I leave the Chamber.  I wish them well and congratulate them on the fantastic work they have done to date in highlighting the difficulties their partners face serving in the Defence Forces in light of current pay and conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the motion.  The EDA was established under a joint action of the Council of Ministers in July 2004 during the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p>Its mission, as stated on its website, is to support the member states and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European security and defence policy as it stands now and to develop it in the future.  Ireland has participated in the framework of the EDA since it was established and it is important to note our participation in it does not impose specific obligations or commitments on Ireland, only that we make a contribution to the budget which funds the agency's day-to-day running.  <\/p> <p> Within its key mission, the EDA has three main sub-missions.  They are to support the development of defence capabilities and military co-operation among the European member states; stimulating defence research in technology and strengthening the European defence industry; and acting as a military interface to EU policies.  This work is done for the purposes of good and with the sole interest of protecting our people.  We and the European Union are facing new and evolving threats all of the time.  One prime example of this is in the area of cyber security.  We need to protect our public services and ensure the business community and the many multinationals operating here operate in a safe jurisdiction and that we have protections in place to protect them from a cyber attack.  Surely we can all agree and see the benefits of working with other member states to research in this area and to develop new technologies by pooling resources and technologies and allowing a small country such as ours to benefit from economies of scale by working with others.  This approach is a no-brainer.  We would be foolish and reckless to opt out instead of participating.  <\/p> <p> The key activities of our Defence Forces internationally are peace-keeping, co-operation with other countries in conflict prevention, strengthening national and international security and operating within a global community to promote peace and security across the globe.  As a nation, we have a very proud record of operating within the UN.  Since we became involved, our service has been constant; we have never had a day's break.  Participation in the European Defence Agency means Ireland has access to research and information that allows us to develop and maintain our military capabilities.  For the most part, due to the size of our country, this is research we cannot generate ourselves.  Ireland's objectives in participating in the European Defence Agency is to achieve economies of scale in participating in defence procurement and to keep up-to-date on best practices, particularly in the area of multinational crisis management.  This important work on the part of our Defence Forces is to keep up-to-date on best practice and to build the capabilities of our Defence Forces and in turn protect those serving in the Irish Defence Forces.  This important work requires us to have the most up-to-date training and the best possible capabilities and that we enhance our capabilities and capacity by working with other member states.  Some in the House are quite happy to laud the Defence Forces for their great humanitarian work, most recently in the Mediterranean, yet they will stand up and oppose any training of our troops to prepare them for this important work.  The hypocrisy is unbelievable.  I have said in the House before when our soldiers go overseas they are not going on holiday; they are operating in dangerous environments.  We must at all times ensure our people have the best training and that they participate in training exercises with armies from other countries so we can share our knowledge and learn from best practice.  We cannot take an insular approach to defence activities.  The work our soldiers do in this sphere is peace-keeping and peace enforcement.  We should always support any training activity that prepares them for such work.<\/p> <p> I will address the two projects which are the basis of this motion.  The EU Satellite Communications Market, category B project allows us to participate in a satellite service where all the member states pool resources and we access the resource only if we need it.  This clearly allows for economies of scale for a country such as ours.  Communications are vitally important in this day and age.  We need to ensure we have a service that is consistently present and that there is no lapse in service.  There is no cost unless we use it.  Supporting this project and participating in it is sensible and wise.  <\/p> <p> The second project, the European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, ECMAN, category B project, deals with providing courses and training for soldiers dealing with improvised explosive devices, IEDs.  We have key expertise and experience in this area.  Unfortunately we have lost experts in this area in the past number of years.  We still have something to offer to other member states by participating and giving to the EDA and this project.  We can also learn.  The cost of this project presents value for money for our Defence Forces and our country and I am very happy to support it on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000022#U01000","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512049500,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I also acknowledge the great work of the wives and partners of the Defence Forces members and the fact they have had to come to Dublin today to protest and highlight the demands for pay and conditions.  It is a disgrace and the situation is getting worse and not better.  My approach to all the EU defence related motions that have come before the House since the Lisbon Treaty referendum result, which tied Ireland to the European Defence Agency, is to view them with a healthy amount of suspicion, given the purpose of the European Defence Agency and most of our EU partners is to gradually achieve an EU army and to increase military spending.  The other aim is to increase interoperability, make national armies indistinct from and dependent on each other and to enhance military capabilities above what would be required, even in an Armageddon scenario, to defend the EU.  We acknowledge that Ireland has a unique reputation to protect in terms of our neutrality and proud record of peace-keeping with the UN over decades.  Every step that further aligns us with the EU military project further erodes our neutrality and further undermines the reputation built on UN duties, which have resulted in the loss of 86 Irish soldiers since 1960.  Nobody is denying the threat level is greater in today's world and that armies and armed groups around the world are becoming more sophisticated, as the Minister said in committee yesterday.  There is a need to afford the soldiers of the Defence Forces the greatest level of protection possible and for their skills to be increasingly honed and their equipment adequate not only to protect themselves but also to protect those they seek to protect.  That can be done without eroding our national interest and our neutrality.  The State's neutrality should not be sacrificed on the altar of interoperability and greater efficiencies.  In committee yesterday, I argued that one of the motions to which we are being asked to sign up, while being benign, could increase our dependence on the EU military machine.  Signing up to the EU Satellite Communications Market, category B project ties our military, Army and Navy operating overseas to the same satellite communications system as most other EU countries despite the fact we already have a satellite communications contract which to date nobody has highlighted as flawed and as far as I know there is no problem with it.<\/p>  <p>  I was told yesterday that the European Defence Agency system run via an Airbus Eurostar or other equivalent satellite is just a back-up.  Interestingly the EDA satellite communications contract is with Airbus, which is one of the largest suppliers of such communications in the world.  It is a French company with more than &euro;14 billion turnover.  While I was told -  it was repeated today - there is no additional cost and it will only arise each time we use it, I believe the system will be used every time the Irish Defence Forces are on operational deployments overseas with troops of other countries because it ensures the buzzword of interoperability.  <\/p>  <p>  While we have signed up to interoperability on this, we are no closer to protecting our soldiers abroad or at home from Lariam, despite a D&aacute;il motion instructing the Minister and military to do so.  We are also way behind other EU militaries in admitting the failures of the past and the legacy of very sick serving and former members of the Air Corps.  When will these issues get the same attention as the headlong rush into the EU-led military agenda?<\/p>  <p>  On the second tongue-twisting motion before us today, the European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, category B, I highlighted the dangerously low levels in the Defence Forces of skills in explosive ordnance disposal personnel.  I am concerned that if they are away on training courses with this project, it would leave the country more exposed and put more pressures on the soldiers who are still at home and who are already over-stretched to cover call-outs.  I was not reassured by the reply because it did not show how that section of the Army would grow quickly enough to address this shortfall.  I also asked where within the very tight defence budget were they able to find the annual &euro;75,000 it will cost?  What will suffer as a consequence?   <\/p><p>I apologise that I am about to step out.  I want to visit the protest outside and I will be back before the end of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000023#V00200","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512050100,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I wish to deal with the two elements in the motion before us, which the Labour Party will be supporting.  The first element on joint procurement of satellite communications makes sense to me, providing for efficient procurement, economies of scale and all that goes with it.  There is no cost to us unless we decide to purchase.  I do not see any downside to that aspect of the motion.<\/p>  <p>  The second element relating to training in improvised explosive devices also makes sense to me.  I would certainly see providing access to training as being attractive to the personnel themselves.  In any organisation, people tend to jump at an opportunity to enhance their skills level.  I believe this will also be positive.  This element appears to cost us &euro;450,000.  The Minister of State has indicated that will come from existing resources.  However, if something comes from existing resources, a pot somewhere is reduced with less funding available for some element of the budget.  I would be happier not to see a budget cut for some line element associated with this.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier I met the people outside the gates of Leinster House.  In his earlier contribution, Deputy Howlin identified the need for a special review of pay for Defence Forces personnel.  I thought the T&aacute;naiste's response was reasonably positive in terms of taking advice from the Minister of State at the Department of Defence.  I call for it again today.  It is a scandal that Defence Forces personnel are relying on family income supplement, a matter I have raised previously in defence debates.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, I do not see any downside to the two elements in the motion.  As I said at the beginning, the Labour Party will support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000024#W00200","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1512050100,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I am absolutely opposed to this further integration of this country into European military industrial complex.

The European Union border regime alone is like some sort of horrific nightmare from a dystopian science fiction horror movie in terms of our complicity in the horrors that are going on in Libya.  We are involved in training the Libyan coast guard, which, in turn, is deeply implicated in slavery, systematic rape, beatings and torture of vulnerable people who are trapped.  Up to 1 million people are trapped in Libya because the Western powers went in and destroyed Libya.  Now the country has collapsed and these desperate people are looking to come to Europe for a new life.  Thousands of them drown in the Mediterranean Sea with more sent back.  I am absolutely amazed that the Minister of State finds this amusing, by the way.  It is an horrific situation.<\/p>  <p>  If there are threats out there, it is because of what Western powers, including European powers, have done in places such as Libya and the inhuman response of the European Union.  Instead, we are developing systems essentially to make it easier to repel these people and co-operate with some of the forces guilty of this horror.  Of course, it dates back to beyond that.  There is the horrific EU-Turkey deal, again about repelling desperate Syrian migrants coming from the disaster in Syria, turning a blind eye to the horrific human rights of the Turkish regime against its own people, against journalists, locking up politicians and so on.  We are quite happy to do deals with Turkey.<\/p>  <p>  We are willing to engage in trade with horrific regimes such as Saudi Arabia, which is beyond words in its horror with the denial of human rights at the most basic level.  After the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, went to the United Arab Emirates and was asked if he raised human rights issues, he said it was not really appropriate to raise human rights on trade missions.  It is that kind of amorality of being willing to work with these regimes.  We are doing big trade deals with the Egyptian regime.  We were complicit in the US military assault on Iraq which destroyed Iraq and in turn had a knock-on effect in Syria.  There would be no ISIS threat were it not for all these things.<\/p>  <p>  We then justify beefing up the European military industrial complex as a response to that to protect ourselves when we have actually created that mess or been complicit in creating the mess that generated those threats in the first place.  On these particular initiatives, the European arms industry has boosted its lobbying budget over the past five years from &euro;2.6 million to &euro;5.8 million.  The 36 different meetings between the arms industry and the European Commission between 2013 and 2016 form the backdrop to this.  This is the totally immoral arms industry trying to cash in on this stuff that European and other Western powers have helped generate through their direct involvement in horrors in the Middle East, Libya and Turkey or through complicity with the US war machine at Shannon here.  Those are the issues we should be addressing.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, we should also care about our soldiers who are standing outside the gates of Leinster House.  Some of them are on family income supplement because we do not even pay them decent wages.  We want to line the pockets of the European military industrial complex.  We should have nothing to do with the international arms industry and the warmongering agenda that lies behind it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000024#W00500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1512050100,"counter":264,"content":"<p>We will not be supporting the motion.  We do not agree with the strengthening of the links between the arms industry and national governments in Europe and we certainly do not think Ireland should have anything to do with any of them.  In putting money onto any of these things, we have no idea where it will end up and what it will be used for.  Obviously the whole focus of fortress Europe now is on preventing refugees getting into Europe rather than preventing others from bombing their homes, making refugees of them in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  I am really disappointed that Fianna F&aacute;il and Labour are prepared to support the motion.  Perhaps I should not be shocked; maybe I am too na&iuml;ve for this place.<\/p>  <p>  The head of the European Defence Agency, Jorge Domecq, said: \"What is missing or really killing our defence effort is [that] we do it in an isolated and fragmented manner.\"  If Ireland is going to sign up and be part of some sort of European army, whatever form it takes, God help us all.  At the moment European countries are spending &euro;200 billion on arms.  This is all madness.  This is driven primarily by the US where, if there was a decrease in worldwide war efforts today, huge numbers of jobs would be lost in America.  Promoting the arms industry in America today is one of the prime reasons that we have such wars and destruction going on worldwide.  More than 60 million people are displaced because of war.  It is just nuts; it does not solve anything.  People do not make bombs, fighter planes and guns to make peace; they do it to make war.<\/p><p>We are involved in it.  The fact that we still facilitate the war effort by allowing Shannon to be used is crazy.  We should not be signing up to this and I do not believe the Irish people would agree to our signing up to this.  There is currently a huge effort to increase the whole security arrangement in Europe.  It feeds the arms industry.  We keep dropping bombs on people in order to create people who cause problems like ISIS.

It will involve a pay per use of the system for defence forces in the field.  However, as part of that debate it would be wrong not to look at the EU satellite technology and to highlight the use of satellites and satellite data transmission as part of Europe's increasingly high-tech and militaristic defence of its borders against migrants.  However, this is not benign technology.  There is something deeply disturbing about the EU using its enormous power to train satellite surveillance on refugees from war-torn and impoverished states trying to cross its borders.  It is chilling.  It is not cheap either.  The European Commission agreed in 2015 to provide &euro;47 million to Frontex for satellite services dedicated to border surveillance.  In total, more than &euro;6 billion from the EU budget and a similar amount from national budgets is to be spent up to 2020 on border surveillance technology, including satellite surveillance.  Data from all these technologies are fed into Frontex's situation room and the idea is that they would form real-time surveillance of Europe's borders to protect it against a non-existent threat from desperate people trying to get to Europe's shores.  All of this is being done at the behest of the arms companies which provided this technology in the first place, the same arms companies which benefited and profited from the disruption and war in those countries which led to the people becoming refugees in the first place.  While the close relationship between the arms industry and EU's governance structure is not new, we know, for example, that the defence industry was heavily involved with the European convention tasked with establishing the EU constitution and so on.  All of this is set to get worse.  The Government would be better off spending that money giving our soldiers decent pay and conditions, rather than wasting it on this offensive measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000025#X00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1512050700,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I too am very concerned about this, having listened to the Minister of State's contribution and read his speech.  It is proposed that we join up to these two projects just on a whim, as it were.  This motion was slipped into the business today nicely when people are very busy with everything else.  What would have happened if an election had been called?  Would the Government have put down this motion for Tuesday night before we did anything else?<\/p>  <p>  The motion relates to the joint procurement arrangement for EU SatCom Market and European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, ECMAN, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence ( Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  I am certainly not in favour of it.  We have gone too far down the road of involvement with our European colleagues, who have not been much good to us in many other areas.  If we were being attacked, I wonder would they come to our defence.  They did not come much to our defence when we needed them in the banking crisis.  Where were they?  They could not be seen or found.  They screwed us in the so-called bailout.  They charged us 6% interest for it, while the IMF was charging us 3% interest for its funds.  That shows us where our friends were.<\/p>  <p>  However, this is too serious a matter.  It would befit the Minister of State better if he were to go out today and meet the soldiers and their wives who are outside the gates of this House - I hope he met them - and take note of the ridiculous and shameful way our soldiers are being treated.  They are being paid less then the minimum wage and expected to work 24-hour shifts, with &euro;20 of a stipend to cover a 24-hour shift, but it would cost more than that to get a taxi to or from work.  These are proud men with 40 years service.  Their families, including fathers, sons, daughters, uncles and cousins, are involved in highlighting this issue.  They have served in many countries with the United Nations, but not in this slimy slidderly way in which we are getting involved in these projects and putting them in danger in the name of so-called protecting our borders.<\/p>  <p>  We have not had one proper debate in this House on the Syrian crisis, on the Iraq crisis or all the other crises.  I tried several times to have such a debate.  Deputies Noel Grealish, Kevin O'Keeffe and myself were allowed raised a Topical Issue on it, thanks to the Ceann Comhairle, on Holy Thursday evening, a very appropriate evening.  No Government time was provided for it.  We had no hope of securing a debate on the persecution of the Christians in the Middle East and minority Muslim sects.  I was talking earlier to Deputies Wallace and Daly about their visit to Syria and perhaps we should all go and see what is going on there.  I went to Lebanon.  We can see what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  We are respected all over the world for our neutrality but now we are being sucked into this vast industry.  Some &euro;200 million being spent on planes and all war missiles and &euro;6 billion on protecting our borders.  I do not know what will happen to our own Border between the North and the South.  I got some hope today from a senior civil servant at the European committee when he said that things were looking more positive.  We should mind our own business and let the people over there mind theirs.  We should not be hanging on and giving them the stamp of approval that we would pony-up and send our soldiers out there.  We should equip the ones at home and give them enough money to feed themselves so that they would not have to be living on family income supplement.  They should be shown respect, instead of putting them into areas, and not knowing where they are going or what they are doing, or what we as a people are being sucked into without the people being consulted.  This started off with the Lisbon treaty, followed by the Nice treaty, in respect of which the then Government went back to the people a second time to get it through.  The Minister of State was not part of that Government, but others were.<\/p>  <p>  I certainly am not going to take a lecture from Deputy Lisa Chambers with respect to her saying that she is disgusted with us not supporting this motion.

That extends from officer level down to private level.  We are all rightly proud of our Defence Forces, the work that 790 or so of them are doing in overseas missions and the work they have done in past.  The way they have represented this country has been a huge service and brought great credit to this country, but they are being let down currently by the Government in how they are being managed.  The response to that should not be what we are seeing here and what we have seen with the recent Government decision, as I understand it, to join PESCO, which is for us to go all in in terms of development as a key member of a new armaments-arranged combined European army development.  We bring real strength to Europe with our tradition of neutrality and peace keeping and our tradition of scepticism and outright opposition to some of the military adventurism that we have seen from European neighbours in recent years and down through the years.  We will not be able to support this proposal.<\/p><p> If the Minister of State is responding at the end of the debate, perhaps he will be able to answer another question I would like to ask.  Why are we debating this matter in advance of a debate on the Government's decision that Ireland should join PESCO?  Surely the Government's decision to go in this direction is strategically broader and of more historical significance than the decision to participate in EDA projects.  By contrast, the Danish Government is maintaining its position that a country can be a full member of the EU without necessarily having to buy into this very real level of security co-operation and support for defence armaments industries.  The EU is very upfront and clear about what it is seeking to do.  An additional &euro;500 million will have to be provided for armaments supports in 2019 and 2020 and &euro;1.5 billion will have to be provided each year from 2021.  I presume there will be an ongoing ramping up from there on.  It was a mistake not to debate the Government's strategic decision on PESCO in advance of debating these operational investments.  Why is the decision not on the agenda for next week?  Surely we have to do it before 11 December, when, I understand, PESCO will be signed off at the European Council.  Why are we not debating that?  A date has not even been set for it to be debated next week.  We have to debate it in advance of 11 December.  When we have that debate, and the same point is raised here, the Green Party will stand for Ireland taking a strategic decision to maintain a proud and strong EU that is proud of its tradition of bringing peace to Europe in a way that did not exist for generations prior to its establishment.  We cannot develop a Europe which is at peace with itself, but at war near its borders with neighbouring countries in a way that undermines the whole peace project aspect of the EU, which I like.<\/p> <p> Deputies have mentioned member states' recent activities in Libya, which have devastated the region, as an example of what results from investment in armaments technology.  I once heard someone referring to the kinetic power of munitions and military force.  We bring the power of intelligence to peacekeeping and how it works.  One can have all the satellites in the world.  I understand that when Irish soldiers went to Liberia, where they did an incredible job as part of an incredible mission, they shared a computer with the people of a nearby village.  That, more than anything else, helped to swing the local population over to them, thereby enabling them to carry out their peace mission.  I was proud to be in government when we supported the difficult mission in Chad.  It was difficult to get equipment and helicopters to Chad.  As I understand it, the best thing we did there revolved around our decision not to build a big fortification.  We did not drive our trucks through local villages in the middle of the wet season, thereby destroying the roads used by local farmers.  That marks the intelligence of the personnel we are proud to have serving in our armed forces.<\/p> <p> We bring these skills and strengths to Europe.  I do not think it is necessary to buy into the big new satellite technology that allows others to look down from space and press a button from a military drone to kill people who do not know what is coming until they have been zapped.  Lord knows what their surviving relations will do against the EU for ever and a day.  That is not the way Europe needs to go.  I want to support our Army.  I would fund our Army.  It needs funding.  We should invest not in armaments but in human intelligence.  We should start by investing in the soldiers who are increasingly unhappy with the way the Minister of State is running the Department of Defence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000025#X01800","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1512051600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 88; N\u00edl, 15; Staon, 21.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Joe McHugh and Tony McLoughlin; N\u00edl, Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Mick Wallace.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000027#Z00100","aye":["1368","1246","1219","1321","1332","1310","1354","1293","1369","1253","1220","1307","1225","1350","1335","1260","1241","1273","1357","1218","1255","1336","1339","1217","1285","1298","1364","1261","1268","1338","1436","1356","1322","1264","1300","1331","1233","1313","1318","1251","1275","1360","1237","1353","1365","1229","1314","1311","1323","1240","1346","1244","1359","1223","1248","1290","1343","1224","1247","1363","1284","1283","1262","1342","1234","1315","1328","1326","1296","1297","1227","1267","1329","1278","1257","1324","1325","1370","1265","1334","1304","1213","1301","1276","1270","1277","1250","1358"],"nay":["1238","1361","1306","1263","1316","1434","1259","1348","1299","1347","1242","1226","1294","1367","1355"],"abs":["1252","1279","1309","1258","1288","1303","1266","1345","1239","1362","1333","1340","1215","1269","1287","1305","1280","1302","1327","1232","1235"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1512052200,"counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000028#AA00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Eamon Ryan, Barry Cowen and Eoin &Oacute; Broin - the recent tragic deaths of homeless persons and the crisis in Dublin; (2) Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v - funding for Traveller-specific issues highlighted in the Traveller community survey; (3) Deputy David Cullinane - child psychology services in Waterford; (4) Deputy Mary Butler - the closure of the Waterford ISPCC branch on 1 December; (5) Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe - staffing and respite care services at St. Patricks Community Hospital, Fermoy, County Cork; (6) Deputy Thomas P.

I welcome the broad support in that House for the core principle of community rating which is a long-established aspect of Government policy on the health insurance market.  This short Bill comprises seven sections dealing with the specific issue of health insurance, particularly the risk equalisation scheme which supports the system of community-rated health insurance.  Risk equalisation means that everyone pays the same price for the same product, irrespective of age, gender or health status.  In other words, older and sicker people pay the same price as younger and healthier people.<\/p>  <p>  In a community-rated market like ours the risks are shared across the market as a whole, making insurance more affordable for less healthy and older people than it might otherwise be.  In risk-rated markets, on the other hand, the premium charged is based on the insurer's estimate of each person's risk, taking into account relevant factors such as age and existing medical conditions.  Under this model, healthier people pay low premiums, while sicker people pay high premiums.  Moreover, under a risk-rated system, the premium for someone who has held health insurance for many years will rise if his or her health deteriorates.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Insurance Act 1994 requires all insurers to apply community rating.  However, older and sicker customers are not shared equally across the Irish insurance market because of the relatively recent arrival of competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017113000030#GG00200","speaker":"1251"}]
