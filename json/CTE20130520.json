I thank all present for being here bright and early on a Monday morning and I particularly welcome our guests.  I remind everybody that mobile phones should be switched off rather than being in silent mode as they interfere with the broadcasting of proceedings, which is unfair to the staff.  This is our fifth session in the series of hearings which the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children has been asked to conduct in discussing the heads of the protection of life during pregnancy Bill 2013.<\/p><p>  I welcome the witnesses to the meeting this morning, as they are here to assist us in analysing the heads of the Bill.  I welcome Dr. Anne Jeffers, Dr. Maeve Doyle, Dr. Joanne Fenton, Dr. Anthony McCarthy and Dr. John Sheehan, who will be here shortly.  I remind members that we are discussing the heads of the Bill and any comments or questions should be referenced to those heads.  To members in particular I say that the language we use should be temperate and moderate, and we should try to avoid being unfair to each other and witnesses.  I would appreciate if members could keep that at the back of their minds.  I will be very strict with time today, as I reviewed the hearings on Friday.  The time allocations will be 70 minutes and 30 minutes and I will end the sessions at the appropriate times.  That will mean some members will not be able to make a contribution at certain times, for which I apologise in advance, but we must be fair in the application of time.<\/p><p>  Before beginning I remind members and witnesses that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to only qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not criticise, comment on or make charges against either a person or persons outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  There are 50 minutes for opening statements so I ask Dr. McCarthy to begin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000002#A00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369038600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I am Dr. Anthony McCarthy, president of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and a specialist in perinatal psychiatry at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street.  I am also the psychiatric assessor for the confidential inquiry into maternal deaths in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Our written submission has detailed comments on the heads of Bill and we recommend that close attention is paid to these points.  Some practical points will need to be addressed and will require some technical amendments to the Bill.  This submission was agreed by the council of the college, the sole organisation recognised by the Medical Council of Ireland as being responsible for the life-long training of all psychiatrists in Ireland.  This council is the elected decision making body of the college and we know that among our 864 members there will be a wide range of opinions with regard to the sensitive issue of abortion, reflecting the deep divisions in society in general about this issue.  Many of these views will be heard today but the submission is the official college position.<\/p><p>  This Bill is about saving women's lives.  We recognise that the Bill is restricted only to circumstances where the life of the mother is at risk rather than her mental health.  We recommend that any woman who has suicidal ideation in pregnancy must be enabled to readily avail of expert psychiatric assessment, and that assessment must be individual, comprehensive, compassionate and not prejudged.  Every maternity unit in this country should have such services, and there is a significant lack in such provision currently, as outlined in our written submission.<\/p><p>  As so much will be said and heard today about the risk of suicide in pregnancy, I wish to make some brief overall points as someone who has been working as a specialist perinatal psychiatrist for more than 16 years in a service seeing in excess of 500 women every year.  Suicide in pregnancy is real; it is a real risk and it does happen.  This is always a tragedy as at least two lives are lost and many others are affected significantly.  We must do everything we can to prevent such deaths.  Much has been made and will be made about the so-called lack of evidence with regard to abortion and whether it will ever prevent a suicide.  I believe there will never be statistical evidence to prove this point one way or other because trying to prove anything statistically for such a rare event is extremely difficult, if not impossible.  Only a study involving thousands of women who were expressing suicidal ideation in pregnancy and wanted an abortion, and where half of them had that abortion and the other half did not, for example, if they were prevented from travelling to the UK, could answer this question about statistical evidence.  This study will almost certainly never be done, I hope.<\/p><p>  As doctors, we must always be aware of research but also be very aware of the limitations of research and of the questions which it cannot answer.  In our clinical work, we search always for clinical evidence and not statistical evidence.  As doctors, we assess suicidal risk as part of our everyday work and we rely on clinical evidence, our clinical skills and our experience and training in assessing each woman or child individually.  There are extra challenges in assessing anyone in emotionally intense situations and where there are potentially serious outcomes, whatever the assessment concludes.  Again I stress that we do these sorts of assessments regularly, even if most psychiatrists do not do so in this specific circumstance.  Part of suicidal risk assessment always includes assessing the presence or absence of a mental disorder or mental illness and an assessment of the capacity of the individual to make an informed decision.  That will be essential here too.<\/p><p>  We also always assess for what are called psychosocial stresses, or life stresses.  However, some in this debate have tried to present the case that these are somehow mutually exclusive, as if a woman who is at risk of suicide is either mentally ill and hence needs psychiatric treatment or that she just has a psychosocial stress - an unwanted pregnancy -  and is then either not really suicidal or her case has nothing to do with psychiatry.  Clinical reality and life reality is that frequently there is a complex interaction between major life stresses, mental distress and mental disorder.  It is sometimes black and white but most often it is not so.  Attempts to present it as such not only does a great disservice to any women who may find themselves in this particular position but also to any person at any time in life who is suffering from major stress, depression or other mental disorder.  They too require a comprehensive mental health assessment and treatment, one that does not focus exclusively on the presence or absence of a mental illness but on an holistic assessment and treatment which recognises the individuality of that person.<\/p><p>  I will specifically discuss a phrase that is being quoted frequently at the moment that \"abortion is never a treatment for suicide\".  This is true, and abortion is never a treatment for suicide, but neither is counselling, psychotherapy, antidepressants or anything else.  There is no treatment for suicide.  What society needs to address in general, and what we as psychiatrists have to do specifically, is try to prevent suicide, and this requires looking at the causes of suicide and what can be done to address those causes.  The question is not whether abortion treats suicide but is there ever a case where a woman will kill herself because of an unwanted pregnancy, and if so, what can we do to save her life, and would that ever be a termination of pregnancy?  This Bill is about legislating for that very small but real possibility.<\/p><p>  There are concerns among many psychiatrists that somehow this legislation will result in them being placed in very difficult clinical circumstances.  For some this is because of their religious, philosophical or ethical beliefs, and these must be respected.  I welcome that those views will be heard today as well.  For others, there is a fear of increased workload for their already overstretched services, and doing this with no extra resources.  For others it is a fear of being faced with very difficult clinical issues and dilemmas where, for example, a woman may be genuinely highly distressed, such as after rape, and wants a termination but is assessed as not being actively suicidal because she does not want to die.  This woman may just want an end to the pregnancy but she will have to be refused an abortion under this legislation.  That will be difficult for her and us as clinicians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369038600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am Dr. Joanne Fenton, consultant adult psychiatrist and a specialist perinatal psychiatrist in the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.  In my role as a perinatal psychiatrist I have treated women attending the Coombe hospital over the past ten years.  These women have had a wide variety of problems and difficulties including illnesses ranging from severe and enduring mental illness like schizophrenia to those with less severe illness like anxiety or depression, but which may cause equal levels of distress.<\/p><p>  Suicide is a real risk in individuals who have mental illness and has a devastating impact on all those involved with the woman.  As psychiatrists, and in particular in my role as a perinatal psychiatrist, we are trained to assess women who express suicidal ideation or intent.  It is my role to provide non-judgmental, compassionate care and treatment to these women.  The women who present with suicidal intent are in a great deal of distress and it is our aim to treat these women respectfully.<\/p><p>  In my years in the Coombe hospital I have seen many women who have had a termination of pregnancy.  Each woman has had a different experience and the effect has been different for each.  I have never seen a woman where termination of her pregnancy was the treatment for her mental illness nor do I believe that a termination of pregnancy is a treatment for mental illness.  However, that said, I cannot say that there will never be a situation where a woman is in such a state of distress and turmoil that for her, termination of pregnancy is a life-saving option.<\/p><p>  The current legislation is very restrictive and many women will continue to travel abroad to seek terminations.  There are a number of points which my colleagues and I will address further and are outlined in our written college submission.  These include the under-18 age group and those who lack capacity.  I believe that two psychiatrists, as outlined in the heads of Bill, should assess a woman who is suicidal and pregnant and be in agreement about their assessments, but should not have to see the patient at the same time.  I believe that the obstetrician should assess the woman from an obstetric point of view but not be expected to assess suicidality, which is beyond his or her area of expertise.  I believe that the timing between initial referral and assessment and the timing for appeal should be shortened as women in this situation are frequently distressed and a lengthening of time can cause a further deterioration in their mental health.<\/p><p>  Many psychiatrists do not wish to partake in the assessments of these women for many reasons and their concerns must be respected.  In my role as a perinatal psychiatrist I believe it is my responsibility to continue to assess pregnant women in distress and aim to provide the best and most compassionate care to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne Fenton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369038600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am Dr. Maeve Doyle, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and chair of the child and adolescent faculty of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.  I welcome the invitation from the Joint Committee on Health and Children to make a submission on specific issues with regard to children, particularly because the X case involved a 14 year old girl, a child, who had been raped and sought a termination because she said that she was suicidal.  The written submission, which was sent by the college, includes a number of key and detailed points about the care of children in circumstances where they may be pregnant and request an abortion and how the proposed heads of Bill must be amended to address these.  My opening statement summarises some of these key issues.<\/p><p>  On the definition of a child, the heads of Bill do not define the word &quot;child&quot;.  This is very important as in cases involving children there are very specific and complex issues regarding their care which must be addressed.  On consent, under the Children Act 2001, and other legislation, a child is someone under the age of 18 years unless married.  A person over the age of 16 years can give consent to surgical, medical or dental treatment and it is not necessary to obtain consent from parents and guardians.  For psychiatric assessment the law has been interpreted as meaning that until the age of 18, children are still not in a position to legally consent to a psychiatric assessment and, as such, require consent from their guardians.  For children in the care of the HSE the issue of consent is even more complex.  I make these points to highlight the need for these issues to be considered by those drafting the final Bill.<\/p><p>  The issue of confidentiality is also quite complex.  Generally, when young people are first seen by a child and adolescent psychiatrist they are informed that what they say will remain confidential unless the information disclosed constitutes a risk to themselves or to others.  This may well result in the young people censoring what they say.  This is particularly true in the area of sexual activity.  The age of consent to sexual intercourse remains at 17 years.  In many cases, however, parents of 17 year olds expect to be informed if their 17 year old child is sexually active, so issues regarding a possible abortion will require expert, experienced and sensitive handling and clarity for the child, family and professionals involved.<\/p><p>  While there are no figures available, the occurrence of pregnancy within a population attending a child and adolescent mental health service is rare.  For a pregnant young person to attend such a service, the consent must come from her parents.  In addition, if the young person is under the age of 17, the professional will have to report to the HSE and the Garda.  The likelihood of parents of pregnant girls seeking advice from a child and adolescent psychiatrist as to whether or not to proceed with a termination of pregnancy is, therefore, very low.<\/p><p>  What may happen is that in the case of a young girl who is in the care of the HSE, becomes pregnant and indicates a wish to have a termination of pregnancy on grounds of suicidality, the HSE, acting <i>in loco parentis<\/i>, may well seek the advice of a child and adolescent psychiatrist in making that decision.  This is probably the main group of pregnant teenage girls for whom the proposed legislation will, in effect, apply.<\/p><p>  I hope that the foregoing will draw attention to some of the difficulties which would need to be overcome in any legislation involving young women, children in the eyes of the law, who present with suicidality in the context of pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maeve Doyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369038600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I am Dr. Anne Jeffers.

I am a perinatal psychiatrist working in the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin.  A perinatal psychiatrist is a psychiatrist based in a maternity hospital and he or she treats women in pregnancy or, for example, following delivery.  I also work as a liaison psychiatrist in the Mater Hospital, Dublin, which has one of the busiest accident and emergency departments in Ireland.  Last year, we had the highest number of treated episodes of attempted suicide in the State, and part of my work is assessing and treating people who present with attempted suicide.  I therefore work both in a perinatal setting and in an accident and emergency department setting.<\/p><p>  I will confine my comments to the aspect of the Bill that is pertinent to psychiatry, namely head 4, which is concerned with the risk of loss of life from self-destruction.  It has major implications for psychiatrists.  First, there is a fundamental difference in the management of medical and psychiatric emergencies in obstetrics.  In obstetrics, medical emergencies and psychiatric emergencies require different interventions.  In a medical emergency, speedy delivery of the baby is required while, in a psychiatric emergency, speedy delivery of the baby is contraindicated.  It is exactly the opposite of that required in a medical emergency.  In a psychiatric emergency such as when a patent is depressed and has suicidal intent, the patient may have impaired capacity and should be advised not to make irrevocable decisions.  The patient probably cannot give informed consent.  Those of us who see people with suicidal intent often see people who feel overwhelmed, unsupported and hopeless and who are often desperate and agitated.  The person often has what is called cognitive constriction and can see no other option in front of them except ending his or her life.  Such a patient needs professional help, not an urgent termination of pregnancy.<\/p><p>  Second, psychiatrists are doctors, not judges.  If head 4 is enacted, psychiatrists will be asked to determine if there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother in order that she may procure a termination of pregnancy.  This is a role in which Irish psychiatrists have not been involved to date.  Many will not see this as their role as medical practitioners.  The role could be construed as making psychiatrists the gatekeepers to abortion.  Psychiatric practice relates to assessment and treatment of patients, not assessment and adjudication.  Psychiatrists are not judges.<\/p><p>  My third point relates to the women who currently travel abroad for terminations.  In the submission to the committee earlier this year, the three Irish perinatal psychiatrists  - Dr. McCarthy, Dr. Fenton and myself - stated that with more than 40 years of combined clinical experience, we had not seen a single case where termination of pregnancy was the treatment for a mental disorder.  If head 4 is enacted, however, it may well change the patient profile currently seen by Irish psychiatrists.  It is likely that women will be referred from that population who currently travel for abortion.  The extent of mental health problems and suicidal ideation among that population is unknown and, hence, the utilisation of the proposed legislation by that population is unknown.<\/p><p>  Fourth, it is impossible for psychiatrists to predict the future.  The explanatory notes for head 4 state, \"It is not necessary for medical practitioners to be of the opinion that the risk to the woman's life is inevitable or immediate\".  The risk of a woman dying by suicide in pregnancy is between one in 250,000 and one in 500,000 live births.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Sheehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369039800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Sheehan.

On head 4, how do the witnesses see the role of the panel in terms of a woman's crisis pregnancy?  She may or may not visit her GP or may present at an accident and emergency unit.  Her first port of contact, probably, will be through a psychiatrist if she is to go forward for assessment under the panel process.  There would be a psychiatrist who would assess the woman in distress.  If she felt that the only option available to her was a termination there would be a second assessment by another psychiatrist and an obstetrician.  What I am trying to understand is whether the witnesses believe it should be just an assessment process or an assessment with care?  In other words, when a woman presents to a psychiatrist I presume it is not a just a box-ticking exercise.  I assume they would look at all avenues to see what supports this particular woman in crisis pregnancy needs, as opposed to just assessment, and moving her on to somewhere else.  Many people are very concerned about this particular area.  I would like clarity on where the witnesses see a role not necessarily on the adjudication but on the counselling, assistance and support.<\/p><p>  There is another area I wish to question.  Dr. John Sheehan points out that every year an unknown number of women go abroad in crisis pregnancy for a termination.  We do not know the exact number who are in deep crisis mentally and psychologically.  He said there could be an increase in the profile of people who will present under this legislation.  One could argue it is a good thing that women would now try to seek support, assistance and counselling when in crisis pregnancy as opposed to just making the fateful decision of getting on an aeroplane and going to Britain without any supports or services around them.  Perhaps he would elaborate on that particular issue?<\/p><p>  The other issue is that if legislation is passed, it will need resourcing, particularly if there is an increase in presentations by women who may be suicidal or with suicidal intent or suicidal ideation.  One may argue that is a good thing because they would be making contact with the health services but do we have the resources in terms of psychiatrist assessment, supports and counselling if there is an increase in the number of women seeking assistance or a determination on their mental status?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000005#D00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1369039800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I join with the Chairman in welcoming each of our guests this morning.  I wish to put a question specifically to Dr. McCarthy.  In relation to the five obligations of the State as set out in the expert group report two of them are referred to as follows: to establish criteria or procedures in legislation or otherwise for measuring or determining the risk to her life, and the other, to provide precision as to the criteria by which a doctor is to assess that risk.  Does Dr. McCarthy believe that the draft legislation before us fulfils both of those two criteria from his professional perspective?  For the panel, there is a requirement for three professional opinions, somebody from obstetrics and two psychiatrists.  I would like to ask for your individual opinion.  We would like to know, whether, in the witnesses' respective opinions, this number is too high?  Does the requirement of unanimity of all three medical professionals render it difficult or, perhaps, even unworkable in practice and place an undue burden on the woman?  In relation to their respective experiences - and they have indicated they reflect both City of Dublin and outside the City of Dublin experiences - will the issue of conscientious objection have any impact on the numbers available, those in practice associated with the respective 19 indicated-for-approval sites?  Many psychiatrists are not actually associated with any of these yet one must be in terms of the way the draft legislation is presented.  Do you see difficulties presenting there?  In your own opinion, who should lead the process?  It is not clear in the legislation whether it should be an obstetrician or two psychiatrists.  One would expect it would be one, at least, of the two psychiatrists and that person would be attached to the individual site.<\/p><p>  In regard to the appeals process because it is particular to head 4 on suicidality, is the timeframe reasonable and workable?  Before the Chair pulls me up, as we have only three minutes to ask questions and elicit as much information as possible, I wish to ask Dr. Maeve Doyle, in her role as child and adolescent psychiatrist, if the Bill deals adequately or at all with consentive and minor adults or adults without capacity - that may or may not be under her particular expertise but perhaps she would like to offer her opinion.  That is very important.  She is only one of two voices coming from a child and adolescent view over the course of today's hearings.

Part one of the test for abortion on suicide grounds, as per the X case, is that as a matter of probability there must be a real threat posed to the life of the mother by way of self-destruction.  Can psychiatrists judge, as a matter of probability, whether someone will commit suicide?  Can they point to any published research supporting their answer and their views?  Would they contend that this part of the X case test is generally unachievable from a psychiatric perspective?  The X case judgment stated that abortion could be the only way of treating suicidal ideation.  Is there psychiatric evidence for what that judgment presupposed, namely, that abortion can be a form of unnecessary mental health treatment?<\/p><p>  In paragraph four of his submission, Dr. John Sheehan said that in a psychiatric emergency, speedy delivery of the baby is contraindicated as it is likely that the patient has an impaired capacity and should be advised not to make irrevocable decisions in such a state.

We stated in our submission that we feel nothing in this legislation should subvert the usual pathway to care.  We would expect that a woman who finds she has a crisis pregnancy would go to crisis pregnancy counselling services but that we would see anybody who needs input from a specialist psychiatric service.  We suggested in our submission that if it is a case in which, perhaps due to conscientious objection, there is no psychiatrist to see the woman, she would be referred to a panel set up by the HSE.<\/p><p>  In respect of women who travel, it is very clear, and we have the figures to show, that at least 4,000 Irish women are having abortions in the UK every year.  We presume the vast majority of these women are mentally and physically very healthy.  They have nothing to do with psychiatry and psychiatrists have nothing to do with them.  My concern is for the vulnerable women who may have a crisis and may travel for an abortion and it may not be the right thing for them.  We do not have a culture or environment in Ireland in which the woman feels she can discuss that and talk openly about it.  The other woman is the one who travels for an abortion and believes that the only alternative to that abortion would be to kill herself.  We need to ask what kind of a State we are that we would allow a woman to travel in that state.  If this legislation can do something about that, it is to be welcomed.  <\/p><p>  My colleagues mentioned resources.  For community mental health teams and particularly social workers, every community mental health team in the country should have the full multidisciplinary team.<\/p><p>  In respect of the requirement for three doctors, we generally feel as psychiatrists that we are the ones with the expertise in managing suicide risk.  There has been much talk about predicting suicide risk, but when anybody who is suicidal comes to us, it is our job to assess what is going on for them.  What are the factors and what is happening that leads them to believe that killing themselves would be a thing to do?  We engage with them - not just the psychiatrist but every member of the team - in finding a way to ensure we can keep that person safe.  That is what we do as psychiatrists.  We do it every day and we know how to do that well.<\/p><p>  In respect of the timeframe, the decision should never be rushed, but a psychiatric assessment does not need to take days.  For many of these women we would be talking about two or three hours for the assessment, but one can do a second or third one within a few days, so the important thing is that the woman is not left in distress.  <\/p><p>  In respect of the degree to which we can predict the risk of suicide, as I have emphasised, what is most important is that anybody who is suicidal feels able to access the service and talk openly about their concerns and fears.

One difficulty we have is that we may have a reasonable idea of the numbers of women who travel for terminations but we have no data on the extent of mental health problems in that group.  We have no data on how many of those women are suicidal, so when people make comments about this group, they are entirely speculative because we have no data.  Would anything that encourages women who travel for terminations to come for help be a good thing?  Of course it would.  One only has to look at people such as Bressie on the television last weekend or Alan Quinlan, the Lions and Ireland rugby player, talking about mental health issues and reducing stigma.  Anything we can do to help people come forward and seek appropriate help is clearly a very good thing.  If that happened, I would be delighted to see it.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the difficult question of the numbers - whether there should be two psychiatrists and an obstetrician, and the number of specialists that is required.  The core of this question is whether anybody has the capacity to identify that one woman in 250,000 who will go on to commit suicide.  Whether it is one, two or three doctors, the number does not improve one's ability to identify that woman in 250,000 to 500,000 because it is impossible to predict with any accuracy when one is looking at statistics as significant as that.  The number issue is a difficult one because one is in an area of trying to predict something that is extremely rare.  <\/p><p>  It must also be said that when we look at the information from the confidential inquiries and the forensic examination of the case histories of women who died by suicide in pregnancy, we see that the very small number of women who die are women with major mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder or with alcohol dependence or serious drug problems.  This is the group we are dealing with.  When one looks at psychiatric involvement, often the psychiatrist is looking at specific risk factors.  As Dr. McCarthy mentioned earlier, when we see people with a mental disorder who are deemed to be an immediate risk to themselves or others, the current psychiatric practice is to detain that person is hospital.  That, of course, is completely at variance with what is proposed in the heads because they propose that someone who is deemed to have suicidal intent is able to make a decision about having a termination of pregnancy.  It is completely at odds with what one would call standard good practice in psychiatry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Sheehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369041600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank all the experts for their very compelling contributions.

Dr. McCarthy said in his statement that, \"Suicide in Pregnancy is real, a real risk, it does happen\".  That is a fact which needs to be clearly stated.  He referred to the issue of consent, in particular, with regard to children.  It is often the case that consent is regarded as one-way, that a person consents to a medical procedure.  However, a person can equally refuse to give consent for a procedure.  We need to be very mindful of the use of the word, \"consent\" with regard to the child.  I am thinking in particular of children in care.  If I am correct in reading between the lines, other children may have choices because their parents may choose to travel with those children but a child in care will not have that choice.  What if the parents do not agree to that?  What if that child is in care because of parental abuse, yet the parents may interfere in the choice made by their child?  This is an extreme situation which may only arise in one case, but that is still a child in the care of the State.  <\/p><p>  In the view of the experts, should the legislation include a specific provision with regard to children in the care of the State?

I will not refer specifically to the child issue because Dr. Maeve Doyle has covered it well and adequately.  I note that, again, there are technicalities on which we really must work and while none of them is insuperable, we must work on them.  In addition, I will not answer anything further about clinical markers, as that point already has been made.<\/p><p>  Yes, suicide is a fact.  When people talk about figures, such as one in 500,000 or one in 250,000, it is desperately important to note we actually do not have a clue because these figures are based on the fact that this is a country, the United Kingdom, in which abortion is directly available.  I am on that confidential inquiry that considers those maternal deaths to which Dr. John Sheehan has referred but, yes, absolutely, those who commit suicide in the United Kingdom at present nearly always are mentally ill.  However, that does not at all account for all the other hundreds of thousands of women who have terminations in England and who may well be mentally distressed and may well have that termination because they are suicidal.  Nothing captures that at present and nothing will.  Consequently, one must be very cautious about that sort of evidence.<\/p><p>  Again, I will not address Deputy Fitzpatrick's questions too much because I believe I covered that issue in my opening statement.  I agree that some people have mental illness and it must be treated.  In the case of some people, it is mental distress.  In the reality of our clinical work, we really are dealing with the complex interaction between stress, distress and mental disorder.  If only life were black and white and one could say these ones are mentally ill and should be treated psychiatrically by getting them into hospital and observing them carefully, whereas these ones are in psychosocial distress and should be dismissed.  That is not life and every one of you in this room knows that.  It is much more complex than that and our jobs and experience are to weigh up these factors.  As for the woman who refuses alternatives, we are not naive.  If a woman comes to me, having refused all other alternatives, my question will be \"Why?\".  Why is she sitting in front of me if her only option is a termination of pregnancy?  Why has she not gone to England?  This will be part of the process as we are not fools and it will be a highly complex discussion.  The question will be whether she is trying to test the legislation or is it the case she cannot leave the country for some reason.  As for the idea that this would be blocked in some way or that she will present in that way, namely, that she refuses everything else and consequently it is up to me, in itself that is a very complex interaction.  We are used to dealing with people who put us under all sorts of stress to make decisions.  Dr. John Sheehan made reference to people in the emergency department who threaten to kill themselves unless they are given some methadone because their methadone was stolen in the hostel.  We are used to being put under pressure.  While that might seem like a job that most of you would not like, I love my work.  It is really complex but it also is very human.  We are aware of the complexities and interactions and are not naive.<\/p><p>  A member, whose name I did not get, asked a very good question about multidisciplinary teams.  While we work in multidisciplinary teams, there are times when, as psychiatrists, we are the ones who must make that final decision.  We have talked a bit about involuntary detention within hospital and it is the consultant's name that goes on that form.  Similarly, for someone who has been previously detained, it is the consultant's name that goes on the discharge from hospital form.  If that patient appeals against his or her detention in hospital, I as a consultant must go into that room and defend.  It is not my multidisciplinary team, just me.  Consequently, as psychiatrists we are used to being the individuals who take these decisions.  That is our responsibility and duty and is one for which we all are very well trained.<\/p><p>  On the viability issue, I agree there are highly complex issues about viability.  I think that really is up to our obstetric colleagues to deal with.  There are of course complex, painful issues that sometimes must be dealt with.  If a woman is six weeks pregnant, my conversation with her will be very different when compared with that with a woman who is 16 weeks or 26 weeks pregnant.  We know that.  Why does she wish to get rid of that baby?  Does she wish to get rid of the baby or does she wish to kill herself?  Moreover, if she wants to get rid of that baby, is it because she cannot bear having that baby inside her?  Perhaps she has an eating disorder and already has taken three overdoses in the course of that pregnancy because she cannot deal with that real distress.  I am sure it is difficult for all of you to understand but I refer to an anorectic who sees herself as totally fat and the issue actually is that she wants the baby out.  This is in contrast to someone else who wants that baby killed because it is her father's child or because she actually is in a relationship with a guy who she should have left years ago.  When she got pregnant, in that ridiculous way she would do, she kind of imagined that somehow having a baby with him might make him be nice.  However, we know that, actually, men are more likely to have affairs during their partner's pregnancy and certainly levels of domestic violence increase during pregnancy.  We men do not come out well out of all this.  This is a woman who already has been kicked three times in the stomach in pregnancy and who knows now that if she is pregnant, her issue is that if she has this baby, she will never get away from him, because he will be the father of the child and she will be obliged to stay in this country because he will have rights.  Consequently, she has a choice, namely, does she kill herself or does she get rid of that baby or perhaps both, but if she has that baby she is stuck.  If this conversation takes place at 16 weeks or 22 weeks, yes, we would try to help as much as we can.  However, if anyone can say there never will be a woman in this circumstance, he or she really does not understand the messy, horrible nature of life sometimes.  I refer to the real mess, the bloody issues that go on.  That is the reality which we must deal with and assess, not as cold pre-judgmental black-and-white people but as real professionals who understand mental illness, mental disorder and capacity, but who also understand that, sometimes, it is not black and white and is not easy.<\/p><p>  Finally, while talking about bloody issues, let me get back to infanticide, to which I referred the last day I was here.  I got a lovely letter from a priest afterwards thanking me for raising this horrible part of Irish history, namely, the history of hundreds of women who committed infanticide every single year in this country during the 19th century and the first 50 years of the 20th century.  Wonderful studies have been done on this issue and these were real.  The study to which Dr. John Sheehan referred is about infanticide now and not about infanticide then.  Infanticide then was not all about mental illness or anything like that.  It was about women who found themselves in extremely difficult situations.  The treatment of unmarried women, women with unwanted pregnancies in this country is not great, is it?  I refer to the Magdalen laundries, industrial schools and psychiatric hospitals.  We as a profession played our part in having women in hospitals for many years.  For what reason?  We colluded with unwanted pregnancies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369043400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>We have 23 minutes remaining in the session.

First, that psychiatrists have the experience and expertise to assess suicide risk, that it is something they all do routinely and that in particular they are used to operating within the statutory framework of the Mental Health Act and of adjudicating on detaining people against their will on the basis of their clinical assessment.  That is very helpful to us in the context of some of the comments we heard on Friday.  It is also helpful to hear from them that abortion is not a treatment for mental illness but rather it may in rare cases be required in order to avert the risk of suicide.  That is the language of the Supreme Court and of the heads of the Bill.  That is helpful as that is what we need to work within.<\/p><p>  Psychiatrists have also pointed out the highly restrictive nature of the legislation, and as a result the reality that for the majority of women who travel &ndash; the 4,000 women - every year for abortion will continue to do so and will not avail of the highly restrictive procedures in this country.  Dr. Doyle put it extremely clearly that the majority of the very small number of women or girls who will avail of the measure will be those in the care of the HSE who are unable to travel otherwise.  The comments on the amendments on children are very important.<\/p><p>  I wish to ask a couple of specific questions on other points about amendments.  In head 4 there are currently two specific restrictions on psychiatrists requiring that both of the psychiatrists will be employed at a centre registered by the Mental Health Commission and that one would be attached to an institution where a procedure is carried out, in other words, a maternity unit.  Concern was expressed on Friday that this was too restrictive, as there would be too small a pool of psychiatrists from which to choose.  Could the witnesses comment on the point and whether we should broaden the definition?<\/p><p>  As a criminal lawyer I am extremely concerned about the definition of the criminal offence involved in a head that has not yet been referred to today, head 19, in particular the criminalisation of women.  Some of the witnesses have pointed out the reality that many young women in particular are availing of abortion pills over the Internet resulting in self-induced abortion in this jurisdiction.  Under the current wording they would be subject to criminalisation and a 14-year penalty.  As psychiatrists, do the witnesses believe that would have a chilling effect on women seeking help in after care?<\/p><p>  My final question is for Dr. Sheehan.  I apologise if I misunderstood him, but is he suggesting that a girl like X who is suicidal because of her pregnancy and has been denied an abortion would never commit suicide?

The reality is psychiatrists do not change the Constitution but they determine psychiatric practice and the psychiatric evidence base.  Therefore, when constitutionally mandated psychiatrists at some hypothetical &ndash; I believe it may never happen &ndash; occasion in the future are confronted with a pregnant woman who is suicidal and are asked to make an adjudication within the rules of the law which we will be asked to pass sometime during 2013, it is their job to formulate the evidence base which best informs the psychiatrists who will be in that position.

If we believe that there will be a net transfer of women who are now going to the UK for abortions to this country - in the event that this new regime occurs - we have to ask why.  It will happen for one of two reasons.  The first reason is that they are legitimately going to the UK because they are suicidal to seek a legal abortion which they believe might not be freely and legally available in this country.  The other alternative is that they are not going to the UK because they are suicidal but will try to game our system.  To game our system they will need to do it with the free, voluntary, informed collusion of two psychiatrists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000011#K00900","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369044000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>This morning I looked at the logo for the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland - wisdom, learning and compassion - and those are what this Bill is about.

Abortion is an irrevocable decision which would be recommended.<\/p><p>  On a point made about the X case, would the witnesses comment on the progress in psychiatric medical evidence in the last 21 years since the X case?

It is a complex issue and we could talk about it for hours.  That is why the Legislature has been resting for a very long time trying to get capacity legislation.  Capacity is not a simple concept.  Someone can be mentally ill and still have capacity.  Someone might not be mentally ill but not have capacity.  A person could have capacity for some decision making but not others.  It could be due to mental disability or brain injury.  It is a complex issue but we certainly must think about it when making any of these decisions.<\/p><p>  Have I ever certified someone?  I have certified a woman into hospital who wanted to kill her baby.  She had a delusional voice in her head telling her to do that.  Clearly abortion would not have been the treatment of choice.  She was very distressed at the time but very relieved afterwards.  Equally, I have seen people who have stabbed themselves in the stomach and who have taken multiple overdoses in pregnancy who were not mentally ill, they were profoundly distressed and at serious risk to their own life and the life of the baby.  We must dismiss the notion that somehow we can neatly discriminate between mental illness and distress because they interact.<\/p><p>  I answered the question on the issue of the 26 weeks and suicidality the last time.

Senator Bacik asked if I could state that X would never commit suicide.  I do not believe any psychiatrist or doctor can ever make a statement that a certain person will never commit suicide.  It is equally true, however, that it is also impossible for a doctor to state that somebody will commit suicide.  The position in which psychiatrists are potentially placed by the legislation is to state that there is a real and substantial risk that the person will complete suicide.  Even studies that looked at very high risk populations, which do not include the population we are discussing, show that in such very high risk populations an expert will be wrong in 97 cases out of 100.  Prediction is, therefore, very difficult; in fact, the word I would use is \"impossible\".<\/p><p>  To tie this in with the issue raised by Senator Crown, psychiatrists are experts in assessment and treatment.

Has the Irish College of Psychiatrists given significant consideration to the way in which the health grounds for abortion in other jurisdictions have been abused, particularly by pro-choice physicians, to permit abortion on wider grounds?  In the United Kingdom, for instance, some medical practitioners have flouted the law by pre-signing abortion consent forms.  Should the proposed law be more cognisant of the real possibility that abortion safeguards will be flouted, especially by those who consider that such safeguards limit the expression of abortion rights?<\/p><p>  If the experts formed the opinion that a patient who was 20 weeks pregnant was suicidal and this constituted a real and substantial risk to her life which could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, would they feel obliged, under the proposed legislation, to try to delay the termination for a number of weeks until the baby was viable or should the law in this case explicitly provide for such an obligation?  Are the experts familiar with what occurred in the State of California before the United States Supreme Court decided in Roe <i>v<\/i>. Wade that abortions could be performed for a variety of reasons, including to preserve the mental health of a pregnant woman, and only if a hospital committee consisting of two or, in some cases, three physicians unanimously agreed that the pregnant woman was suffering from a mental illness to such an extent that she was dangerous to herself or to the person or property of others or was in need of supervision or restraint?  The standard was essentially the same standard as that used for civil commitment.  It is highly relevant, despite this highly restrictive exception made in 1970, that more than 65,000 abortions were approved by hospital committees and almost 63,000 abortions were performed.  Clearly, physicians who believed in the right to abortion manipulated the inherent subjectivity of the mental health ground for abortion to make abortion more accessible.  On what possible basis can we be assured that, over time, this psychiatric exception in head 4 will not be similarly abused?  Should the safeguards in the draft Bill not be strengthened to counter against such abuse?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000013#M00500","speaker":"1019"},{"type":"speech","time":1369044600,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank all the experts.

Were they consulted on the paper presented by the College of Psychiatrists?<\/p><p>  Dr. Sheehan makes an interesting point that psychiatrists, as medical practitioners, do not view this as an appropriate function.  Does he mean that this is not so much a matter of conscientious objection but one that is not considered to be good medicine by many psychiatrists?<\/p><p>  He also states that speedy delivery is contraindicated.

Is there a precedent for that?  We hear of court cases where people ask, for example, not to be deported and mention that they are suicidal and we sympathise very deeply with such situations.  Have psychiatrists ever certified for something that would be to the detriment of the rights of a constitutionally-protected actor, in this case the unborn, or indeed, somebody else?  Have they ever certified against somebody else's best interests?<\/p><p> In the view of the psychiatrists, where abortion is certified, is there any way of knowing that this will not turn out to be adverse to a woman's mental health?  We are conscious of the non-existence of any evidence based on the cohort of people who present as suicidal, but there does appear to be evidence, albeit contested, that there is a low to moderate increase in mental health risk to women associated with abortion.

My first question is directed to Dr. Maeve Doyle, who is sharing her experience of the very complex area of child and adolescent mental health.  Under this proposed law, could Dr. Doyle grant a 14 year old pregnant girl with suicidal intent an abortion without her parents' consent?  Where are the parents in this situation?  What about the situation where one parent agrees but the other does not, in the case of separation, for example?  I am conscious that this is a very complex area.  A young person in care may already have suffered abuse, abandonment and so forth, but are we not in danger of loading another injury on her with abortion, knowing that there is evidence that post-abortion, girls and women do experience suicidal thoughts?<\/p><p>  My next question is directed to Dr. John Sheehan and concerns head 4.  In the last few months we learned about a brave young man, Donal Walsh, now sadly passed on, who asked young people to turn away from suicide.  With this Bill, are we in danger of normalising suicide, suicidal threats, suicidal ideas and so forth in society, by providing for a law that is a gateway to obtaining something else?  Is this not a potentially dangerous practice, akin to a positive reinforcement?  Suicide is being used to get an outcome, in this case, an abortion.  Might I say, it need not be just an abortion?  If the Government passed a law tomorrow morning providing a mechanism whereby a person could get a 50% reduction in his or her mortgage once there was a stated, certified risk that he or she was suicidal, a lot of people would surely avail of that.  We are talking about changing behavioural norms here.  We have seen this happen in other jurisdictions which has led to the opening of the floodgates.  Why, therefore, should we have head 4 if there is even a possibility of its abuse, when balanced against two rights, namely, the right to evidence-based treatment for the pregnant woman and the right to life for the unborn child?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000014#N00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1369045200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their very helpful, valuable and insightful contributions to the proceedings this morning.

He expressed very serious concerns on the national airwaves about the prospect of vulnerable pregnant women having to present in front of a panel of psychiatrists and obstetricians.  He went on to say, subsequent to the interview he gave to \"Morning Ireland\", that he felt that many of his peers from the College of Psychiatrists would be very reluctant to engage in that process.  Is there a fear that the void that creates - if it does create a void - could be filled by more liberal-thinking psychiatrists?

Can a trend be identified in research over the past ten or 15 years relating to abortion and women's mental health?  I note that the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK issued a report in 2008 which very much departed from its earlier position on this issue.

I cannot promise him that no doctor in the country will do that, in the same way that I cannot promise it for any politician, obstetrician or, indeed, anyone else in this country.  I can certainly say that the standard in psychiatry, in general, is such that I would hope, at all times, practitioners would not do that.  Anybody who does that is breaking the law.  There is a constitutional obligation to protect the life of the unborn, where that is practicable and I would hope that every psychiatrist in the country would practice that.  I agree that society in general should be alert to the possibility that individuals may flout the law and it is the responsibility of the State to make sure that does not happen.<\/p><p>  In response to Senator Mullen's question about Department of Health contact, as far as I am aware, as a college, we were not contacted in any way.

I was asked to check if it was true that there were really only three perinatal psychiatrists in the country.  In the body politic, the question had arisen of having three or even six people to assess women and having another six to assess on appeal.  That would mean that 12 people would be involved and I was asked if it was true that there were only three perinatal psychiatrists here.  I was also asked for some of the details of attachment.  I was consulted about that specific question but not about anything else.<\/p><p>  I was asked if I believed my contribution was taken on board.  I would point out first that it was not my contribution but a joint statement to the Oireachtas agreed by myself, Dr. Fenton, Dr. Sheehan and Dr. Doyle.

It was a contribution from three of us as perinatal psychiatrists and Dr. Doyle as a child psychiatrist, who we wanted to be there.

I really do hope that our contributions are taken on board and I think some of the heads of the Bill do reflect some learning that is going on for the legislature and the Department.  <\/p><p>  Regarding the particular issue I spoke about in the aforementioned radio interview, I had heard that there was a possibility of many psychiatrists being involved.  Then<i> The Sunday Times<\/i> published an article suggesting that up to 12 doctors might be involved in assessments.  Frankly, I thought it was my responsibility, as somebody who deals with difficult women, to speak up.  Who came up with the conception that a woman who might be suicidally depressed in pregnancy would see 12 people?  What was he or she thinking?  Was the thinking based on the idea of some young girl who got drunk one night and had casual sex, who did not take the pill and got pregnant, and who would come along and fool us and, therefore, we must have 12 people to hear her?  Did he or she ever think that this woman may have been sexually abused or raped, that the baby might be her father's or that she might have already tried to remove that baby by stabbing herself in the stomach?  How could such a woman be expected to talk to 12 people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000014#N00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369045800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>The proposed legislation is very restrictive and with regard to my role as a perinatal psychiatrist, I would not be intending to abuse it.

As psychiatrists, we see ourselves as dealing with people who are vulnerable.  Similarly to the obstetricians, we believe that the people, to whom this law will apply, will be coming to us anyway.  I do not think a situation will arise where there will be opportunities for that.<\/p><p>  On the next point on being contacted by the Department, I have not had any contact.  On the fact that it is not appropriate for a psychiatrist to be involved in this process, as I said earlier, if we look at the numbers of Irish women who are having abortions in the UK, the vast majority of those women are mentally and physically healthy, and that has nothing to do with psychiatrists or psychiatry.  Our concern and my concern would be for vulnerable women - the women who are making decisions to have an abortion and it may be the wrong decision for them, or the women who are travelling for abortions who are quite convinced that the only alternative to an abortion is to kill themselves.  I feel we have a responsibility both as a State and as psychiatrists to see those vulnerable women.<\/p><p>  On capacity and consent even though somebody is suicidal we see that all the time.  People can have the legal capacity to make decisions even though they are very distressed.<\/p><p>  I was asked whether there is any other situation where a psychiatrist would certify against someone else's best interest.  We would emphasise - the law is very clear on this - that we are there in the best interest of the mother and the unborn.  We are only talking about situations where if the mother dies the unborn also dies.<\/p><p>  Is there any evidence to support that the psychiatrist has no way of knowing whether the abortion would, in fact, worsen her mental health?  Certainly a vulnerable woman who has a termination in a country where she can receive care and support is surely in a much better position than a woman who feels she has to leave the State to have that termination.<\/p><p>  On the issue about normalising suicide, we are very aware that we have a very serious problem with suicide.  Reference was made to seeking a mortgage reduction.  Tragically many people have completed suicide because of financial difficulties.  In recent years, as general adult psychiatrists, we would have seen many people who on the face of it may have looked as if it was financial difficulties but in fact people, who have survived serious suicide attempts and have had an opportunity for expert and specialist care, have been able to work with us in resolving the difficulties and issues they have.  It gets back to the point that for anybody who is suicidal the important thing is having the opportunity to talk about it to have that non-judgmental compassionate hearing where we can sit down with them and try to work out what the problems are and that there is always another option other than killing themselves.<\/p><p>  On the college of psychiatry and the quotation of the report, once again I must warn - we have heard it from the beginning - about any evidence.  This is a group that is extremely difficult to have any evidence on and we have to be very aware of the tendency towards bias.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000015#O01800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Jeffers"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369045800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I will try to deal with a number of the questions.  The first was whether the abortion safeguards could be flouted.  At face value, the heads appear to be restrictive.  Yet the international experience is that what initially appeared to be very restrictive, in practice has turned out to be not restrictive.  At face value one could say the heads appear restrictive, but how it might work in practice is a different question.  Again it ties into the point I made earlier on the application of the law to women who travel.  We do not know the extent of mental health problems in that group or the extent of suicidal ideation.  Therefore we cannot say with any accuracy how this will work in practice.  On face value it looks restrictive, but the practice is another question.<\/p><p>  Senator Mullen asked about contacts with the HSE, the Department or a Minister.

Where a conflict of information or view arises, we try to drill down and find the basis for that conflict.  It is clear to me based on what I heard in January and today and from various submissions I have received, that there is clear division within the profession of psychiatrists.  Unfortunately, it is that profession with whom the buck will ultimately stop.  I do not envy them their position.  Dr. McCarthy stated that many in the profession predominantly believe that this is a social and political issue.  Unfortunately, it has landed at the door of professional psychiatrists.  <\/p><p>  Dr. Boylan mentioned on Friday that the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, which is an elected decision-making body representing more than 864 members, made a single submission on behalf of all members.  I note Dr. Boylan is not a psychiatrist and may not even be a member of that body.  If I understood Dr. Sheehan correctly that survey was made available to members this morning.  Were all 864 members surveyed and what, if any, was the response?  I note some of the witnesses were agitated about only 113 people having been surveyed, which issue I will take up with the drafters of the survey, some of whom may be here this afternoon.  It is a serious issue if people are misrepresented in that survey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000016#P00700","speaker":"1104"},{"type":"speech","time":1369046400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank the psychiatrists who have presented to us.  I have two questions for them.  First, it was stated almost universally by the witnesses that none of them has experienced the type of case for which we are seeking to provide.  Therefore, when we try to dig down we are at a bit of a loss, at least from our perspective.  However, we have the experience of the X case.  Do the witnesses believe the evidence presented in the X case would have been sufficient to justify a termination under this draft Bill?  It is a case in point that is not mentioned.<\/p><p>  Dr. Fenton stated in her address that she has not encountered any woman who required a termination of pregnancy as part of her mental illness treatment.  However, she did not rule out there ever being such a case.  I presume that best practice is in general based on clinical research.  At what point would Dr. Fenton believe that would be a safe decision to make?  Would it be at the point when there is clinical research to support such a decision or when suddenly a need arises?  I do not mean to be over-simplistic.  While the witnesses are the experts we are also looking to other jurisdictions.  We are told there may be a limit or certain perspective on the evidence available here because we currently we do not have an abortion regime, except in respect of the X case, which is more vague.  Could fears be allayed by the insertion, as is the case with the Medical Council guidelines, into the Bill that due regard be given to clinical research in the area of psychiatry?  I find it difficult to understand how, never having encountered such a case, psychiatrists could suddenly find themselves able to deal with such a situation.  I respect that it may happen but when it does would there not be a requirement to look to best practice, including in other jurisdictions if not available here, or would they wait until there is clinical research to show such a step would be required?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000016#P00800","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369046400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I am not sure if I should respond to Deputy Timmins's question about the expert group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000016#P00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1369046400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>It is not relevant to the heads of the Bill.

We speak about suicidal ideation, intent or plans but when one tries to quantify the extent of the problem, one examines the number of women dying by suicide in pregnancy.  That goes back to the confidential inquiries in the UK, which offer the only reliable data at present.  Out of more than 2.5 million deliveries over a three year period, there were four deaths in pregnancy by suicide.  Each of these deaths was likely related to serious mental illness.

If people could keep their comments brief, it will allow for greater participation by members.<\/p><p>  I welcome to this session Dr. Yolande Ferguson, Dr. Peadar O'Grady, Professor Veronica O'Keane and Dr. Eamonn Moloney.  Like all of our expert witnesses, they are here to assist and give of their time voluntarily.  I thank them most sincerely for being here and assisting us.  Before we commence, I remind them of the position on privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  With that, I call on Dr. O'Grady to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000018#S00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369047300,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I am very grateful to be able to make an opening statement to the committee.  I am giving a statement on behalf of Doctors for Choice Ireland.  I have had experience as a consultant child psychiatrist for the past 20 years but also some specific experience of certifying children and young adults under the terms of the Supreme Court judgment in terms of their eligibility to access an abortion, not something of which there is much experience.  I understand Dr. Maeve Doyle referred to this earlier in terms of the types of women or children who might end up being dealt with under the legislation, as proposed.<\/p><p>  According to the World Health Organization's 2012 document, Safe abortion, &quot;In nearly all developed countries, safe abortions are legally available upon request or under broad social and economic grounds, and services are generally easily accessible and available&quot;.  This largely applies to the services Irish women avail of in the United Kingdom every year.  In Ireland the proposed legislation to deal with access to abortion services arose from the Supreme Court's judgment in 1992 that a 14 year old child had a constitutional right to have an abortion in Ireland because of the risk of suicide.  Doctors for Choice Ireland welcomes any improvement in the care of women and children who choose to have an abortion.  However, we believe reassurance is needed that the Bill will in practice provide for an effective and accessible procedure in a situation similar to that of the 14 year old child in the X case.  The risk of suicide in the X case arose in a situation where a pregnant child had become suicidal when she was unable to travel, having decided to have an abortion while pregnant as the result of rape by an adult neighbour.<\/p><p>  The opinion of many psychiatrists and other doctors internationally is that the risk of suicide is increased by having access to abortion restricted.  While I am not going to go into the detail of how that came about, the internationally renowned psychiatrist Professor Robert Kendell summed this up well in 1991 in his review in the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>.  The title of the paper is, &quot;Suicide in pregnancy ... much rarer now: thanks to contraception, legal abortion and less punitive attitudes&quot;, reminding us of the issue of stigma involved in suicide in pregnancy.<\/p><p>  In Ireland restricted access to abortion services is most likely to arise as a result of an inability to travel, a point made well this morning by Dr. Anthony McCarthy, president of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.  This means that women who are too sick, young, poor or disabled to travel are at particularly high risk.  Women who are migrants or whose pregnancy involves a fatal foetal abnormality or which arose as a result of rape or child sexual abuse also experience difficulty in accessing abortions through impairment of their ability to travel.  Children are not specifically mentioned in the legislation, even though they are more likely to experience difficulties in their ability to travel for an abortion and to be at increased risk of suicide as a result.  The costs of travel for an abortion are higher for children as they usually require a parent or guardian to travel with them because of their greater requirement for practical and emotional support.<\/p><p>  Our concerns about the legislation come under three headings: delays in accessing abortion which might occur, the exclusion of certain categories from access to abortion and criminalisation of women and health workers who take part in abortions which do not meet the guidelines laid down.<\/p><p>  As for delays, Doctors for Choice Ireland is particularly concerned that the Bill contains elements that will cause unnecessary delay in accessing abortion services, causing an unnecessary prolonging of an emergency level of risk and requiring more complicated procedures because of that delay, for example, surgical instead of medical abortions.  In Britain most abortions are medical abortions.  They do not involve a surgical procedure and do not, in fact, involve an obstetrician, which is a notable point.<\/p><p>  In the case of eligibility for abortion on the basis of a risk of suicide, imposing a requirement for three doctors will cause unnecessary delay and, including the general practitioner, we may be talking about four doctors.  There is no medical basis for differentiating between a medical emergency and a psychiatric emergency, as the Bill does, a point alluded to by Professor Murphy of the Medical Council on Friday.  All psychiatric emergencies are medical emergencies.  Only one psychiatrist or GP is required to certify eligibility for an abortion.  It is clearly the view of Doctors for Choice Ireland that one does not need any doctor to certify eligibility for an abortion as a necessity, but, if one wants to, only one is required.  Obstetricians should not certify eligibility in cases of suicide risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000018#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar O'Grady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369047900,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Grady.

I am a consultant general adult and community psychiatrist based in the Dublin south central psychiatric service and also in Tallaght Hospital.  I am a member of the faculty of the adult executive of the Irish College of Psychiatry and a member of the Joint Forum on Mental Health between the Irish College of Psychiatrists and the Irish College of General Practitioners.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee for this opportunity and I welcome this legislation.  Psychiatrists are unique among medical practitioners in that we deal with legislation as part of our everyday routine clinical practice in the form of the Mental Health Act 2001.  We have extensive experience in performing assessments to ascertain whether our patients meet the legal criteria set down in that Act.  We also routinely defend those decisions in mental health tribunals.  We bring that expertise and experience to the enactment of this legislation.<\/p><p>  I will restrict my statement to heads 4, 6 and 8.  I believe the constitution of the assessment group in heads 4 and 8 requires revision.  These heads address an infrequent circumstance.  For the most part, this represents a woman or child in the early stages of pregnancy who is distressed because she is pregnant and generally does not have a mental illness.  They are most likely to present to their general practitioner in the first instance.  If the doctor dealing with them is sufficiently concerned, he or she will then make a referral to the appropriate local psychiatric service.  Psychiatric services in Ireland, like most other countries, are arranged on a geographical basis with community mental health teams addressing the needs of the local community.  There are also specialist teams who provide for the needs of children, as Dr. Peadar O'Grady mentioned, and for those with intellectual disability.  The psychiatrists who are the clinical leads for these teams are expert in assessing suicidal risk, whatever the circumstance.  The general practitioner has been assigned a peripheral role in this legislation, a consultative one.  They should have a central role, followed by an assessment by one psychiatrist, in line with the procedures under the Mental Health Act.  This means that two doctors would be involved in the assessment process, which would thus not differentiate psychiatry from other medical specialties in this legislation.<\/p><p>  The assessment group in both heads is made up of an obstetrician and two psychiatrists.  First, as was mentioned by Dr. Peadar O'Grady,  there is a requirement that both psychiatrists are attached to an institution registered with the Mental Health Commission.  This does not reflect psychiatric practice.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists are rarely attached to such an institution.  Some general adult psychiatrists who provide community-based care are also not attached to an institution because their services divide the inpatient and the outpatient roles.  I suggest that this be replaced by a psychiatrist who is entered on the specialist register with the Medical Council.  The head also states that one psychiatrist must be attached to an obstetric unit, and again this was raised as an issue this morning.  The head and the explanatory note contradict one another in that the head states attached to &quot;an<i><\/i>appropriate place&quot; and the explanatory note states attached to &quot;the appropriate place&quot;.  While clarification is required as to whether the head specifically demands that the psychiatrist must be attached to the unit in which the procedure would take place, I recommend that this requirement be removed.  These are women and children who cannot contemplate reaching the point of the booking appointment for an obstetric unit that is the usual entry to perinatal psychiatry.  This requirement imposes an unnecessary restriction.  Their needs can be accurately assessed by an appropriate specialist, such as a general adult or child and adolescent psychiatrist.<\/p><p>  I propose that a panel be established by the Executive, much as the Mental Health Commission forms a panel for the workings of the Mental Health Act.  Ideally, the psychiatrist who is involved in their care would be on the panel to provide the psychiatric opinion.  I should add that an obstetrician should not be expected to perform assessments out of their area of expertise.  It is also proposed that a consensus must be reached between all three doctors.  Could we envisage where an obstetrician is placed in a position where they veto the assessment of two psychiatrists on the assessment of the risk of suicide?  As the head is currently written, the woman or child could have seen up to four doctors, including her general practitioner, at the end of the assessment process.  If the case proceeds to an appeal, she will have been seen by a total of seven doctors.  The time period for the appeal process set out in heads 6 and 8 should be shortened to a maximum of 72 hours for each stage of the appeal.<\/p><p>  This legislation must serve to alleviate rather than add to the distress of the women and children for whose needs it seeks to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000019#T00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Yolande Ferguson"},{"type":"speech","time":1369047900,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ferguson.

I led a national perinatal psychiatry service in London for five years in the Maudsley Hospital serving all of the UK.  I was concurrently head of perinatal psychiatry in King's College Medical School, from where I led a research programme in perinatal depression.  I have published extensively in the scientific literature and I have written a book on perinatal psychiatric disorders during pregnancy.  I have co-authored the standard clinical assessment tool for perinatal psychiatric disorder and I was an expert for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, NICE, UK guidelines for the management of perinatal depression in the UK.  I have set up two general hospital psychiatric services, with one in Beaumont Hospital and another at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.  I have researched and published on the topic of suicide assessment.<\/p><p>  I am delighted to be here today and to have the privilege of advising our legislators on the heads of the protection of life during pregnancy Bill.  The sole purpose of this legislation is to provide law as established in the Supreme Court ruling in the X case; namely, to provide a service for women who, unless they have an abortion, are in danger of dying.  A woman's right to this service has been established in Ireland in our law and Constitution.  There has been vigorous campaigning against the right for women to have their lives protected during pregnancy established in primary legislation.<\/p><p>  Our role, as psychiatrists, is to facilitate the provision of this proposed service for women who express suicidal intent and request an abortion in this context.  Women who are suicidal because of an unintended or unwanted pregnancy - I will refer to this as a crisis pregnancy - will be the main users of this service, given the extreme rarity of requests for abortion in women who are mentally ill during pregnancy.  Primary care, adult and child psychiatrists, rather than specialist services, should and will be the main service providers.  We have been told by the European Court of Human Rights that the service should be \"accessible and efficient\".  To this end, a national panel of those prepared to lawfully engage with this process should be established and an efficient executive should be put in place to efficiently administer requests for termination of pregnancy by Irish citizens.  The GP should make the recommendation for an abortion and one psychiatrist should assess the suicidal risk.  Details of the practical implementation of these recommendations are contained in my Oireachtas submission.  My colleagues have given recommendations, all of which I agree with.<\/p><p>  Some legislators may continue to hold and express views about the \"suicide\" clause.  A consistent argument is that \"allowing\" the suicide clause will remove the only effective barrier to \"abortion on demand\" and will provide a mechanism for women who want an abortion to get one, even if they are not genuinely suicidal.  The argument goes that some psychiatrists will be complicit in this process or may not have the requisite professional skills to be able to predict suicide.  Another argument is that abortion is not good for mental health and is not a treatment for suicidal intent.<\/p><p>  Underlying all these arguments are deeply problematic assumptions about the credibility of women, the reliability of psychiatry as a medical discipline, the meaning and management of expressed suicidal intent and the concept that doctors or legislators have the power to control women's reproductive autonomy.  The proponents of these arguments have caused some confusion, and the arguments require clarification so that head 4 can be implemented and run without unnecessary obstructions.<\/p><p>  First, with regard to credibility of women, we do not practise psychiatry by disbelieving patients.  A key ethical principle underlying all medical care is the relationship of trust that is taken to exist between a doctor and the patient.  We regard all patients whom we see, in the first instance, as being truthful and credible.  Second, with regard to the scientific evidence that suicidal ideation is difficult to assess, it has previously been said by people in the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland that we measure suicidal intent using clinically established markers.  A crisis pregnancy is an emotionally traumatic experience which is potentially life-changing, and a woman who expresses sudden-onset suicidal intent is at a high risk of killing herself.<\/p><p>  We do not require scientific evidence to understand the self-evident truth that young women in crisis kill themselves.  Some 20% of deaths among young Irish women are by suicide or self-destruction, that is, in the same age range when women are most likely also to have an abortion.  In other words, suicide is a common cause of death and is a recognised public health problem that is part of a national clinical programme in this country.  The message that suicidal intent is difficult to assess and manage is untrue and the national office for suicide prevention is holding workshops for caregivers to help ordinary and non-professional individuals identify suicide risk, helping to increase the safety of individuals experiencing suicidal ideation and get further help.  The message we want to get to people is that we can efficiently and safely manage suicidal ideation.<\/p><p>  The phrase \"abortion is not a treatment for suicide\" has been iterated and reiterated, as has the contention that there was unanimous agreement among psychiatrists at the Oireachtas hearings in January that this was the case.  This is not true.  I gave evidence at the Oireachtas hearings in January and I did not give any evidence to support or reject the idea that abortion is a treatment for suicide.  This is recorded as a matter of fact and was witnessed by this committee.  The reason I would never say this is because a treatment implies that a doctor prescribes or at the very least recommends an intervention.  A treatment involves a doctor in a process of active advice, and in the case of abortion, the woman rather than the doctor is requesting the procedure.  The psychiatrist would only determine eligibility.  Therefore, neither the woman's GP, the assessing psychiatrist nor the obstetrician carrying out the procedure would be advising a patient that she ought to have an abortion.  Abortion is not a treatment as the doctor is not involved in giving advice.<\/p><p>  There are no treatments for suicide and we manage underlying risks and issues that the individual presents us with.  There is no evidence that any treatment prevents suicide.  As outlined by Dr. Moloney and Dr. McCarthy earlier, such studies would unethical.  There is scientific evidence from epidemiological studies that certain interventions reduce the suicide rate, for example, such interventions would include treating depression or removing access to lethal methods, such as charcoal in eastern countries and domestic gas in the western world.  Reducing access to such means of lethality reduced suicide rates.  The same is true for abortion.  Abortion legislation was introduced in the UK because unsafe and illegal abortion was the leading cause of maternal death in the 12 years prior to the introduction of the 1967 Act.  In 1950s Ireland, 10% of Irish women who killed themselves were pregnant.<\/p><p>  Studies about whether abortion is bad or not for a woman's mental health have been taken out of context.  The studies subject to public debate have all taken place in countries where abortion services are available, and in those cases we are considering women with a choice of continuing with the pregnancy or having an abortion.  In scenarios where abortion services are not available, unwanted pregnancy is a leading cause of death, which we know from geographical and historical studies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000021#V00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369049700,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Thank you.

Dr. O'Grady said abortion should not be confined to the locations prescribed in the legislation and should be available elsewhere too.  I want to get some clarity on that.  While we are talking about the legislation, we are also obliged to act within Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution which states that there is an obligation to vindicate the life of the child.  I presume one would need to carry out these procedures in a place where, if there is a viable foetus, that life would be saved, where possible and practicable.  I presume that is only in a number of hospitals that would have all the neonatal services and facilities available, and all that flows from that.  I would like some clarity on that.<\/p><p>  Some women are suicidal in pregnancy and some are suicidal because they are pregnant.  Is there a differentiation in how people would assess that?  Many women in crisis pregnancy travel abroad to have an abortion and that happens day in day out in this State.  There is no point in our denying this.  Regarding the proposed panel system of two psychiatrists and an obstetrician, how would the witnesses see a woman presenting herself?  Would they see it in terms of assessing her suicidality or assessing it and treating it and looking at options as opposed to ticking the box and referring her on to somewhere else?  Would they see it as a doctor-patient relationship whereby they would assess, provide therapy and treatments if that was more suitable than a termination as requested by the woman, but which may not be suitable in terms of the treatment of her underlying condition?<\/p><p>  In the context of the broader issue regarding obstetricians not being involved in the panel system, clearly an obstetrician would be the person who would have to carry out the procedure late in pregnancy at the very least.

There is a number of shared common points in each of the presentations but I have picked on one to tease out - because that is our job, to get a clearer understanding - and that is the role of the general practitioner.  It is very unusual and interesting that across the four psychiatrists before us this morning they have each, both orally and in their written submissions, placed great emphasis on the importance of an enhanced role for the GP.  I hope they forgive me for focusing on that.<\/p><p>  Dr. Ferguson, in her presentation, says the GP should have a central role and takes the view that only one psychiatrist is required, ensuring that there would not be a differentiation between psychiatry and the other medical specialties.  On Friday we teased this out with others from across the field of obstetrics.  A view was expressed there that two of the heads could be amalgamated so there would be no difference between the medical and the psychiatric approach.  Would that be a shared view?  Could each witness indicate that please?<\/p><p>  Professor O'Keane makes the point that the GP should make the recommendation for an abortion and one psychiatrist assess the suicide rick.  Is that the order in which it might happen?  Could she elaborate on that so that I could have a better understanding of it?  She also speaks about \"no specific referral pathway reflected in the legislation\".  It has not been set down.  She also makes the point that attendance at the applicant's primary care practice should be included in the legislation as the first point of contact on that pathway.  Could she elaborate a little on that?<\/p><p>  Dr. O'Grady also speaks of this area but says obstetricians should not certify eligibility in cases of suicide risk.  It would be accepted even by obstetricians that two psychiatrists are crucial.  I do not think any of the obstetricians would have argued that they would have primacy in that respect.  However she then says this should be done either by a GP or a psychiatrist.  I ask her to elaborate on that.<\/p><p>  In conclusion and before the Chairman closes me off, I must ask Dr. O'Grady a question because the footnote on the first page of his presentation states that he has experience in certifying eligibility for an abortion.  He is the first to say that before the committee either on Friday or today and I am sure he is not unique in that respect of those who will appear before us.  It is a very important, relevant point.  We are told this presents in only the most rare of cases.  The perinatal psychiatrists this morning reconfirmed that over their combined 40 years' experience none of them has ever taken such a decision.

There is quite a misunderstanding among many people in terms of where viability fits in with abortion.  Many, including myself, argue that 100% of abortions should be completed long before viability becomes an issue.  The situations in which abortion is an issue in terms of a viable foetus are extremely rare.  It is not like the US has the most developed service one can get and, even there, one third of counties have no access to abortion facilities.  We are not the only region that has difficulties with access.  One in 1,000 abortions involves an issue of viability and therefore, is a small number, 99.99% of abortions happen without viability being an option.<\/p><p>  The issue of whether an obstetrician is required is a clinical decision and in our presentation we are trying to distinguish clearly between doctors assisting legislators in certifying, something Doctors for Choice argue clearly is not required medically.  If legislators required that from the point of view of assisting legislation and they are looking for certification as all of the witnesses today have said, this is something we can do.  We should do it to assist things to move forward.  Must we do it?  Not in the scheme of things.  In a proper system, we would not need to do it.  In general, psychiatrists are not involved in the provision of abortion care.  In terms of viability, there is no need to attach to an institution.  Where care in a hospital is required, that should be an option recommended by the physician.  It does not need to be legislated for.  It is already good practice.  We know how to distinguish between intervention and certification.  The role of GPs is very much that they are the first responders.  It does not always happen but we recommend it.  They are the people who will start the process of advising a woman or a child about her state of health, including whether she is not pregnant.   It is important in dealing with crisis pregnancies well before the issue of viability occurs.  The leading reason for delay in abortions in terms of late term is the delay in the diagnosis of pregnancy or of a fatal foetal abnormality and the commencement of non-directive counselling could well be done in general practice as well as the acquisition of informed consent whereby having chosen an option, women in an unwanted pregnancy can choose to go ahead or choose to terminate early with the morning after pill or later through medical abortion, which can take place in a general practice setting.  It does not require an obstetric facility to write a prescription and to advise a patient on how to manage medication and engage with follow up care.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's questions, GP consultation should be optional.  It is good that the GP should be consulted even if he or she is not involved in certification.  That should not be done without the patient's consent.  Heads 2 and 4 should be amalgamated and this was strongly recommended by the Medical Council last Friday.  I refer to the order in which it happens.  From the point of view of certification, the major restriction we have all pointed out that the major reason for raising the risk of suicide is a restriction on travel.  Soon after the Savita Halappanavar case, several women described on radio getting on a plane while actively miscarrying because there was no other option for them.  That is the physical case of having to go to Britain while not fit to travel.  This came up earlier and we hope such women will not be forced on to a plane while too sick to travel.  There may well be cases where women are too distressed to travel and may need to be facilitated to have an abortion in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000023#X00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar O'Grady","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369050900,"counter":131,"content":"<p>In relation to suicide in pregnancy and a person who is suicidal because she is pregnant, obviously the importance of the purpose of a consultant psychiatrist carrying out an assessment in this situation is in establishing whether there is a mental illness.  If someone is suicidal in the context of a severe depressive illness, then the priority is to treat the severe depressive illness and, in those circumstances, one would not suggest that because the woman was suicidal she should have a termination.  The priority there is to treat the mental illness but there are other cases where there may be no mental illness.  Those situations are rare but they will occur and have occurred where a pregnant woman in a crisis pregnancy is suicidal and a termination is the only way of reducing and eliminating that suicidality.<\/p><p>  In terms of a panel of psychiatrists, ideally the care pathway should be the GP doing the initial assessment and the certification and referring to a local psychiatrist who could do both, so to speak - see the individual, carry out an assessment, begin therapy if it is needed, or recommend whatever therapeutic intervention might be needed, but they could also certify.  This will not always be the case but that would be the preference.  I reiterate my belief that the role of the GP is very important and is central to this.  I see them as being one of the medical opinions.  I would see that one could amalgamate heads 2 and 4 so that two medical opinions are necessary and in terms of the panels and this process, and the care pathway mirroring the Mental Health Act, I would say that the executive of the panel would be formed of eligible consultant psychiatrists and, as far as possible, that those assessments would be done by the woman's local psychiatrist so that there would be that continuity of care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000024#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eamonn Moloney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369050900,"counter":132,"content":"<p>A number of issues have been addressed by my colleagues already so I will not repeat them.  A couple of specific issues arise.  Deputy Kelleher asked about the obstetrician role and to clarify that - the Medical Council highlighted this on Friday and to highlight it again - under the heads as currently written, the obstetrician would have an equal right to assess suicide risk as the two psychiatrists.  Obstetricians are clearly not trained to assess suicide risk.  Like all doctors, they can make a stab at it, so to speak, but they are not expert.  That is what we are; as psychiatrists, we are expert.  Obviously, it is important that they have a role, and our role would be to consult with them.  We do this all the time for many different things.  If I have a patient with a cardiac issue, I consult with a cardiologist in the same way as, on this topic, one would consult with the obstetrician, and obviously the obstetrician has an enhanced role if they are the person proceeding with the procedure.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked me about the role of the general practitioner.  All of us have highlighted that because it works very well with the Mental Health Act.  The general practitioner is the person who knows the patient, often very well.  They are the people who know the family circumstances.  They know the social circumstances.  They have a real sense of who the person is.  As Professor O'Keane said, under the Mental Health Act the GP is the person who does the recommendation and then the psychiatrist does the certification.  That works very well and it could be replicated here.<\/p><p>  In regard to amalgamating heads, I do not think psychiatry should be differentiated.  There is a long and sad history of psychiatry being seen as somehow outside medicine.  Sometimes I hear people who are confused as to whether we are psychologists or psychiatrists.  There is some confusion out there about what we do.  We are all medically trained doctors.  We have specialised in this area.  We are as able to make decisions as anybody else.  We have the same evidence to back up our practice.  In my opinion, the heads should be amalgamated.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Seamus Healy asked about the Mental Health Act panels and whether I could see a mirroring.  It works very well.  The Mental Health Commission advertises and interviews for the mental health panels so there is a good screening process to ensure quality and I think that would work well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000024#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Yolande Ferguson"},{"type":"speech","time":1369050900,"counter":133,"content":"<p>As ten Members have indicated, I would appreciate if they would be concise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000024#Y00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1369050900,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank all the doctors who have given evidence here this morning.

We had five consultants in here this morning.  That is nine consultant psychiatrists in the Chamber this morning.  If I was in a crisis pregnancy now and was suicidal, how long would it take me to see them?  Unless we address that issue, I do not think the legislation can ever become a reality for women who are in distress and who are in crisis.<\/p><p>  The second issue, which was touched on earlier, is the criminalisation of women who may have got medication over the Internet for abortion for 14 years.  There is another Act and a precedence with which the witnesses may be more familiar than me - that is, the Suicide Act, whereby the person who died by suicide was decriminalised but those who aided or abetted that person faced criminal sanctions.  Is that something we should be seeking in this legislation - that we do not criminalise women who seek this life-saving abortion?  Of course, we want a deterrent for people who would practise outside of medical guidelines and good medical practice.

Obviously, one would not have seen me this morning, but I have left two colleagues who were available for any emergency work.  I work for a service that is highly responsive.  I see persons where, \"As soon as you can get here\", is often the response.  At weekends and out of hours, we have an on-call service.<\/p><p>  I think that is the value of having the psychiatrist who is responsible for the patient's care being the person who does the certification.  It allows that normalisation of the process.  It is naturalistic.  It is not her seeing some random psychiatrist whom she has never seen before and will never see again.<\/p><p>  The criminalisation is a concern.  The reality is there are many young women in Ireland who are buying their medication over the Internet and taking it at home, or whose parents are buying it and giving it to their children.  It is rather distressing to think that these young women could be criminalised.<\/p><p>  I suppose we, as professionals, have some anxiety about that aspect of the Bill.  The chilling effect has not gone away and one worries that there could be potentially a case taken against one.<\/p><p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick's issues generally tended to revolve around women and children who were suicidal but had no mental illness, and I think these are probably many of the women and children who will be addressed by this legislation.  Assessment of suicide risk is complex.  We approach a woman, not only as a person presenting who is (a) pregnant and (b) suicidal, but in a holistic manner.  One looks at what are her circumstances, what is going on for her and what are her options.  One explores all of that.  One takes that time.  We are part of teams and, often, the other team members become involved.  At that point, if the only option that she can see is that if she does not have this she will die from suicide, then that is the answer to that question but one arrives at that after much discussion and consideration.<\/p><p>  I apologise for not getting the name of the final questioner as I was too busy writing notes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000025#Z00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Yolande Ferguson"},{"type":"speech","time":1369051500,"counter":144,"content":"<p>It was Senator Colm Burke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000025#Z01000","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369051500,"counter":145,"content":"<p>He asked if I would have any difficulty with the Medical Council recommendation of two psychiatrists.

Certainly, in the service that we run but, I would have thought, in any service throughout the country, there would be access.  Whether that would be a home crisis treatment in some areas, the emergency department or attending the local unit, there would be some response.  I can assure the Deputy of that.<\/p><p>  I share her concerns about criminalisation of women.  The word \"compassion\" was mentioned on several occasions this morning.  That is the way we should look at this rather than looking at criminalising young women who are clearly in very distressing situations.<\/p><p>  Psychiatrists and those who work in community mental health teams have an expertise in assessing suicide risk.  They have an expertise in distinguishing the presence or absence of mental illness and they have an expertise in helping persons in emotionally distressing situations and crises.  They can have a role in helping persons in the crisis situation to resolve that crisis and maybe helping to move her on to other services that may be able to provide more ongoing care and support.<\/p><p>  The issue of foetal viability is a hugely complex issue that would involve much consultation with obstetricians and it is not an area to which I, as a psychiatrist, can give an answer.  I think repeated reassurances have been given by obstetric colleagues that this will not lead to terminations in later stages of pregnancy or anything like that, and there should be no suggestion that this sort of legislation would lead to anything like that.<\/p><p>  We were asked if there is a problem with the presence of two psychiatrists, and the answer is \"No\".  I feel quite strongly that a GP should be involved.  Certainly, it would lessen the burden on the individual woman.  It is acknowledged that the GP has an important role to play in the heads of the Bill where it states they should be consulted where practicable.  I would probably go further than that, but it is certainly workable with two psychiatrists.  It just means it is an extra person to see.  I suppose the two medical opinions I would see - a GP and a psychiatrist - are sufficient, but two psychiatrists would not make it unworkable in any way.<\/p><p>  On timescale, I would hope that panels could be available.

I do not disagree with any of it.  I would like to make two further points.  In respect of the two psychiatrists, I believe it should be one psychiatrist because the initial point of contact will be the general practitioner.  The general practitioner is in a very good position to look at a woman they know, hopefully, quite well over a long period of time and to say whether they think this woman is suicidal or not.  It is not one opinion about suicidality.  It is two opinions about it, one which belongs to the general practitioner and the other which belongs to the psychiatrist and, as Dr. Ferguson said, preferentially the local psychiatrist.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Conway, time is of the essence.  We work within structures that allow us to deal with emergencies so there is a certain amount of flexibility, obviously, within a normal medical timetable allowing for emergencies.  We respond within hours.  GPs and accident and emergency officers telephone us directly and we deal with them immediately.  Another problem I have with two psychiatrists is that it potentially slows down the process and also causes unnecessary emotional distress because the woman must repeat her story twice.  It is very difficult for people in distress to open themselves up twice.  The process of opening up is quite painful and it is a very difficult for a person to tell somebody one is so vulnerable that one is suicidal and looking for their help.  To have to do that twice is putting too great an emotional burden on women.<\/p><p>  There is also a practical consequence.  If it slows down the process and it could mean the difference between a woman being able to have a medical or a surgical abortion.  About 50% of abortions in the UK are medical abortions.  This involves taking a tablet and another tablet 12 hours later.  This must be supervised medically but it can be done at a general practice level.  In the future, more and more early abortions will be medical abortions and will not be complicated procedures.  The best strategy in medicine is one that is least interventionist so we want to treat women as early as we can.  <\/p><p>  I know we are pressed for time but I have an important point to make regarding head 6, subhead (2).  This relates to timeliness as well.  I wanted to draw the committee's attention to the fact that the last sentence in subhead (2) implies that the medical practitioner in the initial certification procedure need not give an opinion.  It is quite dangerous for us to allow the first group of medical practitioners who review a woman not to give an opinion.  They should either give an opinion or not give one.  If we allow people to not give an opinion, the review panel may also be in a position of not having to give an opinion so the woman could be going from one situation of not having been given an opinion to another.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000026#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369052700,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses very much for their very helpful points and comments and for reminding us that the legislation is very restrictive but that its purpose is to provide for an accessible and effective procedure whereby women may vindicate their constitutional right to life.  It is particularly helpful to hear from Dr. O'Grady who had the direct experience of having certified eligibility under the X case criteria.  That is very useful because there was some suggestion in earlier sessions that these cases never arise.  I ask Dr. O'Grady to confirm for the committee that in fact they do, albeit in extremely rare cases.<\/p><p>  I wish to raise a couple of specific points, first, in respect of the women who are affected.  We are reminded that the majority of the 4,000 women who travel will not be affected by this legislation.  The reality is it will affect young girls mostly in care or in emergency situations where women are restricted in travelling.  The question was raised about specific reference to children.  In the earlier session, Dr. Doyle suggested that \"child\" be defined in the legislation, given the slight anomaly between the legal age of consent to medical treatment and the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act which is 16 years and then 18 years for psychiatric intervention.  I ask if the experts have any comment on this anomaly.<\/p><p>  I ask for clarification on some technical points.  I take the point that all the experts are in agreement that the Mental Health Act gives us a very clear procedure involving one GP and one psychiatrist.  The expert witnesses suggest that this arrangement be replicated, not that there be one GP plus two psychiatrists.  I ask for clarification on that point because what is being suggested could potentially put another doctor into the certification process.  Dr. Doyle referred to a very practical issue that one third of girls in Clare do not have a GP and asked what is to be done in those instances.  The time limits under head 6 were pointed out and this is very important.  I take Dr. O'Keane's point about head 6(2), which I think contradicts the language of head 6(1), which does not envisage that there would be no opinion.  It envisages an opinion against certifying for eligibility.<\/p><p>  On the final point about the issue of suicide under head 19, as Deputy Conway said, the person who commits suicide - indeed, anyone who attempts suicide - is not criminalised under the 1993 Act.  Similarly, if we are using that model, I wish to confirm that the woman or girl who attempts suicide in Ireland should not be criminalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000027#BB00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1369052700,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I have three brief questions.

Would it not be the case that there is a far greater frequency than one in a thousand in that cohort?  How do we deal with the practical aspects of such a case?

My questions are for Dr. O'Grady and Dr. O'Keane.  Dr. O'Keane spoke about the sudden onset of suicidal intent in a pregnant woman.  Dr. O'Grady is in agreement with Dr. O'Keane that psychiatrists do not treat suicidal intent; rather, they manage the issues underlying the risk and they deal with those issues.  This is where my concern arises.  She stated further that she understands the purpose of this legislation is for psychiatrists to assess the eligibility or otherwise of a woman seeking this procedure.  She stated that in her view the process is too long, with too many medical people involved, and that the rush to appeal within seven days may mean the difference between a medical and a surgical abortion.  While all this might be true, there is no treatment in the middle of all that process.  I ask Dr. O'Keane to explain when, in the case of a woman who may present to a GP with genuine suicidal intent because of her pregnancy, does the treatment kick in?  Do we immediately go through a process of assessing her eligibility or a certification for a medical treatment?<\/p><p>  I am genuinely at a loss.  In my head the reason I could satisfy my support of this legislation was that it was not a treatment for suicide but rather an option where all other options had failed.  In that context I was happy to accept it.  However, I fear from what Dr. O'Keane has described this morning that there is no treatment.  A woman will go to the GP and say she is suicidal and requires an abortion and the process will immediately kick in whereby she will be certified as either eligible or not eligible.  I am concerned that there will not be any medical care.  I am probably mistaken in my interpretation but I ask the doctors to clarify the situation for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000027#BB00400","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1369052700,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I will preface my first question by saying that a reply to a freedom of information request from the UK Ministry for health recently identified that between 1992 and 2010, no Irish women availed of an abortion under that section which deals with saving the life of the mother.  That abortion is not a treatment for suicide is the clear, unambiguous evidence we have been given at these hearings.  Dr. O'Keane conceded this point.  To be fair to her, she said that it was for an unwanted pregnancy rather than a treatment for suicide.  Abortion can be a contributory factor in suicidal ideation in women who have had an abortion.  Many women have committed suicide in these circumstances.  What assurances can the doctors give that this can be avoided if they certify a termination?  I refer, in other words, to the law of unintended consequences.<\/p><p>  We heard evidence with regard to the assessment of patients that psychiatrists, by the nature of the profession, will err on the side of caution when assessing patients.  Dr. O'Keane stated that she would believe a woman if she told her she was suicidal.  On the other hand, we have heard from women hurt by abortion.  Four or five women attended the committee last Thursday who had had abortions in Britain.  Two of them said they were advised to seek an abortion on the grounds of being suicidal, even though they were not suicidal.  They were subsequently certified by people in Britain in the same profession as the doctors present.<\/p><p>  In the United States, there has been considerable liberalisation of abortion with regard to mental health and suicidality.  I refer to Dr. Bernard Nathanson's book <i>Aborting Americ<\/i>.  He states that the attack had to be made in the weakest area, the psychiatric indication, which was inexact and immeasurable, yet sufficiently threatening.  He said that once a breach had been made in that area, once a few precedent-setting cases had been raised, they could then be poured through in unlimited number.  He stated that the proposed threat of suicide was the logical battering ram.  It was just a question of finding a squad of compliant psychiatrists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000027#BB00500","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369053300,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I will start with the last question from Senator Walsh.  I thank him for clarifying that I did say abortion may be a treatment for an unwanted pregnancy and not for suicidality.  That may be, indeed, what I did say.  I have certainly never said the other.<\/p><p>  As regards women being advised to seek an abortion, I can assure the committee that it would be against the spirit of this legislation and would be outside what would be ethically accepted medically for us to do that.  Speaking for myself, I am absolutely not going to advise any woman who comes to see me whether or not she should have an abortion.  That is entirely her decision; she is making the application to have the abortion.  I am not making the application and I am not prescribing the treatment.  She is making the application.  I am employed by the State to determine, in my professional opinion, whether or not that lady is eligible for an abortion, according to the law.  I will not act outside the law but I will enact the law once it is passed, which other psychiatrists may choose not to do.<\/p><p>  As regards the question about treatment, everybody who comes to us will be treated.  Every single individual who comes into the psychiatric services will be treated with psychotherapy and perhaps daily or twice-daily visits from home treatment nurses.  We have access to immediate psychology for them if it is so required.  We can talk to their families and can intervene with family therapy.  We can bring together teams of professional carers and can assemble them rapidly in response to emergencies like this.  <\/p><p>  The reason we want to have rapid access is simply to reduce the amount of distress in so far as we can.  We will obviously provide a full range of psychiatric treatments and care for every single woman who presents to us, regardless of what we do within the limits of this legislation, which I think is just saying that somebody is or is not eligible.  As Dr. Ferguson has clearly pointed out, there is a whole range of interventions and people are treated holistically.  They are treated in response to the individual needs and vulnerabilities that they present to us with.<\/p><p>  The point I am making is simply that we are not prescribing the abortion.  We are not saying to the woman \"We think you should have this treatment\".  The woman is coming to us as an autonomous citizen, asking for an abortion.  We are requested by the legislation - that, hopefully, will be enacted - to see whether or not this woman lawfully meets those criteria.  While we do one, it does not mean that we do not provide care.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000028#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Veronica O'Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369053300,"counter":157,"content":"<p>It may help to clarify this area from the point of view of Doctors for Choice Ireland.  We are being very clear.  The alternative to this legislation is to allow women to decide for themselves and not to require certification by doctors about their eligibility.  That is what they do in Canada where there is no criminal sanction in making this decision.  There is lots of good practice.  If one wants doctors to certify, one cannot also tell them that they think it is a good idea.  All one can ask them is whether they can carry out that certification.  This is what we are trying to advise today.  Does Doctors for Choice Ireland, for example, think it is a good idea?  No.  One does not need certification for eligibility for abortion.  One only needs it where legislators put that requirement on one.  On Friday, we heard from the Medical Council and the Irish College of General Practitioners.  This morning we heard from the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.  Can we do it?  Of course we can do it.<\/p><p>  Legislators will have to own some of the complications that arise from the legislation.  What we can do is to be as helpful as we can.  Do the cases occur?  Yes, they do, as Senator Bacik has pointed out.  They arise episodically.  Why they might arise again the future, why there might be a restriction on travel, or why there might be concerns about whether or not consent is adequately given - we cannot predict in what way they will present.<\/p><p>  I will not go into the 16 versus 18 issue in detail.  That was well argued in terms of the whole capacity debate, which I really think is a separate issue.  Does it apply to this area?  Absolutely, it applies to this area, but not differently than it applies to any other area of medicine.  Where a question arises around consent with a young person or someone, for example, with an intellectual disability, we do need a resolution concerning access to medical treatment.  Whether they can give consent, but also whether they can refuse consent, is a whole other debate.<\/p><p>  I would favour one GP plus one psychiatrist instead of an obstetrician and two psychiatrists.  Obviously, the second doctor should be optional, in my view.  As I have been at pains to point out, the first doctor is and should be optional also, in terms of eligibility - not in terms of advice, but in terms of counselling and helping someone to come to a decision, but not making that decision for them.<\/p><p>  Deputy Naughten raised a point about suicidal ideation and pregnancy, which is absolutely correct and is often overlooked.  Professor Kendall's study pointed out that, years ago, there was a coincidence between suicides and pregnancy, particularly before the Second World War and before the 1950s and 1960s when abortion was made more available in terms of being free, legal and safe.  It very much coincided with missing the second menstrual period, which is literally when a woman starts to realise that she is pregnant.  That is when the clusters of suicide in pregnancy occurred.  <\/p><p>  As the Deputy points out, one is likely to get those cases where suicide risk arises - not all of them, but the vast majority - in the first trimester, i.e. before ten to 12 weeks which is early.  Medical abortions would be carried out predominantly in that period and a delay would lead to more surgical abortions.  I am not sure what advice was given on Friday.  I am not an obstetrician or a general practitioner.  It is not my area of expertise but I am 100% certain on that point, that medical abortions are early, including the morning-after pill if one is of the persuasion that believes that is abortion.<\/p><p>  As regards reasonable opinion, I think the issues of viability are best referred to obstetricians.  It concerns that point in time.  It is not that general practitioners will not be involved, but any decision about prolonging pregnancy in order to deliver a viable baby at that stage, rather than a foetus - that is, decisions about viability and the discussion with the parent about that - is an issue for an obstetrician.  There is really no role in psychiatrists.  In the same way as we might object to an obstetrician advising about the risk of suicide, I think that obstetricians would quite properly object to any psychiatrists giving their opinions about viability. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy indicated, for most people, the word \"fatal\" in fatal foetal anomalies implies that viability is very much the moot point.  It is the point around which the heartache of parents arises.  The diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormalities often does not happen until the second trimester and, sadly, sometimes not even until the third trimester.  The Deputy is correct in saying that these are the more difficult situations where someone had a wanted pregnancy.  These are the changes that all of us are very sensitive to.  There is nothing more tragic than wanting to have had a baby and where the mother decides she will call this a baby rather than calling it a pregnancy.  Nobody, except doctors, really talks about a foetus.  People either have a pregnancy or decide that they are going to have a baby.  That is changed where that is not going to happen and it is a tragedy for all of us.<\/p><p>  To come back to the issue of treatment, anyone involved in certification should never lose track of the fact that they are dealing with a human being.  I do not care whether one is certifying that they need to be off work or off school, in my case - one is not just certifying and saying \"Next\".  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000028#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar O'Grady","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369053900,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Many points already have been covered but I reiterate my opinion that just two medical opinions would be sufficient, one from a general practitioner and one from a consultant psychiatrist.  We really are addressing the legislation before us here and are not really addressing the totality of care women need and obviously, to address Deputy Dowds's concerns, that would continue.  Someone in distress, someone who was suicidal, will get the care she needs regardless and the certification procedure can go on.  In order to reduce the need for a woman to see more and more psychiatrists, ideally the people who provide the treatment also could do the certification.  This is the reason a process which mirrors the Mental Health Act would reduce the number of assessments through which a woman would be obliged to go.  However, the woman at all times will get access to the health and care she needs at that point.<\/p><p>  Similarly, most situations will arise early in the first trimester.  Outside of that, when there are issues with regard to foetal abnormality or foetal viability, obviously there would be discussions as best medical practice would dictate there should be consultation, liaison and discussion with our obstetric colleagues.  As for stating repeatedly that abortion is no treatment for suicide, the latter is associated with certain conditions for which treatment is available.  Consequently, what we are talking about is not treatment but is about eligibility for someone to have an abortion.  There certainly have been and again will be, rare circumstances in which a termination is essential to deal with a pregnant woman's suicidality associated with a crisis pregnancy.  The use of extravagant language and exaggerated claims of some sort of conspiracy involving consultant psychiatrists, general practitioners, GPs, and obstetricians to open the floodgates of abortion are simply exaggerations.  They are what they are, namely, exaggerated claims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000029#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eamonn Moloney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369053900,"counter":160,"content":"<p>To clarify for Senator Bacik, I do not mean a woman should be seen by three different doctors.  The whole thrust of my opening statement was that it is not acceptable to put a woman through that.  Professor O'Keane has highlighted that it is traumatic to tell one's story again and again.  The Senator's other question was, if there is no GP, then what?  Again, that pathway of care is different.  One might see this happening a little more in the case of child and adolescent psychiatrists, where one might get referrals from school counsellors, for instance.  In that case, the second doctor could be a psychiatrist or a GP because that girl should have a GP.  If she did not have one before, she certainly should have one afterwards.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Naughten's concerns about the obstetrician not being involved, I do not think any of us is suggesting the obstetrician is not involved at all.  We simply are saying that when making a decision as regards to suicidal ideation, their role is a consultative one.  While Deputy Dowds addressed his question to Professor O'Keane, it is really important to highlight something I mentioned in my submission at the outset, which is that as much as possible, we should follow normal pathways of care.  This process should be best medical practice and best medical practice means following normal pathways of care.  This means the woman is eligible for all treatments that are available to anyone who is in any situation in which he or she meets a psychiatrist.<\/p><p>  Finally, in response to Senator Walsh, when I think of the United States, I do not think of it as a liberal abortion state but as somewhere that has very mixed and certainly very divided attitudes towards abortion.  The Senator again talks about - I will not even repeat the word because my colleagues have referred to it - how psychiatrists somehow would facilitate an increase or allow an entryway into abortion on demand, which is another dreadful expression.  I am a psychiatrist and I have spoken previously about how proud I am of my profession and how important it is to me that psychiatry is regarded with the same esteem as any other medical profession.  This morning, Dr. Anthony McCarthy mentioned Ireland's sad history with women and pregnancy, both with the Magdalen laundries and, sadly, psychiatric institutions.

In light of the X case judgment that a termination of pregnancy is the only means of averting the risk to the life of the mother, does it follow that abortion becomes the only means available if the woman simply refuses all alternatives?  Second, where a woman who is suicidal presents to the witnesses as treating psychiatrists and she refuses whatever treatments they offer, as she is entitled to do, at that point they will certify that a termination is the appropriate treatment, despite the fact there is no evidence that a termination will have any beneficial effect for that woman in a suicidal crisis.  Is it not fair to state that the law's operation, as the witnesses envisage it, will be inherently open to abuse as it will rely primarily on the will of the pregnant woman?<\/p><p>  Third, how accurate do the witnesses expect to be in determining whether someone is actually suicidal and the only treatment is abortion?  Were we to legislate on suicide as grounds for abortion, are we not legislating for a condition that has an incidence rate of one per 500,000 of population, as per Dr. Anthony McCarthy, with a positive predictive value of 3%, as per Professor Casey?

In essence, that is what we are here for.<\/p><p>  This is not a debate in a vacuum.  It is a debate about realities.  The witnesses have told us of their experience.  The gaping hole in the hearings, both the earlier ones in January and the ones today, are the women and girls who have had the experience.  Perhaps they have been patients of the witnesses.  They requested to be present to give their testimony and their offer was declined.  By any measure, that is essentially wrong.<\/p><p>  I am afraid that we might be rushing because of the approach to the issue.  The professionals are reacting.  Even on Friday, Dr. Boylan, one of the obstetricians and gynaecologists, said life is messy.  Today, again, we hear that life is tough and life is messy, which it is.  That is why care, compassion and supports are necessary, and all those things that eliminate the fear because no poor girl or woman who has had the unhappy experience of an abortion wants the experience.  They have been motivated by fear, coercion or oppression.  Even if it is imagined, the way to address the situation and eliminate the crisis is to get rid of what caused the fear.  Dr. John Monaghan from Portiuncula Hospital pointed out on Friday that when he was working in the English midlands in the Liverpool area as a trainee obstetrician and gynaecologist, the number of medically-qualified people going into the profession started to decline seriously to 50% levels because of the ethical considerations of what was happening in the United Kingdom in the context of delivering medical care.

Deputy Durkan is correct in that, and it is the pro-choice lobby that has drawn attention to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000031#FF00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar O'Grady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369055700,"counter":185,"content":"<p>RTE issued an apology two or three days later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000032#GG00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1369055700,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Please do not interrupt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000032#GG00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369055700,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Dr. Fergusson pointed to three facts that are written in his paper.

These are the two major causes of distress.  We should get rid of this fear, as Deputy Mathews outlined.  The voices of these women can be heard at a later date.<\/p><p>  As to whether conscientious objection would disrupt access, that could be the case, and the issue will have to be monitored.  It has been noted in ethical papers that there is a conscientious objection to the restriction of abortion.  Doctors such as me would face criminal sanction if we were to exercise our right to assist a woman in following up and having an abortion on the basis of her decision of informed consent.  This in contrast to those who wish to have a conscientious objection not to take part in the process.  While I believe people should have every right not to take part, this right should not be an institutional one. <\/p><p>  I was asked whether time was critical.  That is absolutely the case.  Around eight or nine weeks is the most critical period, as a delay at that point will make the difference between a medical and a surgical abortion.  The latter increases complications for the person involved.<\/p><p>  As to whether the jurisdiction is relevant, it is absolutely relevant.  People have forgotten that the 1861 Act was not passed in an Irish Parliament but in the British Parliament and it is a British law.  While we can blame the Catholic Church for many things, we cannot blame it for the 1861 Act.  Jurisdiction is also relevant because the services that between 4,000 and 5,000 women from Ireland engage every year are in the United Kingdom.  It is medically, if not legally, relevant. <\/p><p>  I fully agree that no psychiatric evidence was presented in the X case.  The key question for psychiatrists is whether they agree with the decision by the Supreme Court justices in that case to certify eligibility for access to an abortion.  While opinions on that issue may differ among psychiatrists, in my view the Supreme Court made the right decision.  For many of us, the alternative of restricting travel and access to an abortion and forcing a 14-year-old rape victim through a pregnancy was intolerable.  Given our tendency to become too abstract, we should always consider what alternative options are available.  Most people who examined the case at the time, including psychiatrists, concluded that the Supreme Court justices were correct and the alternative was appalling.<\/p><p>   As to whether abortion is the only treatment available, I am fascinated by the current interest in the certification.  I cannot even remember if it was the High Court or some other court because the issue was not brought before the court.  The certification was straightforward and obvious at the time.  The children in question had decided that abortion was the best option for them.  What I had to do was ensure they had the best chance to engage in non-directive counselling and that any mental health complications that were current or might follow would be adequately dealt with.  In the midst of that, the nature of my certification was not really at the top of anyone's agenda.  I am in some respects glad that was the case.  All of those involved in that process, including the social workers, mental health workers - due credit must be given to the Irish Family Planning Association, which dealt with the request for certification - and the judge in question, behaved rather well and did the needful in a good, thoughtful and timely manner.  If anyone wishes to ask me any particular or specific questions about that, I will be pleased to answer them outside the room.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000032#GG00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar O'Grady"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369055700,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Deputy Terence Flanagan indicated that some questions had not been answered and requested that some of his questions be answered.

We would act in the same manner as we act in respect of all individuals who refuse treatment.  If a person is refusing treatment in the context of a serious mental illness and we believe he or she requires this treatment, we would involuntary detain the individual in question and, if possible, give him or her the treatment we believe he or she requires.  If, on the other hand, the person did not have a mental illness, as a free citizen it is entirely his or her right to refuse psychiatric treatment.<\/p><p>  Another point was raised regarding the system being open to abuse.

However, if he or she is not on the panel, the woman would be poorly served by seeing somebody who did not want to comply with the legislation.

It is a horrible thing to say and I do not like the reality but before abortion services were introduced, infanticide was a common means of controlling one's reproduction.  None of us likes this fact.  We did have the Kerry babies case in Ireland and we have had situations like that within the last 50 years.

The legislation, which is based on the outcome of a 20-year-old risk assessment of suicidality, excludes 50% of the population - males.  Such a focus in excluding men when dealing with legislation on suicidality further eclipses the problem of male suicide in Ireland.  This morning I published a research report on suicide at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland - I have only three copies left, but the Chairman may have the three - wherein the question of marginalisation and normalisation of suicide among young males is analysed.  Members should note that suicidality is already a significant problem in Ireland, accounting for more than 12,000 emergency department presentations annually and more than 2,500 presentations to voluntary organisations.  The rates for males attempting suicide are climbing all the time.<\/p><p>  Based on the research evidence from my studies on this problem in Ireland for the past ten years - Ireland is unique and somewhat different from other countries with regard to this type of research - it is possible that this legislation could inadvertently accelerate suicide rates in younger men, where the real problem lies.

My understanding of this law is that it is to reassure the Irish people that no pregnant woman will be denied life-saving treatment because of her pregnancy.  In my opinion, we do not need this law in psychiatry.  We already have full clarity in terms of our assessment and treatment for patients.  There will be no situation where the welfare of the foetus will eclipse the welfare of the woman.<\/p><p>  Head 4 of the Bill is seriously flawed for three reasons.  First, the treatment it proposes is not a treatment.  Second, the treatment it proposes is never the only treatment.  Third, if truly suicidal with mental illness the patient may not be able to give a valid consent.  We have already heard that abortion is not an evidenced-based treatment for suicidality.  Unfortunately, this Government is proceeding as if it is.  There is no evidence to support the view that the abortion has any mental health benefits.  There is evidence to support the view that in some women, abortion may be associated with small to moderate increases in risks of mental health problems, including suicidality.  There is an ethical problem in offering a procedure as a life-saving treatment to a suicidal woman where that very intervention also poses suicidality as an outcome.  <\/p><p>  It is incorrect to say that abortion could ever be the only treatment for suicidal ideation.  Suicidality is multifactorial.  It is important the people of Ireland understand this.  Our treatment packages take this into account.  We work in multidisciplinary teams because we believe that the skills of each member of our team are essential for the proper and full assessment and treatment of our patients.  Best practice treatment for mental illness is and always will be appropriate full assessment, psychological support and intervention and medication, if needed.  It must be remembered that we have social workers, occupational therapists and psychiatric nurses who work with people in their homes and communities.  We will work with patients in the community for as long as needed following discharge from hospital.  The proper care of a suicidal pregnant woman would entail proper assessment, support and treatment throughout her pregnancy, delivery and postpartum.  Longer term intervention may be required, depending on the circumstances.  The point is that the woman will not be abandoned.  <\/p><p>  We are very aware that mental health intervention must include the assessment of all the stresses in the patient's life at the time in question.  These stresses can include relationship difficulties, poverty, unemployment or lack of occupation during the day, accommodation issues, difficult current or past family dynamics and lack of other supportive relationships.  These also are an indicator of very poor outcome post-abortion.  It is within this holistic view that the treatment package for a suicidal pregnant woman would be appropriately assessed and delivered.  Therefore, it is illogical to say that the only treatment for suicidal intent during pregnancy could be an abortion.<\/p><p>  Valid consent to an abortion may not be possible while a patient is acutely suicidal due to mental illness or distress.  This is important.  It is important to note that a psychiatric emergency or crisis is fundamentally different to any other medical or surgical emergency.  This is because of the nature of the disorder.  In a true psychiatric emergency, the patient's judgment is frequently impaired.  Our role at that time is to administer the most appropriate psychiatric treatment and support.  It would be highly inappropriate and unethical to impose an irrevocable intervention at that time when the patient may not have sufficient mental capacity to give a valid consent to that intervention.  We would in such circumstances be failing our patients.  The patient's right to bodily integrity is paramount.  It is my view that if a termination were prescribed and given at the time when a patient is in crisis, has an acute crisis adjustment reaction or is mentally ill, the patient would be in a strong position to accuse the treating team of failure in their duty of care.  It could be rightly claimed that we as psychiatrists failed in our duty to adequately protect the patient during a period of mental illness.  It should not be forgotten that mental illness responds to treatment.  Acute crises respond to treatment.  They settle down, often in a short period.  Any impairment of judgment in these situations will resolve with treatment.<\/p><p>  With this law, the focus will be directed away from a full and proper assessment of the patient towards an assessment for a direct abortion.  As treating psychiatrists we do not assess suicidality for any reason other than to prescribe the appropriate psychiatric treatment.  Society should do the same.  Society should validate rather than normalise an expression of extreme psychological distress.  Mental illness is just as important as physical illness.  Perhaps even more so.  It affects a person's thinking, the ability to relate and relationships and the ability to function.  It is exceptionally important to state that the proper response to stated suicidal intent should always be the appropriate evidenced based clinical treatment.  That is what we do when we assess patients who threaten suicide.  Direct abortion is not a clinical treatment.  It is a social solution.  This law will do damage way beyond the boundaries of simply legislating for a medical treatment that is without the foundation of medical evidence and good clinical practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000035#KK00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jacqueline Montwill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369057800,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Our next speaker is Dr. Bernie McCabe, who is most welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000036#LL00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369057800,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for providing me an opportunity to present my concerns about this legislation in the absence of Professor Patricia Casey.  As a consultant psychiatrist, it is my duty of care to my patients to provide them with a non-judgmental and evidence based treatment programme in accordance with their needs.  It is my opinion that such treatment is their right and, in the absence of an evidence base, I am in breach of my duty of care to them and their rights.  These ideals are reflected in the guidelines of my governing bodies, the Medical Council of Ireland and the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.  In view of the submission made earlier on behalf of the college, I now have to report to the committee that the text of its submission was sought last week by members but the request was refused until today.  A growing number of members of the college no longer feel the speaker from the college is representing their views.  The college has been informed of this in writing, as of Friday, 17 May.<\/p><p>  It has been stated by a number of speakers at various Oireachtas hearings that evidence is not available for the use of abortion as a treatment in suicidality.  Suicidality is a dynamic state which varies from suicidal intent, where a person has no hope and does not plan for his or her future beyond his or her death, through suicidal ideas, to a crisis state where a person becomes aware of a sudden change in circumstances - in this case we are referring to an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy - and is now fearful or negative about the future.  Clearly these are fearful, distressing and despairing states and have many underlying causes requiring a full multidisciplinary assessment of needs.  It must also be emphasised that we have, as a scientific professional body, a number of evidence based treatments that work in terms of helping to remove a person from a despairing, distressing or mentally ill state to one where judgment is more robust and the person is again in a position to consider options for the future.<\/p><p>  For those individuals who do not fall into the aforementioned categories, that is, people who do not have mental illness, are not despairing or distressed or have needs that cannot be met by a multidisciplinary psychiatric service, such as those who present to psychiatric services with social issues, it is important to accept that psychiatry has nothing to offer over and above those who are not trained as mental health professionals.  These are social issues and, accordingly, psychiatry should not be involved.  It must also be accepted that the prediction of suicide is recognised to be poor.  This is a worldwide and evidence based view held by the profession.  The test of whether there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman that can only be avoided by abortion cannot be met given that suicide cannot be predicted even among those with mental illness.  Offering a pregnant suicidal woman an abortion if she says her pregnancy is the reason may seem like common sense.  However, caution is required in this regard.  Interventions that seem intuitively correct may turn out not to be so.  Intuition is not enough.  An evidence base is required.  As we are members of a scientific profession which uses an evidence base for the planning of treatment, to expect psychiatrists to recommend abortion as a treatment for an unwanted pregnancy in the group I have just described is an abuse of the profession in order to facilitate the requirements of the State.  The psychiatric profession has no role beyond saying that a person has no mental illness and we must not be used by the State to duck the ethical and constitutional debate that must take place or else the profession will once again fall into disrepute under the current proposals.  <\/p><p>  As it is currently constructed, head 4 should not be included in the legislation.  It should be replaced by an evidence based clinical care pathway that would assist women who are suicidal in accessing psychiatric assistance because abortion as a treatment for suicidality is not evidence based.  This view is supported by a growing number of professional colleagues.  Of 302 consultant colleagues who received a postal questionnaire, over 130 responded and this number continues to grow.  Some 90% of the respondents were in agreement with the aforementioned view.  Some have sought to criticise this work but it must be made clear that respondents were asked to put aside their personal views and answer solely based on their clinical experience.  It remains the only piece of work to consider the level of concern among practising consultant psychiatrists and it is worthy of consideration for that reason.  In the event that the Government disregards these concerns and the recommendations expressed more thoroughly in Professor Casey's submission and proceeds with legislation, a number of concerns have been set out in the website submissions and are beyond the scope of this presentation.  <\/p><p>  There is a dearth of information on the value of abortion among suicidal pregnant women.  It has never been studied.  The Government is acting as though evidence is available to support this.  Psychiatrists should not be involved except in so far as we can treat women with mental illness, which must be evidence based.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000036#LL00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Bernie McCabe"},{"type":"speech","time":1369057800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Our final speaker is Dr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill.

I have worked exclusively in psychiatry since 1997, having graduated form the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1994.<\/p><p>  I will address my comments to head 4 in particular.  I share some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Timmins and others in regard to whether this consultation can be truly meaningful if the Government is not prepared to take the expert evidence into account with regard to abortion and suicidality.  There was almost complete agreement among the psychiatric experts who gave evidence in January that abortion - the direct and intentional killing of the unborn child - is not a treatment for suicidality.  It is extraordinary that the Government has seen fit to disregard all the accrued evidence in proposing legalising abortion on the grounds of suicide.  I draw the committee's attention to recent votes at the conferences of the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners rejecting motions in support of abortion, even within the limitations envisaged in the X case ruling.  It clearly emerged that the majority of doctors do not support legalising abortion on the grounds of suicidality.<\/p> <p>The suicide clause in this Bill is not about early delivery; it is about ending the life of children in the womb.<\/p><p> Finally, the evidence of medical experts has been remarkably consistent during these hearings.  The committee has heard from a representative of St. Patrick's University Hospital, one of Ireland's leading psychiatric hospitals, who said that there is \"no evidence either in literature or from the work of St. Patrick's University Hospital that indicates that termination of pregnancy is an effective treatment for any mental health disorder or difficulty.\"  The committee has heard from Professor Kevin Malone, who stated that abortion is not a treatment for mental illness and in his written submission referred to a textbook of psychiatry and asked how it can suddenly become a recommended psychiatric treatment in this legislation.  These are the words of one of the world's leading suicide researchers, who comes from Ireland.  He must be listened to.<\/p><p> This committee and the Government have heard much of this evidence before.  I sincerely hope that they display the integrity expected of them by the people of this nation and that they respond to what they have heard on this occasion.  Mothers and babies deserve far more than an ideologically-driven Bill which seeks to end rather than protect human life in pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000036#LL00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1369059000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Dr. &Oacute; Domhnaill.

At the outset, may I say that we are not ignoring the issue of abortion.  The fact is that more than 4,000 Irish girls and women go abroad every year to Britain for whatever reason, and there are a variety of reasons.  In that context, can I ask the witnesses, in their professional opinion, are they saying that there has ever been a case in which a woman has actually taken her own life because, for whatever reason, she was in a crisis pregnancy?  There could be myriad reasons, but she was in a crisis pregnancy in her mind at the time.  Has there ever been such a case?  We are legislating for the fact that the X case obliges us to look at the issue of suicide because of the constitutional imperative that is there.  I want to get clarity on that issue.<\/p><p>  It has been stated by other psychiatrists who are eminently qualified that termination of a pregnancy is not in itself a treatment for suicide.  That was said quite openly here by many people today.  Equally, they say that in a very rare circumstance it may be the only option left to save the life of the woman.  That was stated but in the context of extreme circumstances.  If the witnesses are saying that there is no evidential or clinical-based research data to suggest that termination is a treatment for suicide, why would it ever be prescribed?  Why would psychiatrists ever prescribe a termination if the witnesses maintain that the clinical evidence is that it is never a treatment for suicide?  In other words, why would the witnesses be concerned that this legislation would open up a more liberal form of abortion in this country if all the clinical evidence is that it is not a treatment for suicide?  I am just asking that question.<\/p><p>  We are aware that women go to extraordinary lengths when they are in crisis pregnancies, including self-abortion and self-imposed surgical interventions.  We know what has happened with women in previous times; because they could not access abortion for whatever reason, they have done things and made interventions.  That is still happening as we speak in this country, with abortive pills and so on.  We know that women will go to extraordinary lengths.  I am just asking the question.  Is it possible that a woman would ever go to the most extraordinary length of all and take her own life?<\/p><p>  On the issue of whether psychiatrists can decide whether a person would commit suicide, the witnesses say that of 100 people who were potentially suicidal, only three went on to actually commit suicide.  Surely that shows that intervention, counselling and treatment actually work, in view of the fact that the witnesses have proscribed 100 people that in probability could have committed suicide, but only three actually did so.  I assume it is because they all got treatment and because they were in a controlled environment.  I assume they would have been assisted, assessed and counselled, so that treatment does work.  The point I am making is this: if we have women who are at present going abroad, would it not be the case that instead of going abroad they might present themselves to the system here and that there could actually be interventions other than the extreme of actually going to England for a termination?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000038#NN00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1369059000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests here this afternoon.  It is very important to say at the outset that despite the scepticism of some of the voices this afternoon in respect of the worth, value or legitimacy, even, of this set of hearings, whatever the respective views of Government, as an opposition voice I am accepting the bona fides of it, and it is hugely important that this is understood.  That is why we are here: to listen to a wide variety of views, each of them equally respected.  I welcome the respective contributions of the witnesses, as I have those that I have already heard.<\/p><p>  To try to help us fully understand the position that each of the contributors has given, I wish to clarify a point in Dr. Montwill's contribution on consent.  All I am asking is for is an elaboration and an explanation.  She stated, under point five on consent, that a patient must give her consent for any medical procedure.  It is accepted that ultimately it is the woman who will decide, if a determination is made in respect of legality or if this Bill were to pass.  Dr. Montwell went on to state that it would be unethical to impose a procedure on a patient when the patient may not have full mental capacity or be able to give a valid consent to such a procedure.  She went on to say that impaired judgment could be seen to affect the patient's capacity to consent to the procedure and her right to bodily integrity would be violated.  If, ultimately, the decision is the woman's, Dr. Montwell is suggesting that in some or all cases it would be the professionals who made a decision, irrespective of the woman's view.  It is open to that interpretation.  As someone who believes that, in the event of the passing of this legislation, it is absolutely the case that the woman must have the final say - she cannot be compelled - then I believe we need an elaboration in respect of point five, please.  That is the only reason I highlight it.<\/p><p>  Dr. McCabe's executive summary states that claims have been made that some women are suicidal because of the pregnancy only.  She goes on in the same paragraph to say that psychiatry has little to offer this group.  Given the contribution of my colleague one moment ago I would have thought that psychiatry certainly has a role to play and that the whole purpose and intent of the intervention is to assist, to help and to prevent the woman from taking that course of action, and that this is where we would work from at all times.  Fully 0% is what we want to see, not any percentage.  I find that a most unusual point in Dr. McCabe's executive summary.<\/p><p>  Not to pass on Dr. Malone's contribution, but I wish to ask a question in respect of Dr. &Oacute; Domhnaill's submission.  One sentence of his stretches the boundaries of credibility - that is, his suggestion that those psychiatrists would be more likely to approve abortions if this Bill becomes law.  In the context of Article 40.3.3&deg; still standing, in the context of the extent of the wider interest in and the requirement to report all such decisions directly to the Minister of the day and in the context of the legal measures that many are uncomfortable about and that could be taken in the event of any abuse, does Dr. McCabe really believe that there are professionals in our psychiatric services in this country who would do as she has suggested and would take the risk if were only from a selfish point of view?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000038#NN00400","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1369059600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for the frankness and honesty of their approach.  I will ask them a question I asked earlier.  The X case judgment stated that abortion could be the only way of treating suicidal ideation.  Is there psychiatric evidence for what that judgment presupposed, namely, that abortion is a form of necessary mental health treatment?  The heads of the Bill also provide for abortion where it is the only way of avoiding a real and substantial threat that a pregnant woman will commit suicide.  Are the guests aware of any in-depth studies that indicate that abortion can be the only way of avoiding the real and substantial threat of a pregnant woman's committing suicide or even that abortion can be a form of genuine mental health treatment?  I think the guests have already made their position on this clear.<\/p><p>  Unlike Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I do not have the confidence that he expressed in the hearings that took place in January.  The guests might expand on their view that the Government has ignored the evidence presented here last January.

That is the difficulty, in that there is no data.  What we are probably assuming is that some of the 5,000 women who go abroad are suicidal at the time they make that decision but we do not know if they are suicidal when they have a termination.  We do not know, for example, if they bought their airline tickets and then changed their minds.  We do not know how many women are suicidal on returning home.  We also do not know how many women regret the procedure or would say they have no regrets.  We have no data and that is the problem.<\/p><p>  Many assumptions have been made.  For example, Professor O'Keane described a 20% suicide rate in women of childbearing age, but that does not mean that is in any way related to crisis pregnancy, just because the women are of childbearing age.  How can we not say that perhaps some of those women who committed suicide were women who had a suicidal reaction to an abortion?  There is no data.  A great many assumptions are being made.  If members look through the submissions, they will note that many of them have no evidence or references in this respect.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's second question was why a psychiatrist would ever prescribe a treatment that is not a treatment.  I agree, but the problem is that we do not think we are prescribing this treatment; rather, as was said earlier, we will be certifying eligibility.  Let us see if can we certify eligibility and what the eligibility criteria are.  There are no such criteria, because if a woman has mental illness or an acute crisis reaction, she will be in a state of crisis and people will recognise that.  Even when people have a simple crisis in their lives, they will not be able to think straight.  That is okay and can settle down within a day or two.  If people are in that state, their capacity will be affected.  We have to make, supposedly, in this law, a judgment that the woman still fully understands what is going on, has full capacity, is saying she is suicidal and meets the criteria that suicidality will mean that abortion is indicated when there is no evidence that it is, but we also have to make sure the woman is not so distressed that her judgment is impaired.  As we know in our mental health practices as consultant psychiatrists, those patients' judgments are impaired and we never impose any life decisions on those patients at such times.  We say to them: \"Please wait; you are not in the right frame of mind, and in a day or two, or when the medication takes effect, things will be different.\"  We have no criteria by which to apply a test for this law.  It does not exist.  <\/p><p>  The research that Professor Casey talks about involves the worst cases we can think of - patients who are extremely unwell, in a psychiatric unit, and all, as far as a consultant psychiatrist is concerned, at the highest risk possible for committing suicide.  In that situation, in which one would think we would have a very good prediction rate, we do not; we can only predict 3% of suicides.  In all our assessment cases we make a full assessment and examine all the pressures surrounding the patient and why he or she is suicidal at this time.  For example, we examine what has happened to this woman who is pregnant, what are her supports, whether she had mental illness previously and whether there was a risk of suicide.  That is all part of our assessment.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked for an elaboration on consent.  That is the issue.  We have three broad groups of women.  The first group is women who have severe mental illness, which could include psychosis or depression.  The definition of psychosis is that people can have strange ideas that are not true but they resolve with treatment.  The second group consists of those with adjustment reactions.  One can have a depressive reaction with suicidal ideation.  This is in the psychiatric classification of diagnosis, and it settles with treatment.  Both of those are classified in terms of mental illness.  The third category includes people who are in a life crisis but have no mental illness.  It could be rightly assumed that valid consent to an abortion must be given when there is no impairment of judgment and the person has the capacity to make that decision.<\/p><p>  Moving on to Deputy Mattie McGrath's question, in terms of the X case judgment, the problem is that there is no study indicating that abortion can ever alleviate a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  Professor Fergusson's research is incredibly important in this regard.  In his hypothesis he examined whether abortion reduces rates of mental health problems in women with unwanted or unintended pregnancies, and for this reason he looked at all the research.  When he was contacted he rightly said, with regard to the explicit question of a woman being offered an abortion when she is suicidal, that research had not been done.  One could understand why that would happen because no doctor will offer a woman an abortion when she is acutely suicidal.  I have grave reservations about colleagues stating that they think the timeframe should be reduced.  If one had a woman who was acutely suicidal, one would help her get better so that she had a good capacity to make judgments about what she wanted in her life.  That is all we are saying.  When somebody is acutely suicidal the particular issue is that the person cannot make judgments and the person is not looking to the future.  If somebody is truly suicidal, the person sees no future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000039#OO00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jacqueline Montwill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369059600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I find it difficult to follow on in answering a number of those questions because Dr. Montwill has answered many of them.  I emphasise that there is a difference in the groups of people about whom I have specifically talked.  I have talked about the mentally unwell, including people who have suicidal ideation and people with crisis pregnancies who are despairing and distressed.  One can imagine one's self in a crisis.  If one crashed one's car into a bollard, one would not be able to think straight for the next five minutes.  Imagine how a woman would feel on discovering she is pregnant.  It may take her a week, two weeks, three weeks or a day - it depends - to come to terms with it, but there are many problems in terms of her thinking processes during that time.  I have dealt with those.  We can help in those situations.<\/p><p>  The situation in which we cannot help and in which we have no role is that of a woman who does not have any of those thoughts.  A person can drive into a bollard and say to himself or herself, \"I drove into a bollard - no problem.\"  One can have a  person with a crisis pregnancy who is a little bit more resilient and who does not get upset but finds herself before a psychiatrist because her GP is not quite sure what to do.  The woman may say: \"I am pregnant and I do not want to be.  I have been told to come here, so here I am.\"  Our job is to assess that woman and determine whether she has a mental illness and whether she has psychiatric or psychological sequelae with which we can or cannot help.  If we cannot find anything to help her with, then we have no role.<\/p><p>  We have people coming to us all the time as a result of the recession, as Dr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned.  We have a number of people coming and going.  A person will present and say, \"I cannot pay my mortgage.  I am not depressed but I am distressed and I do not know what to do.  I was sent here; what can you do for me?\"  As a psychiatrist, I can make sure the person is not ill.  My psychiatric services are multidisciplinary, thanks to the junior Minister for Health, and I can make sure that my multidisciplinary team have nothing to offer the person.  If we do have something to offer the person, then we do so, but if we do not, I can direct that person to outside services such as MABS, the bank or the social welfare officer.  That is what I mean by that statement.

Quite honestly, the reason is that I have worked in other jurisdictions and in the very first jurisdiction in which I worked where abortion was legal, which was Jersey in 1997, I saw consultant colleagues at that time who signed off in advance.  I remember one particular individual who had a pile of forms pre-signed, and the reason for that simply was that the ideology of that individual was completely pro-choice and they had so little regard for the unborn child or for the rights of the unborn child.  My concern is that we would reduce the value of the life of the unborn, as this Bill seeks to do for the first time ever.

Dr. Montwill spoke about abortion being a social solution and her colleague, Dr. Bernie McCabe, articulated that there are often social solutions to problems that confront people with mental health difficulties, that they work in a multidisciplinary way, that it is not always just a question of medication or some intervention, and that there can be social stressors.  By that very deduction, is abortion not a solution to somebody who is facing a crisis and who is suicidal?  If the person does not get that intervention, what do we do with them?  What is the alternative?  I would like to know the witnesses' thinking on that.<\/p><p>  I raise a second issue.  We have had 13 consultants before us today.  I asked a question this morning and I will ask it again of the witnesses.  If I was in crisis today, how long would it take me to access the services provided by the witnesses?

We heard about a woman with anorexia, and the X case.  We know that very often there is distress, stress, and mental disorder, and that is what we have heard already today.  I am trying to put myself in the shoes of that one in 500,000.  I listened to Dr. Malone give figures on male and female suicide.  My role as a legislator is to protect everyone and not to say that that is not a sufficiently large figure for us to examine.  If I am that one in 500,000, what happens in those situations?  Do we put our heads in the sand, knowing they will go to the United Kingdom?  Is that the solution we are proposing, or do we ensure that the treatment is available for them and not tell them to wait two weeks?  This one in 500,000 is a rare, extremely stressful case.  These women are not in a logical, rational place.  If I am that one in 500,000, what would the witnesses say to me?

We must be very honest.  There are only two options: the woman either will have her baby or she will not.  The issue is whether we can accurately assess and diagnose somebody as suicidal so as to be eligible, under this law, for an abortion.  The problem is that we cannot do so.  We cannot say which woman will commit suicide and, more broadly, we cannot say which patient will commit suicide.  It is important to understand that research has shown that we should be considering why the woman is seeking an abortion.  Is the partner or boyfriend gone and is the woman on her own?  Does the family know she is pregnant or is she on her own there as well?  What are the pressures with regard to study and work?  What coercive pressures will be placed on the woman in making her choice?<\/p><p>  The alternative is a proper support care pathway for the woman when she presents and indicates she has an unwanted pregnancy and does not know what to do.  That is if she feels suicidal.  When we do our assessment, we must assess - as we do with every suicidal patient - whether immediate treatment is required, if the person must come to the hospital or if she can be treated in the community, if medication is required and if there is evidence of a depressive illness.  We must consider whether there is evidence of an illness that leads people to commit suicide when pregnant, such as severe mental illness or psychosis.  The two women in a million are not women with crisis pregnancies but with severe mental illness.<\/p><p>  Considering maternity rates in the UK, it has been indicated in research that the women committing suicide have severe mental illnesses that are either under-diagnosed or inappropriately diagnosed.  There is no reduction where abortion is freely available.  They are not getting full and proper treatment, which is the issue.  These women need best practice and full assessment.  We should not skimp on that but this law will skimp on it.<\/p><p>  A second issue is the idea that suicide in pregnancy is a real risk.  It is absolutely a real risk.  We deal with it all the time in pregnant women, and the highest risk is in the post-partum period.  We are very aware of that, but it is not what this law is about.  Listening to the four previous contributors, one can see that what we are talking about is not women with mental illness but rather women with a firm belief that they do not want to be pregnant.  If a woman goes to a doctor and states that she is suicidal and will kill herself because of an unwanted pregnancy, if this Bill becomes law no psychiatrist will be able to say that this woman will not kill herself, and women will be processed through this law.  They will also miss out on proper assessment, which is a problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000041#QQ00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jacqueline Montwill"},{"type":"speech","time":1369060800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>How will women miss out and not get a full assessment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000041#QQ00700","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369060800,"counter":249,"content":"<p>That is what I am concerned about.  For example, I have heard that there is a reduction in time to 72 hours.  The Bill is proposing that the period be seven days.  If a person presents as being acutely suicidal, mental illness will respond to treatment, but only over time.  If the person has severe depression or psychosis, antidepressants normally take four to six weeks to take effect.  That is the nature of the disorder.  We do not know how long acute crisis and adjustment reactions take, as it depends on a person's circumstances and how they present.  Sometimes patients present with acute adjustment reaction on Friday evening and by Saturday morning, if they are in hospital with one-to-one support from nurses, they feel much better.  It can be a wonderful thing.  A young female came to me one morning and said she could not believe she was not suicidal.  I had told her the treatment would work but she did not believe it at the time, although it worked.  We have to hold with our patients while the treatment works.  That is what we do.  If a woman is acutely suicidal, she should get full and proper assessment and she should have the full assessment of the team.  She should be admitted to hospital only if she needs to be admitted, as she may have psychosis or severe depression.  She may have overwhelming anxiety or a partner who is abusive or violent or is coercing her to have an abortion.  This assessment must provide that knowledge to her treating doctor, or else she is being skimped on and is not receiving proper assessment.  That is the issue.<\/p><p>  There are no different views in how we deal with patients.  We always deal with patients in a non-judgmental way, and a psychiatrist cannot be shocked, as we have heard it all before.  There is no problem at all in hearing alternative life views or choices, as it does not matter.  Our only role is to see whether there is a treatable psychiatric illness and to ensure it is treated promptly and appropriately.<\/p><p>  Senator Burke spoke about the X case judgment.  The problem is that the judgment was made with full integrity because the worst-case scenario presented itself.  This was a 14-year-old girl who had been violated and raped and who stated she was suicidal, which is completely understandable.  The girl went on to have a miscarriage, but the X case legislation was enacted for the C case, which was again a worst-case scenario of a suicidal girl.  Our immediate instinct is to make it better; we say to junior doctors that they should not treat their own anxiety but rather that of the patient.  What, in hindsight, was the best treatment for the patient?  It was to manage her pregnancy in a safe and protected place, probably a hospital but perhaps a supported house or with her family.  We now have the evidence, in hindsight, that she stated she never wanted an abortion and was never told about it.  It happened, and she has been suicidal since.  We must stick to best practice clinical guidelines and medicine, regardless of how distressing the presenting complaint.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000041#QQ00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jacqueline Montwill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369060800,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I repeat that what seems to be intuitively correct may not be so.

If a cardiologist sees a patient who is having palpitations because he or she cannot pay his mortgage, the cardiologist will check that patient out, do an ECG, perhaps an angiogram and other things.  If the heart is normal, the heart is normal and the cardiologist cannot deal with it.

We are currently in Dublin 2.  One would go straight to St. Vincent's University Hospital where there is a protocol under which one would be seen, assessed and triaged psychologically and psychiatrically within eight hours.  If one was identified as having a treatable mental illness one would be referred on to a community psychiatric team in Baggot Street or Irishtown and one would hopefully be afforded the full complement of clinical services.  I would like to think that would be the same around the country.  Unfortunately, it is not, but it is really important in all this to have evidence of good clinical practice.  It gives hope and leadership.  It is a good question.<\/p><p>  The question on involuntary admission and therapeutic alliances is a fantastic one.  They are both fantastic questions, but that is a particularly good one because it is a real challenge to treat somebody under an involuntary certificate and working longitudinally with a therapeutic alliance.  It is something we do all the time and it is part of what we do.  I would point out that there is still no evidence that abortion is a treatment for a mental illness.  While Dr. McCarthy's point about suicide in pregnancy being real is correct, there is still no evidence that in those cases where a suicide death has occurred in pregnancy and there was a treatable mental illness, abortion was the right treatment for that person.  Again, I come back to the four clinicians from the perinatal psychiatry service over the last 20 years, and indeed all psychiatrists around the country.  I have not heard one psychiatrist say he or she has found a case in which abortion was a treatment for mental illness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000042#RR00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Kevin Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369061400,"counter":255,"content":"<p>On the issue of pathways to care, I concur with my colleagues.  Apart from the fact that we have 24-hour accident and emergency cover, I know that in the service with which I work any patients identified as posing a significant risk are seen within a matter of hours.  Suicide in pregnancy is rare and, as my colleagues have pointed out, tends to be associated with the more severe manifestations of mental illness, such as psychotic depression.  The treatment in that case is to treat the psychosis and depression.  The patient, when she recovers, would be fairly upset if she thought a doctor had ended her pregnancy because she was depressed or psychotic.  The doctor would probably be sued.<\/p><p>  I have to make this point to Senator van Turnhout.  We cannot cover all the angles.  She mentioned the one case in 500,000, but how many lives is she prepared to sacrifice for that one case?  Once you open the gates - once you legalise abortion on mental health or suicide grounds - they are open.  If we look at Britain, where in 1967 there were just under 80,000 abortions and last year there were just under 200,000, we can see the price they paid.  It is over 4 million.  It is a question that is worth reflecting on.  It is something that we should all reflect on, as members of society.<\/p><p>  The question was raised of what to do when one is presented with incredibly difficult cases.  I have no doubt I have been presented with some of the most difficult, bizarre, unprecedented, GUBU cases that I could ever have imagined.  Thanks be to God, and my colleagues, the patients have survived.  We do what we do best.  We manage psychiatric emergencies.  I am very confident in the service, particularly in the emergency psychiatric service provided in this country.  It is excellent.  It is unfortunate that the Minister for Health and other politicians might feel it necessary to impugn consultant psychiatrists, but I can honestly say that most of my colleagues work far beyond the number of hours required by their contracts.<\/p><p>  On the question of why have the fear that somebody is going to sign these forms if suicidality is not a ground for abortion, again, ideology is an incredibly strong thing and there are those who cannot see beyond their ideology.  I believe and hope that as clinicians - many of us consider ourselves somewhat vocational in our work - we are able to go beyond our own ideologies to provide the best possible treatment.  However, the people who are watching and who will read the record of this hearing now and down the years may wonder what we were so afraid of.  We read the newspapers.

Professor Kevin Malone stated in his written evidence that the field of clinical assessment of suicidality in psychiatry has not reached any kind of validity or reliability in relation to predicting suicide.  How then can the legislation, which clearly states in regard to suicide intent that it can be the only mechanism for treating a person with suicidal ideation, be implemented based on the report he has given to the committee?  What are the psychiatric clinical procedures for the assessment of suicidal risk?  We were told this morning that an assessment can be made in two to three hours.  Dr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill said it is a subjective assessment but we were told here this morning by his own college that there are many clinical markers which are reliably used, while not absolute, to assess suicidal intent.  His college is telling us one thing and he is telling us something different.  Perhaps he will clarify that.  Dr. Jacqueline Montwill made the point that women in this situation need help and support from psychiatrists but will they go to the psychiatrists if provision is not made in head 4 or some other head or will they not just travel to the UK?

If any patient presents to the psychiatric emergency department with a severe mental illness, an adjustment crisis reaction in which she is threatening suicide and saying \"I am completely upset, Doctor; I can't think straight,\" or severe symptoms of mental illness, then, during that emergency time, her judgment is impaired.  That only means that we ask the patient to come into hospital or offer to treat her at home where our nurse can go and see her.  If at that time the law says that the patient has full capacity to make the decision about an abortion, then that is the issue, not whether she is suicidal.  We believe that what patients say is true for them.  We always believe what the patient says because that is part of the clinical presentation.  The issue about capacity is this: are you suggesting that we should offer an abortion to a woman who might be seriously psychotic, who might be severely depressed or who might be suicidal in a crisis reaction, when perhaps her judgment is impaired just for that period?  What we are saying is that we should treat the woman, and when her judgment is more robust, then she will be able to make that decision - not when she is acutely suicidal. <\/p><p>   Senator Hayden asked whether I can guarantee that any woman who is suicidal can be cured.  We aim to cure all our patients, but the problem with suicide is that there could be an impulsive thought that comes into the patient's mind or there could be outside circumstances that we do not know about.  The tragedy of a completed suicide must be assessed completely.  The most important thing is whether the person got a full and proper assessment and proper treatment, whether he or she was complying with the treatment and whether we were managing him or her as closely as possible.  We can never guarantee that a person will be completely cured.  We would hope to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000044#TT00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jacqueline Montwill"},{"type":"speech","time":1369062600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>The answer is \"No.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000044#TT00400","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369062600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>It cannot be guaranteed in any element of medicine.  There is one other matter, however.  The criteria that the Government has put into this legislation are not true criteria to assess suicidality.  They are pretend criteria that it has made up to assess eligibility for abortion, but no such criteria exist.  We cannot tell who will commit suicide, but we can say to every one of our patients that we will treat them as if they are going to commit suicide and we will make it as safe as possible for them.<\/p><p>  It was stated that I said there were no medical criteria for assessing crisis pregnancy.  I am pretty sure I did not say that.  If I did then I must have been nervous.  No; there is no question of anybody not getting the proper assessment, and that is the issue here.  The problem is that the discussion is now moving from women with mental illness to women with no mental disorder.  I have a little bit of an issue here, because I wonder at what point a woman will be completely over her crisis, will be completely adjusted and will have no mental disorder.  My colleagues described that scenario earlier this morning, and I can see the scenario in front of me.  It is a woman who comes in and says, \"Doctor, I have an unwanted pregnancy.  I have a right under this law to an abortion and I am telling you now that I am going to kill myself.\"  We say, \"We will treat you anyway, but we are going to put you through the pathway to see the panels.\"  We ask the patient if she will see our psychologist, if she will give us the full background, and if we can talk to her partner or family.  She says, \"No, I don't want any of that.  I just want the abortion.  I am telling you now I am suicidal.\"  In those circumstances we will continue to offer treatments, but the woman will now go through into this process.  In law there is no psychiatrist on the panel - as we said, we cannot guarantee anything - who will be able to say the woman will not commit suicide, so it is a direct pathway.  What is happening, though, for that woman in crisis?  Why will she not allow the assessment?  What are the pressures being put on her?  It would not be out of the range of possibility that a partner has urged the woman to go in there and tell us she is suicidal.  That is my point.  She is not getting a proper assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000044#TT00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jacqueline Montwill"},{"type":"speech","time":1369062600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Can I ask a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000044#TT00600","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369062600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000044#TT00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jacqueline Montwill"},{"type":"speech","time":1369062600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>The law as it stands refers to circumstances in which all other treatments have failed and where abortion is the only option.

This is a timing issue.  The explanatory note to head 2 states that it is not necessary for the medical practitioner to be of the view that loss of life is \"inevitable or immediate.\"  It does not clarify how far into the future one should consider the risk to apply.  Could it be six months, two years or ten years?  That is the point that is being made.  There is no bar.  This can extend to anybody at any point in her life.  I hope that I have answered the question.<\/p><p>  With regard to having no way of predicting suicide, we do not predict suicide very well.  I mentioned that specifically in my earlier speech.  We are very good at risk assessment, though.  We do a lot of risk assessment and we do it very well.  We put a lot of people into the high-risk category and we monitor a lot of people as a result.  However, we have no real way of knowing who is going to proceed to suicide.  We just do not.  We know this from various studies.  We have done studies ourselves, and there have been actuarial studies that did not involve practitioners.  They basically told us that we are not good at predicting who will commit suicide, so we should not try to do so; we should be over-cautious and keep monitoring the high-risk people.  That is what we do.  We will never be able to predict.  If we could predict - and it would be very nice if we could - we would not have any suicides.<\/p><p>  With regard to mistrust of colleagues, I am not quite sure what that is referring to.  Does it refer to the letter that went to the college on Friday morning because some members did not have access to the text of the college's submission?  I am not sure if that is what is being talked about.  That is an area of concern to members that will play out.<\/p><p>  There was a question about whether a determination that a patient was lacking in judgment meant that we did not believe the patient.  That is not the case and never will be the case.  A lack of judgment is not necessarily a lack of capacity.  It ranges all the way from being upset to not being able to form thoughts properly because one is psychotic.  It encompasses a wide range and does not mean the patient is not believed.  It does need psychiatric interventions of all sorts, ranging from psychotherapeutic interventions to admission, if necessary, and medication, if necessary.  It does not equal not being believed.  We do not refuse to believe our patients.  We have no choice but to believe them, and we want to believe them.  That does not mean we do not assess them.  We will always assess them very thoroughly, and the assessment does not take two hours for every patient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000044#TT01800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Bernie McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369063200,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I will try to answer two questions.  The first relates to the science question.  I refer the committee to a paper I wrote in the <i>American Journal of Psychiatry<\/i> in 1995 about clinical versus research assessment of suicidal behaviour in major psychiatric disorders which refers to the strengths and weaknesses of any type of predictive modelling, which was obviously peer-reviewed by international scientists.<\/p><p>  The second point I make is that, because suicide in pregnancy, at 500,000:1, is such a rare event, it is statistically impossible to construct any type of predictive modelling.  That is where we stand on that.  One will never be able to construct a predictive model.<\/p><p>  The third point I address relates to the question I have raised about normalisation through an amplified signal and in this legislation, writing suicidality into Irish law.  I have just published a study on suicide in Ireland where the problem is very particular to young men and there is a clustering problem in young men.  These young men are frequently at the margins of society and they are vulnerable.  I think introducing something that makes suicidality okay for some people for certain social needs really creates a challenge for Irish society.<\/p><p>  Then, on the second point, if one increases inadvertently male suicide - we have done a study of female suicides - there is a two-year lagged effect.  When male suicide rates increase in Ireland, two years later one will get an increase in the female suicide rates.  We have documented that over a 15 year period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000045#UU00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Kevin Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369063200,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Obviously, there was a misunderstanding in relation to someone stating that there were clinical markers for suicidality.

I would like to ask the panel about Women Hurt.  I was deeply offended at the last session when Dr. Ferguson stated that people who are dissatisfied set up pressure groups.<\/p><p>  Professor O'Keane said that there are 150,000 women out there who have had abortions and - I forget the exact terminology - not that many must have been affected because they have not come forward.  Have any of them come forward to the witnesses?  My understanding is that Women Hurt was invited in here and everybody was invited to hear them.  They sent an invitation to everybody.  They are still available for people to talk to.  My understanding is that many of the people in that organisation have lied about the impact of their abortion and have not even told their psychiatrist about the abortion.  They just recount their difficulties and look for a cure without coming up with a solution.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on that.<\/p><p>  There appears to be a division and while it is not a clinical matter, it is important.  This morning I asked Dr. McCarthy about the survey he referred to concerning 113 or 120 people.  He questioned the accuracy or authenticity of it.  One of the other speakers did also.  Perhaps the witnesses could elaborate on that.  I was surprised when I heard Dr. Sheehan.  It appeared to me that he had not participated in the College of Psychiatrists survey, although I may be wrong.  I would like to know if the witnesses got the one from the college, of which there are 864 members.  Do we know how many people responded to that?  I asked that question this morning but I did not find out.  Perhaps the witnesses have that information.<\/p><p>  I have a couple of points following Professor O'Keane's talk this morning.

Is there any evidence to sustain that?  Perhaps that point could be clarified.<\/p><p>   Professor O'Keane's written submission stated that in situations where abortion services are not available, unwanted pregnancy is a leading cause of suicide.  In her verbal presentation this morning, she said it was a leading cause of death.<\/p><p>  In Ireland in the 1950s, 10% of Irish women who killed themselves were pregnant.  Do we have a figure on what the number was?  Of the 10% who killed themselves when pregnant, do we have any statistics on what the basis was?  Was it as a result of the pregnancy or prior mental health?  Perhaps Professor Malone can answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000046#VV00800","speaker":"1104"},{"type":"speech","time":1369063800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I have two questions.  As regards the first one, I would appreciate it if the experts could give me a specific answer.  As regards the heads of the Bill, the current position on the interpretation of the balance between the life of the mother and the life of the unborn is given in the X case.  We are told by the Government that this will tighten up the situation and, in effect, make it better.  As regards the tightening up and the clarification, I might guess how the experts will answer, but can they say whether they are in agreement with that, whatever they think or do not think about the X case?  The current practice requires the X case with all its unknowns.  The witnesses are operating under the X case at the moment concerning such matters.  This legislation is supposed to provide clarification and tighten up things, as we are told, but I wonder if the witnesses agree that it does so.<\/p><p>  The second question is a bit broader and comes back to the whole issue of treatments.  A lot of us are hopeful and Dr. Montwill spoke in a very hopeful manner about addressing people who are in distress and seeing them through.  That is very reassuring.  We would all place a lot of significance and importance on the need for treatment.  Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to speak when Professor O'Keane was here.  I would like to have put the question to her to clarify it, because she is the main proponent of this position.  When one treats somebody with a mental illness or psychosis, that treatment is invoked under the psychiatric services.  If a person does not have a psychiatric illness or psychosis, they are not getting treated.<\/p><p>  However, Professor O'Keane is envisaging another situation which is that a woman is suicidal because of her pregnancy, does not have psychosis or a mental illness but is in a heightened state of distress.  As a lay person, I would think that if a person has a mental illness or psychosis, that is obviously more quantifiable by the witnesses.  As regards somebody who is very distressed but does not have a mental illness, can that person even be treated?  We are all reassuring ourselves that people are going to get treated, but is there actually a treatment for such a person who does not have a mental illness?  In that situation, and accepting what Professor O'Keane says, are the witnesses saying that this person is very upset and really believes - this is not about duping somebody or having them on - that they need to have a termination and therefore there is nothing the witnesses can do for them in that situation because there is no treatment where there is not a psychosis or a mental illness?<\/p><p>  I would like to have some clarification.  In my lay person's view, surely if I put myself in that boat, not having a psychosis or mental illness that I know of, and if I am in a heightened state because I am distressed because of an event, could the witnesses not talk me down?  I would say that such people would be less likely to need suicide protection compared with a person with a mental illness.  I would like to hear the witnesses comment on that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000046#VV00900","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1369063800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I will go to the panel now and call Dr. Montwill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000046#VV01000","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369063800,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I will try to answer that question first but I might need, if you do not mind, Chairman, to get-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000046#VV01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jacqueline Montwill"},{"type":"speech","time":1369063800,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Four people have offered to ask questions so I will come back to them if the panel so allows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000046#VV01200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369063800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I will answer that question.  We are in a quandary here because some of our colleagues are describing that this law will be used for people with no mental illness.  If anyone comes to my clinic or our emergency department where our junior psychiatric doctors are, and they are distressed for any reason, we will admit them.  If they are suicidal and pose a risk to themselves, or if they are so distressed that we are very concerned about them, we will do a proper assessment.  That sometimes takes two or three weeks and at the end of that assessment we will be able to formulate a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan.  I do not know when a woman in a crisis pregnancy is going to go from having the acute adjustment reaction where she is saying, \"This is the worst thing in my world; I want to kill myself; I cannot deal with this,\" to having no mental illness.  I would follow that woman all the way through anyway if she ever had a situation where she was thinking of suicide.<\/p><p>  However, we have to make a distinction in that, with this law, there will be women who will present with a firm belief that they are entitled to an abortion and who we can say, hand on heart, have no mental illness and will threaten suicidality.  That is the issue.  What do we do for those patients?  I would say to them that they should not be threatening suicide, that suicidal ideation is not a good mindset to be in, and therefore let us do our assessment.  However, if the woman is saying she does not want any of that, and when we have no concerns that they have a mental illness, we are in a quandary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000046#VV01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jacqueline Montwill","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369064400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I wish to answer Senator Healy Eames's questions as well as the question about the survey and the poll.

A number of studies show they are all over the place.  While I am sure Professor Malone would add by a factor of ten what I will give to members, these studies also extend to actuarial studies.  Even the latter, which were not done by psychiatric professionals and are purely statistical, have proven the prediction of suicide to be highly unpredictive, even in the high-risk groups.  A paper produced in 1983 by Pokorny states the number predicted as being likely to die by suicide was 35 times greater than the number who would die.  In other words, we over-predict and as a result have false positives.  I hope that answers Senator Healy Eames's question.  We are very poor at it.

We tried to identify as many working consultant psychiatrists as possible.  While the Irish college has a list, we were not allowed to use it because it is not used for such purposes.  We generated 302 names - I believe there are approximately 350 - and sent out a postal questionnaire with a statement in respect of the evidence base.  Arising from that, we received at least 130 responses.  As the numbers continue to rise, I cannot really be sure precisely what number we have reached but we got 130 respondents.  While 14 agreed with the proposals as indicated going through, more than 120 did not.  This means that 90% of respondents to the poll did not agree with the proposals or had concerns about them.

One was a question on legitimising suicidality.  The question actually was about legitimising suicide, and I do not think that is fair.  However, I think it potentially is legitimising suicidality, and that has the potential of running interference at deeper levels in Irish society than those to which we are giving full thought.  That would be my feedback on that question.  I heard someone mention Dr. Sheehan's grave concerns, and as a result of this, I would share his concerns in that area.<\/p><p>  The other question that came up was about communication of intent, which is a good question because communication of intent does increase the risk.  In other words, people who say they are going to do something are more likely to do it.  Unfortunately, one still remains in the realms of extremely rare.  When one is trying to predict something that is as rare as one in 500,000, even though one can improve the odds, one will not improve them anywhere into the range of having any type of predictive validity.  Consequently, the answer to communication of intent is yes, it increases the odds.  For example, as I mentioned, we have more than 15,000 presentations to accident and emergency each year, many of which involve people who have made an attempt on their lives.  While it may not have been of high lethality, they have made an attempt on their lives.  The vast majority of these people will not take their own lives.

It states that in a college with more than 864 members there would be a wide range of opinions with regard to the sensitive issue of abortion, reflecting the deep divisions in society about the issue and, therefore, they are confining their comments to the general scheme of the heads of the Bill rather than any overall comment about abortion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000048#XX00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369065000,"counter":383,"content":"<p>There are no data to support Professor O'Keane's point on approximately 10% of Irish women dying.  This is all supposition.  In Irish society most people know of an aunt or single woman who, because of society&rsquo;s norms at the time, committed suicide because she was pregnant.  One would hope that would not happen in modern Ireland.  There are no data to suggest that such a high rate existed.  Dr. Dermot Walsh wrote a letter to that effect to <i>The Irish Times<\/i> and he has been the inspector of mental health hospitals for many years.<\/p><p>  The other issue I wish to clarify is that there are no data for any of the assumptions on the suicidality of women who are going to England.  If women have mental illness, we hope that their first port of call, their GPs, would be able to assess it, or their family, and we have to advocate that in society so that all mental illness is treated.  That is the issue at stake.<\/p><p>  It is important to reiterate what Dr. McCabe said on the submission from the college.  We received the email on Friday.  There are approximately 350 consultants in the college but I am not sure about the exact numbers.  We sent in our submissions and only 30 of them were received by Wednesday evening.  An emergency meeting was held on Thursday and a draft was supposedly unanimously agreed.  We have no idea what was in the draft.  None of us saw the text of the submission.  We repeatedly asked about it by e-mail on Thursday and Friday and we were told it would only be published on Monday.  I have not read the submission because I did not have time today, except for two points: 72 hours is far too short to have some poor suicidal woman going through a process and being directed immediately to an abortion.  That is an abomination.  The second point is how the College of Psychiatrists in Ireland does not mention evidence-based treatment for suicidality.  The public should be informed of the evidence base for every treatment for suicidality.  I have serious concerns about the submission but I have not seen the text.  That is the issue.

The obstetricians are in agreement about the obstetrics, they are in disagreement with the psychiatry, and the psychiatrists are completely split.  That tells its own story.<\/p><p>  If I understand the situation correctly, and the witnesses might clarify if I am wrong, the one in 500,000 refers to women who commit suicide in pregnancy, and that is associated with mental illness.  If I understand it correctly, it would be impossible to find that one person in the 500,000 and abortion would not be a treatment anyway.  Therefore, what we are talking about is finding the cohort of women who say they will commit suicide and whom the earlier group of psychiatrists said must be believed.  We all understand why that is important, but it seems they are not in the realm of medicine anymore and that they are really in the realm of certification, which might explain why Dr. Peadar O&rsquo;Grady said this should not necessarily involve doctors at all.  Is that the problem here, that to catch the cohort we are talking about, it is not a medical decision the psychiatrists are being asked to make?  Is that the essence of their concern, that it is a question of some kind of intelligent guesswork they cannot do because they do not have the ability to predict who might or who might not?

There were many omissions and I came to the conclusion that this is not the protection of human life in pregnancy Bill, it is the legalisation of the killing of one of the two patients in obstetrics Bill.<\/p><p>  On morbidity and mortality, for women who have had terminations, the figures vary.  In 16 years of psychiatry, and I am not someone who is not extremely busy, I have never come across a case of a woman who has killed herself because she was refused an abortion, either in my own practice or in the practice of anyone I have ever worked with, and I have worked in at least 20 different psychiatric units.<\/p><p>  I have, however, dealt with the families of people who have ended their lives as a direct result of having a termination.  In 1992, the year of the X case, I had the unpleasant experience of losing a colleague on the anniversary of her abortion.  These are the forgotten people.  In the psychiatry textbook I used, by Professor Basant Puri, the quotation that always struck me, because the word \"only\" was used, according to a chapter written by two female British psychiatrists, only 10% of women who undergo abortions suffer severe and\/or protracted sequelae from abortion.  That suggests nearly 20,000 women per year in Britain and at least 400 women per year in Ireland.  Where are they going and who are they going to?  I treat probably more post-abortion women than anyone else in the country by virtue of the fact that I am an easily identifiable pro-life person who understands the trauma associated with abortion.  They avoid the doctors who sent them, and they certainly avoid the clinics that sent them, because they feel they have been let down and not informed and were never given any indication at any point they could end up severely depressed or suicidal as a result of having an abortion.

The commission was established to perform the functions conferred on it by that Act which was commenced in full in November 2006.  The role of the commission is to promote, encourage and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health care services and to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres.  The commission's remit extends across the broad spectrum of mental health services.  Mental health services are defined in section 2 of the Mental Health Act 2001 as &quot;services that provide care and treatment to persons suffering from a mental illness or a mental disorder under the clinical direction of a consultant psychiatrist&quot;.<\/p><p>  The procedures referred to in the heads of the Bill do not fall within the definition of mental health services and by extension are not within the remit of the commission.  All references to the Mental Health Commission in the heads solely relate to the registration of a centre at which the psychiatrists involved must be employed.  There are two references to the Mental Health Act 2001, both of which indicate that this Act provided guidance to assist in the drafting of the relevant heads.  The Mental Health Commission notes that the committee is seeking its views on how the proposed legislation will operate.  The heads of the Bill clearly specify that operational matters will be the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, HSE, and agencies providing health and social care services on behalf of the HSE under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  It is suggested by the commission that the HSE and relevant Section 38 agencies are best placed to advise the committee on operational matters.<\/p><p>  The regulatory body for an &quot;appropriate location&quot;, as defined in head 1, is the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, only and not the Mental Health Commission.  The regulatory authority for the relevant medical practitioners is the Medical Council.  Formal medical review procedures will be the responsibility of the HSE, which shall be required to establish a panel of relevant experts populated with nominees from the relevant colleges, including the Irish College of Psychiatry.  Therefore, there is no role for the commission, under any of the heads, in assessment or oversight.<\/p><p>  The Mental Health Commission, from its experience in implementing provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001, has a number of general comments on the heads of the Bill which, in the view of the commission, may assist the committee in formulating its report to Government.<br \/> On head 1, interpretation,&quot;psychiatrist&quot; means a medical practitioner who is registered in the specialist division of the register of medical practitioners established under section 43(2)(b) of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, under psychiatry.  The commission suggests that clarification is required to ensure inclusion of relevant specialties within psychiatry, for example, child and adolescent psychiatry.  The term &quot;self-destruction&quot; is used in the heads of the Bill but the commission notes that there is no clear definition provided.  There is no legal or medical dictionary definition of self-destruction.  <\/p><p>  Head 6, subhead (4) refers to the appointment and authorisation by the HSE of one or more of its employees with appropriate qualifications and experience for the purposes of establishing and convening a committee for the purposes of a review.   It is unclear as to what constitutes &quot;appropriate qualifications and experience&quot;.  The Mental Health Act 2001 may provide guidance in this regard, specifically section 9(8), and the Mental Health Act 2001 (Authorised Officer) Regulations 2006 (S.I. Number 550 of 2006), whereby the grade of person who is authorised to perform the role of an &quot;authorised Officer&quot; is prescribed.<\/p><p>  On head 4, clarification is provided in the explanatory note that the two psychiatrists involved must be employed at an approved centre and one of them must be attached to an institution where the procedure will be carried out.  The Mental Health Commission advises the committee that the above criteria may exclude psychiatrists working within specialist community mental health services, as they are not always employed at an approved centre, that is, a centre that is registered by the Mental Health Commission.  A requirement that one of the psychiatrists involved must be attached to an institution where the procedure is to be carried out is a further restrictive criterion, as there are only three such psychiatrists in the country and they provide services on a part-time basis in the Dublin region only.  The explanatory note refers to self-destruction as &quot;suicidal intent&quot;.  However, this term is not specifically stated within head 4 or in the interpretation section, head 1.<\/p><p>  On head 5, the Mental Health Commission is of the view that the reasonable opinion of the medical practitioners should be required in writing, following an examination of the woman concerned and the reason(s) for the opinion should be provided.  The definition of &quot;examination&quot; in Part 2 of the Mental Health Act 2001 may be of assistance to the committee.  With regard to certain procedures under the 2001 Act, an examination means &quot;...a personal examination carried out by a registered medical practitioner or a consultant psychiatrist of the process and content of thought, the mood and the behaviour of the person concerned&quot;.<\/p><p>  The heads of the Bill are silent on a mechanism for appealing a decision of a review committee.  I will now deal specifically with the heads of the Bill <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> a person under the age of 18.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000051#BBB00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Saunders","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369067400,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to express my opinion as a medical oncologist on the proposed heads of the Bill as presented for cancer in pregnancy.  I am a consultant medical oncologist in both St. Vincent's University Hospital and the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Tallaght.<\/p><p>  Cancer is a disease of increasing age so while cancer during pregnancy is encountered, it is rare.  International data suggest that it complicates approximately 0.1% of all pregnancies, therefore in the absence of published Irish data we estimate there are approximately 60 to 70 cases diagnosed in Ireland per year.  However, with increasing age of childbearing, it is likely that this number will increase.  In pregnancy, a variety of cancers occur, but breast cancer, haematological cancers such as lymphoma or leukaemia, gynaecological and skin cancers are the most frequently encountered.  As there are many gynaecologists who can comment on surgical cancer treatment on the panel, my focus is the administration of drugs during pregnancy.  Agents used in medical oncology include traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies, biological therapies and anti-hormonal agents which for convenience I will refer to as chemotherapy.<\/p><p>  When considering the implications of this Bill for cancer in pregnancy, two main questions arise.  Does the pregnancy confer a worse outcome to the pregnant mother with cancer and, if so, will a termination of pregnancy improve her outcome?  The literature here is consistent in demonstrating a lack of evidence to suggest that termination will abrogate mortality risk in pregnant women with cancer.<\/p><p>  Does the administration of chemotherapy in the pregnant woman put that woman's life at risk in a way that is not experienced in the non-pregnant woman?  In clinical practice, we in the haematology and medical oncology field not infrequently navigate this challenging scenario.  In the vast majority of cases, chemotherapy will be administered to the pregnant woman as curative or life-prolonging therapy without significant modification as per international guidelines.  We work very closely with our obstetric colleagues to identify the optimum time for delivery of the baby, striving for foetal maturity rather than just foetal viability.<\/p><p>  There are risks with chemotherapy administration in every trimester for mother and foetus.  However, available evidence suggests that many of the agents used in the treatment of cancer have a safe profile, particularly if initiated after the first trimester thereby minimising risk to the unborn.  As doctors, a challenge for us is balancing the risk of foetal abnormalities in the unborn as a result of the administration of chemotherapy during the first trimester or its deferral until a potentially safer time for the foetus but this has implications for the mother when immediate chemotherapeutic intervention is required.  Organogenesis occurs during weeks five to ten of gestation.  The administration of chemotherapy may have unintended complications, requiring intensive care unit management potentially threatening the life of the mother.  May a termination be required to save the life of the mother in this circumstance?  It is possible but these situations are exceedingly rare.<\/p><p>  In answering these questions, I acknowledge a dearth of large prospective randomised trials investigating each question here but through retrospective cohort studies, case series and case reports the results achieved reach similar conclusions, regardless of the country where the study was performed.  It is universally recognised that treatment recommendations in pregnant women with cancer will always rely on limited evidence.<\/p><p>  My only comment in appraising the heads of the Bill is that should a situation arise where the life of the mother is at significant risk, it would be advisable that two medical practitioners on the specialist register with expertise in this area be involved in the certification process with the consultant obstetrician - for example two consultant medical oncologists or consultant haematologists, as they would have the medical expertise to advise and guide in this difficult area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000052#CCC00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Janice Walshe"},{"type":"speech","time":1369067400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>For members who were late, I wish to inform them that Dr. Kevin Walsh will be late arriving.

He then went on to define an examination.  Head 5 of the Bill provides that the medical opinion should be in a form and manner prescribed by the Minister.  Is Mr. Saunders suggesting that the Mental Health Commission's view of an examination and the reasonable opinion of the medical expert should be provided for in the legislation?<\/p><p>  My next question is to Dr. Janice Walshe and Dr. Kevin Walsh.  Has either doctor, in discussions with their peers or personally, ever come across a case whereby a woman because of her physical condition, and based on medical advice that her life was under threat if she received a particular treatment, opted to terminate the pregnancy?  In other words, have they come across a case whereby following explanation to a pregnant woman that a particular treatment could have a profound impact on her life or the quality of life of the foetus, that woman decided to terminate the pregnancy as a life-saving measure?<\/p><p>  My final question is on head 12 and relates to conscientious objection.

As such, they are confirmatory in terms of points already shared across each of the different disciplines.<\/p><p>  My first question is to Dr. Janice Walshe.  Dr. Walshe made reference to international research regarding the impact of chemotherapy treatments on pregnant women.  How extensive is that research and across what cohort of international experience was it compiled?  Is there a body of evidence already accrued based on the situation in Ireland and factored into this international research?<\/p><p>  I thank Dr. Kevin Walsh for his presentation.  I know a number of people who attend the Warfarin clinic at my local hospital.  Is it the case that there is a lowering age group who may be exposed to the use of Warfarin, with the result that there might thereby be an increased risk to women in years when conception is realistic?  Because women are now getting pregnant when they are older the use of coagulants is becoming more prevalent and the age profile is lowering.  Therefore, there is an increased risk in relation to Warfarin intake because as Dr. Walsh indicated it crosses the placenta and can cause foetal loss throughout pregnancy.  I would be grateful if he could elaborate on that point.<\/p><p>  Dr. Walsh cited statistics obtained from colleagues across the water regarding adult congenital heart disease and the termination of pregnancy.  Is the statistic of one or two women in every 3,000 particular to some practices or are they indicative?  Can Dr. Walsh extrapolate from that in relation to the likely situation that applies across the neighbouring island?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000053#DDD00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1369068000,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for attending at this time in the evening.

Perhaps Mr. Saunders would, if he can, comment on that matter.<\/p><p>  It is necessary in the context of our discussion to look to other jurisdictions.  Following the <i>Roe v.

We could deal further with the issues that arise subsequent to the Bill's enactment if a mechanism is built in to allow a review of these procedures in light of experience, perhaps after one, two or three years.  We do not know what is ahead of us in terms of this legislation.<\/p><p>  In regard to the issue of children, nothing in the heads of the Bill addresses the different circumstances of children or women who are below the age of consent, which is 16 years or 18 years depending on the perspective one is taking.

The mother obviously wants the best outcome for the foetus and we want the best outcome for both, but primarily for the mother.  We have to strike a balance between Heparin and Warfarin and occasionally this will lead us into trouble with a valve clotting.  That is a situation in which one could end up with a termination, but foetal loss is usually part of that.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the experience in the UK and other centres, I spoke with more than one centre and they had encountered only a handful of cases over many years.

Having two medical practitioners in medical oncology might be wise because cancer in pregnancy is exceedingly rare.  As I stated, we are seeing only 60 to 70 cases in Ireland per year.  It is conceivable that there could be a medical oncologist or a haematologist who has never encountered this kind of situation.  I would feel personally that, from a safety perspective and in order to ensure we make appropriate decisions, a second medical practitioner in that area should be consulted.  In terms of the pathway, once that process had occurred, certification would occur in combination with the obstetrician.  I would not envisage this happening often, as indicated through my data.  It would be exceedingly rare that this situation would arise.  In the context of timelines, we tend not to have extreme medical emergent situations so seven days would be adequate.  The Deputy inquired as to whether GPs could be an obstacle.  In terms of specialist care such as this, GPs tend to rely very much on the information they receive from us.  I would not, therefore, see them as being an obstacle.<\/p><p>  Some of Senator van Turnhout's questions overlapped in the context of the pathway and she asked if the legislation would help this situation.

When they are known to the system, they have rapid access to us via nurse specialists and their general practitioners.  There is no real problem with that.

That would be a pretty unusual event.<\/p><p>  I must inform Senator van Turnhout on the prior advice, preconceptual warning, we may advise against it but we would fully support them if they went ahead with the pregnancy.  We always make them understand that.  We say that we do not think it is a good idea and we try to get their partners involved.  However, if they go ahead, they will get full support all the way with it because that is ultimately their choice.<\/p><p>  On the two specialists, the problem is that I am the only specialist in adult congenital heart disease.  We have been waiting five years for the HSE to appoint another one.  At the moment we would probably try to keep it simple and have one specialist.  We are always going to be consulting obstetricians - as part of a multidisciplinary team involving all the specialists - in order to make that sort of decision.

One of the issues which has exercised the committee in recent days relates to the quantification of risk, namely, the percentage chance an individual has of dying.  It is clear that this becomes very nebulous and contentious in the area of the highly hypothetical and probably-never-going-to-happen psychiatric indication.  In various medical conditions, however, it is a very real concern.  I refer to blood pressure complications, congenital heart problems etc.  I am guessing that the answer to my question is \"Yes\" but perhaps Dr. Kevin Walsh could provide some reassurance.  If someone comes to him with a particular congenital heart lesion which has caused a certain level of left ventricular dysfunction, valvular regurgitation or whatever, does he have available to him reasonably good guidelines which indicate what is the incremental risk of death to the woman in question if she carries her pregnancy to full term as opposed to her not doing so?  At what level would he consider that the threshold is such that he would strongly urge that the risk to her life is so great that she really should have a termination?<\/p><p>  My second question is for my colleague and very dear friend, Dr. Janice Walshe.  Obviously, she and I work very closely in respect of cases of this nature and she has given the committee a really good insight into the various dilemmas relating to the life of the mother, the risk of foetal malformation etc.  She is correct, we have worked out ways of trying to get the balance right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013052000055#FFF00800","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1369069800,"counter":480,"content":"<p>In respect of the question about the involvement of the Mental Health Commission, it is clear from the heads of the Bill that the services proposed arising out of the Bill will be delivered by the HSE and by the voluntary bodies under section 38 of the Health Act.

There is an assumption that the second one would be as well, but that is not entirely clear.

Would the delegations agree with that?<\/p><p>  My second question deals specifically with the physical medical emergencies and non-emergencies that arise.  Given the provisions in the Bill, do the delegations believe that they will broaden the availability of abortion, or will they merely reflect current medical practice?  Mr. Saunders made a sensible suggestion under head 5, which my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, referred to.  It is a good recommendation to the effect that the reasonable opinion of the medical practitioner should be required in writing and that examination of the woman concerned would be documented, including the reason and the opinion.  There are two points.  Does Mr. Saunders believe that the word \"reasonable\" should be attached to the word \"opinion\"?  Some have been canvassing that the word \"reasonable\" should be removed and this concerns me.  Does Mr. Saunders believe that as part of the recording of information - which I believe is essential in future for making decisions - the consultation with the general practitioner should also be fully recorded by the consultant involved in dealing with it?<\/p><p>  Reference was made earlier to Miss C.  As the delegations may remember, in 1997 she was brought to Britain by State officials to have her baby taken out, as she has described herself.

When the commission was discussing the issues it noted the difference and that in the case of physical severe illness there was a requirement for a consultant obstetrician plus medical specialists up from the disease entity - that was the issue - whereas head 4 refers to two psychiatrists.  This is explained in the heads by the statement that the provision for two psychiatrists in addition to an obstetrician arises from the recognised clinical challenges in accurately assessing suicidal intent and the absence of objective clinical markers.  In these cases the Bill provides that the opinion will be jointly certified by an obstetrician gynaecologist and two psychiatrists.  I suppose that is the answer.  There is a recognition in general that the ability to predict the seriousness and consequence of suicidal ideation is a difficult one.  There is a distinct difference between head 2 and head 4.  One could argue conversely that perhaps it should be the same and that there should be an obstetrician and one psychiatrist in the same way that there is one obstetrician and one physical specialist in the case of head 2, but I believe it is a matter of debate and opinion rather than a matter supported by scientific fact.<\/p><p>  The question of children was raised.

Could Dr. Walshe clarify for the record what is available currently in Ireland for a woman in the position of C?

To make a will, one has to be of sound mind, yet with this Bill essentially we will be certifying a woman who is suicidal, and in that respect she could be considered not to be of sound of mind, to make a final decision about her unborn baby.

We know that the Minister for Health has expressed a view that the 2007 Act offers scope for oversight of termination of pregnancy permitted under the Bill and consistent under Article 40.3.3o of the Constitution.  From the explanatory note under head 1 it is not obvious which provisions of the Health Act of 2007 would authorise the Minister to investigate, discipline and-or refer for prosecution a physician or a psychiatrist who would certify, without justification, that an abortion was necessary to prevent the woman from killing herself, or to remove a physician, including a psychiatrist. from the panel's consideration of an application for abortion or reviewing denials of such applications.

That is a very different thing, as I and the commission understand it, from capacity.  As a note of interest, the capacity legislation that is promised in the D&aacute;il takes a view that capacity is neither 0% or 100%.

It is reassuring to hear the last point about foetal maturity, with the ethos of care coming out strongly in terms of bringing both cherished patients to a safe place.  I thank Dr. Walshe for the good work she does.<\/p><p>  I have a question for Mr. Saunders.  We heard earlier from Dr. Yolande Ferguson, one of the psychiatrists who appeared before the committee, who spoke about the way psychiatrists routinely defend their decisions in mental health tribunals.  It struck me that given the far-reaching and fatal consequences for the unborn child of the decision to certify that a person is suicidal and that there is a real and substantial risk which can only be averted by a termination of pregnancy, would it not be appropriate that there should be a forum where such decisions would also be defended?  That is arguably a more far-reaching consequence than something like detention, for example.  That thought has struck me.<\/p><p>  Turning it around, perhaps I have overlooked it but I do not see in Mr. Saunders' submission any comment on the fact that whereas a review is possible of the decision to refuse to certify that abortion would be lawful on the head 4 ground, there is no provision that any person or official would have the right to seek a review of the decision to permit a termination to go ahead.  Again, given the far-reaching consequences for one constitutionally protected actor, does Mr. Saunders believe there should be, to use a phrase that became popular some years ago, parity of esteem and that there should be the possibility of a review in those situations?<\/p><p>  I do not think Mr. Saunders made any comment on head 11, but head 11 essentially provides that records would be submitted to the Minister where a decision is made under head 4, or under any of the heads, permitting lawful termination of pregnancy.  Again, with particular regard to head 4, it mentions that no notification shall give the name or address of the woman in respect of whom the termination was carried out.  Everybody would agree that is right and proper, whatever people feel about the appropriateness of making any such certification under head 4.  However, it goes on to state that the Freedom of Information Act shall not apply to any record under this head.  Given that there would be no question of giving personal or identifying details, is that appropriate?  Can Mr. Saunders think of any reason the Freedom of Information Act should not apply?  If people are concerned about procedural abuses here, surely one important mechanism to allow us to know whether there is a procedural abuse is that the Freedom of Information Act should not apply.

The committee may know the mental health legislation in place operates tribunals for third-party reviews of decisions made to detain people against their will in approved centres.  It is a cumbersome and costly process but it is effective enough.  I am not sure how it might translate to the situation included in the heads of the Bill.<\/p><p>  With regard to third-party review, the issue I raised is that at some point in most appeals mechanisms one can make an application to court, usually the Circuit Court, to review a decision.  The point I made is that under the heads of the Bill as read now, there is no provision beyond the initial review for any appeal to a court of any description, regardless of the decision made.<\/p><p>  With regard to notifications under head 11, the commission examined this head and it appears to be quite sensible in the sense that ultimately the Minister and the Department are responsible for all health care service delivery and should have routine information provided to them to help them understand how the services operate.  It is self-evident that details about personal names and addresses should not be included in this data.  With regard to the Freedom of Information Act, I understand the Act already has provisions whereby information is withheld because of its sensitive or personal nature, so a decision will need to be made with regard to the information we are discussing under the heads of the Bill.<\/p><p>  With regard to the questions on psychiatry, psychiatrists will be asked to make decisions on the evidence presented by a woman and it is a matter for psychiatrists to reach a conclusion.
