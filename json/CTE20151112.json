During that meeting with the officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the debate strayed into the issue of burglary.<\/p><p>When the witnesses were being questioned, one of the senior officials in the Department of Justice and Equality made a comment that in their opinion judges were not taking burglaries seriously enough.  It has transpired that some pressure was put on that official to apologise for that remark.  That is quite significant.  Our system of Government is not exactly like the US system in that we do have a separation of powers.  Our Executive and our Legislature is rolled into one, and then we have the Judiciary.  I do not believe that it is out of bounds for one arm of the State to criticise another arm of the State if it is a genuinely held belief which is based on policy.  When I read the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015, which is currently passing through the Oireachtas, it is clear that the Department of Justice and Equality felt it was necessary to restrict judges' ability to give bail in some circumstances.  That is the essence of that piece of proposed legislation.  When one reads the Bill it is clear that there is a view within the Department of Justice and Equality that some judges are not taking the issue of burglaries seriously.  This is why the Bill was drafted.  I believe that a Judiciary which does not hold back in criticising the Legislature or the Executive has no right to expect to be above general criticism.  I do not think there is any bar within the Constitution on a senior official in the Department of Justice and Equality giving the kind of opinion that was given in this committee last week.  The matter needs to be looked at and the question asked: why was the official forced to write an apology to the President of the District Court?  What occurred at this committee last week, and after the fact, was very significant.  I will not say it was a seminal moment with regard to the separation of powers in the State, but I have never come across an incident like this in which an apology was demanded by one arm of the State from another.  This is a parliamentary committee and the official in question is a very senior official within the Department of Justice and Equality.  His view would be agreed with by the vast majority of citizens and might even be agreed with by some members of the Judiciary.  It is reasonable to ask who forced the official to write that apology.  This incident should not be allowed to pass.  There are checks and balances within the Constitution.  I do not believe the official in question crossed the line, and that should be pointed out by this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111200002#A00400","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447322400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Deasy suggesting that this committee should write a letter?

If the committee asks for clarification from the Department it will just be a regurgitation of \"There was no attempt to criticise the Judiciary.\"  I am afraid the committee will get nowhere with that approach.  It was very clear, and I read the transcript a couple of times.  I believe his right to make a criticism of the Judiciary should be protected.  It was uncalled for to force a senior official to issue an apology after the fact.  It is a serious matter if a person in his position cannot give an opinion or a criticism of the Judiciary; according to our Constitution the Judiciary are not above it completely.  It should be perfectly okay for one arm of the State to make a criticism of another.  If the official had mentioned one judge or member of the Judiciary specifically, then he would have crossed the line and an apology would have been warranted, but he had a right to comment on the Judiciary as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111200002#B00800","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1447322400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>That requires clarification; was it a general criticism right across the board?

Everyone acknowledges the sensitivity and the caution which applies in making any comment on or criticising the Judiciary or anyone on the Bench.  The actual issue Deputy Deasy raises is the concern over an instruction given to a senior official to apologise for a view which he expressed.  If this committee sends a general letter it will, with respect to the system, receive a fudge in response.  I hope I am not breaching anything by making that criticism.  I would suggest that any correspondence by which we hope to gain clarification be hinged on the requirement on or the request to that senior official to write an apology.  If the official had seriously overstepped and had identified an individual on the bench then I imagine other steps would have been taken, but I believe the point raised by Deputy Deasy is a fair one.  It is ironic that there is a proposal for legislation around ethics and the conduct of public and elected officials.  One of the problems stems from the culture within the system whereby raising a dissenting voice is frowned upon. Everyone recognises that this needs to be addressed.  It is not in any way helpful if a senior official comes to an Oireachtas committee and gives a considered view and as a result gets a rap on the knuckles and is instructed to apologise.  He was not making these comments on a bus or in a pub.  It is a very worrying development which goes against the grain of what is being attempted by way of public sector reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111200002#B01000","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1447322400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>If we are writing, we should ask some very specific questions of the Department.

While it is considered by some to be a sensitive matter, the appropriate letter can be written to the Department to get the answers.  I do not want to reduce the importance of the issue raised by Deputy John Deasy.  In my thinking, it goes along the lines of controlling and policing the committees, having one voice in the committees that does not in any way upset the <i>status quo<\/i>.  Frankly, this is more of the same.  While the separation of powers is important, it is also important that we hear the views and opinions of officials.  It is akin to asking the clerk not to speak at a meeting.  When democracy goes to that extent, it is a step too far.  We will write that letter.<\/p><p>The other matter arising from the minutes is the draft report on the issue of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  We now have a copy of it.  There is a request from the clerk that if there are amendments, members should let him have them because we will publish it next week.  We have been making some changes to the draft.  I think next week is publication date.<\/p><p>On HL Commodity Foods, the clerk has circulated a note on the issue.  When one reads it and recalls the meetings held, the company was treated most unfairly.  It now falls on the Shannon Group to offer some remedy to the company.  Will the committee agree to the proposals contained in the note circulated by the clerk?  It details the key facts and gives an account of the review by the committee and suggests further action by it.  In that regard, we are saying the committee can highlight what appears to have been an unwarranted action by a State agency.  It also recommends that the Shannon Group, in consultation with the Minister, consider any remedy which may be appropriate in the case.  It is extremely important that we state this clearly and make our views known.  Is it agreed to endorse this proposal?  Agreed.<\/p><p>We will now deal with correspondence received since the meeting on Thursday, 5 November.

I expressed disappointment that there is not sufficient commentary in the report on the workings of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That office was mentioned in respect of informing other committees on budgetary strategies.  The one single reforming step that could be taken if an Administration were serious about controlling issues such as procurement overspend and inefficiencies within the State, would be to increase the level of resources available to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  They should be made effective right across Government Departments and agencies from the point where money is allocated to that when it is spent.  Funding and resources should be provided to cover forensic examination of different accounts where that is deemed to be warranted.  There should also be an amalgamation of local government and the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  I made those points yesterday at the briefing session.<\/p> <p>  The sooner the Houses of the Oireachtas begin to examine that part of the balance, the better it will be for the taxpayer.  I think it is urgent and every single political party in the forthcoming election should be making an issue of this part of the administration of the State in terms of public sector reform.  We might have seen glimpses of reform but we have not seen what I would consider to be real reform, which would affect the quality of monitoring and control of the spend of taxpayers' money.  The first step should be to amalgamate those two offices and centralise power with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The resources should then be given to that office.  That would go a long way towards starting reform.  What gets counted gets done.  That is the way they should do it.  I welcome the report although I was disappointed with that aspect of it.

Our primary role is providing support to the Attorney General in discharging her functions as legal adviser to the Government pursuant to Article 30 of the Constitution.  To that end, we provide two main services to our client Departments, namely, legal advice and legislative drafting.  The advisory side of the office is organised into five specialist groups.  This allows the members of the group to become expert in those areas and provide a high level of expertise to clients.  There is constant contact between the groups and their client Departments, including meetings specifically to review the service being provided and discuss future developments.<\/p><p>The scope and variety of the legal work is very wide, with new areas of work constantly appearing and developing.<\/p><p>  The legislative drafting service is provided through the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  That office is organised into four groups, each serving a number of specific Departments, and this enables the drafters to build up a high level of familiarity with the Department's work and objectives, which then facilitates drafting on complex topics.  Like the advisory side, there are continual meetings with clients to ensure that the service provided meets their needs.<\/p><p> Much of the work of the office, particularly of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, is primarily driven by the Government's legislative programme.  Members will be aware of the extensive programme which places heavy demands on the office in the formulation of advice on legislative provisions as well as their actual drafting.  Much of the advice has to be provided and the drafting carried out at relatively short notice.  In particular, there has been an enormous increase in the number of amendments made to Bills during their passage through the D&aacute;il and Seanad.<\/p><p> The administration side of the office is an essential support to its legal work.  It is organised into a number of business units which cover the following:  human resources, finance, library and knowledge management, information technology, change management, training and development, corporate services and registry.  Senior management participate in the office's  management advisory committee while all staff are represented on the office partnership committee, as well as a number of partnership sub-committees on specific issues.<\/p><p> The office constantly reassesses the need to provide legal services to its wide range of clients and seeks to ensure that its lawyers are fully trained and resourced.  This involves making sure that legal staff are fully expert in their areas of legal work and have at their disposal all resources to do their work to the highest standard required by Government.  Law is constantly changing, through case law and new legislation, and is constantly being reinterpreted.  New developments of law emerge continuously, including through the actions of the European Union and its Courts of Justice as well as the European Court of Human Rights and changes in international law.  This means that the lawyers and the administration in the office must work together to ensure there are high levels of legal expertise and high standards of service delivery to our clients.  Everything that we do is focused on achieving this aim. <\/p><p> Knowledge management and information sharing is a central feature of how we operate.  Precedents, procedures and practices are recorded and made available as appropriate to staff.   In order to ensure that staff skills, particularly legal skills, are kept up to date and developed, the office promotes training as part of the performance management development system.   The office is consistently able to indicate one of the Civil Service's highest rates of compliance with the PMDS process and for 2014, the rate was 96%. <\/p><p> We work very closely with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, a component part of the office, in providing legal services and also share MAC, IT systems, knowledge management and an audit committee with it to ensure there are economies, efficiencies and expertise.  We also work closely with lawyers placed in Departments and offices.<\/p><p> As part of the diversification of the model of delivery of legal services, and in recognition of the expanding need for legal input at an early stage in Government Departments, the office has run a highly successful secondment programme since 2006, whereby advisory counsel from the office are placed as legal advisers within Government Departments.  In 2014, the office had 23 legal advisers seconded across 15 Government Departments and offices.  Currently, there are 18 across 13 Departments and the Irish Prison Service but following a recruitment process, former numbers will be restored with additional placements being planned.  The office also assigns an advisory counsel as legal counsellor to the permanent representation of Ireland in the European Union in Brussels.<\/p><p> The Office of the Attorney General is fully committed to public sector reform.  The work of the office is extremely specialised and demand-led.  We do not operate public programmes, as do other Government Departments, so it is not possible for the office to make savings or gain efficiencies through eliminating or restructuring such expenditure.  Nor is it possible to unilaterally decide to divest ourselves of work that our clients, the Government, Ministers and Departments, require us to carry out.  Our contention has always been that maintaining a high level of legal service in the provision of accurate advice and legislation and in the management of litigation results in savings and also the avoidance of significant costs to the State.  That is not to say that within the flexibilities available to us we have not been able to achieve significant savings.  As part of the public sector reform process, the office, since 2010, has prepared, implemented and reported on several action plans to effect change and achieve savings.  The office has consistently reduced its annual administrative costs.  By the end of 2014, compared with 2008, our gross budget had been reduced by 22.9% while our net expenditure was 22.5% lower.<\/p><p> For 2014, the office operated on an administrative gross budget of &euro;15.1 million of which the outturn was &euro;13.9 million.  A significant proportion, &euro;10.8 million, or close to 71%, of our budget was allocated to salaries.  This high proportion reflects the fact that the office is a legal professional organisation that provides legal services to the Government and Departments and does not have expenditure programmes.  The next largest allocation is the &euro;2.1 million, which is about 14% of the budget for the Law Reform Commission, which is channelled through our Vote as a grant-in-aid.  The remaining &euro;2.2 million, or 15%, is allocated to training, IT, premises and telecoms.  <\/p><p> During 2014, the office had savings of &euro;1.2 million.  The majority, or &euro;833,000, arose in subhead A1, which is salaries; &euro;279,000 arose in subhead A2, which is contract legal expertise; and &euro;139,000 arose in  subhead C, which is the Law Reform Commission.  The savings in salaries arose due to the time required to seek sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to run recruitment competitions and to fill vacancies.  The savings in subhead A2 arose due to a move to minimal reliance on contract drafting expertise.  The savings in the Law Reform Commission were due mainly to staff changes.  In all areas of expenditure, the office closely monitors and controls expenditure to ensure an appropriate use of funds and maximum value.  Each month the office's management advisory committee is briefed on the office's financial position, including such issues as the formulation of annual budgets and measures required to meet savings or staffing targets imposed by the Department of Finance.<\/p><p> The office operates a financial management system which greatly assists me and also informs the monthly presentation on financial matters to the members of MAC.  There is ongoing development of an interface between the financial management system and the case records management system to allow for the development of costing as well as enhanced financial and non-financial management reports. <\/p><p> In conjunction with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, my office has an audit committee.  The committee includes three members from the private sector, one of whom acts as chair.   Each year the committee agrees a programme of audits.  The resulting reports and recommendations are presented to the local management advisory committees and made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In late 2014, the Attorney General's Office and Chief State Solicitor's Office, jointly decided to put their internal audit work out to commercial tender.  Following that process, an external audit partner has been selected and has carried out several audits so far this year.<\/p><p> I will finish by saying that the need to ensure the State gets best value for money in public expenditure is fully appreciated by the office.  In the past five years, we have reorganised staff and our work in order to operate within the financial parameters set down by Government while still maintaining the expected high level of service.  Our main challenge will be continuing to adapt in order to ensure we meet the demands of our clients.<\/p><p> That concludes my brief overview of the work of the office and its organisation.  I am ready to answer any questions the members of the committee may have.  I thank the committee for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111200002#F02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam O'Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447322400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Daly and call Mr. Donoghue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111200002#G00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1447322400,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation to discuss appropriation account of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to Vote 5.  Before discussing the appropriation account, it might be useful if I gave the committee a brief overview of the work of the office and the more significant developments that have taken place in recent years.<\/p> <p>  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions directs and supervises public prosecutions and related criminal matters.  The office has two legal divisions - the directing division where decisions are made in the more serious cases as to whether there should be a prosecution and what the charge should be and the solicitors division which implements those decisions and represents the director in all the criminal cases in Dublin, as well as in constitutional and judicial review matters.  Outside of the Dublin area, there are 32 State solicitors who provide a solicitor service in the Circuit Courts and in some District Courts matters in their local areas.  These are solicitors in private who are employed on a contract basis to act on behalf of the director.  The two legal divisions of the office are supported by a policy and research unit and an administration division which provides HR, IT, finance and support services.<\/p> <p>  Since our last appearance before the committee, the office has established a small number of dedicated units to deal with new and specialised areas of work which I think is something that I should mention.  In 2011, a specialised financial unit was set up to deal exclusively with fraud and white collar crime cases.  The unit was initially staffed by two lawyers but it has expanded over time and now comprises five lawyers together with administrative support.  The nature of the work in the unit is such that very large amounts of documents need to be analysed and presented in court.<\/p><p>To facilitate this, the unit developed skills in the area of electronic collation and presentation of evidence.  Working with the Courts Service, the office has successfully presented a number of cases making extensive use of technology. <br\/><br\/>As the committee will be aware, in November 2014 a new Court of Appeal was established.  This resulted in a sharp increase in the number of criminal appeal cases to be dealt with by our solicitors division in court.  Sanction was obtained by the director to recruit three additional staff to deal with this increase in workload and a dedicated appeals section was established in the solicitors division of our office.  By July of this year, the Court of Appeal had processed a total of 280 criminal appeal cases.<br\/><br\/>As a result of the transposition of the EU victims directive, our office set up a dedicated communications and victims liaison unit in July of this year to deal specifically with this area of work.  Sanction was sought and granted for two lawyers and three administrative support staff for the unit.  The unit is responsible for developing the structures and procedures required to ensure the rights of victims and their families, as set out in the directive, are implemented in so far as they apply to the work of the office.  The directive will have direct effect on 16 November 2015, which is next Monday.  Under the directive, victims and the families of victims will have the right to seek reasons from our office when a decision is made not to prosecute, and also to ask for a review of a decision not to prosecute.  I should say that this builds on work we have been doing to date whereby there has been for many years a procedure for a victim to look for a review of a decision.  We have, since 2008, given reasons in fatal cases.<br\/><br\/>In 2014, the office dealt with just over 14,000 new prosecution files.  This represents the first increase in the number of files received since 2011 when we recorded the highest number ever of new prosecution files.  The complexity and size of files submitted in more serious case categories continues to increase, particularly in the area of fraud and white collar crime.  While the actual number of files received in white collar crime cases is low relative to other offence categories, this area of work, as Deputies can imagine, is very resource intensive because of the amount of material submitted in these cases and the complexity of the issues involved.  The total number of prosecution files received in the office, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of the level of resources required to deal with them.<br\/><br\/>The files now being submitted to the office by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na generally relate to more serious and complex matters.  This is because under section 8 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda is given a general consent to prosecute in less serious cases without reference to the office.  The general consent has been extended by the director to include a broader range of offences that can be prosecuted by the Garda without reference to the office.  The effect of this has been a reduction in the numbers of files submitted to the office in less serious cases.<br\/><br\/>Specialised regulatory agencies also submit files to the office.  These include the Revenue Commissioners, the Competition Authority, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Health and Safety Authority, local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  By their nature, files received from these agencies tend to be large and involve complex legal issues.<br\/><br\/>As the committee will be aware from the appropriation account, the total cost of running the prosecution service in 2014 was &euro;36.7 million.  The largest single area of this cost arises in relation to fees we pay to counsel who prosecute cases on behalf of the director.  In effect, we outsource advocacy work in the higher courts to prosecution counsel.  While the total amount paid in fees to counsel has increased in absolute terms in recent years, I would highlight that in response to the economic downturn, our office applied cumulative reductions of 24% in the rate of individual fees paid to counsel between 2009 and 2011.  These reduced rates continue to apply.<br\/><br\/>In 2014, counsel fees accounted for 37% of the total cost of the prosecution service.  It is important to note that the amount paid in counsel fees is demand-led and is driven by the number and, in particular, length of trials heard in the various criminal courts.  The office does not have control over the number and types of cases scheduled for hearing by the courts each year.  The establishment of the new Court of Appeal is also having an impact on fees paid to counsel.  This year to the end of October, fees amounting to &euro;944,000 were paid to counsel for appeals compared with total fees paid for all of 2014 of &euro;581,000.<br\/><br\/>The second largest expense for the office is salaries paid to staff which accounted for 34% of the total expenditure in 2014.  In common with all public sector organisations, the office operated within very tight staffing constraints in recent years and saw a reduction in staff numbers.  Arising from sanctions to recruit a small number of additional staff to deal with new areas of work, such as financial crime, the new Court of Appeal and the EU victims directive, staff numbers have risen to 190.  This is still well below our staffing complement of 196 from 2011.  Of the 190 staff employed by the office, 111 are legal staff and the remaining 79 are administrative support staff.<br\/><br\/>The State solicitor service and law costs awarded against the office are the two other largest areas of expenditure, at &euro;6.4 million and &euro;2.7 million, respectively, in 2014.  As I mentioned, 32 local State solicitors provide a solicitor service in the Circuit Court and some District Court matters outside of Dublin.<br\/><br\/>Most of the law costs arise from judicial review and <i>habeas corpus<\/i>applications taken by defendants.  These costs are managed through an office costs settlement policy which involves negotiating with the defence in cases where costs fall to be paid with a view to settling the question of costs without the necessity of having the matter determined by the Taxing Master.  This has resulted in a reduction in the total amount paid in costs from &euro;7 million and &euro;6 million, respectively, in 2009 and 2010.  Deputies will see from the appropriation accounts that the figure for last year was &euro;2.6 million, which is obviously a very considerable reduction.  It has also resulted in a saving of court time by reducing the number of court dates and hearings.  However, I note that this figure can increase significantly, as happened in 2012 when a small number of exceptionally expensive cases came to be settled.<br\/><br\/>I would like to outline briefly for the committee some of the challenges facing the office in the short to medium term which will need to be managed effectively to ensure we can continue to provide an efficient prosecution service.  I have mentioned the establishment of the communications and victims unit to deal with the additional work which will be generated by the victims directive.  It is difficult at this stage to gauge the volume of requests for reasons for decisions not to prosecute and requests for reviews of decisions that might be received from Monday next.  The office has done significant work in preparing for the directive.  Systems and procedures are in place to process and manage requests.  Our guidelines for prosecutors have been revised to ensure all prosecutors are aware of their obligations under the directive.  In fact, at our recent annual conference, which is attended by all prosecutors, the question of the victims' directive was central.  We are engaged in an extensive training programme, both for our own staff, State solicitors and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have drafted plain English information booklets, which will be published next week, explaining to victims how we make decisions and how victims can request reasons and reviews.  These are the documents I am referring to, and the National Adult Literacy Agency has been very helpful in terms of settling these documents to ensure they are in plain English.  While much work needs to be done, we are not quite sure at this stage what will be the resource implications of the directive.<br\/><br\/>The establishment of the new Court of Appeal has, as stated, resulted in additional work for the office.  We have additional staff in place to deal with the increased workload but we may be faced with additional expenditure on counsel's fees as the court deals with an increasing number of cases.  Cases being dealt with by our specialised financial unit will continue to put pressure on resources in the office.  Since establishment in 2011, the number of lawyers assigned to this specialised area of work has increased from two to five.  As more cases come before the courts, we will continue to review the resources allocated to this area.<br\/><br\/>I would like to mention an issue which I think will have implications for the office, that is, the starting salary level for a prosecution solicitor.  Now that the economy is recovering, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the public service, because of its relatively low starting salaries for lawyers, to attract and retain the calibre of legal staff required.  After a period of retrenchment, very attractive salaries are being paid in the private sector for even newly qualified lawyers.  If we cannot attract and retain the requisite level of expertise required by the work of the prosecution service, it will create real problems in maintaining standards and may also adversely affect the ability of the office to carry out its work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447322400,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Donoghue.

I am pleased to be able to assist the committee in its examination of the 2014 appropriation account of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.<\/p><p>I am pleased to be able to say that my office does not feature in the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and, as requested, I have provided the committee with an update on expenditure in 2015.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, my office deals with a wide range of legal work on behalf of the State.  This ranges from conveyancing and property work to advising on and dealing with commercial contracts, managing litigation taken against the State and dealing with challenges to the Constitution.  Many matters are high profile, sensitive and capable of attracting publicity.  Sometimes, they involve emergency applications to court, strict time limits and complex issues of law.<\/p><p> The Vote for my office is split into two parts, those being office administration and the provision of legal services.  It should be noted that payroll and legal expenses account for 94% of total expenditure.  Within the administrative subheads, payroll is by far the greater expenditure at &euro;14.1 million in 2014.  This equates to 52% of the entire expenditure under that year's Vote.  While my office has a staff complement of 226, there are 17 vacancies.  One of the main challenges I have faced in 2014 and 2015 is the recruitment and retention of solicitors.  With the economy picking up, there are more attractive financial opportunities in the private sector.  In 2014, eight solicitors resigned, with a further 14 resigning in 2015.  It has proven difficult to attract replacements.  The office has 13 vacancies at solicitor level.  This equates to 11% of its solicitor complement.  I am discussing this matter, which is posing a significant risk to the office, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> Expenditure on the remaining administrative subheads amounted to &euro;1.8 million or 7% of total expenditure in 2014.  The administration division facilitates a full range of support services that are critical to the provision of the legal service.  Expenditure includes items such as staff training, library and knowledge management services, utilities, building maintenance, photocopying and document preparation, and the provision of IT, telephone and postal services.<\/p><p> The provision of legal services is spread across five divisions, each managed by an assistant chief State solicitor, which is equivalent to assistant secretary.  The divisions are organised around legal case types.  All of the work is driven by the demands of Departments and Government offices.  The range of work undertaken is broad and includes matters of national importance that are high profile and of high monetary value to the State.  Much of the work is court based and can be subject to tight time limits, leading to great demands on my staff and the counsel used by my office.  The office has developed specialist expertise where necessary and has to maintain these specialisms across all legal areas.  The office also needs to be in a position to react to new legal developments as they arise for our clients.<\/p><p> Expenditure on legal services includes fees to counsel, general law expenses and external legal services, and it accounts for 41% of overall expenditure.  The main area of expenditure under this heading is on fees paid to counsel, which in 2014 accounted for 36% of the entire expenditure of my office.  I should point out that expenditure in this area is dependent on the level of activity in the courts and is, therefore, difficult to forecast accurately.  Significant controls are in place to manage expenditure on fees paid to counsel, and the management of this expenditure is a key activity for the Chief State Solicitor's office.  These are fees payable to counsel representing Departments and Government offices in litigation before the Irish courts and other tribunals and the European Court of Justice.  They also include fees payable to counsel for the provision of legal advice to the State, whether sought for the Attorney General's office or for client Departments.<\/p><p> While the controls in place are working well, recent legal activity has seen a marked increase in the complexity of the work being handled by my office in areas such as commercial litigation and transactional work, procurement work, litigation and advisory work resulting from our membership of the European Union and the implementation of directives, environmental law, planning, employment law, asylum and immigration, etc.  Furthermore, the new Court of Appeal has resulted in a faster throughput of appeal cases that heretofore would have remained pending on the Supreme Court list for a number of years.  My office has also handled a number of significant and high-profile cases relating to, among other issues, challenges to the Constitution and the recent referendums.  The result of all this is that I will not be able to remain within the 2015 Estimate allocation for fees to counsel and have commenced the process of seeking a Supplementary Estimate to be in a position to discharge all fees owing for 2015.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for allowing me the opportunity to make this short statement and will do my best to assist him and his colleagues in their considerations.  In the event that I do not have information with me, I will do my best to provide any outstanding material within two weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111200002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Creedon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447322400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Creedon.

From the point of view of State expenditure on legal work, we have strived to bring the cost down.  As I mentioned, when we had discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2011 in respect of how we go about this, the main point was to ensure that the costs came down.  In a sense, procurement methodologies came into the discussion.  It is acknowledged that we have brought State fees down.  We are not responsible for paying private sector solicitors' firms that Departments use.  That is outside our remit.  That type of work that those firms do we have nothing to do with in the sense of paying or monitoring or value for money or whatever.  Those are matters for the Departments.  From the point of view of the State work we handle, we have managed to bring costs down by approximately 48%.  That is the way it is now.

It seems that it is an astronomical amount of money when it is all gathered together.  One wonders if having, perhaps not a one-size-fits-all, but certainly a general approach drawing in the Department spend also would give us a greater idea of just how much the State is spending.  It might also suggest how better that amount of money could be spent if resources were pooled.  While this might be a policy matter, someone has to ask.

Very soon - again through the Government procurement office - there will be consideration of the procurement processes that will have to be undertaken by centralised Government.  I am sure the Government procurement agency has some sort of figures on which it is working from the point of view of introducing these sorts of framework agreements.  Incidentally, the framework agreement that will be put in place for Government Departments only covers the procurement of solicitors' services.  It does not cover counsel.  The idea is that they want to look at the issue of Government Departments that are taking in quite a lot of legal advice from the private sector - mainly commercial-type solicitor firms - and how to bring the cost of that down.  Now, in looking at these issues it is certainly our disposition that more money should be spent fortifying the Chief State Solicitor's office, centralising legal services and bringing that up to a certain level of expertise rather than paying a small number because that is all who seem to be getting the solicitor work, of solicitor firms doing work for Departments.

I will not give the name of the case but it is something I came across recently where a barrister was being paid &euro;1,500 per day.

I have a few questions in a related area.  A total of 41% of funding in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is spent on counsel fees and 37% of funding in the Director of Public Prosecution's office goes on counsel fees.  The witness indicated that this largely depends, in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions, on the duration of cases and so on.  What steps are taken to ensure cases do not drag on?  In many cases, there is a determination on the steps of the court or information is given that is subsequently ruled out of being put before the jury.  It seems that issues like this could be dealt with more expeditiously.  Counsel fees are a major issue.  As the troika stated when its representatives arrived, the major expense of litigation in this country needed to be addressed.  This again comes back to the citizen.  It is either the citizen or the relevant corporate entity that is detrimentally affected by drawn-out cases.  The taxpayer is affected by counsel fees, which are quite expensive now, if the litigation is unduly extended.  Are there procedures to examine cases and see how the length of time for them can be reduced to save money for the State and citizens?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111200002#S01000","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1447322400,"counter":402,"content":"<p>The length of trials is largely a result of the increasing complexity of cases coming before the criminal courts.

There is the likes of closed-circuit television, forensic evidence and so forth.  That is part of the reason.<\/p> <p>  With regard to procedure, we try to ensure disclosure is done as early as possible in cases.  We have done that recently in order that information is disclosed to the defence at a much earlier stage than it may have been in the past.  Additionally, the Department of Justice and Equality has examined the efficiency of the court system.  I was a member of a group some time ago, which continued with the former chief prosecution solicitor and others, and it considered ways in which case management could be improved.  Much good work was done in that regard.  The Department of Justice and Equality proposed to introduce a procedure Bill allowing for the types of issues mentioned by the Deputy, namely, the question of exclusion of evidence and so forth, to be dealt with in advance of a trial.  Part of the difficulty is that under the current system, the jury must be empanelled before proper legal issues may be determined by the trial judge.
