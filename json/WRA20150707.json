The primary purpose of Section 63 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 is to ensure that the driver licence number of individual offenders is recorded, to enable the application of the appropriate penalty points to the licence on conviction by the Court.  The Courts Service notifies all penalty point convictions to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the points are assigned to the relevant driver record in all cases where driving licence details are supplied.  Where a driving licence number is not available penalty points are assigned through a process of matching with other available information, where this is possible.  In those cases where it is not possible to identify a driving licence, details of the conviction are nevertheless retained as penalty point records in relation to the individuals concerned.<\/p>  <p>  I am of course concerned that recent figures indicate that a large proportion of persons, having been brought before the Courts on penalty point offences, did not present their driver licences in Court and in many cases thereby avoided having penalty points recorded on their licences.<\/p>  <p>  It is an offence under the Road Traffic Act to fail to provide your licence details and, as I have recently advised the Deputy, an arrangement has been put in place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service to facilitate the bringing of prosecutions for the non-production of a driver licence in these circumstances.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will shortly commence prosecutions at multiple locations nationwide, targeting persons not presenting their licences in Court.<\/p>  <p>  I expect this will send a strong message that it is essential that our Road Traffic laws are respected and that there are consequences for the minority of persons who seek to evade them.  Ultimately enforcement and prosecution of offences in this area is about improving public safety and reducing deaths on our roads, and there must be no way out for anybody seeking to avoid receiving penalty points.<\/p>  <p>  I can further advise the Deputy that my Department is in ongoing and intensive contact with the other relevant agencies with a view to ensuring that the most effective system to associate penalty points with driver licences is in place.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I have recently received an update from the Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System) Working Group on this matter and we have asked that further urgent consideration be given to this specific issue with a view to more detailed analysis being submitted later this year.  In addition to assessing the impact of the prosecutions referred to above, this analysis will consider other means of addressing this issue, including an examination of the feasibility and means of introducing a mandatory association between driver licence details and vehicle registrations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700059#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Policy","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700059#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[27048\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700059#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to combat sexual violence; if she has been in contact with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs regarding the withdrawal of funding to the Rape Crisis Network Ireland; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>A second national strategy to address domestic and sexual violence is currently being prepared by my Department.

To that end, I assume what we are discussing is decriminalising those who offer their services as prostitutes and not the buyers, brothel keepers and pimps who would also fall under the category of 'those in prostitution'.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, I would like to remind the House that the General Scheme to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, which I published last November, includes proposals in the area of prostitution.  There are two new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services.  As an additional means of combating the exploitation which is associated with prostitution, these offences specifically target the demand side of prostitution.<\/p>  <p>  The first provision is a general offence of purchasing sexual services which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and\/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence.<\/p>  <p>  These new offences address recommendations contained in two reports of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality - a report following a review of prostitution and a more recent report on domestic and sexual violence.<\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with targeting the demand side of prostitution through these new offences, it is also very important that support and assistance is provided to those who wish to exit prostitution.  My Department, through the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit, provides funding to Ruhama for the support of persons affected by prostitution.  Funding of &euro;225,000 was provided to Ruhama this year.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware, however, that there are calls to further decriminalise the women and men who provide sexual services. The extent to which these women and men are currently subject to the criminal law is limited.  Under existing law, there is an offence of soliciting, in a public place, for the purpose of prostitution and an offence of loitering, in a public place, for the purpose of prostitution.  These offences apply to both a person who offers his or her services as a prostitute as well as to those who seek to obtain such services.  These offences are targeted at addressing the public nuisances associated with this type of activity.  Without understating the vulnerability of those involved in providing sexual services, there is also a public nuisance aspect to prostitution which must be addressed.  There must be a balance.<\/p>  <p>  I am also aware of the approach adopted in Northern Ireland where an offence of paying for sexual services of a person was recently introduced.  The existing offence of loitering or soliciting for purposes of prostitution by persons offering such services was also repealed.  Consequently, those who offer sexual services are no longer subject to any criminal offence under prostitution legislation.  I am not convinced that a similar approach must be adopted in this State.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I am aware of the concerns expressed by the groups who work with the women and men in this area and I take those concerns seriously.  It is my intention to review possible alternatives which will recognise the exploitative nature of prostitution, continue to support women and men in exiting prostitution while ensuring any public nuisance concerns are addressed.  Any proposals will require consideration by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700059#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Reports","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700059#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[27012\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700059#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":" her views on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission's annual report and whether she believes that sufficient progress has been made in the commission's ability to hold the Garda to account.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is an independent statutory body established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.

The Annual Report of GSOC for the year ending 31 December 2014 is the seventh full calendar year report of the Commission&rsquo;s operations.<\/p>  <p>  As documented in the Annual Report, 2014 was a busy year for GSOC in dealing with investigations. The Annual Report states that GSOC received 11% more complaints in 2014 over 2013 and concluded 8% more cases in 2014 compared with 2013.<\/p>  <p>  I know that questions have been raised in the past about the level of cooperation that GSOC receives from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but I am glad to say that the 2014 Annual report gives a generally positive message on that issue. The Report notes that there were marked improvements in efficiency and in dialogue and cooperation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am confident that this trend will continue into the future, reinforced by recently renewed co-operation protocols agreed between GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that the public has strong confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the system of oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

As Deputies will be aware, this Government is, at present, implementing a comprehensive programme of reform in the areas of policing and justice.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Act 2015 passed by the House earlier this year is an important piece of that reform. The Act, which is fully in force, strengthens and clarifies the remit and capacity of GSOC. The legislation has provided GSOC with more comprehensive and effective powers of investigation and oversight which enable it to fully discharge its functions.<\/p>  <p>  Resources and funding are also kept under continuing review to ensure that GSOC has all the necessary resources to continue to operate effectively and efficiently and in accordance with its statutory remit. This year, an increase of &euro;1 million in the GSOC allocation was provided to resource the organisation's activities. Arrangements have also been put in place for a staff recruitment campaign to fill current vacancies.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I should say that the Government has recently agreed to nominate Judge Mary Ellen Ring to be appointed as Chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission following her nomination for appointment to the High Court.

I am aware of course of the concerns which have been expressed in relation to a particularly serious recent incident of knife crime in the city centre, and note that persons have been charged in connection with these assaults.<\/p>  <p>  Tackling this type of crime is central to the overall and ongoing implementation of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan.  This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate. As part of the Garda Plan a range of dedicated policing operations and measures are in place to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour in the city centre.

Progress is also being made on necessary reforms to legislation on sexual offences, and by my colleagues, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State for Primary and Social Care, on reforms to mental health legislation.  Another key task which is underway involves examining how the important issue of Reasonable Accommodation can be achieved within our Constitutional framework as interpreted by the Supreme Court.

The position remains unchanged.<\/p>  <p> The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is constantly seeking ways in which the visa system may be developed to facilitate legitimate travel to the State for the purpose of tourism and business.  In doing so, officials in INIS maintain regular close contact with relevant Government Departments and agencies.  It is, however, important to emphasise , at the outset, that the vast majority of tourists visiting the State - over 96% - are from countries whose citizens do not require a visa to travel to the State e.g. the United Kingdom, other EU states, the United States, etc.<\/p>  <p>  In July, 2011, the Government launched the first ever Irish Short-Stay Visa Waiver Programme.  Under this Programme, tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa are able to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  The Programme covers eighteen countries including major emerging tourism and business markets such as China and India.  The Programme has proven extremely successful leading to a 68% increase in visits from the countries covered by it  from 2010 (the last full year before its introduction) and 2013.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the success of this programme, negotiations took place with the United Kingdom authorities on the development of a reciprocal programme i.e. of also allowing visitors with an Irish visa to travel to the UK on the basis of that visa.  These negotiations led to the establishment of the British Irish Visa Scheme which I launched, with the UK Home Secretary, in October last year.  This Scheme was implemented in China later that month and in India in February of this year.  The Scheme, which will supersede the Waiver Programme, allows visitors to travel to and around the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK, including the north and south of the island of Ireland, on a single visa.  A formal joint review of the Scheme with the UK is due to be carried out shortly and both Governments have committed to the worldwide roll-out of the Scheme to be substantially completed by the end of this year.  I am confident that this Scheme will build on and expand the growth in visitor numbers resulting from the original Waiver Programme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, a liberal multi-entry visa regime for business travellers and other regular visitors with a good visa history, has been implemented in the Irish Visa Offices in Beijing, Moscow, Abu Dhabi and New Delhi over the last few years.  This regime allows for the issue of multi-entry visas for up to five years' duration for applicants with a good previous visa history.<\/p>  <p>I am satisfied that the existing visa regime continues to support and facilitate tourism growth from countries whose citizens are visa-required for travel to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700060#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Religious Discrimination","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700060#WRB02150"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[27075\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700060#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on the rights of non-religious and minority faith persons, specifically in the context of a recent review of that issue by the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.","asker":"1197","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>Insofar as my area of Ministerial responsibility is concerned, I can assure the Deputy that we are robust in our protection of the rights of non-religious and minority faith persons.

Testing of the system is currently underway. It is expected to be in place shortly.  I should emphasise that applications for re-entry visas may be made by post. There is no necessity to attend at the public office and I would urge all applicants to make full use of the postal service insofar as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In common with the re-entry system, the immigration service is also planning to introduce an on-line booking system for appointments to register and apply for permission to be in the State.

Therefore, the experience of operating the re-entry visa appointment system will be examined to see if it can be adapted for the registration and permission to remain process also.<\/p>  <p>  I should point out that within existing arrangements every effort is made to provide a customer friendly service for callers to the Burgh Quay offices.  The GNIB Public Office is open from 8am to 9pm each Monday to Thursday and 8am to 6pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays).  The office also remains open through lunchtime.  Priority is given in the early morning period for particular categories including those coming here to work or conduct business, with tickets for persons registering their presence in Ireland for study-related purposes being allocated after 9am (special arrangements are in place for students during the period September &ndash; Mid November to cover the return to studies period).  This is to minimise the amount of time persons at work are required to be away from their jobs.  In addition, the GNIB with the assistance of the Garda Press Office has recently established a Garda website notification system for the purpose of assisting persons who are required to attend at Burgh Quay for registration.

In general terms, while the Directive permits certain restrictions on legal services advertising that are informed by the public interest, the Commission has found that some of the current restrictions being applied in this jurisdiction under existing law may be disproportionate. A letter of Formal Notice to that effect issued to the Government in October 2014. The issue of there being a possible infringement by Ireland is, therefore, being resolved under current Government policy as a matter of legislative reform rather than by direct correspondence with the legal professional bodies. Such correspondence does not, therefore, arise in this instance. The Government's vehicle for this reform is the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is therefore engaged, under the normal procedures, in ongoing correspondence and consultations with the European Commission with a view to finding the appropriate balance between the exigencies of the Services Directive and those of Government policy. Such advertising refinements as may be agreed between the Government and the Commission in achieving that balance will be put forward by way of appropriate amendment to the Legal Services Regulation Bill.<\/p>  <p>  By way of further explanation of the approach being taken, the Deputy will wish to note the key change that is already taking place under the Bill in relation to the advertising of legal services by legal practitioners. While, at the moment, the legal professional bodies regulate advertising by their members, under section 158 of the Bill it is the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority that will be responsible for the making of regulations in this area. Moreover, this will be the case in relation to both solicitors and barristers.  The resolution of a possible infringement of the Services Directive is, therefore, being approached by means of the drafting of appropriate adjustments to the existing advertising reforms of section 158 of the Bill that can meet the relevant policy concerns.<\/p>  <p>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill is now before the Seanad having completed Seanad Second Stage on 13   May. It is anticipated, therefore, that any Government amendments being proposed to ensure advertising compliance with the Services Directive will be among those circulated for consideration for Seanad Committee Stage which I expect to take place in the Autumn. The intention is that the Bill be completed so that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority can come into operation without delay this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700060#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Investigations","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700060#WRB03550"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[27047\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700060#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she is satisfied with the way the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission conducts its inquiries; if she is satisfied with the way it interacts with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during these inquiries; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) was established as a statutorily independent body, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, to investigate complaints made against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  GSOC has a hugely important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded.

This is a major undertaking for the Central Statistics Office and requires detailed forward planning in order for census enumerators to call at every home in Ireland to deliver in the region of 1.8 million census forms. <\/p><p>The CSO works hard to ensure that the information collected and provided from the census remains current, relevant and of maximum use to the public. It has been common practice in advance of each census to conduct a public consultation on possible new questions and changes to existing questions, which are then considered by a specially convened Census Advisory Group in advance of testing in the field in the form of a pilot survey of some 12,000 dwellings. Unfortunately given the very tight budget circumstances in 2013 and 2014, with constraints on resources right across the public sector, it was not possible to pursue this route for census 2016. Accordingly the 2016 census is being run as a &lsquo;no-change&rsquo; census with the questions on the 2016 questionnaire remaining unchanged from those used in the 2011 census, with the exception of the question on marital status.  <\/p><p>The format of the question on disability used in 2011, and being repeated in 2016, was agreed by the Census Advisory Group which was established to assist the CSO in developing the 2011 questionnaire. This group comprised representatives of central and local government, the social partners, universities, research bodies and other users of census data, along with the relevant CSO personnel.  The group reviewed over 90 submissions for new questions or changes to existing questions during the course of their work. In addition a specific sub-group, comprised of representatives from the National Disability Authority, the  Equality Authority, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies was convened to consider the disability-related questions on the census form. The current format of the disability question was tested successfully in the April 2009 Census Pilot Survey and the Government  subsequently accepted the advice of the CSO and the Census Advisory Group to accept this format of the question. <\/p><p>The exact format of the question is outlined below, and persons can choose multiple categories of disabilities. As censuses of population are traditionally held at five-yearly intervals in Ireland it is intended that should there be a census in 2021 a full public consultation on the questions to be asked will be conducted in advance.<\/p><p>Q. 16.

On that day, the Department supported all affected customers to transition to an alternative income support payment, including the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA), and the family income supplement (FIS).<\/p>  <p>  The reforms seek to address the long-term social welfare dependency and poverty experienced by many lone parents by providing them with improved access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment supports to assist them to move towards sustainable employment. <\/p>  <p>  FIS is the most financially advantageous option that is available to affected lone parents and on the basis of advice from Intreo staff the Department has processed up to 1,600 new FIS applications to date from the affected customers.  These customers increased their hours of employment to 19 hours per week, or 38 hours per fortnight and can now also claim the back to work family dividend (BTWFD) where they can retain the child increase portion of their payment.  This is worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year with 100% entitlement and &euro;775 in the second year per child as entitlement reduces 50%.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that to reach the threshold hours for FIS an individual can work for one employer or can combine hours from a number of employers.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of customers who transitioned out of the one-parent family payment scheme on 2 July, 2015, moved to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, which is available to lone parents who have a youngest child aged 7 to 13 years inclusive and who qualify for a jobseekers allowance payment.  These customers are exempt from the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance conditions that require them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  As such, no lone parent with a youngest child aged under 14 years is required to take up employment in order to receive income support from the Department.  They can also move into education and\/or employment, including into part-time employment (for example, during the mornings, when their children are at school), if they so wish, and still receive payment, subject to a means test.  <\/p>  <p>  Jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment recipients are required to engage with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services and, more significantly, can avail of a wide range of employment support programmes, including the community employment scheme, JobBridge, the back-to-work enterprise allowance, the rural social scheme, and JobsPlus.  These customers can also avail of a wide range of educational options.  They can apply for both the SUSI maintenance and tuition grants and, if eligible, their maintenance grant will not be assessed as means for the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.  They can also participate in a wide range of SOLAS and education and training board courses.    <\/p>  <p>  Access to these services and supports is imperative for lone parents, in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved. <\/p>  <p>  Former one-parent family payment recipients who have a youngest child aged 14 years or over who are either not working or working under 19 hours per week, transitioned to a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment &ndash; with the full conditionality of that scheme applied.  These customers receive the same level of activation supports as all other jobseekers.<\/p>  <p>  For any affected customers who are currently working less than 19 hours per week and are having difficulty increasing their hours to qualify for the FIS and BTWFD payments, the Department will work with these customers and employers to assist them to find additional employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700063#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700063#WRE02850"},{"type":"question","counter":275,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[27690\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700063#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will ensure that all appropriate support measures are put in place immediately to assist employees of an insurance company (details supplied) who face redundancy; the meetings and advisory sessions that have been held to date with employees in the company who are seeking advice and support regarding entitlements; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":276,"content":"<p>On 24th June 2015, Liberty Insurance announced 250 redundancies in their Cavan and Blanchardstown offices.

There has been a substantial worldwide increase in trade in recent decades, much of which now takes place within multinational groups.  Transfer pricing is a normal and necessary feature of transactions within large groups of companies.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland introduced transfer pricing legislation in the Finance Act 2010.  The legislation provides the statutory basis to challenge an understatement of profits for tax purposes as a result of abusive transfer pricing and there is an increasing focus by the Revenue Commissioners, as for tax authorities in other countries, on ensuring that multinational profits are not understated.  Ireland's transfer pricing legislation is to be interpreted in accordance with the internationally recognised OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have adopted a phased approach to the implementation of this legislation.  The initial phase focused on requesting companies to undertake comprehensive Transfer Pricing Compliance Reviews.  In 2015, Revenue has commenced risk-based audits specifically examining companies' transfer pricing arrangements.  While the implementation of this legislation is still in a relatively early stage and Revenue will monitor whether any changes to the legislation may be necessary to address issues that may be identified, there is no concern that Revenue has insufficient powers.<\/p>  <p>  At an international level, Revenue is closely involved in the G20\/OECD BEPS Action Plan project.  In particular, the outcomes of actions 8, 9, 10 are likely to result in significant changes to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.  Actions 8, 9 and 10 seek to better align profits with the activities that create value with the objective of ensuring that profits are taxed in the jurisdiction in which they arise.  Revenue also actively participates in the EU Joint Transfer Pricing Forum (\"JTPF\"), which assists the European Commission on transfer pricing tax matters.  One of the issues currently being considered by the JTPF is the implementation of Country by Country Reporting (CbCR) at a European level.  Ireland supports the implementation of CbCR and Revenue recognises that it will be a useful tool for transfer pricing risk assessment.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of a commitment contained in the Road Map for Ireland's Tax Competitiveness which was published as part of Budget 2015, Revenue has also been allocated additional resources for its Competent Authority team dealing with transfer pricing issues.  The Revenue officers concerned engage with treaty-partner country tax administrations where a company resident in that treaty-partner country considers that excessive transfer pricing adjustments are being sought in relation to transactions involving an associated company resident in Ireland.  The Competent Authority team is also responsible for the negotiation of bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (\"APAs\") which are a form of cooperative compliance by companies that serve to reduce the risk of abusive transfer pricing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700064#WRF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Treaties","counter":323,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700064#WRF01750"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[27111\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700064#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will instance the work undertaken by his Department to help develop tax and revenue systems in developing countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[27112\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700064#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is satisfied that tax treaties between Ireland and developing countries are such as to prohibit unfair tax avoidance by companies acting in those countries; if it is proposed to review such treaties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.<\/p>  <p>  Work relating to tax and revenue systems in developing countries falls to the Revenue Commissioners.  Where the opportunity has arisen, for example in Rwanda a number of years ago, Revenue has shared its expertise in assisting tax administrations to modernise, particularly in relation to the automation of processes making use of information technology. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that Irish Aid, in collaboration with the Revenue Commissioners, is at an advanced stage of preparation of support to be provided to the Malawian Revenue Authority under the Tax Inspectors Without Borders (TIWB) Initiative.  This initiative, run by the OECD Tax and Development Programme, aims at building capacity through targeted, hands-on tax audit assistance programmes where foreign tax auditors work with local tax auditors in developing countries on actual tax audit cases, directly transferring audit knowledge, techniques and skills through a 'learning-by-doing' approach.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2013, a particular focus of Ireland's tax treaty negotiation work, which is principally undertaken by Revenue, has been to engage with African countries that wish to extend their treaty network.  A tax treaty was negotiated with Botswana in 2013 and with Ethiopia in 2014; treaty negotiations with Ghana, which began in 2014 are nearing conclusion.  In addition, Ireland's treaty with Zambia, signed in 1971, was renegotiated in 2014 and the replacement treaty was signed in March of this year.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Ireland's approach to negotiations is respectful of the need for treaties to be mutually beneficial for both countries concerned in avoiding double taxation and preventing fiscal evasion.  The effective operation of a treaty requires each country to be satisfied that the treaty meets its objectives. Tax treaties involve the sharing of taxing rights.  Ireland considers that agreeing to specific source taxation, for example in relation to dividend, interest or royalty payments, in line with the treaty policy of those developing countries that follow the UN approach to such issues, ensures a practical and effective sharing of taxing rights.<\/p>  <p>  Tax treaties are reviewed primarily on the basis of the age of the existing treaty.  Where a country has sought to re-negotiate an old treaty, Revenue has agreed to the request regardless of the stage of development of the country concerned.

Setanta was formally placed into liquidation by the Maltese Financial Services Authority on 30th April 2014 when a\u00a0liquidator was appointed\u00a0under the provisions of the Maltese Companies Acts 1995.  The liquidation is proceeding according to Maltese law.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The liquidation of an insurance company is a legally complex and time consuming process.  The Liquidator has advised that\u00a0settlements and refunds of premiums can only be paid out by the Liquidator after all of the Company's liabilities are quantified.  Since it could some time for a particular case to be finalised and,\u00a0under the Statute of Limitations, claimants are given two years following an accident to make an initial claim, it may take some years before the liquidation process\u00a0is completed.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the immediate aftermath of the announcement of the liquidation of Setanta, my officials were informed by Insurance Ireland that the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland\u00a0had indicated that they intended to accept all third party claims.  My statements in the D&aacute;il reflected this position which was accurate based on the information available at the time.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, the MIBI obtained a legal opinion and, having considered it, they advised the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in late July 2014 that the 2009 Agreement with him does not require the MIBI to satisfy awards against drivers covered by a policy of insurance where the insurer is unable to pay all or part of an award because of insolvency.  Jointly with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I\u00a0obtained legal advice on this matter from the Attorney General.  Having considered\u00a0the Attorney General's advices, I\u00a0proceeded on the basis that the MIBI would not be playing a role in compensating claimants due awards under Setanta policies and that\u00a0all Setanta claims, including those which were settled but not paid out by Setanta, would\u00a0fall to be\u00a0processed as part of the Setanta\u00a0liquidation.  The Accountant of the Courts of Justice and the\u00a0Setanta Liquidator\u00a0have done much\u00a0work to agree procedures to allow for advance payments\u00a0of up to 65% in respect of claims to be paid from the Insurance Compensation Fund.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This\u00a0updated position\u00a0was provided by me in response to Parliamentary Questions regarding Setanta Insurance and the MIBI on 17th September 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The respective roles of the Insurance Compensation Fund and the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland in the compensation of former Setanta policyholders is\u00a0currently before the High Court.

However, since Setanta\u00a0is a Maltese\u00a0authorised company subject to prudential supervision\u00a0by the Malta Financial Services Authority, any follow-up investigation on the regulatory issues surrounding the firm's failure falls under the responsibility of the MFSA as home regulator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700065#WRG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700065#WRG03500"},{"type":"question","counter":399,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[27488\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700065#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding inheritance tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":400,"content":"<p>Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) is the overall title for both Gift and Inheritance Tax.  The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. <\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the Group threshold below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.<\/p>  <p>  There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.<\/p>  <p>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000, applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<\/p>  <p>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<\/p>  <p>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, applies in all other cases.<\/p>  <p>  Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.  In recent years these thresholds were reduced and the rate has been increased in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes in the face of falling asset prices and as part of our fiscal consolidation efforts.  In addition, taxes on certain capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that property values have increased, with developments which had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country, though not to the same extent in terms of price rises.  I recognise that the increase in property values has a bearing on taxation of the inheritance and gifting of property with respect to CAT thresholds.

Lazard\u00a0invited eight major global investment groups, alongside PIMCO, to participate in a competitive sales process (Project Eagle).<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that on 10 March 2014, PIMCO informed NAMA that its compliance staff had discovered that PIMCO's proposed fee arrangement with Brown Rudnick included a proposed\u00a0payment of fees to Tughans, the legal firm who acted as a subcontractor for Brown Rudnick\u00a0and a proposed payment\u00a0of fees\u00a0to a former external member of NAMA's Northern Ireland Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NAMA viewed this disclosure as a very serious development and the NAMA Board met on 11 March 2014 to consider the most appropriate course of action.  The NAMA Board decided that if PIMCO did not withdraw, NAMA could not permit them to remain in the sales process.  On 12 March 2014, NAMA indicated its serious concerns to PIMCO regarding the proposed fee arrangement and, in particular, the proposed fee payment to the former member of the NIAC.  On 13 March 2014, PIMCO informed NAMA that it would withdraw from the Project Eagle sales\u00a0process.  For the avoidance of doubt, no fee payment was made by NAMA to\u00a0PIMCO or\u00a0to\u00a0any of the parties involved.  I was informed of these developments by NAMA, including the\u00a0withdrawal of PIMCO from the process.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  NAMA and Lazard continued to engage with the\u00a0remaining\u00a0bidders and I am informed that Cerberus emerged as the\u00a0highest bidder for\u00a0the loan portfolio.  In light of the matter disclosed to it by PIMCO in March 2014, before confirming Cerberus as its preferred bidder, I am advised that NAMA,\u00a0sought and received confirmation from Cerberus that no fee was payable to any person connected with NAMA in relation to any aspect of Project Eagle.\u00a0\u00a0The proposed sale to Cerberus was announced in April 2014 and completed on 20 June 2014.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA has also recently made statements regarding\u00a0the sales process which\u00a0outline that NAMA takes all measures it considers appropriate to safeguard the integrity of all of\u00a0its sales processes. NAMA's\u00a0statement\u00a0reiterates\u00a0that confirmation was sought from Cerberus\u00a0that no fee was payable to any person connected with NAMA, in advance of the conclusion of the sales process.  The Deputy will also note that Cerberus has stated publicly that in providing that confirmation to NAMA it sought and received the same confirmation from its legal advisor Brown Rudnik and, through Brown Rudnik, from the Northern Ireland law firm Tughans.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully satisfied that the best return to the taxpayer was achieved at that time\u00a0and that the Agency acted conscientiously in exercising its commercial discretion.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the very serious allegations made recently in the D&aacute;il refer to the actions of a former partner of\u00a0Tughans.  Tughans, in their released statement, confirmed \"that a former partner diverted to an account of which he was the sole beneficiary, professional fees due to the firm without the knowledge of the partners\".  Tughans also confirmed that the individual in question no longer works for the firm and that they have \"reported the circumstances of the departure of the former partner to the Law Society\".  Therefore questions regarding the specific allegations are a matter for Tughans, the NI Law Society, and potentially law enforcement authorities in Northern Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I understand that Cerberus, in their statement, have emphasised that \"no improper or illegal fees were paid by [Cerberus] or on [Cerberus'] behalf and [they] take any allegation to the contrary extremely seriously.\" \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I wish to stress that the recent allegations, made by Deputy Wallace, in the D&aacute;il regarding the alleged misappropriation of funds within Tughans law firm\u00a0are not in any way applicable to NAMA.  The swift remedial action taken by NAMA when an issue of concern did arise with one of the bidders, verifies NAMA's commitment to safeguarding the integrity of its sales processes.<\/p>  <p>  I would add that both NAMA and the Government will cooperate fully with any criminal\u00a0investigation, should such cooperation be needed.  Similarly, I understand that NAMA will appear before the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee, on Thursday 9\u00a0July 2015.  The NAMA\u00a0Chairman and CEO have stated that they\u00a0welcome the opportunity to put on the record the factual position in relation to the sale of the loan portfolio of Northern Ireland debtors and to address any issues, of which NAMA has knowledge, which may be raised by the Committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700065#WRG05200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":417,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[27682\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700065#WRG05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if any assessment has been carried out on the potential impact on the Northern Ireland economy following the sale of the National Asset Management Agency's Northern Ireland loan book; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":418,"content":"<p>Neither NAMA, nor my Department, has carried out an assessment\u00a0on the Northern Irish economy in relation to the sale of these loans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700065#WRG05500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[27683\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700065#WRG05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a memorandum of understanding exists between his Department, the National Asset Management Agency and the successful bidder for the Northern Ireland loan book; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":421,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance did not enter into any Memorandum of Understanding with NAMA, the ultimate purchaser, or any other third party in respect of the sale of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio.

In response to the increasing workload, NSAI went to tender for the provision of technical assessors, who commenced in January 2015.

Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought to hire a non-EEA national.  The Employment Permit (Amendment) Act 2014 provides the flexibility to deal with changing labour market, work patterns and economic development needs which often require rapid response. The Regulations, as provided for in the Act, are being reviewed and adapted on a biannual basis to reflect the exigencies of a changing enterprise environment.  They, inter alia, stipulate two types of occupation for the purposes of the employment permits system: the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations Lists (HSEOL) sets out the lists of eligible occupations deemed to be critically important to growing Ireland&rsquo;s economy, are highly demanded and highly skilled, and are in significant shortage of supply in our labour market.  This list is an integral part of the <i>Critical Skills Employment Permit<\/i>which is designed to attract highly skilled people into the labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence in the State.  The Ineligible Categories of Employment List includes those occupations for which there is a clear surplus of adequately skilled Irish and EEA nationals in the wider labour force.  <\/p><p>My Department has devised a process of reviewing and updating the HSEOL and Ineligible Categories of Employment List for employment permits bi-annually.

Such a process involves obtaining and considering advice from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SMLRU - SOLAS).  It also involves input from relevant Government Departments, Agencies, and industry as necessary.  <\/p><p>The EGFSN&rsquo;s <i>Annual Skills Bulletin<\/i>contributes principally to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing monitoring of the labour market.  This Bulletin draws on data on employment, vacancies, job announcements and immigration and other qualitative information held in the National Skills Database (in SOLAS), to identify imbalances in the Irish labour market at occupational level.  <\/p><p>The inclusion of massage therapists on the Ineligible Categories of Employment List was informed by the work of the EGFSN.  However, the periodic review process provides an opportunity to interested parties to make representations on the composition of the lists.<\/p><p>New employment permits cannot be granted for occupations included on the Ineligible List, as they are proscribed in Regulations pursuant to the Employment Permits Acts.<\/p><p>However, those employees who are currently working on the basis of employment permits granted prior to the commencement of the Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014 and associated Regulations may continue to work on the basis of those permits and may seek their renewal upon expiry. Unfortunately, while massage therapists remain on the Ineligible Categories of Employment for an Employment Permit List, new applications for massage therapists cannot be granted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700066#WRH05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":482,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700066#WRH05200"},{"type":"question","counter":483,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[27286\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700066#WRH05300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will detail compliance with the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996; the number of completed inspections; the number of compliant inspections; the number of prosecutions initiated; the number of convictions in the years 2012 to 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":484,"content":"<p>The following table provides details of the overall number of employment rights cases  completed for the years 2012-2014 inclusive.

This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  A study commissioned by my Department estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole. It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5% and increase in real wages of 1.5%. It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.<\/p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s mandate to negotiate with the United States on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) includes in the scope (paragraphs 22 and 23), investment protection and investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS).

Importantly, the mandate states that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of EU and the member states to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety in a non-discriminatory manner.<\/p><p>This means that the type of investment arbitration system under TTIP will be a vast improvement on investment protection in existing Bilateral Investment Treaties, some of which date back to the 1950s.<\/p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s Concept Paper, &ldquo;<i>Investment in TTIP and beyond &ndash; the path for reform<\/i>&rdquo;, published on 6 May, sets out the context for this reform and, building on the important progress that has been achieved in the investment agreements with Canada and Singapore, sets out four areas for further improvement: Governments&rsquo; right to regulate, establishment and functioning of tribunals, relationship between national judicial systems and an ISDS system, and an appellate mechanism.<\/p><p>These improvements are aimed at fixing the problems with investor dispute settlement in order to create a new modern system of investment arbitration.

For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, IDA Ireland does not comment publicly on the success rate of such site visits.  We must also remember that it is the investor in all cases who decides where to invest and an investment win for Ireland regardless of the location has to be seen as a plus for the country as a whole.  It is also worth noting that approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from the existing client base.<\/p><p>The attached tabular statement (B) sets out, on a county by county basis, the total numbers employed in IDA Ireland client companies in each of the years from 2010 to 2014, inclusive.

Additionally, a &euro;150 million property investment plan, spread out over five years, will support the achievement of the organisation&rsquo;s regional goals.  The funding will be used to upgrade Ireland&rsquo;s Business and Technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations.<\/p><p>In February, the Government announced details of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs: Regional<\/i>initiative which seeks to capitalise on the strengths and assets of each region to maximise enterprise growth and job creation.

The first of these plans for the Midlands region covering counties Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath was launched on Monday 29th June. This plan sets out over 120 actions aimed to deliver enhanced employment growth in the region over the coming years with a target of increasing employment in the region by 10-15 % by 2020.  IDA has been tasked with attracting 25-30 additional FDI investment projects into the region over the next 5 years while Enterprise Ireland is to increase the number of start-ups by 25% by increasing their flow of start-up companies through enterprise hubs and onto Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s competitive programmes. The overall ambition of the Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Midland Region is to increase employment by approximately 14,000 by 2020.<\/p><p><b>Number of IDA Ireland sponsored Site Visits by potential

Independent legal advice should be sought if an individual has concerns about a specific employment situation.<\/p>  <p>  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) provides general information on employment, equality &amp;amp; industrial relations legislation, through the Workplace Relations Customer Service and Information Unit.  It can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or via its website www.workplacerelations.ie.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to delays &ldquo;in the courts&rdquo;.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the administration of the courts system falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Ms. Frances Fitzgerald, T.D.   <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to people &ldquo;unfairly dismissed&rdquo; from their job.  An avenue of redress in this regard, depending on the circumstances, may be the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 for which I have responsibility.  Claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts are currently heard, in the first instance, by a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT), with an appeal being possible to the EAT in cases where the first instance hearing was before a Rights Commissioner, or to the Circuit Court where the claim was heard in the first instance by the EAT.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that there have in the past been significant backlogs in respect of both Rights Commissioner and EAT hearings.  I took the view that these delays were unacceptable, and this is one of the reasons I undertook a root and branch reform of Workplace Relations Services and Structures.  <\/p>  <p>  There have been significant reductions in backlogs.  In terms of Rights Commissioners, an offer of a first hearing for a referral under the Unfair Dismissal Acts to the Rights Commissioners Service is generally made in the region of 5-6 weeks outside of Dublin, and 9-10 weeks in Dublin.  This waiting time is inclusive of the statutory 21 day &ldquo;holding&rdquo; period provided for in the legislation, during which time a party to the hearing may object to the case being heard by a Rights Commissioner.  The current backlog in respect of EAT hearings stands at 60 weeks, which marks a significant reduction from a waiting time of 76 weeks in 2011.<\/p>  <p>  When the relevant sections of the 2015 Act are commenced, it will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure.  The activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court will be merged into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).   The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.   When the relevant sections of the 2015 Act are commenced, and the Workplace Relations Commission established, all complaints, including those under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, will fall to be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission in the first instance, and, on appeal, to the Labour Court.   <\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the relevant sections of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 will be commenced by Ministerial Order by 1st October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700067#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Data","counter":499,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700067#WRJ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":500,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[27672\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700067#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 6 of 12 February 2015, the position regarding the location of a tenant for a former plant (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"960","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":501,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[27713\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700067#WRJ00700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of a plant site (details supplied) in Cashel in County Tipperary, given that a to-let sign has been recently placed at the site in contradiction to the announcement in February 2015 that the site had been sold and a jobs announcement was imminent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":502,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.<\/p><p>I am informed by the IDA that the former Johnson and Johnson\/Alza plant in Cashel is not in the ownership of IDA Ireland, it is privately owned.

There is also a strong cluster of indigenous companies operating in the business services sector including Eishtec (Waterford and Wexford); Rigney Dolphin (Waterford); VHI, Bank of Ireland and Taxback.com (Kilkenny) and Maven TM (Carlow).

Additionally, a &euro;150 million property investment plan, spread out over five years, will support the achievement of the organisation&rsquo;s regional goals.

The sampling of greyhounds for the detection of prohibited substances is a key element of Integrity Management at Bord na gCon. Anabolic steroids such as Stanozolol are not authorised for use within the Irish greyhound industry, stanozolol is a therefore a prohibited substance. <\/p>  <p>  I understand from Bord na gCon that the National Greyhound Laboratory (NGL) has accreditation status from the Irish National Accreditation Board which accredits the NGL to undertake sampling in compliance with the International Standard ISO\/IEC 17025. <\/p>  <p>  The National Greyhound Laboratory has flexible scope accreditation. This means the laboratory is in a position to validate and add any prohibited substance to its scope of accreditation at any time. It is not the practice for a racing laboratory to list all substances for which it is accredited. <\/p>  <p>  The National Greyhound Laboratory, including through its relationship with other Laboratory services, provides the capacity to detect the anabolic steroid Stanozolol in samples obtained at licensed greyhound racing stadia. Bord na gCon is confident that these laboratory services, complemented by the use of intelligence lead sampling, can detect the unauthorised administration of Stanozolol to greyhounds where this has occurred. Bord na gCon has advised that it is currently awaiting confirmatory analysis of four samples obtained at licensed Stadia for the prohibited substance Stanozolol.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that Bord na gCon has recently conducted a review of its integrity and regulatory systems under the guidance of Professor Tim Morris (School of Veterinary Medicine &amp;amp; Science, University of Nottingham) with particular emphasis on sampling and analysis for the presence of prohibited substances and medication control issues.   <\/p>  <p>  This review is nearing completion and once it is finalised, I expect Bord na gCon to consider its recommendations with a view to identifying any amendments required to legislation, practices or policies to ensure both the advancement of Board na gCon&rsquo;s commitment to greyhound welfare, and to underpin the integrity of the Irish greyhound industry.   <\/p>  <p>  The scope of this review encompasses the capacity of the National Greyhound Testing Laboratory in Limerick, the general adequacy of the equipment used and the levels of testing for prohibited substances.

It was first commercialised in the mid 1970s and is registered worldwide. It is used in agriculture, forestry, industrial, home and garden, and semi aquatic areas.<\/p>  <p>  Glyphosate is primarily used as a means of total weed control prior to the establishment of field crops or at the very end of the growing season to desiccate the crop to manipulate harvest date and improve crop quality.

The Natura 2000 measure provides for compensation to farmers for disadvantages in their farming activities arising out of 3 Directives &ndash; the Habitats Directive, the Wild Birds Directive and the Water Framework Directive. Under the 2007-2013 RDP, Natura 2000 is linked to both the REPS and AEOS agri-environment schemes, and applicants with Natura designated land are prioritised under AEOS.<\/p>  <p>  Participation in agri-environment schemes, including Natura, is voluntary on the part of farmers and expenditure is therefore demand led. Actual demand under the Natura measure during the 2007 &ndash; 2013 Programme proved to be significantly less than had been provided for. Therefore, the financial provision for Natura was revised to reflect the actual spend as the programming period progressed. This involved the reallocation of funds across the agri-environment and Less Favoured Areas schemes in Axis 2 of the RDP without changing the overall spend under that Axis.<\/p>  <p>  The members of the Rural Development Programme Monitoring Committee were informed of the proposed amendments to the RDP Financial Plan in April 2013 and asked for observations. The issue was included on the agenda of a RDP Monitoring Committee meeting in July 2013, where it was discussed and the amendments agreed by those present. The National Parks and Wildlife Service is a member of this Monitoring Committee, as are the representative farming organisations. While the National Parks and Wildlife Service has expressed concerns in writing in relation to this matter, the amendment to the RDP was agreed by the Monitoring Committee in full accordance with the regulatory and legislative process in place.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the reference in the Indecon Report to a new Natura 2000 scheme, this refers to the introduction of the new Natura Scheme linked to the new Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) as part of the &ldquo;Health Check&rdquo; review of the Common Agricultural Policy in 2010.

In addition, the new 2014-2020 RDP contains a central focus on environmental and sustainability challenges across its schemes and supports.

One of the requirements of the programme stipulates that from 30th June 2016, at least 80% of the AI used on participating holdings must be from 4 or 5 star bulls on either the terminal or replacement index. This complements the requirement that where a stock bull is used, at least one stock bull on the holding on the 30th June 2019 must be a genotyped 4 or 5 star bull on either the terminal or replacement index.<\/p>  <p>  There is a very wide range of AI bulls available for pedigree beef breeding that are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index. For example, ICBF recently completed its listing of recommended sires for bull breeders involved in the Gene Ireland maternal beef breeding program. In total there are some 164 bulls in that catalogue of which 151 (92%) are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index within or across breeds.<\/p>  <p>  There is no restriction on using imported sires under the scheme provided they receive a 4 or 5 star rating from the ICBF. The ICBF calculates a euro star evaluation for imported sires based on their foreign data so that they can be utilised under the scheme and the ICBF is engaging with its counterparts in other countries with a view to increasing access to the genotypes and the relevant data used in these evaluations. The approach used for assigning this rating is in line with that used for all other bulls under the eurostar rating system and it is important that any rating is based on objective, scientific criteria which the ICBF can justify to each and every farmer using such bulls. Indeed, the ICBF can provide an indication of the likely euro star rating to be given to such bulls in advance of importation into Ireland and I would urge pedigree breeders to avail of the services of the ICBF in this regard. Furthermore, the fact that 20% of the AI used can come from other types of bulls also gives scope for pedigree breeders that wish to use some outcross sires that do not meet the criteria of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700068#WRK02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":597,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700068#WRK02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700068#WRK02350"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[27259\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700068#WRK02400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"with regard to estates or units of accommodation where the water infrastructure is under the ownership of his Department if the occupier of the dwelling is liable for a water charges bill, and, if so, the reason.","asker":"1192","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":598,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[27258\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700068#WRK02500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"to outline his views regarding the ownership of the water supply which serves Orchard Park in the Curragh in County Kildare; if this infrastructure has any relationship with Irish Water; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":599,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 218 together.<\/p>  <p>  The water supply to the Curragh Camp is taken from underground wells which are vested in the Minister for Defence and operated by the Defence Forces.

A wide range of strong actions is being pursued at EU level on an ongoing basis to support the actions of the Member States in combating terrorism.

I had met with the Director General of the Central Statistics Office last November to discuss the implications of the Report's findings and I am very grateful to the CSO for the professional and independent analysis which it has carried out.  This analysis is an important step in securing the integrity of our national crime statistics.<\/p>  <p>  The work of both the CSO and the Garda Inspectorate has identified common issues of concern in relation to Garda crime recording processes and systems.  Many of these issues have no doubt built up over time and it is true to say that similar issues have also been found with police data in other jurisdictions.  It is, however, essential that we have access to accurate, reliable data on crime so that the policing services offered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are responsive to current and emerging crime trends.  In addition, the public must have confidence that the published crime statistics are accurate.<\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na took a number of important steps to address the issues identified in relation to the recording of crime.  These have included the establishment of a new Data Quality Team within the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), and the piloting of a new incident recording process to test data review processes.<\/p>  <p>  I am greatly encouraged that, arising from and building on this work, the Commissioner has indicated that she expects a series of further new measures to be rolled out nationally later this year. These will ensure that all reports from the public to Garda stations and control rooms are logged in a consistent manner using a standardised method and that all incidents will be recorded and classified initially at the GISC.  This will reduce the number of incident classification decision makers and improve consistency.  Furthermore, changes to the PULSE system will ensure that the status of an investigation is correct at all times.  In addition, a new PULSE upgrade will enable District Officers to generate daily, weekly and monthly incident reviews of investigations. This will enhance accountability, governance and oversight of investigations.<\/p>  <p>  I might also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to other work being led by the CSO, in particular an Expert Panel it is Chairing to examine the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations on crime statistics, including with a view to the development of new crime counting rules. I believe this will be another important contribution to our efforts to improve crime data systems and processes.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, and as I stated when the recent CSO review was published, I am determined to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in developing its systems to meet the realities and expectations of 21st Century policing.

However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Obair was launched in each Division in the Eastern Garda Region in April 2012. The primary objective of Operation Obair is to disrupt and prevent mobile and organised criminal groups from committing criminal offences, to apprehend suspects in the commission or the attempted commission of offences and to fully investigate, detect and, where possible, prosecute any offences outstanding against these suspects. Operation Obair is the specific burglary related operation which is in place in the Eastern Region to support the national operational strategy targeting burglary crime under Operation Fiacla. This approach provides both a preventative and detection element, and focuses on geographical areas and specific targets. Targeted offences include; burglary, aggravated burglary, robbery, possession of house breaking implements, possession of stolen property and trespassing. I am advised that, as of 30 June 2015, Operation Fiacla has led to the arrest of 13,736 persons with charges being brought against 7,828 persons nationally.  <\/p>  <p>  Under Operation Fiacla Gardai utilise the full range of specialist services available including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service, the Criminal Assets Bureau, Money Laundering Investigation Unit and Organised Crime Unit, as well as Forensic Science Ireland.

Measures are also in place to target the use of motorways by criminal gangs and to disrupt and arrest those involved.

An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.

Considerable rationalisation has already taken place since the Government assumed office and work is underway to further rationalise the existing structures in order to provide for additional efficiencies and synergies.  In particular, the efficiencies involved relate to centralising the management and oversight of legal aid under the auspices of the Legal Aid Board.  This will bring greater rigour to the current system and ensure accrual of greater expertise in the management and delivery of legal aid, the ability to deploy resources in a more flexible fashion across the legal aid sector and central oversight of legal aid budgets and practices.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the provision of legal aid broadly falls into two separate categories, i.e criminal legal aid and civil legal aid.  The provision of civil legal aid in the State is already delivered through the Legal Aid Board. Criminal legal aid is granted by the Courts, through the Judiciary.<\/p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission also provides legal aid in connection with Mental Health Tribunals and the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board provides legal aid with in connection with reviews by itself of court orders to commit persons to the Central Mental Hospital (those found not guilty by reason of insanity).<\/p>  <p>  In terms of efficiencies, the Government agreed in late 2010 that responsibility for the management and administration of the main criminal legal aid and various ad-hoc schemes would be transferred to the Legal Aid Board.  To date, responsibility for the administration of the following ad-hoc schemes have been transferred to the Board:<\/p>  <p>  - Garda Station Advice Scheme - 1st October 2011<\/p>  <p>  - Custody Issues Scheme (formerly Attorney General&rsquo;s Scheme) &ndash; 1st January 2013<\/p>  <p>  - Criminal Assets Bureau Legal Aid Scheme &ndash; 1st January 2014<\/p>  <p>  The Government also plans to transfer the responsibility for legal aid at Mental Health Tribunals to the Legal Aid Board subject to the necessary legislative amendments to the Mental Health Act 2001 and the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of civil legal aid the Legal Aid Board continues to strive to achieve the most efficient use of its resources through the management of its Law Centre network and the use of panels of Private Practitioners.  Steps taken include a start-to-end case management system in its law centres, the introduction of a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach in all law centres to ensure early legal advice is available, piloting the use of private solicitors in additional areas of work, piloting mandatory information sessions about mediation where there is a dependent child, and restructuring its management\/support function.  The numbers waiting for services from the Board have dropped from just over 5,000 on the 1st January 2014 to just under 2,900 on the 1st July last.  It should be noted that despite financial pressures, my Department's financial allocation to the Legal Aid Board has not been cut over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the provision of criminal legal aid, I wish to advise the Deputy that I consider that the Criminal Legal Aid system operates reasonably efficiently within its current legislation in terms of the absence of a waiting period associated with the granting of criminal legal aid to persons charged before the courts.  The Deputy will be aware that under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the Courts, through the Judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid upon the applicant's appearance in Court.  However, a new Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Bill is currently being drafted which will update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  It is anticipated that the legislation will be enacted in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, this Government has made significant strides in rationalising and improving the efficiency of the legal aid system but this is an ongoing project with additional steps, as set out above, to be taken over the coming number of months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":781,"content":"<p>Question No. 277 answered with Question No. 270.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":783,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":782,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN01900"},{"type":"question","counter":783,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[27243\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the progress that has been made on identifying the burial place of the Tuam babies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1006","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":784,"content":"<p>The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters was formally established by Government Order on the 17th February 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission is specifically tasked with investigating post-mortem practices and procedures including the burial arrangements for all mothers and children who died while resident in these homes and the Bon Secours Home in Tuam is, of course, included in the Commission's Terms of Reference.

This table was originally published in 2007 in Maternity and Child Welfare in Dublin 1922-1960 by Lindsey Earner Byrnes and was reproduced in the report of the Inter Departmental Group in 2014 to help to illustrate mortality rates in various Mother and Baby Homes compared with mortality among the general population at that time.<\/p><p>As I have previously outlined, the 2012 draft report and the data it contains, was prepared by the Health Service Executive (HSE) based on records from the former Bessborough mother and baby home as part of its response to the <i>Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries.<\/i>This process, which was independently chaired by Martin McAleese, was conducted under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>In the course of this work the HSE provided the draft report to the Committee secretariat and to the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.

I can assure the Deputy that all significant risks were addressed immediately.  In particular, steps were taken to address the information systems being used to formally document cases, and to improve record keeping and the updating or validating of data.  HIQA was satisfied with the action plan to address the significant risks that were identified.  In fact, most of the actions needed to address HIQA&rsquo;s immediate concerns were completed prior to the publication of the report.  Over half of all actions in the HIQA action plan have been achieved, with the remaining actions on track to be completed within the indicated timescales.<\/p>  <p>  Issues were highlighted around resources and staffing in Louth Meath.  This is being addressed at national level as a matter of urgency.  Tusla has been preparing a national review of cases waiting allocation of a social worker.  I expect that this will be submitted to me shortly and this will inform the overall approach by Tusla for the budget and deployment of social work staff.  Overall, Tusla employed 3446.55 people (whole-time equivalents) at end of May 2015.  Of these, 1408.31, or 41% of the workforce, were social workers.  The number of social workers employed by Tusla has increased by 12 since the start of 2015 and by 40.68 since the agency's inception in January 2014. At end of May, 128 social workers were under active recruitment to Tusla.  It is important to recall that in addition to frontline child welfare and protection services, social workers are required to fulfil other Tusla functions, such as the recruitment and assessment of foster families.  Officials from my Department have already been engaging with Tusla on resources for the remainder of 2015 and into 2016.  A submission on staffing and other resource issues is to be made in the near future.  Tusla has indicated that it is currently looking at ways to improve the rate at which staff can be recruited.<\/p>  <p>  The Chief Operations Officer has assumed direct management oversight of the special programme for improvement and has been overseeing the implementation of the comprehensive action plan which has been agreed with HIQA.  The COO is project owner of the implementation steering group.  In addition to the HIQA action plan, further steps were identified by Tusla and are well underway.  An experienced short term social work team was put in place to assess the backlog of cases.  This has involved a significant number of cases being closed, being referred to other appropriate services, and the remaining cases were prioritised to be allocated a social worker.  The supports for the intervention in Louth Meath are currently being resourced with a Team Leader and a number of social workers.  As of 24 June, Tusla has reported that this action is also complete.  Specific training provision is on track and includes training on thresholds, assessment guidance and the Child Protection Notification System.  Actions for the implementation of supervision policy and the oversight of audits as part of the monthly review process are complete.  Overall 9 out of 17 actions identified by Tusla were completed by 24 June, with a further 6 actions on track for completion over the course of the summer.  Only 2 of the actions have revised timelines since the implementation plan was put in place, one relating to a business case to expand the provision of local prevention partnership &amp;amp; family supports (PPFS) and one about an approach to quality assurance audits.  Both of these are expected to be completed before the end of the summer.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the inspection findings were not all about deficits.  It was found that many children have benefitted from the service and that there was evidence of good practice and excellent inter-agency collaboration in Louth Meath.  Good practice with children and families was observed by inspectors.  Reforms on how the service provided by Tusla is organised nationally are taking effect.  I am committed to seeing the reforms underpin a service that delivers a consistent, responsive and safe child welfare and protection service for the children and families of Louth Meath and the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN04000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Detention Centres","counter":804,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN04100"},{"type":"question","counter":805,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[27540\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN04200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position on the Oberstown campus transition; his views that the children there are adequately supported; that the staff there are adequately supported; if he will publish the McIlfatrick report; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":806,"content":"<p>There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.  A number of actions have been taken on foot of this commitment.  These include the gradual transition of responsibility for older children to the Oberstown campus, the construction of the expanded detention facilities, the introduction of cross - campus procedures and staffing rosters, the introduction of a single campus management structure and the first recruitment programme for new care staff in many years.  More broadly, these changes have taken place in parallel with the important agenda of public sector reform under the Croke Park and Haddington Road Agreements.  As for other areas of the public service, this has created challenges.  However, I am confident that as these challenges are overcome, there will be a secure foundation for the children detention service into the future.  Working in concert with the Oberstown Board of Management, I am committed to the best possible support for both children in custody and the staff that deliver this important service.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of children in custody, a number of initiatives have been put in place in recent years to build on the child focused model of detention in Oberstown.  An advocacy service has been introduced under the aegis of the Empowering Children in Care organisation (EPIC) which is available to each child in detention.  In addition, the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS) has been introduced.  This is a shared multi - disciplinary service with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency which allows for each child to be screened on admission for any therapeutic supports that may be required.  A pilot project is also underway this year involving the provision of a dedicated package of pre and post release supports to a number of young people by the Youth Advocates Programme Ireland organisation (YAP).  This is in addition to the normal support services provided via care worker staff and management and the education staff employed the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  Finally, a new education and training building is due to be opened for children for the September school year, which has been provided under the Oberstown capital development programme.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the staff on the Oberstown campus, new supports are being provided in the form of new physical detention buildings and the first recruitment programme on the Oberstown campus in many years, including expanded nursing cover for children.  This programme has also included internal promotion opportunities for existing staff on the campus.  I understand that in the past year, the Oberstown management has engaged staff in a new Health, Safety and Welfare Committee and a new Policy and Operations Consultative Committee.  There is also extensive interaction between management and staff on the Oberstown campus on the secure operation of the facility, safeguarding practices for children and staff health, safety and welfare issues.  I recognise that there are frequent industrial relations issues on the Oberstown Campus, which to a degree may be seen in the context of the large degree of organisational changes being experienced on that site at present.  These issues are being pursued through normal industrial relations structures through negotiations which are taking place with staff representatives.  If required there is also scope for recourse to third party conciliation and if required, adjudication by the Labour Court under the Haddington Road Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The report referred to by the Deputy was commissioned in 2013 and related to care issues and operational issues on the Oberstown campus.  The report is the subject of a human resources process on the Oberstown campus.  This process is ongoing and I am advised that no steps can be taken at this time which could be interpreted as prejudicial to this process.<\/p>  <p>  I also note that the recent inspection of the Oberstown campus by HIQA has resulted in an agreed action plan being developed and implemented on the Oberstown campus.  This will also ensure safe and secure custody and operation of the Oberstown facility for both children and staff, in line with best care practice.  I wish to record my full support for the robust inspection framework that is in place under the Children Act 2001 and delivered by HIQA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN04300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Regulation","counter":807,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN04400"},{"type":"question","counter":808,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[27560\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN04500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps and measures a citizen must take to become a child care service provider; and the requirements and Government policy for opening a child care facility in any given community.","asker":"981","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":809,"content":"<p>The majority of childcare services in the country are commercial or community\/not-for-profit services.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone wishing to become a childcare provider must comply with all relevant childcare legislation and with Tusla requirements, and the planning requirements of the relevant local authority.

The Child and Family Agency is responsible for the former Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and also for the functions of Child and Family services previously provided by the HSE.  The Agency's functions include maintaining and developing services in order to support and promote the development, welfare and protection of children and to support effective functioning of families.  In so doing the Agency will promote enhanced interagency cooperation to ensure that services are coordinated on the principle of the best interest of all children and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000.  The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities.  It is anticipated that the guidelines will be completed before the beginning of the 2015\/16 academic year.  The Agency is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through the integrated working of its service strands.<\/p>  <p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to help to identify the extent to which children have caring responsibilities.  Under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives (2011-2016) analysis of figures in the 2011 Census will help to inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles.<\/p>  <p>  A National Youth Strategy is also being developed by my Department for all young people aged 10 to 24 years.  It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support.  I am pleased that representatives of the Carers' Association participated in the consultation process in the development of this strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN05200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Detention Centres","counter":816,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN05300"},{"type":"question","counter":817,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[27563\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN05400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of boys and girls currently within the system in Oberstown boys school, in Oberstown girls school and in Trinity House school.","asker":"981","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":818,"content":"<p>As of Friday 3 July 2015 the occupancy of the Oberstown campus, Lusk, Co Dublin was as follows.<\/p><p>There were 16 boys detained in Oberstown Boys School, comprising 4 boys on remand and 12 boys serving a sentence of detention.<\/p><p>There were 19 boys detained in Trinity House School, comprising 8 boys on remand and 11 boys serving a sentence of detention.<\/p><p>There were no girls detained in Oberstown Girls School.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN05500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":820,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[27564\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700071#WRN05700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of minors on remand in Trinity House from the year 2000 to 2015.","asker":"981","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":821,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in the format requested.

This allows for issues such as the seriousness of the charge and the nature of the evidence in support of the charge to be properly considered by a Court.   In addition, section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 provides that a court may reject an application for bail where it reasonably considers it necessary to prevent a person who has committed a serious offence from committing another serious offence.

Supporting infrastructure, procured through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of  multi-disciplinary primary health care.<\/p><p>Primary care infrastructure at the following locations will be delivered using the public private partnership (PPP) mechanism.  These are Coolock\/Darndale - Dublin north city; Summerhill, north inner city Dublin; Kilcock; Wexford Town; Waterford City; Dungarvan; Carrick-on-Suir; Limerick City - Ballinacurra\/Weston; Tuam; Boyle; Ballymote;  Claremorris,  and Westport.  The HSE included Ballinrobe as a suitable substitute for PPP for locations in the west which could not be progressed.  Considerable progress has been made in developing this project.  Following a detailed tender evaluation process the National Development Finance Agency announced the Prime-Balfour Beatty consortium as the preferred tenderer in May 2015.  Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2016 and it is expected that the primary care centres will be delivered by early 2017.  In the meantime work is continuing on the financial and legal provisions of the project contract.  Additional detail on the project is available on this website: <i>www.ndfa.ie\/TenderCompetitions\/PrimaryCareCentresPPPProgramme.htm<\/i>.<\/p><p>Awards of planning have been obtained for Crumlin\/Drimnagh and Knocklyon\/Rathfarnham but unfortunately this was not within the timeframe for inclusion in the PPP project. <\/p><p>As regards the remaining locations, the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is  subject to  suitable locations being offered\/provided\/available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff.  In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing.  Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.  To date it has not been possible to satisfactorily progress Donegal town.  <\/p><p>The following locations have been included in the HSE's multi-annual Capital Plans to be delivered by direct\/own-build - Dungloe; Tullow\/Rathvilly\/Hacketstown; and Rowlagh\/North Clondalkin.  It had been intended to delivery Laytown\/Bettystown and Rathdrum by means of the direct-build mechanism.  However, the proposal is to deliver both by operational lease.  <\/p><p>Kells is to be delivered by the operational lease mechanism; its construction will be completed later this year as set out in the HSE's NSP 2015.  The operational lease mechanism is also the preferred delivery option for the following locations - Balbriggan which is under construction, Drogheda north, Swords and Tralee.  In its November 2014 advertisement for primary care infrastructure to be delivered by the operational lease mechanism the HSE advertised, in addition to others, the following locations - Kilkenny city; Cork city for Togher; Clonmel; Thurles; Ennis; Gort and Ballaghadereen.

It is intended that the register of Individual Health Identifiers will be implemented first, only after commencement of the Act, and this will allow for identifiers to be assigned to individual patients.  The identifiers will be used in both the public and private healthcare settings, including community health centres managed by HSE staff.<\/p>  <p>  Preparations for the implementation of the Individual Health Identifier are at an advanced stage by the HSE.  The necessary management and organisational structures to enable the establishment of the register are currently being put in place.  A development plan is being drafted along with a  Privacy Impact Assessment which is nearing completion.  <\/p>  <p>  With the initial completion of the register the next phase will be to allow for other health care ICT systems in both primary and acute care to access the register and make it available as the Act permits.  The work will be done on a phased basis over a number of years.  Access to the register of individual health identifiers and the use to which the identifier can be put is strictly controlled by the Act.  It is intended to be widely used in health and social care settings throughout the health services to enhance patient safety and underpin efficiency.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  However, in light of legal advice following a High Court ruling, children born after 1 June 2002 are being treated by the HSE as eligible to apply for an assessment under the Act. Part 2 of the 2005 Act provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  <\/p>  <p>  Although the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the Assessment of Need (AON) process, given the number and complexity of cases, it has taken a number of measures to address the issue. It has issued guidance to its staff that, where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child. While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2011, the Department of Health and the HSE jointly commissioned the National Disability Authority (NDA) to review the operation of the Assessment of Need (AON) process in the HSE.  This report was published by the NDA and can be accessed at www.nda.ie. The NDA research has found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.  It also found that where integrated children's disability teams have already been established under the HSE&rsquo;s Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme, the AON process has worked more smoothly.  In light of the NDA&rsquo;s findings, an additional emphasis is currently being placed on re-configuring children's disability services into integrated multi-disciplinary geographically based early-intervention and school-aged teams, as part of the HSE's Progressing Disability Services Programme. The aim of this Programme is to bring about equity and consistency, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their difficulty.  The Programme is a key priority for the HSE's Social Care Directorate.  An additional &euro;4m was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million will also be made to support the development of therapy services in 2015 (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year).  The transition to this new service model is taking place on a phased basis and includes consultation and engagement with stakeholders, including service users and their families.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the specific detailed operational information he has requested.

International studies and scientific assessments suggest that the best way to prevent most disease due to human papilloma virus (HPV) is to vaccinate as many girls and women as possible.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  <\/p>  <p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  Gardasil&reg; is a medicinal product which has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  With this authorisation, the vaccine can be marketed in all EU Member States.  Since first authorisation the HPRA has continuously monitored the safety of Gardasil&reg;  .  This monitoring includes a review of global safety data in addition to national experience with use of the vaccine.  The EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union.  <\/p>  <p>While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil&reg; has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  The most recent EU review of cumulative global safety update data completed in December 2014 concluded that the benefit\/risk profile for Gardasil&reg; remains positive and concluded that no updates to the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) were considered necessary.<\/p>  <p>Up to the 8 June 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 873 reports of suspected adverse reactions\/events notified in association with Gardasil&reg;.  National monitoring experience has been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects known to occur with the vaccine, as outlined in the approved product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) for Gardasil&reg;  .  The majority of the reports received to date involved events\/reactions related to injection site reactions, malaise, headache, myalgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and skin reactions.  Vaccination related events such as dizziness and syncope (fainting) was also reported and would not be unexpected in this patient population.<\/p>  <p>The HPRA continues to ensure that the quality, safety and efficacy of all vaccinations licensed in Ireland including HPV meet the required standards.  The safety profile of Gardasil&reg;   has been continuously monitored since it was first introduced both nationally and at EU level and like all medicines and vaccines will continue to be so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700076#WRS00300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Data","counter":1100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700076#WRS00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1101,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[27462\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700076#WRS00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of primary care staff of certain specialties (details supplied) currently on the public payroll in whole-time equivalent terms; and the number, in whole-time-equivalent terms, who are active in primary care, that is, not on maternity leave or long-term sick leave, or other long-term leave, or diverted to other health care settings","asker":"1178","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1102,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on the matter.

Participants contribute according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  To manage the available funds through the year, the HSE operates a national placement list in order of when applications are approved. Funding is released in strict chronological order as it becomes available. <\/p>  <p>The Budget for the Scheme in 2015 is &euro;993m, an increase of &euro;54m from the 2014 position  . <\/p>  <p>  In order to be an &lsquo;approved nursing home&rsquo; for the purposes of the NHSS, all private and voluntary nursing homes must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  This is a necessary feature of the Scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's contribution. The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. If price negotiations break down a three stage review process, developed by the NTPF, can be invoked. Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website.<\/p>  <p>  The review of the Scheme is almost completed and is expected to be published shortly.  This review considered the Scheme&rsquo;s long term sustainability as well as looking at how well the current model of provision is balancing residential care with care in the community, and whether this needs to be adjusted to better reflect what older people want. <\/p>  <p>  Nurses who trained in a country outside of Ireland and wish to work in Ireland are required to apply to register as a nurse with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). In assessing an applicant for registration, to protect the public, the NMBI seeks evidence from applicants of comparable standards of education and practice. According to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) the timeframe for the completion of the assessment of qualifications for registration takes up to a maximum of 90 days provided all necessary documentation has been supplied by the applicant. The main difficulty to expediting timely applications as reported by the NMBI is that of delay\/failure by the applicant or third parties to furnish the necessary documentation required to assess eligibility for registration and the overall volume. It is important to note that the NMBI are dealing with very significant volumes of applications at present.  The NMBI are processing all applications as quickly as possible, while ensuring appropriate procedures and checks which are designed around protection of the public.  <\/p>  <p>  NMBI, following assessment of qualifications by an applicant, may require an applicant nurse or midwife to undertake a period of adaptation and assessment, which if required, must be successfully completed as a pre-requisite to registration. This clinical adaptation period may last between 6-12 weeks. <\/p>  <p>  Clinical adaptation is a process of adjustment and assessment to support candidates who have not worked in the Irish health system previously. NMBI require that adaptation takes place in an appropriate setting approved by the Board and within a certain timeframe. The minimum timeframe for completing the period of adaptation and assessment is six weeks. Any site that has approval for students or wishes to seek approval as a new site to be considered for adaptation and assessment purposes needs to submit a request, with supporting documentation, directly to NMBI and NMBI will review accordingly.   NMBI has to date received one such request from a nursing home facility &ndash; a decision on same has yet to be reached.  <\/p>  <p>  A collaborative group including the Department of Health, HSE, NMBI and Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) representatives have met to explore solutions to facilitate adaptation and registration delays. Proposals were agreed which will now be implemented and should result in an improvement in the difficulties currently being experienced. <\/p>  <p>With regard to workforce planning, Action 46 of Future Health   (DoH, 2012) provides for the Department to work with the HSE to implement an effective approach to workforce planning and development with the objectives of: recruiting and retaining the right mix of staff; training and upskilling the workforce; providing for professional and career development; and creating supportive and healthy workplaces. <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the Department of Health will develop a national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning, on a cross-sectoral basis. A cross-sectoral Working Group will be convened to develop the framework in the near future. The Group's deliberations will take into account issues including population aging. Consultation with key stakeholders will form part of the Group's work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700076#WRS02200","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":1128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700076#WRS02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1129,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[27514\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700076#WRS02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding eligibility for a medical card in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Waterford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1130,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

All persons who opt to be treated on a private basis on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care.  Those charges are a per diem rate set out in the 2013 legislation and were informed by overall cost of the provision of the private in-patient services and the policy of moving towards the recovery of full economic cost, but they are not directly related to the cost of specific treatments provided to individual private patients, the level of complexity of a case or the costs of individual hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of hospital financing has been the subject of recent Departmental reports. In the case of public acute hospital care, a prospective, casemix-adjusted activity based system was recommended.  It has been recommended that the existing &lsquo;per diem&rsquo; charging regime for private activity in public hospitals be replaced by a case-based charge using DRGs.  Taking account of international evidence and of the detailed analysis already undertaken in the context of the above reports it was advised that the Programme for Government commitment on &lsquo;Money Follows the Patient&rsquo; should be realised through the introduction of a prospective Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) case-based payment system.  Since January, 2014 the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) grouping system has been used to facilitate the introduction of a new prospective, case-based funding model for public hospital care called Activity Based Funding (ABF - also known as Money Follows the Patient).  <\/p>  <p>  Activity Based Funding is being rolled-out on a phased basis and full implementation will take a number of years.  The ABF approach is initially being applied to in-patient and day-case activity in public hospitals.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop policy proposals for the introduction of a case-based charging system for private patients in public hospitals.  However, it must be acknowledged that given the complexity and breadth of the issues to be examined and addressed, significant preparatory policy work must be undertaken.  This work must take full account of eligibility and legal issues, private income issues and the need for a sustainable mechanism for meeting the cost of private patients in public hospitals.  It would require substantial technical work and analysis on the financial impact on public hospitals. The focus for the short to medium term is on implementing ABF in the public system, as outlined in the recently launched HSE ABF Implementation Plan 2015 &ndash; 2017. Until this further work has been completed it will not be possible to present the Deputy with the figure requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700077#WRT02100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Constitutional Amendments","counter":1178,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700077#WRT02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1179,"qnumday":420,"qnumall":"[21328\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700077#WRT02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to hold a referendum on Article 40.3.3&deg; of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1180,"content":"<p>Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Irish Constitution states that:<\/p><p>'<i>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.<\/i>'<\/p><p>The Government does not intend to propose any amendments to Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700077#WRT02400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staff Remuneration","counter":1181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700077#WRT02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1182,"qnumday":421,"qnumall":"[26389\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700077#WRT02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of business cases he has been asked to approve in respect of sections 38 and 39 agencies for payment of salaries over and above approved pay scales; the number approved; the number still being assessed; if he has issued any updated policy directives on the subject; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1183,"content":"<p>My Department has submitted proposals to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the business cases submitted by the HSE to red-circle the remuneration of a number of senior managers in Section 38 agencies.

These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyberbullying, are addressed.<\/p><p>  A study on &quot;The Prevalence and Impact of Bullying Linked to Social Media on the Mental Health and Suicidal Behaviour among Young People&quot;, which was commissioned by my Department and the National Office for Suicide Prevention, was published in May 2014.  The review notes that as cyberbullying appears to be closely tied to traditional bullying, it is likely that already established anti-bullying interventions will also impact on cyberbullying and that entirely new programmes are not necessary.  Therefore, the implementation of the Plan will continue.  A key element of its implementation is the anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools which were published at the beginning of the 2013\/14 school year.<\/p><p>  These procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.  They place a strong focus on education and prevention strategies to deal with bullying behaviour including, in particular, cyberbullying and identity based bullying such as homophobic and transphobic bullying.  The procedures make clear that the focus of any prevention and education awareness measures in schools about cyber-bullying should be on educating pupils on how to stay safe while on-line and also on developing a culture of reporting any concerns about cyber-bullying.  The procedures also recognise that parents and pupils have a role and responsibility in helping the school to prevent and address school-based bullying behaviour and to deal with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere.<\/p><p>  A very important element of the new procedures to help ensure greater transparency for parents and pupils is the requirement for schools to publish their anti-bullying policy on the school's website and to provide it to the parents association.  The procedures also include important new oversight arrangements that involve the School Principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti- bullying policy and its implementation.  Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the parents association and published on the school website.<\/p><p>  In addition, my Department's Inspectorate, as part of its inspection work, is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.  For example, parent and student questionnaires issued as part of whole school evaluations, include, since January 2014, additional questions to get a clearer picture of how the school deals with bullying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700081#WRX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Aid","counter":1394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700081#WRX01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1395,"qnumday":505,"qnumall":"[27322\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700081#WRX01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the basis upon which ancillary grants to schools are calculated, including if there is a statutory regulation and guidance surrounding the grants, in terms of the amount of moneys to be paid to school administration staff; the hourly rate; if that payment relates to a weekly wage for 52 weeks of the year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":1396,"qnumday":506,"qnumall":"[27323\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700081#WRX01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if boards of management and school principals are required to utilise ancillary grants for the employment of administrative staff, or if they have free scope and leeway regarding same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1397,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 505 and 506 together.<\/p><p>  My Department provides capitation funding to all recognised primary schools for general running costs and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services.

Staffing levels therefore reflect the complexity of need that exist within schools rather than being determined solely by a school's designation, as many Special schools enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations.<\/p><p>  In determining the staffing allocation for schools, the NCSE takes into account up-to-date enrolment and pupil profile information.

Accordingly, the staffing allocation for the school referred to in the Deputy's question reflects the profile of pupils currently enrolled in the school, in accordance with each pupil's disability categorisation.<\/p><p>  The NCSE has published the staffing allocations for Special schools for 2015\/16, including the school referred to by the Deputy, on its website <i>www.ncse.ie.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700081#WRX02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Scoileanna Oile&aacute;in","counter":1404,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700081#WRX02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1405,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[27447\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700081#WRX02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"cad iad na socraithe at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aici lena chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil cl&aacute;r cuimsitheach &aacute;bhar ar f&aacute;il ag an 200 scol&aacute;ire at&aacute; ag freastal ar scoileanna dara leibh&eacute;al ar na hoile&aacute;in; cad iad na c&eacute;imeanna at&aacute; i gceist aici a ghlacadh le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; a fheabhs&uacute;; cad iad na hiarratais ina leith seo at&aacute; faighte &oacute;n GRETB agus &oacute; DETB; c&eacute;n cinneadh a rinneadh ar na hiarratais seo; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1406,"content":"<p>Chun cur ar chumas an &uacute;dar&aacute;is scoile freagairt ar dheacracht at&aacute; sainaitheanta le freastal ar na tiomantais churaclaim f&iacute;or-riachtanacha i leith na ndalta&iacute; laistigh den ghn&aacute;th-leithdh&aacute;ileadh foirne.Leagtar amach mionsonra&iacute; ar phr&oacute;iseas an lamh&aacute;ltais churaclaim in &eacute;ineacht leis na crit&eacute;ir leithdh&aacute;ilte post agus t&aacute; siad seo ar f&aacute;il chomh maith ar an su&iacute;omh idirl&iacute;n.<\/p><p>  T&aacute; s&aacute;s achomharc san &aacute;ireamh sa phr&oacute;iseas leithdh&aacute;ilte chomh maith faoina f&eacute;idir le scoileanna achomharc a dh&eacute;anamh in aghaidh an leithdh&aacute;ilte at&aacute; ag dul d&oacute;ibh faoi na sceidil foirnithe.

Rents for houses were 6.5% higher, while apartment rents were 7.8% higher than in the same quarter of 2014. <\/p>  <p>  These annual rates of increase were driven mainly by the Dublin market.  Overall, in the 12 months to the end of Q1 2015, rents were higher by 9.6% in Dublin (with house rents up by 9% and apartment rents higher by 10.8%).  Annual growth in rents for the market outside Dublin was more subdued.  In the 12 months to the end of Q1 2015, rents were higher by 5.3% (with house rents up by 5.7% and apartment rents higher by 5.2%).   <\/p>  <p>  A shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts.

Construction 2020 also commits to identifying and implementing further improvements to the planning system to facilitate appropriate development.   <\/p>  <p>  Addressing the supply shortfall in housing will take time but in the period since the publication of Construction 2020 some welcome signs of recovery in the sector have become evident.  Particularly notable in this regard is the increase in the number of house completions in 2014 to 11,016 units nationally &ndash; an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure.  The latest figures for new house completions show that 4,566 units were completed to the end of May 2015, up almost 16% on the corresponding figure for 2014.   <\/p>  <p>  Social housing is a key priority for the Government, evidenced by the additional &euro;2.2 billion in funding announced for social housing in Budget 2015 and the publication of the Social Housing Strategy 2020 in November 2014.  The total targeted provision under the Social Housing Strategy 2020 of 110,000 social housing units includes the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and 75,000 units through the private rented sector supported mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).<\/p>  <p>  There has been a number of relevant publications in recent times with suggestions and options in relation to rent certainty, notably the report produced for the PRTB by DKM Economic Consultants, Rent Stability in the Private Rented Sector and the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) report Ireland&rsquo;s Rental Sector: Pathways to Secure Occupancy and Affordable Supply.

These discussions form part of an ongoing process of engagement with relevant stakeholders to remove any obstacles that may arise in the implementation of the scheme.  To try to deal with some of the issues that have arisen and which can delay the process, a protocol between all stakeholders was agreed and came into operation in June 2014.  Under this process, the borrower is involved from the outset and is requested to give their consent to the sharing of their full information at the start of the process.  This ensures that there is no ambiguity for borrowers in the mortgage to rent process. <\/p><p>In addition, the package of commitments on mortgage arrears announced by Government recently includes a number of amendments to the AHB Mortgage to Rent Scheme, which will enable more properties to qualify for the scheme and make it more flexible and accessible to borrowers.  The principal amendment to the scheme is to increase the valuation thresholds applicable which should enable more properties to qualify.  These amendments apply across the country regardless of the location of the property  and took effect from 1 July. <\/p><p>Since the scheme began in June 2012 to end June 2015, 104 AHB mortgage to rent transactions have negotiations completed.

Agreement on the sale could not be agreed on a further 45 cases.  Some reasons for transactions not progressing include ineligible applications, including the borrower not meeting the criteria of the scheme, the borrower declining the scheme, the lender withdrawing the offer of the scheme, the local authority not having a need for the property or the over concentration of social housing in the area.  At the end of June 2015, 111 cases were with the lenders who are seeking the consent of borrowers to share information and for the carrying out of an independent valuation.

Innovative advances in technology also means that portable computers (netbooks and tablets) along with smartphones, have overtaken the use of home computers, and are widely available in a highly competitive market.<\/p><p>With all households now having access to basic broadband and a high proportion having an internet subscription, my Department is focussed on delivering high speed broadband access, through the National Broadband Plan, and driving digital adoption through the National Digital Strategy.  The strategy aims to position Ireland to take advantage of the opportunities of digital by getting more businesses trading online, more citizens online, and enhancing the use of ICT in the school environment.<\/p><p>According to the CSO, the main reasons stated for not having a household internet connection was<i>Not needed<\/i>(42%) and <i>Lack of skills <\/i>(39%).  My Department&rsquo;s Bene<i>f<\/i>IT programme is a key initiative under the National Digital Strategy to raise awareness and increase digital skills among citizens.  It works in partnership with community voluntary and not-for-profit organisations to provide digital skills training to citizens in more than 700 locations right across the country.  The combined efforts of my Department, its partners and other stakeholders are paying dividends with CSO statistics published in December 2014 showing the number of people who have never used the internet now reduced to 1 in 6. <\/p><p>I will arrange for my officials to forward the Deputy a copy of the National Digital Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700083#WRZ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"question","counter":1534,"qnumday":554,"qnumall":"[27175\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700083#WRZ01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when high-speed broadband will be provided to a townland (details supplied) in County Mayo under the national broadband plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas pipeline network. <\/p>  <p>  In 2006, the CER approved a Gas Connections Policy which enabled assessment of the feasibility of connecting new towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied. <\/p>  <p>  The policy provides that the construction and operating costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recovered through the consumption of gas and the associated network charges.  The distance of a town from the gas network is the major factor determining the costs of building a gas pipeline. The anticipated industrial or commercial gas usage in the town largely determines the revenue from gas network charges which must balance the connection costs.  Uneconomic gas pipeline projects would unfairly increase energy costs for all gas consumers. <\/p>  <p>  Under the 2006 network connections policy Gaslink has completed three comprehensive studies to assess nearly 80 towns for connections to the gas network with the result that more than twenty new towns have been connected in recent years.

In the meantime, funding under the present scheme has been extended to 31 December 2015 to ensure the continuity of existing services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700085#WRBB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1676,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700085#WRBB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1677,"qnumday":605,"qnumall":"[27381\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070700085#WRBB03600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she has considered an application for funding from a community group (details supplied) in County Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1678,"content":"<p>I wish to confirm to the Deputy that I have received the correspondence from the community group in question.
