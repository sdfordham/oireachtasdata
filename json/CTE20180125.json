Apologies have been received from Deputy Marc MacSharry.<\/p><p>Are the minutes of the meeting of 18 January agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising?  One issue arises regarding the periodic report we published this week, namely, our recommendation that the implications of the review to reopen Garda stations be considered in the context of the 2018 Estimates process.  I propose that we write to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality forwarding a copy of the report and drawing its attention to the recommendation for its consideration as part of the Estimates process for the Department of Justice and Equality.  I expect the Estimates will be discussed at the joint committee next month.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  While we do not generally submit our reports to other committees, the report included a specific recommendation relevant to the joint committee.  The report has also been circulated to all the relevant bodies and parent Departments.<\/p><p>There are three categories of correspondence.  The first is briefing documents and opening statements.  Nos. 1030 and 1039 are a briefing and opening statement, respectively, from Mr John O'Sullivan, chief executive and commissioner of the Valuation Office for today&rsquo;s meeting.   Is it agreed that we note and publish them?  Agreed.<\/p><p> The second category is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both and follow-up to committee meetings and other items for publishing.  No. 986, which was held over from last week, is from the Health Service Executive.  It provides a substantial amount of information related to the HSE-commissioned Deloitte report on the cost of care incurred by the service provider in the Grace case.

According to the correspondence, a request was made to tone down certain aspects of the report.  The purpose of commissioning an independent report is to ensure there is an equality of power between the persons who may blow the whistle and the relevant organisation.  This is demonstrated in some of the correspondence.  If we are to have confidence that independent reports into the HSE or any other organisation are genuinely independent, this will be an issue.  Some of the correspondence certainly reinforces that view in mind.  This is an issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#B00800","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I propose that, in addition to sending the correspondence, we send a transcript of this part of our meeting in order that the Deputy's views are conveyed directly to the commission.

It was a report commissioned and paid for by the Health Service Executive, which also set its terms of reference.  The HSE simply outsourced a project to Deloitte.  No one on this committee would suggest it was independent.

While I will not discuss in detail individual items of correspondence, one of them indicates there are two similar cases in litigation.  As we discussed last week, the HSE is moving towards an open disclosure approach.  I do not know if this issue falls into that category.  It is frustrating that money that could be spent on services is being spent on legal fees when matters are brought through a legal process.  I do not know whether value for money will be delivered in this case but the correspondence identifies two similar cases.  If that is correct, I would be concerned that someone who is a ward of court will be in exactly the same position as Grace until such time as court approval is secured for the services he or she may have.  This may well delay some of the services the individual in question needs.  Some of this may fall within the remit of the commission.  However, if there is litigation involved, it may also be a matter that the committee must examine from a value for money perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#B01000","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>As a result of last week's meeting, at which we discussed the State Claims Agency and the cost of legal fees, we are in the process of writing to the HSE to seek a progress report on the implications of its open disclosure procedure and how the procedure is working out.

If the transcript of our discussion on the Grace case is to be submitted to the commission, it must be noted that this matter came before the committee as a result of the persistence of the whistleblowers who have suffered.  They had to find a value for money angle to bring this case before this committee and its predecessor, which did great work under the former Chairman.  While the Health Service Executive repeatedly contacted Deloitte, the service provider is not allowed to do likewise.

The Chairman finished by stating that none of us in this committee would accept that the Deloitte report into the HEA was truly independent and other members have spoken about the process.  That process is used repeatedly, not only by the HEA but by other organisations.  At what point do we stop, reflect and look at what level of independence there is when these type of issues arise?  I am not persuaded, for all sorts of different reasons which we do not have the time to go into today, that many of the reports which have come before us were truly independent.<\/p> <p>  On this issue of the information we received, it would be useful for us to look into the education sphere, particularly the third level sphere, at the amount spent on auditing, consultancy fees, legal fees, reporting, independent reports or otherwise, and then conduct a mapping exercise in terms of which organisations and companies provide the service because we have seen audit companies conducting so-called independent reports into organisations from which they have already received funding to audit.  The function of such companies, as auditors, is to make sure that everything is okay.  If they were the auditors, how can they go in and be truly independent and try to find mistakes?  It is rife with all sorts of conflicts of interest.<\/p> <p>  Surely the HEA has a role in the significant amount of money that is spent on legal, consultancy and reporting.  There is a massive issue here in terms of governance.  I do not know how much the HEA costs the State but I would imagine it is a great deal and it has a large staff.<\/p> <p>  I want the committee to come back to this.  I would imagine that more of these roles could be fulfilled in-house.  Is it too quick to outsource much of this at a cost to the State?  That, in my view, is clearly under our remit because it relates to value for money.  It relates to whether or not we have good governance procedures within the third level sector and the HEA and whether the HEA is doing its job.<\/p> <p>  I propose that we look at that.  Some of this information is relevant and maybe I will write to the clerk to the committee and look for a more detailed breakdown.  There is the auditing, which is the internal audit, and the statutory auditing, which needs to be done by the HEA, and then by the constituent colleges.  The total expenditure by all the third level institutions, the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills on auditing, consultancy and legal is significant.<\/p> <p>  It would be a good piece of work for us.  There may be lessons to be learnt and recommendations to be made in terms of how we improve, save money, and get better governance and more independent reporting out of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#C00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>We are agreed on that.  We will certainly return to this topic, in particular, as part of our review of the education sector.  Deputy Cullinane will send in a note suggesting how we might go about it.  I understand Deputy Kelly has requested additional information on the same topic as well.  If both Deputies send in their views, we will discuss it again.  It is an issue that will certainly raise its head.  I was shocked at the scale of the fees that are being paid right across the board.  That information is now being published.  The next item is No. 1047 from Deputy Kelly in connection with the topic to which I referred.  That is noted.<\/p><p>Correspondence Nos. 1008 and 1024, held over from the previous meeting, is from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, providing minutes of the Committee of Public Accounts report on the examination of financial statements in the third level education sector and on the report on the examination of matters relating to financial procedures at the Garda Training College.  The essence of what happened here is that we issued two reports in July last, one on the third level education sector in which there were approximately 40 recommendations and the function of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to reply to this committee on its agreement or otherwise with the 40 recommendations in our report.  That is now back before us for consideration as to whether or not we accept what follow through needs to happen.  Similarly, there were approximately ten recommendations in our report on Templemore.  We have a separate item back from the same Minister on that issue.<\/p><p>I will start with the report on the financial statements.  There is a lot of information in it.  This issue is not yet closed.  Our first report and the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the timeliness of reporting and many issues.  We have essentially started the ball rolling and the matter is by no means concluded.  I suggest we conduct a brief run through these.  It is the job of the Committee of Public Accounts to see what the Department has said.<\/p><p>Document No. 1008 is in the name of Mr. Robert Watts, forwarded by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in response to our report on the third level education sector.  The first topic is a very serious one.  As Chairman, I am taken aback by the response of the Department.  It is wholly unacceptable.  It accepts most of the recommendations but we have to test what it will do about them.  It is an extensive document, all of which we will not read in public, but I want to highlight the following issue.  The first recommendation in our report was:<\/p><blockquote>The Committee recommends that the Higher Education Authority puts a system in place to monitor and quantify research and administration resources by both the Irish and EU taxpayer which are consumed by institutions in developing commercial Intellectual Property projects.  This is necessary in order to eliminate the current lack of financial information and facilitate an assessment with regard to value for money.<\/blockquote> <p>We started with Waterford.  The president of Waterford Institute of Technology came in here and stated that this was about the spin-off companies from intellectual property.  He stated its value and that it was great value for the taxpayer, and the amount the taxpayer received from disposing of its relatively significant shareholding when the spin-off company was set up down to the small percent that is left today.  He stated we got great value for money and he was able to tell us how much was achieved by the taxpayer.  I asked what was the cost to the taxpayer of setting up this company and the research and he did not know, so he was bluffing us at best.  I have to say that we took him up on it, asking how he could make a statement that the taxpayer got value for money when he had no concept of the cost that the taxpayer had invested in a State asset.  This is essentially about selling State assets and only knowing the price one achieved with no idea of the cost, that is, what the taxpayer invested.<\/p><p>It is the only recommendation of the 41 the Minister has not accepted.  I am shocked at this reply.  He states that it is a complex area.  I will read one or two paragraphs only.  The Committee of Public Accounts cannot possibly accept this reply.  That is all I am saying.  The Minister states: &quot;It is...difficult to quantify the exact amount of exchequer funding in research and administration that is allocated within the [higher education institutions] HEIs on commercialising Intellectual Property projects, given the multiplicity of funding streams and national and international collaborative research options available.&quot;  That is exactly what we said - we need to know this.  He then went on to say that the HEA provides funding, Science Foundation Ireland provides funding, Enterprise Ireland provides funding, the Horizon 2000 programme from the EU provides funding in some of these cases, Teagasc provides funding in some cases and the Health and Research Board provides funding in other cases.  Clearly, that is what we want.  We want to know the total funding that goes into these companies from the taxpayer.<\/p><p>In the Minister's final comment on our request that this information be assembled, he states:<\/p><blockquote>This complex research funding environment, added to the overlap between teaching and research activities within institutions, means that it is not feasible to ascertain the specific attribution of all the relevant activities and costs that contributed in some way to the commercialisation of a particular piece of research.  However, the steps outlined above will ensure there is greater awareness of the scale of activity and provide for greater monitoring of developments of the sector on a system wide basis.<\/blockquote> <p>The Minister is saying it is not feasible for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to have a system in place to establish the amount that goes into these companies before they are sold off.<\/p><p>I will throw this open for comment, but first I will make two points.  The Revenue Commissioners have been before the committee and a figure of &euro;600 million is given as the tax credit allowed against corporation tax.  All of the people who apply for that tax credit are able to account, to the penny and the euro and subject to audit, in order to claim this allowance.  If the taxpayer wants to claim research tax credits he or she has to prove it and have it verified.  If the taxpayer, however, is putting money into research and development it is too complex to even add it up.  This is utterly unacceptable.  This approach is one hundred years out of date.<\/p><p> My second point is that the committee will write to the Department to seek any information on any spin-off projects that are currently being considered for 2018.  The committee has no option but to ask that any further spin-off of State assets is held off until we know how much the taxpayer has invested in those companies before we sell them off.  I am not against the principle of it but we cannot sell State assets on the blind without knowing the value of what we are selling.  It is inconceivable that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform could send such a letter to the Committee of Public Accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#C00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>The committee knows that I have been raising this issue for some time.  I also brought the Waterford Institute of Technology issue to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts and we had a very robust exchange with the president of WIT.  I researched the matter when I was looking at the WIT situation and while there is a national policy to govern intellectual property it is actually quite loose.  It struck me that there was an attitude from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Department that the committee did not understand the world of intellectual property and how it works, that we should be hands-off, that it was all very complex - which it may be - and that somehow we were against commercialising intellectual property by simply asking questions about whether the taxpayer was getting value for money.  I was disappointed with that response initially but because we were diligent and we pursued and pressed the matter there are now two reports pending.  We should try to get those reports in to the committee as soon as possible.  This will underpin our approach because the reports have analysed the issue.  One is a global look by the HEA at how intellectual property is governed and managed.  While there is a national policy every institute of technology and university has its own policy and there are clear differences.  We saw this when some of the heads of institutes and universities came to the committee and they had different views on how it all works.  The policies for each institute are different and vary according to the institute; some are better at managing conflicts of interest, some are better at getting a higher stake for the State and so on.  This is obvious.  That is the global report.  There is also the report into WIT, which funnily enough the HEA legal department has been looking at since before Christmas.  I am not sure why there is a delay.  The report has been with the HEA for nearly two months.  We need this report published and we need it before the committee, as well as the global report.<\/p> <p>  I do not accept the Minister's response because I believe it is feasible to give us the spend, as accurately as they possibly can.  Obviously, it is a complex matter because there are many stakeholders: Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, the HEA and European funding.  There is an awful lot of funding and because there are a lot of funding streams, let us call a spade a spade, we know there are individuals within colleges, institutes of technology and universities - including very senior people who are paid by the taxpayer - who personally benefit from this.  I am not saying it is wrong, but because there is a lot of money attached to intellectual property for institutes and for individuals, along with a huge amount of State investment, I am suspicious and concerned about why we are getting the response we have got from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Department of Education and Skills and the HEA were also pushing us back a bit on the matter.  We need to look at it.  The source will be the two reports, which the committee needs to look at.  I am not letting the issue go.  I say this only because I am interested in getting value for money for taxpayers.  I have no difficulty with commercialising intellectual property.  It is of huge benefit to the State and it has been of huge benefit to the south-east with regards to the WIT research.  There are massive benefits but it has to be a level playing field, it has to be fair and the taxpayer has to be protected.  We have to be able to do our job to analyse whether there is value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#D00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Cullinane's comments about the response the committee received, especially from the Department in question.  The education sector requires significant investment.  This is a potential source of investment.  These universities and institutes of technology are a research and development tool but there is a cost to that research and development, in the same way there is a cost to companies when they do their own research and development.  By not counting that cost it means we have absolutely no way of knowing if we are getting value for money or not.<\/p> <p>  There is also the potential for reputational damage in the future to companies that are spin-out companies if this matter keeps coming back.  It is, therefore, right on a number of levels that we continue on to get to a process and a system where we can actually count what the investment is so we can measure whether it offers value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#D00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I support what has been said.  We have also raised this matter as it has come up repeatedly and as we have seen spin-off companies.  In our ignorance we have learned.  We tried to ask questions on the commercialisation of intellectual property.  Deputy Cullinane has said that he has nothing against that.  Personally, at this point I would like an absolute explanation for the ordinary person as to what we are talking about before I express an opinion on whether it is good, bad or indifferent.  What is the commercialisation of intellectual property?  What is there back from that process for the public institution that is funded with public funds?  What is the process and who is pushing it?  What is the return from that process?  We are still in an era where asking questions about institutions is frowned upon.<\/p> <p>  Lately the Kerry babies tribunal's findings have been in the spotlight.  This is relevant to this matter because it was never discussed in the D&aacute;il.  The report into that case was never discussed in the D&aacute;il in the 1980s.  We are now in the 21st century and have moved to a point where we actually discuss things but it is considered taboo to talk about this matter of intellectual property.  There is an attitude of \"we know best\" and \"they are anti commercialisation of intellectual property\", with no questions allowed.  Nothing has changed since the Kerry babies tribunal, just the subject.  The subject in this case is the commercialisation of intellectual property and spin-off companies, about which we should not ask questions.  We had the seven magnificent men in to the committee from the seven institutions all with varying opinions but with the same theme of \"we know best\".  There is absolutely no openness and accountability around what percentage the university was getting back and so on.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for sticking with this.  We might have slightly different opinions on it but the issue for the Committee of Public Accounts is value for money.  Based on what has come before the committee I cannot say that we are getting value for money.  I cannot stand over it without coming back and looking at the situation.  It is public property and public universities that are funded with public money.  The president of NUI Galway retired lately and his parting shot was twofold.  One was on gender and the second was that he thought third-level fees should be doubled.

Some of the other recommendations touch on non-compliance and the Department has responded and outlined what it proposes to do, including a financial penalty.  What the Deputy and Mr. McCarthy have been discussing will be discussed shortly.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation No. 35 related to Dundalk Institute of Technology's overseas contract, which has been put out to public tender.  Recommendation No. 42 has been accepted.  It concerns producing the accounts for annual audits more quickly.  Substantial progress has been made on that.  We are all singing from the same hymn sheet.  The next recommendation deals with what we were discussing.<\/p><p>Recommendation No. 43 was referred to a few times in the report from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER.  Our recommendation states:<\/p><blockquote>It is the view of the Committee that penalties in relation to funding should be implemented by the Higher Education Authority where institutions fail to present accounts within 6 months of the financial year end.<\/blockquote><p>The Department accepts this.  The minute goes on to state on page 6:<\/p><blockquote>The Minister is further informed by that Department that a proposal is being considered, as part of a review of the grant funding model [- this concerns the education sector team -] to impose a financial penalty for serious breaches of [corporate] governance compliance, including failure to provide timely and accurate submission of [accounts]; unsanctioned payments to staff; false financial, statistical or governance reporting; and wilful breaches of the relevant codes of governance.<\/blockquote><p>I think procurement will come into that.  The Department is stating it is now looking at having some financial penalty in place where there are breaches of governance by any of the funded organisations.  That rolls into the question Deputy Cullinane raised.  This has worked in the HSE, as we were told at a previous meeting when Tony O'Brien was before the committee.  The section 38 and section 39 organisations were told that unless and until they have their financial accounts in on time, there will be a withdrawal or withholding of funding.  This has brought a remarkable improvement in these organisations turning around their financial statements and in their accountability, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform now thinks the same can happen here.  The Department seems to be following the recommendation, so that is that point covered.  We will watch that because the Department is only in the process of following the recommendation.  Generally, the Department accepts all of what we are saying and it is moving to implement it.<br\/><br\/>I want to highlight another recommendation, unless members want to discuss any others.  I am moving on to recommendation No. 73 on the bottom of page 9 and the top of page 10.  It concerns approval of &quot;a value for money based business case in respect of proposals for significant outlays&quot; by third level institutions such as UCC.  We were speaking about the purchase of the Irish Management Institute.  I just want an information note on this.  The first paragraph proper of page 10 states - some people will find this interesting and some will find it boring:<\/p><blockquote>With respect to Universities more generally, historically they were classified as privately controlled non-profit institutions in the National Accounts.  In 2012 the CSO reclassified the universities as market producers meaning they were classified to the non-financial corporations sector rather than the non-profit sector.  Currently the universities are classified outside Government on the basis that they are (a) privately controlled and (b) market producers.  Therefore, the requirement to ensure accountability in respect of the use of public funds must be balanced with the autonomy of [the higher education institution] to make decisions on expenditure.<\/blockquote><p>We want a note from the CSO spelling out what that is all about because I think there is talk about universities going-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#E02600","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>On the State balance sheet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#F00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>-----back onto the State balance sheet because of the nature of their funding.

The CSO is now looking at this again as most of the institutions in Ireland - the universities and the third level institutions - are substantially funded by the State.

It is interesting that the paragraph from which I quoted comes at a time when, probably for the first time, we as a committee are putting a real, sharp spotlight on the third level sector.  There were many issues that came out of that which, I imagine, rattled some within the sector.  We could see that even when some of the Accounting Officers came before us.  They were uncomfortable with some of the questions that were raised.  Let us be clear that the spotlight we put on the third level sector led to a number of reports by the HEA and the Department that would not have been carried out otherwise.

Our recommendation states:<\/p><blockquote>The Committee recommends absolute clarity on a reporting framework to bring significant issues to the attention of relevant parties such as the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG), the Policing Authority and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The matter of what constitutes a &quot;significant issue&quot; [should] be communicated clearly.<\/blockquote><p>Obviously there was an issue in Templemore that was not communicated to the Comptroller and Auditor General as part of one of the audits and we felt it was significant.  There was another issue where some people may or may not have felt the Garda Commissioner should have informed the Minister about a particular matter regarding Templemore.  The last paragraph states that a communication protocol between the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also being developed as part of the revised governance framework, and the timeframe for completion was the end of 2017.  We wish to see that document.  They appear to be responding on the issue of when the Garda Commissioner is to raise a red flag with the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Minister, as the case may be, and they say the timeframe for completing that protocol was the end of last year.  We want to see a copy of it and when we get it people will be free to examine it.<br\/><br\/>In recommendation No. 41 on page 7, we talked about the independence of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na internal audit service and they accept that.  They say in the last paragraph on page 7 that the Minister was informed that in December 2016 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na contracted external consultants to conduct a review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na internal audit section against international professional practice frameworks to identify the opportunities to enhance the internal audit process and to provide recommendations to improve efficiencies and effectiveness.  This review was completed in March 2017.  I do not think that was brought to our attention during the course of our discussion on Templemore.  In any event we want a copy of that report.  That goes without saying.  That addresses one of our specific recommendations.<br\/><br\/>Much of the next page is about procurement training for the Garda.  We are told that is happening.  Regarding returns of information to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, they say only one has not been verified or returned because the particular person is on extended sick leave.  Everybody else at work has completed all the documentation and confirmed with SIPO.<br\/><br\/>Those are my observations on that.  I hope I have covered the ground for the committee.  There are only one or two points to be followed up in that regard.  That was the longest part of the correspondence.<br\/><br\/>Correspondence No. 1034 is from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, providing up-to-date information following our meeting on 14 December last regarding promissory notes and NAMA's loans value.  Mr. Moran also includes, on a confidential basis, a copy of the letter engaging KPMG as special liquidator and an update on the situation relating to related costs.  Can we note and agree to publish the material, except for the letter of engagement as requested by the Department?  Members are free to raise any matter in that at a later date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We are not publishing that letter, as requested.<br\/><br\/>Correspondence No. 1040 is from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, providing a follow up<b><\/b>to our meeting with the Department in December.  A number of items are included in the documentation.  We note that.  Members can read and study it and if there is information of interest to any member please use it in any way you see fit.<br\/><br\/>In category C correspondence, No. 1010C is carried over from last week.  This is from Senator Rose Conway-Walsh and it is a copy of a report compiled by Deputies Denise Mitchell and John Brady entitled &quot;Job Path Exposed&quot;.  It is a Sinn F&eacute;in policy document.  The Senator asks the committee to examine the matter considering the ongoing spending in the area.  However, given that our remit is to look back, it may be more appropriate for the sectoral committee.  There is a review of JobPath.  There are two companies involved.  We are seeking information on the commercial sensitivity issue but the policy of how that is working is a matter for the sectoral committee.  However, we are still following the commercial aspects of the topic we spoke about in respect of the two private providers for the JobPath programme.  Is that okay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#F01600","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#G00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>The sectoral committee should follow up on that.

The Valuation Office is responsible for the valuation of property to allow local authorities to levy commercial rates.  The office also provides <i>ad hoc<\/i>property valuation services to Departments and State agencies.  The 2016 appropriation account for Vote 16 - Valuation Office recorded gross expenditure of &euro;9.1 million.  This comprised expenditure of &euro;8.6 million on the provision of valuation services and approximately &euro;500,000 on the Valuation Tribunal, which provides an appeal mechanism in cases where a property owner or a local authority is not satisfied with a valuation decision.  Pay costs accounted for &euro;6.5 million or a little over 70% of voted expenditure.  In addition, &euro;342,000 was paid in fees and expenses to Valuation Tribunal members.  Other expenditure included &euro;639,000 spent on national revaluation projects and a little in excess of &euro;200,000 spent on legal fees and expenses.  A little under &euro;1.5 million was spent on non-pay administration costs.<br\/><br\/>Appropriations-in-aid amounted to a little more than &euro;1.1 million.  That consists mainly of &euro;700,000 in valuation revision fee income and almost &euro;300,000 on pension related deductions from staff salaries.  Net voted expenditure in the year was 16% less than provided for in the Estimate, resulting in the surrender of the surplus of &euro;1.5 million to the Exchequer at the year end.<br\/><br\/>Local authorities charge commercial rates by applying a locally determined rate to property valuations decided by the Valuation Office.  Property valuations should reflect current market conditions for a defined area and, therefore, result in a fair distribution of the rates burden throughout that area.  Periodic revaluations are required to ensure that the rates burden continues to be fairly distributed among the relevant businesses as market conditions evolve.<br\/><br\/>A cyclical programme of revaluations of all commercial properties was provided for in the Valuation Act 2001.  However, progress in carrying out the revaluation programme has been slow.  The first revaluation of properties under the 2001 Act commenced towards the end of 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area.  When my report was being completed in September 2017, revaluations had been completed for only 15 local authority areas, accounting for 43% of all commercial and industrial properties in the State.  The remaining 57% of commercial and industrial properties, in 16 local authority areas, were being charged rates based on valuations that reflected market conditions in 1988, almost 30 years previously.<\/p><p>The 2001 Act requires that, following the initial revaluation of property in a local authority area, further revaluations must be carried out at intervals of between five and ten years.  Arising from this, a second revaluation of the South Dublin County Council area was completed in September 2017, before initial revaluations in many other areas.  A second revaluation of Fingal County Council commenced in October 2017. <\/p><p> Up to 2015, the average time taken by the Valuation Office to complete the revaluation for a rating authority was almost 30 months.  Following enabling legislation in 2015, new approaches to revaluation have been piloted to try to accelerate the programme.  For example, the revaluations for Carlow and Kilkenny were carried out by private valuers on behalf of the Valuation Office and were completed in 12 months.  A pilot project using an approach of self-assessment by rate payers is under way in Laois and is expected to be completed in ten months.  The office has also shortened the time it takes to carry out revaluation projects using its own staff. <\/p><p> The core aim of the revaluation programme is to ensure that rates liabilities are distributed equitably based on current market conditions.  A revaluation does not increase the amount to be collected by the relevant local authority.  Instead, the required income is redistributed across ratepayers. <\/p><p> Overall, for the completed revaluations, the number of ratepayers who experienced reductions in rates payable has exceeded those who have experienced increases.  Nevertheless, the changes in rates payable for an individual property can be substantial.  In one case in Limerick, the annual rates bill increased from &euro;16,000 to &euro;490,000.  For another property, the rates payable reduced by &euro;558,000 to &euro;2.4 million. <\/p><p> Apart from the direct cost of the revaluations that were contracted out, the costs of carrying out the revaluations are not known.  The chapter recommends that the Valuation Office puts systems in place so that accurate costings of the various approaches are available.<\/p><p> As I mentioned previously, there is provision in the system for an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal of the valuation attributed to a property.  There have been delays in the processing of appeals by the tribunal.  The chapter recommends that the appeals process should be reviewed.  A number of initiatives are under way to speed up appeals processing, about which the Accounting Officer will be able to update the Committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#K02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>The committee will be aware that conducting a national revaluation programme - the first of its kind in over 160 years - has been a priority for Government since the enactment of the Valuation Act 2001.  I can report that the programme has gained considerable momentum since June 2015, following the introduction of new legislation, and advancing the programme is a central element of the Valuation Office&rsquo;s current strategic plan covering the period 2017 to 2019.<br\/><br\/>As indicated in the briefing material and the map forwarded to the committee last week, the current position is that the first revaluation of 15 local authorities is now complete and revaluation of an additional eight counties is currently under way.  The final phase of the programme, involving six counties covering eight local authority areas, is scheduled to commence in 2019 and conclude in 2021. <br\/><br\/>The members of the committee will be aware that the purpose of revaluation is to improve transparency in the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates burden more equitably between ratepayers.  The value of property changes over time but not at the same level across categories, business sectors or locations.  Hence, revaluation is a central feature of the rating system in similar jurisdictions as a revaluation programme is the only comprehensive way to address such movements.  Following revaluation, some ratepayers obtain a reduction in rates while, inevitably, others experience an increase.  However, based on the revaluations conducted to date, and as the Comptroller and Auditor General has outlined, the number of businesses receiving a reduction considerably exceeds the numbers experiencing an increase in their rates liability.  I have provided further details in this regard on page seven of the briefing material. <br\/><br\/>The outcome of a revaluation in a particular local authority area depends on the market conditions in play in that area on or around the revaluation date.  The particular mix of urban and rural properties and differences in the range of property types in the main business categories and sectors - retail, industrial, offices, hospitality, etc. - also has a major bearing. <br\/><br\/>Estimating the value of a property for rates purposes is an entirely evidence-based exercise.  The primary sources of such evidence are information relating to lease transactions provided by the Revenue Commissioners and the Property Services Regulatory Authority and, of course, information obtained directly from ratepayers.  For certain categories of property, trading information or construction costs may be used to assist in assessing the rental value of that property.  During a revaluation, the Valuation Office conducts its analysis in accordance with best international practice as set out in published practice guidance notes and in line with well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the Valuation Tribunal and the higher courts. <br\/><br\/>When a revaluation is being conducted, we are very keen to ensure that the work we do is well understood and extensive supports are provided to ratepayers and other stakeholders.  Thus, for example, detailed information packs are provided directly to ratepayers at key stages in the process.  We engage with local media to increase the understanding of the work we are doing.  We organise walk-in clinics for ratepayers at various locations within the local authority area.  We hold frequent briefings of trade bodies and representative groups before, during and immediately after a revaluation.  We organise briefings of elected members of local authorities at key stages in the process.We provide online access to an extensive set of guidance notes and other instructional material and we operate e-mail and telephone helplines throughout a revaluation.  We also operate a joint forum with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, which represents many of the professional advisers to ratepayers.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>As committee members will be aware, chapter 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the national revaluation programme sets out two recommendations.  It said that, &quot;The office should review its approach to the recording of costs associated with the revaluation programme to ensure that accurate costings of the different elements of and approaches to revaluation are available&rdquo;.  It also said that, &ldquo;A review of the appeals process with the Appeals Tribunal should be conducted in order to identify and address the causes of not dealing with appeals in a timely manner&rdquo;.  As Accounting Officer, I have accepted both recommendations and can confirm that substantial progress has been made in implementing measures required to address these recommendations.  I have provided specific details in relation to these measures in the briefing material, on pages three to five.<br\/><br\/>In respect of the 2016 appropriation accounts for Vote 16, I can confirm that the Valuation Office has received a clean audit report from the Comptroller and Auditor General with no significant issues arising. <br\/><br\/>The enactment of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 has represented a sea change in enabling the office to carry out the national revaluation programme.  The Act introduced several new provisions with the objective of accelerating the programme.  In particular, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to elements of self-assessment by ratepayers, known as occupier assisted valuation.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General indicated, piloting of this new process has recently commenced in Laois.  Another new provision is the enabling of revaluation by external contractors to augment our internal resources.  This approach has been used on a pilot basis to conduct the revaluation of Carlow and Kilkenny, which were completed in September 2017, an independent review of which will be undertaken shortly.  The Act also sets out the streamlining of the appeals process.  It provides for the wider application and use of statistical information, as has been the case in other countries for some time.  It also contains new provisions in relation to improving the operations of the Valuation Tribunal, the independent body which determines appeals made against valuations from the Valuation Office.<br\/><br\/>The new Act also addressed a number of operational issues highlighted during the implementation of the 2001 Act.  Supported by the changes brought about by the 2015 Act, acceleration of the national revaluation programme has involved a multi-faceted approach from the staff and management of the Valuation Office.  As our current strategic plan demonstrates, we have concentrated on using a wider range of data sources to inform and validate our valuations, continual improvements in how we organise and carry out our work and developing innovative approaches to valuation, underpinned by the new legislation and new technology.<br\/><br\/>As a matter of information, the members of the committee will be aware that the Government is bringing about the merger of the Valuation Office, the Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland.  The new organisation arising from the merger, known as Tailte &Eacute;ireann, will have responsibility for several functions, including the State property registration system, the State mapping and surveying infrastructure, the State property valuation service and the development and maintenance of State geospatial information.<\/p><p>This merger requires primary legislation to establish the new entity, and publication of the Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill, which is being drafted, will represent the next major milestone.  The committee is aware that the Government recently decided that the functions of the merging organisations should be transferred to operate under the aegis of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as and from 1 January 2018.<\/p><p> The Valuation Office is very cognisant that commercial rates are a significant outlay for businesses.  We exercise a range of legislative functions set out in the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 in an independent manner, and our overriding concern is to ensure that the valuations arrived at for rates purposes are correct, equitable and uniform.  This is backed up by the presence of an extensive appeal process and the application of a wide body of internationally developed professional practice, procedures and case law.<\/p><p> The national revaluation programme has gained considerable momentum since June 2015 and the Valuation Office intends to maintain this momentum to the conclusion of the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Sullivan.

The amount of &euro;1.5 billion is taken in commercial rates from the business operators and owners of this country each year.  We are not dealing with small money in respect of the impact and the significance of the work of the Valuation Office.  Very important debates are happening in the House in respect of health, education, housing, homelessness and abortion, and they are all dominating the national press.  I am sure the witnesses are acutely aware that outside of the bubble of this place and at grassroots level, when the witnesses rock into towns and villages throughout Ireland, a very big issue that dominates the local press and, more pertinently, local council meetings is the revaluation process.  The issue is the burden of commercial rates on businesses which make up the main spine of employment in this country and which, in many cases, have been crippled by increases in commercial rates.  This is not just by virtue of the revaluation process but by increases by councils which, because they are underfunded by central government, increase the tax on the businesses that employ people and keep them in a job and keep this country ticking over.  I have made this point previously to Mr. Lemass.  It might not be the sexy story that grabs the headlines in here, but trust me when I say a huge swathe of people are interested in the witnesses' appearance here this morning, and even more so by the figures surrounding the revaluation process they are here to discuss, no more so than in my county of Meath, where I know the Valuation Office is heading to next.<\/p> <p>  If we start with the figures, since the establishment of the Valuation Office there has been a spend of &euro;41 million.  In recent years, the average spend has been &euro;8 million to &euro;9 million per annum.  In his conclusions, the Comptroller and Auditor General made the point there has been painfully slow progress on the programme, and in the 15 years since the Valuation Act provided for a programme, only 43% of rateable properties have been revalued.  We see an exception in terms of the speed because the average time taken by the office to complete revaluation prior to 2015 was 13 months, and I know Mr. O'Sullivan spoke about the enabling legislation which allowed it to speed things up.  This has reduced since 2015.  Interestingly, Mr. O'Sullivan referred to the pilot project in Carlow and Kilkenny, which was completed in 12 months and involved more than 5,000 properties, at a cost of &euro;2.5 million for the contract and another &euro;250,000 in contract costs.  Again, this is not small money.<\/p> <p>  Why was the process so slow?  I know what the Valuation Office has noted in terms of how it has speeded things up, but how, over the course of more than a decade, was the process so slow given what was at stake?  There is now a requirement for all public bodies to be able to identify the costs associated with carrying out their work, and the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned this interesting point.  Obviously we can see the costs associated with the project in Carlow and Kilkenny, but we cannot find a comparable figure because the office does not have the costs.  There is a requirement for all public bodies to have systems, practices and procedures in place to maximise the value of public money being spent, but in the absence of these costings we cannot make this adjudication.  How can we compare value for money when we do not know how much it costs in the first place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#M00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.

There were a number of difficulties in operating the statutory steps in the legislation and there is no doubt about this.  The purpose of the 2015 Act was to pick up on these issues and streamline the processes.  A major change made was to streamline the appeals process.

One can see the example that he gave in respect of Limerick where an annual rates bill increased from &euro;16,000 to &euro;490,000.  Exactly this time last year, counties across the midlands were hit hard by the process.  I met groups in here this time last year who made representations.  I remember meeting business owners in Longford last year during my party's think-in in that town.  I recall meeting one man who explained how he was hit by a fourfold increase in rates.  He was publicly named and there is no problem with me doing so now.  It was publican Andy Byrne who was hit by a fourfold increase.  Where is the fairness in the system?  There is a big difference, as outlined, between Dawson Street in Dublin and Main Street in Longford town.<\/p> <p>  Given the Comptroller and Auditor General's conclusion, I have a question.  He outlined the process that the Valuation Office takes in the build up to the revaluation process and how it engages in x, y and z.  What help do businesses receive when faced with a massive spike in their rates bill?  Such hikes can put a guy out of business fairly sharpish.  Mr. Andy Byrne said that had he been aware of the potential increase in rates it would have influenced the negotiation of the five-year lease for his particular premises.  He also said that although the rate rise will not put him out of business it will limit his ability to hire staff.  Of course, if we are in the game of job creation, the imposition of that spike has massive ramifications that people should be cognisant of.  The Commissioner of the Valuation Office mentioned, when he concluded his statement, that his office is cognisant.  I have highlighted the reality for people.  How are businesses helped to face the massive hikes generated as result of the work of the Valuation Office?

Is there an onus on him to say to Mr. Lemass, the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that revaluation has a very significant impact on businesses as a result of the work of the Valuation Office?<\/p><p>The work will now speed up as the office is progressing quickly in that regard.  Will the question be asked as to whether there are alternative ways of doing business?  This might be looking at the turnover of a premises rather than the 19th century model of taking into account the valuation of a business, as has been mentioned.  Is that something that could be conveyed to the Department and the Minister?  Will the witnesses alert people in the Department and at ministerial level of the hardship felt by people whom they contact?  That is the difference between the witnesses and others as they meet the people.  Are they conveying that hardship in real terms rather than just statistics to the people that could possibly change the system?  The witnesses have said the limitations end at a certain point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#N02200","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>The Deputy makes a number of points.  The system we use for valuation is based on estimating the rental value of a property on or around the valuation date.  That rental value is based on hypothesis and the legislation in place.  The same system is in place throughout the common law world.  Other methods would be policy decisions for Ministers and I do not have any role in them.  The role of the Valuation Office is to give effect to the legislation as we find it.  In association with that, we try to address many of the matters on the ground through information and walk-in clinics.  There are different stages in the process but on at least three occasions during the life cycle of a revaluation, we operate walk-in clinics and workshops.  The ratepayers can come in off the street and we can explain the process to them.  Our role is very much associated with explaining the revaluation process, the information we need and what we do with it, as well as options open to people.  Our website is very well equipped with information in that regard.  We give every help we can and we understand exactly that it can be a difficult process for many people.  It is at that stage where our statutory duty ends.  We analyse the figures coming from particular sectors and the geography of different rating authority areas.

I know the witnesses will return in March and I look forward to that.  This matter is very important.  The Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, was before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government last November.  The witnesses may have been there as well.  One of the key tenets of its presentation that day was the matter of commercial rates and the over-dependence of local government on this as an income strand.  It indicated that over a period, especially over the past number of decades, local government has become massively overly dependent on those rates.  Commercial rates accounted for 37% of overall local authority income in 2016.  As I stated, that comes in at &euro;1.5 billion.<\/p> <p>  There was a period during the crash when councils were trying to freeze rates to give people a chance when they were going out of business.  Last year, for the first time, all the main cities - with the possible exception of Dublin - started to increase rates, and in some cases the increase was substantial.  Some increased the rate by approximately 5%.  As a result of the butchery of town councils, we now have an ongoing equalisation process.  Towns that traditionally had a lower rate than the county are now being forced to put up their rates to match the county rate.  Those people are getting hit twice.<\/p> <p>  Is there an acceptance by the Department that the revaluation process is having an exceptional impact on small and medium sized businesses, which still form the bedrock of employment in this country outside this city?  Is the matter of commercial rates going to be addressed separately outside this revaluation process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#O00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I will reply to the comments but I should first say that we fully support the ongoing revaluation process.  It is an important part of the funding make-up for local authorities.  It is difficult the first time it happens but it is very important this revaluation process happens and reoccurs on a regular basis thereafter.  I was before the joint Oireachtas committee before Christmas to make a presentation on new legislation for commercial rates.  The joint Oireachtas committee has decided not to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny but the proposals we are envisaging, which are currently being drafted into a Bill, would increase the power of a local authority to collect rates.  We are very mindful of the fact that 84% of those liable for rates pay them but 16% do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass"},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>That is an average and it varies between counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#O00500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Yes.  In some local authorities the figure is as low as 60% for those who pay rates, with 40% not doing so.  It is a very significant concern for us and we want a system that is equitable and fair.  Therefore, we want to empower local authorities and ensure they can collect rates from all liable ratepayers.  That will be part of the revised legislation being drafted now and we hope to have it before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the first half of this year.  It is on the list of priorities agreed with the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  We can also consider the impact of a revaluation.  As the legislation currently stands, rates are payable in two moieties, typically one in January and one in July, when the bills go out.  If a person has a rates bill, half of it must be paid upfront in January and half must be paid in July.  That would be the expectation.  The provisions in the new legislation will be that it would be spread out over the course of the year, making it much more manageable for businesses to spread the payments throughout the year.  I also suggest that most local authorities of which I have experience would have chief executives and finance departments that are very willing to engage with ratepayers who have difficulty.  In many cases, they would engage and agree schedules of payment to help or accommodate people who have experienced increases or who are having trading difficulties.  That happened a lot during the downturn.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of other points to be emphasised.  When a revaluation occurs, the Minister generally signs a rates limitation order.  The objective is not to increase the take in rates and it is about the distribution of the rates burden within the county.  In the revaluations that took effect for 2018, rates limitation orders were issued to those local authorities.  That means they are limited in any increase to the consumer price index and an increase for \"buoyancy\", which typically relates to new or extended properties.  The individual valuation of one property relative to another might change but the overall take is not expected to change as a result of a valuation.  The more frequent revaluation process will ensure that the spikes mentioned by the Deputy will be a thing of the past.<\/p> <p>  Before Christmas I also referred to section 66 of the 2001 Act.  I am aware that some businesses require support and rates are not the only lever available to a local authority to provide for small to medium enterprises.  Section 66 of the 2001 Act is available and being used by a number of local authorities to provide enterprise supports to small and medium businesses.  I highlight the fact that the Department has written to local authorities in its most recent circular, asking them to exercise rates restraint.  To be fair, although there were increases last year, in most cases there were no increases since 2008.  Last year and in some cases the previous year saw a slight increase but we have to go back to 2008 for increases before that in many cases.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the overall funding model for local government, the Deputy is aware that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has announced a review of the local property tax.  The Department will participate in the review to ensure it addresses, as much as possible, the matter of local government funding.  With a collection rate of 84%, we are keen to take it up to a level comparable with the Revenue Commissioners, which has a rate of 96% or 97%.  That would bring a significant increase to the amount of revenue coming to local authorities and help them in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that harmonisation is a challenge.<\/p><p>However, it has been set out in the legislation that this can take place over a period of ten years.  It is matter at local level to choose how slow or fast to undertake that process.  Some local authorities have completed it while others are taking a more steady-as-it-goes approach, taking it over multiple years.  However, that is a matter of individual local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I am well aware that the chief executive officers are able to accommodate businesses and Mr. Lemass referred to a schedule of payments over years.  Meath County Council did that a number of years ago as a pilot project before the Minister even considered it.  We did that and included a business incentive discount.  Mr. Lemass said the spikes will reduce but half the country still has to be covered.  If someone in Meath is hit with a fourfold increase as the recovery is starting to pick up, that could hit him or her for six.  It does not matter how often that person goes into Jackie Maguire or Fiona Lawless in Meath County Council.  If the spike is of such significance, it does not matter what schedule of payments is put in place.  This goes back again to my central theme of underfunding.<\/p> <p>  We can argue here all morning, but Mr. Lemass referred to rate restraint.  That happened because there was no option given the economy had tanked.  I was a member of the county council since 1999 and in the ten years prior to that, the pressure because of the massive development that was happening meant that when the local authority looked at its income, there was a hole in the budget every year and the people who picked up the tab every year were the ratepayers.  This relates to the central deficiency in the funding of local authorities.  There are two issues at play - the underfunding and the impact of the work of the Valuation Office - with nobody taking responsibility for the bill that ratepayers are subject to.<\/p> <p>  It is extremely worrying that in a reply to a question on underfunding, Mr. Lemass referred to the review of LPT by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I hope nobody thinks that is what will be used to plug holes and generate additional income.  Mr. Cody from the Revenue Commissioners has been before the committee.  Mr. Lemass referred to the exceptional uptake but there is not much more scope in this regard.

However, in a county where the population, business activity and number of businesses have been in decline for a long number of years, the reduced number of businesses will have to pay the same total that was always paid by the county even though there is less activity and a lower population.

There is clearly a big gap in the staff here.  I will make a comment and then listen to Mr. O'Sullivan's answer.  I read this with horror.  I look at the number of premises that have to be assessed and see that only four additional staff when ten were sought to be recruited.  The relevant chapter also states, \"A further campaign is planned in early 2017.\"  Will Mr. O'Sullivan give me an update on that?  The chapter further states \"There was provision in the estimate to pay &euro;0.2 million for a restructuring of staffing levels to restore a credible structure.\"  Will Mr. O'Sullivan deal with that?  It is further stated, in a way that does not make sense to me, that \"Due to protracted discussions with staff interests, no progress was made on this issue until late 2016.

I might be slightly wrong on that.  What a remarkable job to do setting out on a horse, and here we are using valuations from 1988.  It seems extraordinary, and that was an original valuation rather than a revaluation.  I never quite understood that.  I realise the area is more complex now in terms of types of businesses and so on, but we have the advantage of satellite mapping and IT systems that will multiply the value of an individual property.  I accept that the job cannot be done without the people but it is extraordinary that in the 21st century it is taking longer to do than somebody who set out in the 19th century with such rudimentary assets.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus on my constituency of Kildare and use some of the experience of that because it is a fairly recent revaluation.  I support what was set out in the previous legislation in that the revaluations are more regular.  It is right that that does not fall off track because it stops and that we will not have the shocks when there is a big gap in the valuation timeline.  From observation, however, I would have questions about some of the methodology.  How does that change?<\/p><p>In the case of a retail premises, the front is valued at something, the middle is given another value and the back is valued at something else again.  If it is a very big premises, the owner can get a greater value for that piece at the back that is given a lower valuation.  Are the officials considering things like undermining main streets by virtue of the fact that there is a bigger portion of that more expensive piece to the front?  It makes it difficult to absorb it.  It was very difficult not to draw that conclusion when examining how the revaluation happened.  There were big variations.  For example, the equine sector was very heavily hit in places like Kildare, which was not the case in the past.  Do the officials consider those in terms of the changes they will make when it comes to the revaluation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#R05700","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleague, Mr. Lavelle to go into some of the detail of the valuation methodologies we used.

We are examining the transactions and applying our analysis of that to all the other properties that do not have a specific rental transaction around the valuation date.

If Mr. O'Sullivan is telling me that the staff know that the task is urgent, why is nobody doing overtime?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#T02000","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Smyth to explain the detail of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018012500002#T02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I will deal with the question of overtime.

There are two terms, namely, representations and appeals.  Representations are what a ratepayer can make after he or she gets a first initial valuation &ndash; the proposed valuation &ndash; from us.  It is a very informal process and it can be done online.  People can take issue and give us extra information.  That is a form of appeal without it being a formal appeal.  During a revaluation we make a considerable amount of adjustments.  In the batch of counties we finished in September representations were made in 17% of all cases.  Of those, we made an adjustment in many cases and we also made an adjustment of similar properties that did not make a representation but appeared to us to be in the same boat &ndash; to be similarly circumstanced.  This is all about getting it right.  There is no impact on the local economy as there is no new list at that stage.  The rates are being collected on the old list.  It is a form of appeal but it is a form of perfecting the valuation list.  Representations must be made within 40 dates of the issue of notice.  We will consider point by point every representation that is made to us and make the changes that we deem necessary then in respect of the properties.  A classic example, if one were to take a street in Carlow, would be where we deem there to be two different valuation levels on the shops in that street and then during the representations we get in three new rents that suggest we are a little bit high.  In that case we would then take down all of the valuations on that street that appear to us to fall into the same boat.  That is an important part of perfecting the valuation list before we publish it.<\/p> <p>  The second appeal is the formal appeal.  That is made to the independent body, namely, the valuation tribunal.  It was set up in 1988 and continued under the 2001 Act.

There is, therefore, a statutory process associated with it.  This was only made possible under the 2015 Act.  A new Part was inserted, but effectively on 26 February a lot will be seen because by that stage we will have written to and contacted every ratepayer in County Laois.  In advance of that happening, we will have a considerable outreach programme with anybody who wishes to engage with us.  Throughout the process we will have walk-in clinics in the county; they will be held one day a week or as often as is required.  We have had many discussions and will have many more in the coming weeks with the representative bodies, one of which we met yesterday.  We have briefed the local authority staff.  We will do whatever it takes to get this right because this is the first time it has been done.  It is generating a great deal of interest internationally, including in the International Property Tax Institute and similar bodies, because if it works well, it could result in us being able to conduct ongoing valuation cycles more quickly.  We have developed a new website for it, but it is not live yet.  We have made a number of videos to instruct ratepayers on how to, for example, measure their retail unit.  We ask them to fill in a form online.  We give an indicative valuation and the floor area to most ratepayers to help them along the way and they can either choose to accept or go against it.  If the floor area is incorrect, they are shown how to remeasure it and correct us in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There is a small category.  Trading data obviously drive many of the valuations.  We are doing it a little differently, but they are relatively small numbers.  The message very much is that ratepayers will see the first roots towards the end of February.  We propose to issue first draft certificates on or around 12 July which is the other key date.  They will have a period in which to make representations to us and we would prefer if they made them online.  The cut-off date is 21 August.  They will have up to 50 days if they make the representations online.  We will issue the final certificates on or around 12 October.

We are very glad to be here.  It is not a coincidence that the committee sees two rapporteurs on two separate files, one with two Cs and one with three Cs, because Mr. Alain Lamassoure and I believe they belong together.  It is a statement in itself that the two of us have come here together.<\/p> <p>  I will quickly outline the context.  The European Parliament does not have competence in taxes but can advise on tax matters.  We decided not to do it only in Brussels but to come out and tour member states.  We are happy to be here.  We started in Estonia and then went to Luxembourg, Brussels, The Hague, Berlin and Paris.  We will move on to Vienna, Bucharest and Sofia.  Our aim is twofold.  First, it is to hear the concerns and put national parliaments in a better position.  At the end of the day, it will be decided in the capitals, not in Brussels.  We also want to hear the concerns and give better advice.  We also wanted to put it on the public and political agenda because it is a change that needs to come.  Why do we think that?  If one looks at the corporate tax systems, as we have done, they are from a time when we had factories with chimneys and smoke.  We knew where the location was and that has changed dramatically.  One could say globalisation is meaningless.  Part of the activity has become mobile and global.  That does not mean that we relocate a headquarters or factory all of a sudden but on paper, one can do a lot.  Any financial construction can be located anywhere in the world.  One can locate one's intellectual property anywhere in the world.  With a digital platform like Google or Facebook, it is unclear where one operates.  This has given the corporates huge advantage in the systems from the 20th century by choosing where to locate part of their activity.  That is the game that is going on.  They can choose their location.  What the CCTB does is change the rules of the game.  One takes profit and allocates profit, meaning it is no longer firms that decide where the profits are being made and where the taxes are being paid.  Now, it is the countries that say we consolidate the accrued profit and we allocate the profits; this changes the rules of the game dramatically.  That is the reason we are together.  We think the two files - one is on the tax base and one is on the consolidation - belong very much together.  There is no benefit from this change unless the consolidation is introduced, which changes the rules of the game.  <\/p> <p>  It is interesting.  What we see here is a somewhat broad coalition and sometimes an awkward coalition.<\/p><p>Mr. Lamassoure is a French republican.  I am a lefty social democrat.  We also work with a conservative CSU from Bavaria.  People from Bavaria are, by nature, very conservative I think.  However, we also work with a revolutionary from Belgium.  These are the people who work together.  This not only true within the Parliament but also outside it.  I can talk with activists, small and medium-sized enterprises and big corporates.  They all seem to think the rules of the game need to be changed.  I hope that the European Parliament will show that we have a broad coalition.  We will have the first vote in committee in February.  Later, it will go to plenary.  I hope we will see a broad coalition driven by this simple notion that the rules of the game need to be changed.  The consolidation part is essential and the second part, already highlighted, is that we need to tax the digital economy.<\/p><p> I know that in Ireland there will be a reference to base erosion and profit-shifting, BEPS.  I think BEPS has done wonderful work within the OECD agreement.  However, remember there are 15 action points.  The first action point was taxing the digital economy.  The first action point was no action.  We will study it for five more years.  Anyone who refers back to the OECD is just dragging their feet.  It cannot be claimed that firms should pay a fair share, I think we all agree that they should, and at the same time refer back to the OECD.  The OECD is stuck on taxing the digital economy.  It is pretty obvious the US wants to have the right to tax or not to tax the digital giants.  That is a huge conflict of interest between the EU on the one hand and the US on the other.<\/p><p> We think we need a European initiative to break this deadlock.  To do that properly, we can look at the turnover tax that has been put forward by, among others, Bruno Le Maire.  However, it needs to be done in a proper way.  Then look at profits.  We think that the CCCTB is a fundamental approach for also taxing the digital platforms in this world.  I am referring to Google and Facebook, for example, but also to Amazon, Airbnb, Uber, etc.<\/p><p> I will try to keep it short.  I know the discussion.  I am happy to have this discussion here but I can sort of feel what the discussion will be like because I am from the Netherlands.  I have similar discussions in my country.  If we do not compete we will lose jobs.  That is a very general and important argument.  I am from a social democratic family.  Jobs are important.  My point of view is what we have seen is, in effect, a lot of paperwork.  Just look at the statistics.  If we look at foreign direct investment, that is really strange.  Luxembourg and the Netherlands together have more inward foreign direct investment than the US.  Ireland has more inward foreign direct investment than Germany or France.  It just shows the investment has no relation at all with the real economy.  This is my point of illustration.  I know that Ireland is like the Netherlands, a gateway to Europe.  Ireland has an important role in the European economy and has been very successful in that.  However, part of that is not necessary.  That is the paperwork and rerouting through financial constructions and location of intellectual property.  This is the claim.  I understand the concerns and I encounter them in my own country.  However, I do not think they are necessary.  Ireland has a great economy and will still be able to compete in many ways.  For example, the rates will always be lower in Ireland than in France and in Germany, there is no doubt about it.<\/p><p> Ireland needs to take away these constructions.  On our tour, we picked up on the countries that play this game.  In my country and also here I see them as pirates.  It is the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Malta and Ireland, unfortunately.  We play the game of going into another country and stealing tax bases.  This should come to an end in the sense that now the paper constructions should be ended.  That is why Ireland could embrace the CCCTB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Tang","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I apologise for the poor quality of my English.

As Mr. Tang has said, on this issue the European Parliament has no legal power.  Our power is limited to giving an opinion and this opinion is not binding for the Council.  The Council can only take a decision on the basis of unanimity and probably with ratification by national parliaments.  That means the Oireachtas will have the final say.  We work in close relationship with national parliaments to try to facilitate an exchange of views among members.  We held an interparliamentary conference.  Some members here took part and it was on that occasion that we were invited and decided to come to see the committee.  Our role is to facilitate negotiations, discussions and exchanges of views between national parliaments and between governments - to be facilitators, as it were.<\/p> <p>  We also express the concerns of the European citizens we are accountable to, as the members here are accountable to their constituents and tax payers.  We, as Mr. Tang mentioned, are in no position to teach lessons to anybody.  My country, France, has always been a good friend of Ireland.  We stand by Ireland on all issues, particularly those linked to Brexit.  However, France is a bad pupil on some major European issues, particularly all the criteria of good governance in the economic and monetary union.  It is not a matter of national concern.  It is a matter of European discussion.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, on the Continent, what triggered all these concerns on and calls for reforms of corporate tax issues were scandals when all our citizens discovered some member states among the European family had managed to rob tax bases and tax wealth from their partners.  That is not acceptable.  Corporate tax was considered highly technical and boring.  Now, all European citizens understand that in our Union some multinationals can manage to pay no taxes at all while the ordinary citizen of the SME pays normal tax.  It is unacceptable.  We must put an end to that.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that there are political differences of course between the left wing and the right wing.  It is the case in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, and it is the case in the European Parliament.  The European People's Party, EPP - of which Fine Gael is a member in the European Parliament - accepts the principle of tax competition.  That is clear.  We do not object to the choice by the Irish Government of a tax rate of 12.5% - a rate that seems to be part of the Irish identity and even the Irish Constitution.  A former President of the French Republic realised that when he challenged this rate.<\/p> <p>  That is not the problem.  Our concern is to ensure that all the rules and principles we all apply unanimously in all fields of economic issues throughout the Union apply to tax competition as well.<\/p><p>It has not been the case so far because on tax our competition is obscure, disloyal and unfair.  We must ensure from now on that it is transparent, loyal and fair.<\/p><p> To achieve that goal, it is necessary to have the same definition of the taxable profit.  We do not hear a credible objection against the principle of the same definition of the taxable profit.  We can disagree on the content of the definition, of course, and it is a matter for the negotiation on the CCCTB.  Should we deduct or super-deduct research spending?  Should we ensure that there is neutrality between financing investments by borrowing or by equity and so forth?  The content of the definition is a matter for debate.  In the context of the principle, however, I cannot understand any objection so far.  We can compare it with the US.  The US has corporate tax at state and federal level.  It is far simpler for the US to have a single federal corporate tax at federal level.  It would be simpler and more effective for the competitiveness of our companies and multinationals based in the member states if we have the same tax paid through the same system.  This is, of course, along with enabling the member states, on the same basis, to apply their own rate to this, as has been the case with VAT for 40 years since the 1970s when Ireland joined the then Common Market.<\/p><p> The third point, as Paul Tang said, is that the same definition of tax base and the consolidation are closely related.  All the multinationals we consult, be they American, European or French multinationals in my country, are quite definite on that.  Either the reform comprises both elements - same definition and consolidation, CC and CCC - or it would bring about more complexity and would be less interesting for them.<\/p><p> On the digital platform, now is the time to find a way to tax these new business models which did not exist when we devised our national corporate tax.  This is the digital economy and, particularly, the digital platform.  I can give an example.  Facebook has 30 million users in France, including me.  Facebook pays no tax in France.  How can we justify that?  It is impossible.  Now is the time to find a common definition of what is a digital permanent establishment and to find a common system to distribute the tax revenues of these digital platforms among the member states, for the multinationals that have operations and activities in several member states.  Of course, when we think of digital platforms today, it is the GAFAs - Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon - and American multinationals, but when we establish a new tax system, we must not forget that it is not for the next few years but for the coming decades.  We all hope that in ten, 20 or 30 years there will be some European digital multinationals, including French, Dutch and Irish multinationals.  If we engage in taxing the multinational, it is not to punish the GAFAs, which would be ridiculous and counterproductive, but to settle a real issue.  We were impressed in Tallinn, which we visited during the Estonian Presidency, to note that Estonia, which is the leader in the digital economy, is particularly keen to find a way not to kill the golden goose but to take fiscal tax revenues from the golden eggs.<\/p><p> The final point is that it is obvious and clearly laid down in the European treaties that tax matters pertain to national sovereignty.  However, the EU, with the special procedure of unanimity of member states and national ratification, can step in or intervene whenever tax provisions could impair the fairness of competition in the great Single Market.  We must also comply with the subsidiarity principle.  The subsidiarity principle does not mean that all issues must be dealt with at the lowest level possible.  It means that every issue must be tackled at the relevant level, the level where we are more efficient, and, depending on the issues, it might be a very low municipal or regional level, national level or the EU level.  When it comes to taxing multinationals, negotiating with multinationals and negotiating with international partners such as the United States, the relevant level is the EU.<\/p><p> There are member states smaller than Ireland whose GNI is far lower than the turnover or even benefit of some multinationals.  How can they negotiate on the same level with these multinationals?  With regard to Google, Facebook and so forth, if some members tried to engage in taxing their profits or sales at national level, it would be ridiculous to have 27 different Google taxes in member states.  We know that after agreeing among ourselves, hopefully, a common European system we will have to negotiate with our other international partners, starting with the US.  None of our member states, be it Germany, France or another country, is able to negotiate on an equal level with the US Congress.  If we want to ensure that the recent important overhaul of the US corporate tax achieved in the US Congress is compatible and amended to take on board our concerns and to find common rules, politically it will probably be in the framework of the OECD but if there is no direct contact and negotiation between the EU and the US Congress nothing will happen on these issues in the OECD.<\/p><p>We risk endangering our work competitiveness and our future in the EU.  We understand the role that tax attractiveness played in Ireland's economic model.  The French admire the way the Irish have managed to have today an average income higher than the French average income given that when Ireland joined the EU at the beginning of my administrative career, Ireland was one of the poorer countries of the then Common Market.  I say congratulations on that.  We do not want to jeopardise the situation but we want to apply the principle of loyal co-operation within the European family, and among the member states.  It is in that frame of mind that we appear before the joint committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012500002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alain Lamassoure","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lamassoure.

I take major issue with it and I do not agree with it.  The definition of a tax pirate is someone who is roaming effectively on the open seas.  Our multinational sector is contributing more than 250,000 jobs in Ireland and many of them are people we represent.  They are giving valuable jobs to families and contributing approximately 50% of our POE base and approximately 50% of our corporation tax base.  Changes have been made.  The double Irish is gone.  We are looking at BEPS.  My concern is that if the CCCTB came in, it would be a case of tax piracy by the larger countries such as France and Germany.  Reference has been made to looking after small nations.  One of the reasons we have such a large multinational sector here, which is providing such a large number of jobs, is that we have had a 10% manufacturing rate for years.  This is not something new that we have dreamt up.  Our industrial base is based on the country being English speaking.  On our western border, we are the nearest point to America and we have a long-term association with that country.  Our 12.5% rate, as well as our previous 10% rate, is utterly transparent.  Our effective rate is more or less the same.  Mr. Lamassoure will appreciate that in France while the rate might be higher, individual arrangements are arrived at with individual companies and that does not happen in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012500002#K00700","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":731,"content":"<p>What about Apple?

The point I make is that to state that Ireland is a tax pirate is grossly inaccurate.  Mr. Tang was showboating a bit on the radio this morning.  It is not an accurate picture of what we provide here in terms of jobs.<\/p> <p>  I wish to deal with a couple of points to which the witnesses might respond.  If the CCCTB were to be introduced, which individual countries would benefit?  I will deal specifically with Ireland because that is the country I represent.  Will it narrow the tax base in Ireland as a country?  Will it undermine our economic policy?  Will it affect the large amount of jobs based on the multinational sector that have been built up over the past 30 to 40 years, if not longer?<\/p> <p>  Has an impact statement been carried out on the effect of CCCTB?  The preliminary assessment by the European Commission has said it would be 0.4% of GDP.  We are a small export nation.  To put it in context, multinational companies in Ireland employ about 250,000 people.  That is outside of the indirect jobs in indigenous companies.  Associated turnover is approximately &euro;78 billion.  Irish companies operating on a multinational basis have approximately the same number of jobs in companies around the world.  The sectors are more or less comparable.  We are a country that has both foreign direct investment in and we have a large amount of foreign direct investment out.  We have some of the largest multinational companies such as CRH that operate globally.  We are a small open economy.  That is the basis of our economy.  We are not like France and Germany that have large population bases whereby companies can operate within the local economy.  Our population requires us to be an export nation.  We also have to attract companies here that will export goods.  The companies that come here operate in the European market.  One of the aspects of Europe is that it has a Single Market and free trade within its borders.  As a country we attract companies here to avail of that.  The OECD BEPS project which has been looking at how transfer pricing would operate would afford a more equitable measure to deal with the issues raised in terms of taxes.  I do not disagree with the witnesses that there are issues to be dealt with but it was grossly unfair of Mr. Tang to make a sweeping statement to the effect that we are tax pirates.  I invite him to deal with that accusation.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses accept that our 12.5% rate is a transparent one?  It is a rate that is easy to understand.  We have a system that operates in a very effective manner in terms of companies coming in and knowing exactly what is involved.  We are unique in that we are an island nation.  The UK is currently dealing with Brexit.  We are a small island nation on the periphery of Europe.  We are boxing above our weight.  I make no apology for that.  We are bringing in companies from abroad that employ many thousands of people and they contribute in a major way.<\/p><p>The witness referred to corporation tax.  They contribute in terms of jobs, which provides PAYE and PRSI, paid for by the employees themselves. Employers PRSI is paid on top of that.  They make a major contribution.  I welcome the witnesses, and I hope they get a chance to see Ireland.  Perhaps he has seen it before.  I presume they have been here before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012500002#K00900","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":734,"content":"<p>No, this is my first time here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Tang"},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":735,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. Tang should have taken a trip around Ireland before making his reference to tax piracy this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012500002#L00300","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516870800,"counter":736,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I am going to visit the house of Bono, the lead singer of U2.

I understand his position.  I come from a relatively small country.  The Netherlands sees itself as a small economy.  Of course, we have a big tax avoidance industry, which we seem to forget, but we consider ourselves a small economy which is dependent on trade and investment.  In that sense, there is a strong similarity with Ireland which I immediately recognise.  Jobs and investments are important; that is crucial.  In my introduction, I alluded to the fact that the thinking is changing slowly.  We are Protestants and are very stubborn in that sense.  It is changing, and we would like to think that it is all about jobs and investment.  The question that must be asked is whether it is really about jobs and investment.  When I try to make the distinction between paper constructions and real investment, it is a way of addressing fair taxation and economic growth and welfare.  In my country there has been fierce debate as to how much this contributes at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I cited the numbers for inward foreign direct investment because it is obvious that the link with the real economy is lost.  To take a simple example, Ireland's corporate tax rate is 12.5% and the effective rate is close to it, but Bulgaria has reduced the rate to 10%.  Do I expect an influx of foreign direct investment into Bulgaria?  Does anyone?  I doubt it.  I make that case about my country too.  We have many assets.  That is true for the Netherlands and for Ireland.  Ireland is part of the transatlantic bridge, a gateway to Europe.  This gives Ireland a unique position in the European economy.  It makes it strong and thriving, and is the reason it has had success.  Taxes may have been a part of that, but in my opinion, as an economist, it is not the most important location factor.  It never is.  It may have contributed, but I do not think the letter box and all of the legal juggling has really contributed to it.  That is why I try to make a distinction between paper constructions and real investment.  On paper constructions, I am very clear; it is piracy.  If one looks at work by Gabriel Zucman, who is a French economist based, I believe, in Harvard, and has done a large amount of work,-including his PhD, on this topic, it shows who the winners and loser are in this game.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012500002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Tang"},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":742,"content":"<p>Is it the case that Mr. Tang is qualifying his position on the comments he made this morning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012500002#L01000","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":743,"content":"<p>I say the same in my country as I say here.

That does not have to do with the 12.5% tax rate.  That is not my main concern.  My main concern is always that there is a possibility of constructions, and that the current corporate tax system is outdated.  There are always opportunities to manipulate the location.  The transfer pricing system is outdated.  What is the transfer price or market price for intellectual property?  What is the trademark of Coca-Cola worth?  I do not know because there is no market, but that is the basis of transfer pricing.  Ireland is working with a system that is outdated and refuses to have it repaired.

That is one of the reasons when I think about the European Union, it is the future.  This is the way we can still manage the global order.  This is the first step; we have to set a European standard first to make it to a global standard later.<\/p><p> There is a flaw in the assessment by the European Commission.  That is not due to the European Commission alone.  We know pretty much the consequences of the proposal for Europe and the European Union as a whole but we do not know what they will be specifically for each member state.  It is a flaw.  In all fairness, the Commission is aware of that and cannot really correct it without co-operation from the member states.  It needs the national tax administrations to see what are the consequences for firms and tax revenues.  For every treasury in each country, this is a crucial issue.  They need to know how much it will cost or bring in and it is not there yet.

It would help very much if the Irish Parliament did not just point to the European Commission but rather to the Irish tax administration if it needs to know the consequences.

I share a lot of the witnesses' views on multinationals, taxation and the unfairness and injustice at work.  All of this tax avoidance must be addressed.

However, I also agree with the witnesses' observations on the tardiness of the approach of BEPS, the need to examine it and find ways to escalate it.  I agree with the witnesses' comments on avoidance.  Many multinationals have sailed off into the sunset and left a trail of destruction behind them.  I come from rural Ireland, and if the witnesses were to travel around Ireland they would see for themselves the lack of really basic infrastructure like broadband, telecommunications, roads and so on.  Tax justice is hugely important, and it is certainly hugely important to Sinn F&eacute;in.  However, there are points we really need to examine in respect of the proposals the witnesses have brought before the committee.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  The witnesses seek to use Article 48.7 of the Lisbon treaty because there seems to be unanimity at Council level about these proposals.  Can they clarify whether the proposal is to use the mechanism after the CCCTB is enforced to make the changes or to use it to get the CCCTB passed in the first instance?

First, it is very important for us to apply the common corporate tax base, CCTB, and the CCCTB on the same day.  We recommend that time is taken if, as is likely, it is needed to finalise the whole system.  However, when we hear from multinationals, be they European or American, on this issue, they are definite that both elements of consolidation should apply.  It represents progress for them, improving simplicity, fairness, etc.  They are all for it.  If the alternative is to only have CCTB as a first stage, then there will be a very complicated interim period with interim regulations and then several years of consolidation.  This would cause more complexity, an outcome in which they are not interested.<\/p> <p>  Second, of course we hope to reach unanimity in spite of reservations expressed by some member states, including Ireland at this point.  Negotiation is ongoing.  If unanimity is not forthcoming, it is very likely that the procedure of enhanced co-operation will be launched.  This is because there is a clear determination in many member states, starting with France and Germany, to find a solution.  For instance, our German friends can no longer put up with a situation where part of their tax wealth is robbed by Luxembourg. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012500002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alain Lamassoure"},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I understand what Mr. Lamassoure is saying.

It is a matter I have raised over many years.  For instance, many years ago, I and another member of this committee had argued in favour of bringing Apple before the committee.  The Government, and some Opposition parties, refused to do so.  We are very critical of how Ireland has facilitated tax avoidance at a global scale and how issues such as Apple have been facilitated by the Irish tax code.  However, to dismiss the idea of tax sovereignty as though it does not actually mean anything, and merely ask states \"how sovereign are you?\", is nearly an argument for allowing Europe to decide not only the common base and consolidation but also the rate.  One cannot cherry-pick tax sovereignty.  What we are looking at here is a tax grab.  This is a grab.  I agree that there have been major scandals and that is why I am very critical of the Government because it has facilitated people across Europe, MEPs with their own views to which they are entitled, to use this opportunity created by Ireland facilitating mass tax avoidance - for which it has suffered huge reputational damage on a global scale - to try to put pressure on states to give up their tax sovereignty.  That is what is happening here.  It has been on the agenda for many years.  If I was in Mr. Tang's position, I would feel the time was opportune because Ireland is weak.  We still have a veto but our credibility is weak on this issue because of how we have dealt with Apple, the double Irish, stateless companies, section 110 companies and how - as seen in the last Finance Bill - we continue to allow Apple and other multinational companies to avail of allowances that result in an annual &euro;850 million in forgone tax because we decided not to tax them appropriately.<\/p> <p>  I agree with that but this is a tax grab.

I do not see why I cannot be openminded and say that where we did not share sovereignty on some matters in the past, maybe we ought to now on certain issues, of which corporate tax is one.  I am much in favour not only of harmonising the tax base and introducing an apportionment but also of a minimum effective tax rate.  I do not think it is the type of competition that we would want and we cannot do it.

However, he will be familiar with the fact that before it arose more than ten years ago, it was a principle of many of the leaders of the European Union that they wanted to take tax sovereignty to the core.  This is them now taking the opportunity to do that.  I disagree with their approach.  Taxation matters are best dealt with at national level.  There needs to be co-operation in terms of how we tax people and ensuring that they cannot exploit the differences between individual states.  In terms of the functions of being able to determine how many rates we have, what the rates are and how we apply them, however, it should be done at national level.  It is difficult for me to say this because successive Governments have facilitated that which I have outlined.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Tang used the term \"tax pirates\".  In the past, I have stated that they have pimped out our country to the multinationals and allowed them to use our tax code to avoid paying their due taxes, not only here but also across the rest of the world.

Every time Deputy Pearse Doherty states that he wants the tax competence to rest with the nation state, the companies - such as Google and Facebook - cheer.  They are the ones which benefit in the end.  We are talking about the differences within Europe, but the real winners from this are the large corporates.  We see - this is part of a global trend - the share of labour falling worldwide and the share of capital growing.  We see the number of people who have been lucky to turn wealthy grow.  This is part of a trend that means globalisation versus the nation state.  Every time one states it has to be the nation state, one is making one's politics powerless and to the benefit of capital and the capitalist.  I am from the party that wants to save capitalism from the capitalists.<\/p> <p>  On this issue, I would very much like to have a global framework.  No doubt this should be our aim.  That is why the EU and the OECD are working together and trying not to contradict each other.  There is a careful dance on digital taxation for that matter.  Europe knows that it should take action on its own but it does not want to destroy or even disturb the OECD process.  My opinion is that if we take a European lead, we have a better chance of arriving at a global framework.  Sometimes one needs leading examples.  Europe is an economic superpower.

I do not mind sovereignty - I apologise for being a bit provocative.  I do not know what sovereignty means in a world at peace.  One should beware of discussing at length the principle of sovereignty without taking into account what happened in the United Kingdom.  On the principle of sovereignty, the British decided to leave the European Union.  Now they realise that, in leaving the Union, they are leaving their real sovereignty.  Theoretically, they will regain the power to decide, for instance, on financial regulations, in Westminster and no longer in the EU.  If, however, they use this regained sovereignty to adopt financial regulations in Westminster applying only in the United Kingdom, the huge influence of the city of London in all the euro area will shrink to the size of the United Kingdom, and possibly only to England and no longer to the other nations of the United Kingdom.  I am sovereign in France on tax issues but, being sovereign, I cannot prevent my neighbour's country from stealing tax away from France for his country.  Sovereignty does not mean anything anymore among ourselves.  Personally, I leave sovereignty and the debate on sovereignty to the sovereignists.  I am not interested at all.<\/p> <p>  I do not need a transfer of sovereignty to make the European Union function.  What I need is a clear separation and distribution of competences between the member states and the Union.  We have full competence on some issues for the Union.  Most competences are full competences of the member states.  It is the case for 90% of tax competences.  There are shared competences.

We must break with the whole model and philosophy of tax competition, which is a disaster.  Ultimately, the only winners in the long run are the large corporations.  Precisely as Mr. Tang said, the illusion is of choice but the choice is only ever downwards.<\/p> <p>  I will start with a question to Mr. Tang on the global picture in the context of something he described very accurately, particularly if one looks at the graphs over a period of decades regarding the share of wealth going to labour and the share going to capital.  One can overlay on top of that graph a picture of global effective corporate tax rates which shows the decline - a key factor in that shift of wealth.  How can that be reversed?  I agree, in principle, with the CCTB, albeit there are some issues with the formula which we can address.  However, no one will claim that it will be a very substantial contribution to reversing the trend.

As a politician, one sometimes starts but does not know where one will end up.  One hopes one's successors will take on what one has started.  My fight started in the national parliament in 2007 when I was a member.  Over the years, I have learned that transparency is crucial.  What one has seen with LuxLeaks, the Paradise Papers and the Panama Papers is that they cannot see the light of day.  If one's voters see this, they get outraged.  The driving force has not been economic concerns such as a level playing field, it is the sense of unfairness people feel as in the case of Apple.  I do not suppose it sits well with the Irish people.  Transparency can be very important.  It is necessary in the context of the big corporates as to where they make profits and where they pay tax - both of which are crucial - but it is also about the wealthy who can hide their wealth in all sorts of tax havens.  That is why the blacklist of tax havens is important.  It can be an effective instrument to lead to transparency.  There is then the proposal which Alain and I are discussing here today in respect of the need for fair rules of the game.  I refer to the corporate tax system, wealth taxes and so on.  These are the things one needs.<\/p> <p>  To bring us to the global level, we need to start at European level.  I cannot see any other way.  Europe has the ability to set standards, not only for itself but also globally.  That is why the blacklist of tax havens is important.  If it is a farce, we are not able to set a standard.  However, we are able to do it because we are an economic superpower.  Why do we allow our multinationals to work with tax havens which do not abide by the rules?  There is no reason.  That could start within this economic superpower.  If countries could work together within the OECD, it would be even better as that would include the USA, Japan and China later on.  Then, one could build a global order that is fair.

Transparency is key.  We have argued that public, country-by-country tax reporting is necessary so that we see exactly what the corporations are up to.  The reaction of the Government on the Apple tax does not reflect the attitudes of ordinary people.  Ordinary people see that there is &euro;13 billion available and wonder why it cannot be used in respect of the housing and health crises.  We must also understand that the existence of this money points to the need for a different development model for Ireland.  I would go further and suggest the timeframe for the shift in power and the share of wealth from labour to capital and in the area of corporation tax coincides with the rise of neoliberalism, globalisation and the free movement of capital.  That poses very substantial challenges to any attempt to reverse the process.  It means one should question the idea of saving capitalism from the capitalists.  Perhaps we have to save the planet from capitalism and need a different developmental model based on public ownership, investment, global co-operation and planning.  I do not believe that the French, Dutch or German Governments or the Commission are pursuing this in the interests of global justice and everyone paying tax.  They have their own interests, which may partly coincide with the interests of corporations.  I do not know if Mr. Tang has any more comments on the global picture.

This is what we are now doing in the European Union on the tax issue but we would also like to have it addressed at a global level.  Perhaps the OECD could start this process.

There is a problem that is open to discussion, negotiation and amendment.  By the way, this will be another issue that could be appropriately raised by the Irish representative on the working group of the Council if Ireland believes the weighting of the different factors is not in its interests and it would prefer another weighting.  Deputy Paul Murphy would recommend a stronger weighting for labour.  My recommendation to our committee, which has not yet voted, is to have an equal weighting for the four factors.  This is usual practice in the OECD and also simpler.  However, some members or groups insisted on basing the formula on sales or a combination of sales and labour without capital.  If we attach too much importance to labour, for instance, the risk is that this would be to the detriment of those who invest more in new technologies, robotisation, etc., which is progress.  Conversely, if we base too much on capital, it would detrimentally affect enterprises with a large workforce.  We are open on this matter.<br\/><br\/>On the digital factor, the first problem is to find a definition which enables us to link the digital economy to a geographical base or jurisdiction.  Having listened to many tax and engineering experts specialising in the digital economy, we arrived at the idea that, by definition, everything is movable in the digital economy, apart from personal digital data.  To take Facebook as an example, the company has 30 million users in France, of which I am one.  Incidentally, Facebook does not pay any tax in France, which is unacceptable.  Facebook can collect and exploit data from France everywhere in the world or even in the cloud but it cannot prevent my personal data from being based in France or, in my case, the 17th <i>arrondissement <\/i>in Paris.  It is easy for the tax administration in France to check this and we proposed a definition.  I do not know if it is the best or correct definition and the proposal is open to debate.  If we were to take on board this factor, it is open to debate as to whether it should have the same weighting as labour.  Given that the European Parliament is entitled only to give an opinion, we cannot make demands.  Our political aim, however, is to oblige the Governments to discuss this matter.  I hope that will be the case in respect of taxing the digital economy.  That is the starting point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012500002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alain Lamassoure"},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":847,"content":"<p>I profoundly disagree with Mr. Tang's description of Ireland as being some kind of pirate country.

For example, I understand M. Lamassoure is from the south west of France.  Unlike Ireland, France has a federal, regional system of government.

This might address some of the issues Mr. Lamassoure has raised and would have a global reach.  In a globalised economy, if one simply closes down in one region of the world, one may perhaps address just some of it.  I just do not see the CCCTB.  There is a lot of potential in respect of digital taxation.  Does the committee have a feeling that the OECD process is not the mechanism?

It is also important in terms of the employment capacity of these companies on a globalised basis.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has had a very difficult crash.  All during that time, we continued to pay &euro;600 million or so annually in overseas aid, mainly to countries in Africa, which is untied - not linked to military or other market contracts.  That is something people do not appreciate in Europe sometimes.  We do not have military industries in the way the Netherlands, France, the UK and all the other major European powers have.  We probably do not spend enough on overseas aid but it is untied and it goes to some of the poorest countries in the world.  We did that even in the context of an appalling financial crash and a rescue that cost our citizens quite a lot of money.

The Deputy is correct when she says we must not forecast only on the tax treatments if we want to ensure a level playing field in the European market but must also take into account the various grants and other financial assistance given in some member states and regions to investment, be it by multinationals or small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  This part of the problem is overseen and controlled very closely by the European Commission.  For instance, France has made a step of devolution of power to the regions but their autonomy is relatively limited.  It can happen that the French Government may give grants to big companies or take a public share in them.  It is, however, under the close scrutiny of the Commission and France has been condemned several times by the Commissioner in charge of competition, when these aids were deemed unfair.  There are other cases to be looked at closely.  For instance, the Spanish Basque region was particularly generous towards foreign investments, both by tax privileges and in granting aids.  It was condemned by the European Commission and now it is over.  When we were discussing with our colleagues the content of CCCTB, our German colleagues explained to us that they do not need a super-deductibility on research because in Germany, they encourage research not by tax incentive but by grants.  The Deputy is right and makes a good case.  We must ensure that we take on board also the expenditure side.  However, thus far, the expenditure side has been under very close scrutiny by the European institutions or regulators, which has not been the case for the tax side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012500002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alain Lamassoure"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516870800,"counter":852,"content":"<p>We think the CCTB is one of the proposals that can make the change.  It is not the only thing we need, however.  The reason we think it is important is that it changes the rules of the game.  Now it will be up to firms to decide the location of their profit through constructions, transfer pricing and so on.  If one wants to have one's costs in a high-tax country and one's revenues in a low-tax country, this game should be changed.  If the countries decide where profits are being made and where they are being taxed, one changes the game.  While that is an important change, it is not enough.  A global framework is needed.  I have been arguing that we need Europe to help set the global standard.  The OECD is still very welcome but it has its disadvantages.  It is very much divided when it comes to taxing the digital economy.  There is a conflict of interest there between the US and the EU; Google and Facebook are American-based, after all.  Consequently, one cannot expect the OECD to move on that.<\/p><p>More broadly speaking, not everyone is at the table in that regard and less-developed countries are not very well represented.  A person from the IMF confided in me that African countries should not sign up to tax treaties, although I do not think that is official policy of the OECD or IMF, which usually say a country needs to sign up and become part of the global framework.  However, the official said that because he does not believe that the tax administrations in such countries are a match for the lawyers of big corporations.  That is why I do not think the OECD at this stage is ideal.  There is clear conflict between the United States and the European Union, as well as the fact that it is not really global although, at the end, it is a very good framework.  If one goes global, one goes global but that should be done through an active European Union.  That is the way forward for which I would have most hope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018012500002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Tang","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516870800,"counter":854,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tang for his answers.  However, a genuine comparison of the real effective tax rates in different countries is an absolute<i>sine qua non<\/i>of this discussion.

One such factor is that for the past century or so, Ireland has been an English-speaking country and my experience of working in America and other parts of the world has shown that culturally, that is extraordinarily attractive to the senior executives of such companies.  I completely accept that the tax issue is also extremely critical but I am concerned that the common consolidated tax base is now quite old in terms of how capital formation now occurs and does not capture enough to meet the challenges that may arise if Europe is going to fall behind in regard to the creation of its own industries and the consequences of that for younger people or the implications of robotic development for future employment.<\/p><p>Mr. Tang made a very important point regarding regions.  In the context of the rescue of Ireland, throughout Europe there are regions that do less well than, for example, those surrounding the capital of a country and it is very important for national politicians to try to develop such regions.

I have a problem with what was said by Mr. Tang regarding states being able to invest capital because Ireland does not have a huge accumulation of capital and has had a significant amount of debt since the crash.  The EUROSTAT rules and the various relevant deals do not allow the Irish State to invest as much in capital as can richer European member states.

Approximately 80% of our corporation tax base relates to foreign multinationals, with about 40% of the total coming from the top ten multinationals.  Companies such as Apple and so on provide very significant employment in this country and generate wealth that is exported around the world and not just within the EU.  We need to see a country-by-country impact analysis of who the winners and losers will be before we could go any further with this.<\/p> <p>  I, like most Irish people, am not against corporations paying tax.  We want them to pay their fair share of tax in the appropriate location but it is often the case that this is not that location.  Ireland should not receive &euro;13 billion from Apple for a phone designed in America, manufactured in China and sold in Singapore.  We do not believe we are entitled to those profits but are being told that we are.  We are not saying nobody should get that &euro;13 billion but we do not believe it should be us.  However, there is a concern that companies are being advised that this is how they will now be treated, having experienced a different regime in the past.  Ireland once had a 10% manufacturing tax rate and 43% corporation tax rate and was told it could not have a manufacturing rate, so merged the two into one.  We want corporations to pay their fair share of tax in the appropriate locations but we need to see an analysis of the redistribution of the tax within Europe.

We thank the committee for its invitation to this afternoon's meeting.  We last came appeared before the committee on 16 February 2012.  We are delighted to have the opportunity to inform it about the work that has been undertaken by the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains in the intervening period.  We are very pleased that, since our last meeting, four disappeared victims have been recovered and their remains returned to their families.<\/p> <p>  Before we detail our recent activity, however, I would like to take the opportunity to outline briefly the background and functions of the commission for the benefit of any new committee members who were not present at our last meeting.  The commission was established in 1999 by the Irish and British Governments as one element of the suite of initiatives taken by them in the context of the peace process.  The commission is completely independent in its functions.  It is a non-political body that, since its establishment, has enjoyed cross-party and cross-community support.  This is important to us and the families.  The commission has a humanitarian mission and it is not part of the criminal justice system in either jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of the commission, as members will know, is to facilitate the recovery to their families of the remains of persons killed by paramilitaries during the conflict in Northern Ireland and buried secretly.  These victims are known as \"the disappeared\".<\/p> <p>  The interests of these victims' families have been at the forefront of the commission's efforts since 1999 and will remain so.  They have had to endure a particular cruelty, facing not only the tragedy and injustice of losing a loved one to murder, but also the added pain owing to a relative being missing.  All they seek is the return of the bodies of their loved ones for a dignified burial, to have a place to grieve and to have an end to the painful uncertainty of not knowing where the body of their brother, father, son or uncle has been concealed.  The commission is deeply committed to alleviating their suffering and will continue its work to that end.<\/p> <p>  In the pursuit of its objectives, the commission has been a model of cross-Border co-operation since its establishment.  The commission, the two Governments and police forces, and the many others who have provided services to the commission, have all worked seamlessly together towards a shared goal.  In that sense, the commission is a testament to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  We are grateful for the unwavering support of the two Governments for our work.<\/p> <p>  As I stated, we have recovered four victims since our last meeting with the committee in 2012.  On 1 October 2014, the commission discovered the remains of Brendan Megraw at Oristown Bog.  Brendan disappeared in April 1978.  It would be 36 years and multiple searches before he was recovered and returned to his family.<\/p> <p>  On 25 June 2015, the remains of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee were recovered in Coghalstown, County Meath.  Seamus and Kevin were found during an extensive search being undertaken by the commission for another disappeared victim, Joe Lynskey.  They had been abducted and murdered together some time around October 1972.  The commission had previously searched for the remains of Kevin and Seamus in the Coghalstown area but those earlier searches had not been successful.  Their discovery during the Joe Lynskey search was unexpected but, of course, greatly welcomed by their families and by the commission.  Following their recovery, the search for Joe Lynskey continued for another five months.  Regrettably, we did not find him, and he remains one of our three outstanding cases.<\/p> <p>  On 6 May 2017, the commission recovered the remains of Seamus Ruddy at a forest in Pont-de-l'Arche near Rouen in France.  Seamus had been teaching in Paris when he disappeared in 1985.  Several unsuccessful searches had been undertaken by the commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na previously.  However, following extensive inquires undertaken by the commission prior to the new search, Seamus was recovered and returned to his family.  The commission greatly appreciates the co-operation and assistance of the French authorities and the Irish Embassy in Paris in achieving the outcome.<\/p> <p>  My co-commissioner, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, will speak about the remaining cases on the commission's work programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018012500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Murray"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516889400,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I join Mr. Frank Murray in thanking the committee for its invitation.  It is an important opportunity to brief members on the commission's activities, hear their views and elicit their support for our ongoing efforts.<\/p> <p>  There now remain just three victims on the commission's case list.  Joe Lynskey disappeared in August 1972 and is believed to be buried in the Coghalstown area of County Meath.  Columba McVeigh disappeared in November 1975 and is believed to be buried in Bragan, County Monaghan.  Captain Robert Nairac disappeared in May 1977, and the commission has received very little information to assist in his recovery.  He is believed to be buried somewhere in the Ravensdale area of County Louth.  <\/p> <p>  I should emphasise that information is crucial to the commission's work.  The receipt of information is our greatest asset and the pursuit of information remains our greatest challenge.  It is now over 40 years since the last three victims disappeared, and the passage of time creates obvious difficulties for accessing relevant information.  I appeal to anybody with information that may help in locating the remains of any of the victims to provide it, in confidence, to the commission using our freephone number or our PO box address.<\/p> <p>  All information provided to the commission is treated as strictly confidential and it can be used only to locate and identify the remains.  By law, it cannot be given to other agencies or used for prosecutions.<\/p> <p>  As commissioners we have always taken great satisfaction from the relief and solace that our work brings to the families of the disappeared.  Mr. Murray and I have attended many of the funerals of the people the commission has recovered and have always been struck by how these occasions of great sadness are simultaneously occasions of joy.  The families are joyful that one part of the great tragedy that has befallen them has finally ended.  I have also noted how the families of the disappeared provide great mutual support for one another, even after their loved ones have been recovered.  In that regard, I acknowledge with a deep sense of gratitude the tremendous support that the organisation WAVE has provided to the commission for many years and the work it has done with the victims' families.<\/p> <p>  At this point, we need further focused information to enable us to complete our mission.<\/p><p>We therefore appeal most earnestly to the humanitarian instincts of anyone with such information to pass it to us now through our confidential freefone number or our PO box.  We are grateful to the members of the committee for facilitating this meeting today and I implore them to use whatever influence they might have to encourage people with information to come forward in confidence.<\/p><p> I will ask the head of our investigation team, Geoff Knupfer, to give some more information on the final three cases in the commission&rsquo;s casebook.  We look forward to hearing the members' views and answering any questions they may wish to put to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018012500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Sir Kenneth Bloomfield","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516889400,"counter":867,"content":"<p>As members have heard from Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, we have three outstanding cases on our list of disappeared.  The first is that of Joe Lynskey, who was apparently abducted and killed in 1972.  His name was not included in the initial Good Friday Agreement list of victims published in 1999.  It only came to attention as a result of the publication of a book in 2010.  Nevertheless, we have since been given to understand that inquiries were being made into his case in 1998 and 1999.<\/p> <p>  Following the receipt of some rather patchy information as to the whereabouts of Joe Lynskey&rsquo;s remains, we undertook a search of a large field in Coghalstown, County Meath, in 2015.  In the course of that search we found the bodies of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee in a single grave in that field.  We had previously been informed by an intermediary they were buried in an adjoining field.  Despite completing a thorough search of the field following the recovery of the bodies of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee, I am afraid we did not find any sign of Joe Lynskey.  We have been advised by the republican movement that it has no further information on this case.  We believe his remains are probably buried in the Coghalstown or Oristown area of County Meath and while we keep an open mind, our inquiries are focused on those areas.<\/p> <p>  The second case is that of Columba McVeigh, who was abducted and killed in 1975.  His name appeared on the list published in 1999 and the commission was advised that his remains were buried in Bragan Bog, Carrickroe, County Monaghan.  Information continues to be exchanged on this case and, to date, a number of searches of that bog have been undertaken but sadly without success.  Further refinement is being sought on this case and, if it is deemed positive, a further search could be programmed for Bragan Bog in the current year.  Nevertheless, the information we have on this case contains some inconsistencies and is far from complete.  Any additional information that could be made available would be very much welcomed. <\/p> <p>  I turn to the final outstanding case, that of Robert Nairac who was abducted and killed in May 1977.  At the time he was a serving soldier.  He was abducted from the Three Steps Inn in Dromintee, taken to Ravensdale and was killed.  Unfortunately, his body was removed immediately afterwards and was secretly buried.  Several people were tried and convicted of his killing and associated offences, but his body has not been found and no information has been passed to the commission as to its whereabouts. <\/p> <p>  We believe that this could be because he was a British soldier and that, since his death, his name has been linked in a number of books and articles with five separate killings and atrocities.  Due to this dearth of information, the commission has taken the unusual step of undertaking research into his background.  This has revealed that Robert Nairac was not and never had been a member of the Special Air Service; he was in fact a Grenadier Guard.  His role was that of a liaison and intelligence officer, liaising between the police and the army.  In military terms, he was a very junior officer and would not have had free rein.  Neither was he tasked with handling informants or sources as part of his role.<\/p> <p>  On the dates of four of the incidents with which his name has been linked, Robert Nairac was not in Ireland.  On the fifth occasion, he was actively deployed on an operation in Derry, many miles away from where this incident occurred in County Monaghan.  In all five cases we have been able to trace and interview witnesses who are able to vouch for Robert Nairac&rsquo;s presence in these various locations and not anywhere near the locations where the incidents occurred.  We in the commission are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that these witness accounts are absolutely accurate and the individuals providing them are telling the truth.  It is most unfortunate that the army&rsquo;s \"neither confirm nor deny\" policy was brought to bear when these various allegations came to light.  Had they been countered at the time with the appropriate documentary and witness evidence, it is unlikely we would find ourselves in the present situation.<\/p> <p>  We earnestly appeal to anyone who has information on the whereabouts of Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh or Robert Nairac to contact the commission.  Any information received will be treated in the strictest of confidence and can only be used, as the committee has heard already, to recover and repatriate victims.  It cannot be passed to any other organisation and it cannot be used in a court of law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018012500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Geoff Knupfer"},{"type":"speech","time":1516889400,"counter":868,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentation.

I am very glad, as I did in 2012, to have suggested for the 2018 work programme of this committee to invite the representatives of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains to make a presentation to the committee.  My request met with unanimous approval.  The thinking behind my request was that we have to use every forum open to us to try to create awareness that people with information should provide it to the commission.<\/p> <p>  I compliment the commission on what it has achieved to date in recovering so many bodies.  Unfortunately the bodies of Joseph Lynskey, Columba McVeigh and Robert Nairac have yet to be recovered.  I have been familiar with the work of the commission since its establishment following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, as the first commissioner appointed by the Irish Government was my predecessor as Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan, my good friend and former T&aacute;naiste, the late John Wilson.  I was familiar with the work of the commission without knowing the detail of the work.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Murray and Sir Kenneth Bloomfield have been in very senior positions in the public service, as has Mr. Knupfer.  John Wilson told me that even though he had been in very difficult positions, including up to T&aacute;naiste and in government, nothing was anything like as difficult as his work on the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains.<\/p> <p>  I compliment the commission on its excellent work in trying to recover bodies.  It is absolutely appalling that so many innocent people were abducted, murdered and secretly buried.  I have met many of the victims' families over the years.  I do not have the words to describe the grief that they have suffered and continue to suffer.  Many of them said to me that they wanted to have a grave where their loved one would rest and where they would be able to go, say a prayer and lay a flower.  It is not a big request in respect of a family member who had been murdered.  These were innocent people murdered by thugs and murders masquerading as so-called republicans and loyalists.<\/p> <p>  I am sure that with every passing day the work of the commission does not get easier.  I assume that what it needs is information.  I sincerely hope the Governments provide it with the necessary resources to support its work.  In his opening remarks, Mr. Murray made the point that it is gratifying to have the support of the Government and the Oireachtas.  Part of my thinking in inviting the witnesses to make a presentation to the committee, with the full agreement of the committee, was to let those families know that their loved ones still being missing is a source of concern for all of us and to try to use this forum as a means of generating awareness<\/p><p>If somebody has some information, even though they might think it is irrelevant or just has some relevance, they should come forward and provide it to the commission.  I wish the commission well in the remainder of its work.  I know the terrain in north Monaghan and Bragan Mountain well.  It is part of my constituency and I know the area around Oristown in Meath, which is a neighbouring area.  The topography does not make it easy for the commission to do its work.  I presume that the commission needs information more than anything else. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018012500002#C00400","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516889400,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I welcome the commission members and thank them for their presentation.<\/p> <p>  For many of us, the hearings into victims and legacy issues have thrown up many of the awful instances that happened during the conflict.  There is no question that this is a particularly awful situation and it continues to be awful for the families with the remains of their loved ones still not found.  It should not have happened.  This was wrong and our focus now has to be on supporting the families and loved ones who are left behind.  Thankfully, 13 of the named victims have been recovered but a further three remain missing, namely, Joseph Lynskey, Robert Nairac and Columba McVeigh.  I agree with Deputy Brendan Smith's comments on using this meeting as an opportunity and a platform to make the appeal once again for anybody to bring forward information they may have in any of these cases.  They should bring it forward under the certainty, which has been offered here again today, of absolute anonymity.  I am sure the appeal will be made again during this meeting.<\/p> <p>  Most of these 16 cases happened before I was born.  I say this because we are operating in a limited window with regard to information.  Sometimes the information on the outstanding cases goes back 40 or 50 years.  We have a short window in which this information can come forward.  This closing window makes it critically important to have the information.<\/p> <p>  Would Mr. Knupfer accept that he has received support for his efforts from former IRA activists thus far? Would Mr. Knupfer accept that they were genuine in their efforts to help?  Mr. Knupfer referred to the legislation that provides for immunity for information received but how important does he think this is in the broader campaign undertaken by the commission?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the continuing efforts to locate the remaining victims, Mr. Knupfer alluded to who those people are.  Perhaps the witness could expand on what measures are currently being taken.  This may offer the commission another opportunity to make an appeal for any information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2018012500002#D00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516889400,"counter":872,"content":"<p>We have received a very significant degree of support from members of the republican movement over the years.

It has all been passed with the best of intentions, albeit it has been inaccurate.  This, however, is entirely understandable given the timescales involved.<\/p> <p>  One of the other problems we have is that people who may have been involved in these events 40 years ago have now moved on with their lives.

There are issues and there is no two ways about it, but we have had genuine support also.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the consequences for passing on information.  This is not a general amnesty; it is a limited immunity.  I believe we would all agree that it has worked remarkably well.  Nobody who has passed information to the commission about missing victims has ever been interviewed, arrested, charged or appeared in court for anything related to that information.  We are comfortable that the legal structure works very well and I believe that the people we engage with are satisfied this is the case.  As the years go by, more victims are found.

The setting up of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains has been one aspect of the Good Friday Agreement that is working in a lot of ways with a difficult task.<\/p> <p>  I attended Kevin McKee's funeral in St. Peter's in Belfast, in a personal capacity.  It brought back the awfulness of the tragedy of his murder and the secret burial which left his family grieving for many years.  That he was buried with his mother in Lisburn many years later brought back that fact that this young man was 17 years of age when he was abducted with Seamus Wright who was 25.  Across the Border we found it very difficult to comprehend these unfortunate times. <\/p> <p>  Three victims' remains have not yet been found, namely, those of Joseph Lynskey, Columba McVeigh and Robert Nairac.  Can Mr. Knupfer tell the committee if there is a reluctance, a selectivity, a hierarchy, a cunning or a disrespect involved in the fact that Robert Nairac was from a British army tradition?  Is this why information is not coming forward about him? I watched the \"Prime Time Investigates\" interview with Robert Nairac's friend Fr. William Burke.

Will the Minister update us on how that is progressing and what the likely difference is between the CSO statistics and the information coming back from the local authorities and other mechanisms?<\/p> <p>  In respect of the turnaround of vacant properties or local authority voids, we need to have the debate the Minister missed last week in the Department about the definition of a void.  Many members were disappointed because it was not quite what we believed a void was when we discussed the start of Rebuilding Ireland.  Most of us have been in local authorities and have seen voids, sitting there for a long time, boarded up and unused, and that was what we considered to be a void.  The figures, however, include the turnover of people who vacate houses because of a debt or for any other reason.  Many of these properties were built in the 1960s and 1970s and would automatically need doors, windows and electricity replaced.  They are now included in a void return.  That is not very transparent or fair.  It is definitely not my understanding of how we defined a void.  We need a debate on that issue. <\/p> <p>  I believe choice-based allocation and data is available in every county.  Do we have any data to show how that is working out compared with the previous scheme.  The repair and lease scheme is disappointing from everybody's point of view, including the Minister's, given that there are only eight or nine successful starts on it.  What tweaks is he proposing in respect of the scheme?  Can he update us on that?  <\/p> <p>  Can the Minister give me more detail on urban renewal and the &euro;50 million he is making available?  The town and village scheme exists.  Where is this aimed at?  Is it aimed at different populations?  The Minister is also asking the local authorities to match that &euro;50 million with another &euro;50 million.  I have been discussing local authority finance here for a long time.  There has been a lot of debate at previous meetings about the base lines of local authorities.  Where will they get the &euro;50 million to match the Minister's &euro;50 million?  I do not believe it is there.  It is unfair to ask local authorities for that sum.  If the Minister is using the excess over and above the baseline figure to extract that &euro;50 million, it will apply only to the local authorities that have a surplus available.  Could the Minister clarify that further?  We equally have some concern about the change of use of commercial properties.  Deputy Cowen emailed the Minister about that last night.  <\/p> <p>  I know the housing delivery cost unit has been completed, according to the report here.  When will this committee get a copy of that report? <\/p> <p>  I have raised the housing inspections and the targeted 25% by 2021 before now.  Given the way society is going, we need to try to achieve 100% inspection before any tenant moves in.  We need to revisit this to see how we can achieve that.  Before we put a tenant into a house, it needs that inspection and a target of 25% is not good enough.<\/p><p>At the end of June or July last year, there was to be a review of rental pressure zones but we have not received any information back on those, how they are working out or what changes the Minister is making to them.  Constituents have told me that areas outside rent pressure zones are coming under enormous pressure and experiencing severe rental increases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#B00500","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":907,"content":"<p>I do not have an opening statement as I was informed it would be of no value.  It is good to get straight into questions and Deputy Casey asked a number.  I am glad he raised the CSO figures because work has been ongoing in the Department for the past six or seven months on these.  This is not to say the CSO vacancy figures of between 178,000 and 180,000 are wrong, rather that its definition of vacancy is not how we would define what is a liveable property in a high-demand area that would be worth bringing back into use.  We have now set up vacancy teams in each local authority and that number has come down quite dramatically.  Even if we got 10% back into use, it would amount to 17,000 or 18,000 homes, an enormous number, but the information we are getting from local authorities is that the number of vacant homes is nowhere near the CSO's figure.  Our desktop exercise brought it down to some 90,000 homes in high-demand areas but we started to drill down and we brought it down to below 20,000.  At the housing summit, Galway City started off with a CSO figure of 3,500 but the geodata figure took it down by over 1,000 and after taking out homes that were for sale, between lettings, not in high-demand areas or not desirable for social housing, the figure was less than 100.  Fingal had a CSO figure of 4,944 but the geodirectory made it 3,000 while a desktop exercise, to look at the figures and establish the real level of liveable vacant homes, brought it down to 361 potentially vacant units.  Of these, 74 were inspected and only 13 were identified as vacant, which would give a total of 60 out of an initial figure of almost 5,000.  According to the CSO, Fingal had one of the lowest vacancy rates.<\/p> <p>  Fixing supply is the primary aim in solving our housing crisis, although we also need to manage existing stock.  However, the existing stock may not be there in the levels we thought and we have to think about what that means for resources.  Is it more efficient for a local authority to have three people on the ground trying to find out who owns a home, why it is vacant, whether they should CPO it or if they should go for a scheme?  That takes time and perhaps these people should be involved in trying to get sites built on.  South Dublin County Council's CSO figures showed 3,500 while the geodirectory took it down to 600 and the local authority estimated the vacancy rate at 250.  After its own research, the council believes it is only 56.  Vacancy is not the low-hanging fruit we thought it was.  We should try to get these 56 vacant units back into use, of course, and we will do so, but it will be up to each local authority to balance its resources prudently in this regard.<\/p> <p>  One of the Deputy's questions was on the definition of a void.  A lot of time was spent on this.  Local authority vacancy was the low-hanging fruit but when we came out of the bailout in 2014 the Government began an ambitious programme to get local authority stock that had been vacant for a long time back into use.  In that period, at least 8,000 homes were brought back into use.  These vacant voids included some that were derelict and some in need of significant repair but they did not include homes where the entire estate was in need of regeneration, as that comes under our builds figure.  We are not talking about simple turnover or homes where there are casual vacancies.  They are homes that require a substantial amount of work and investment to get them back into use as social housing stock.  If that money was not spent and the work not done, they would be lying empty now but that is what we count when we count voids.  If we were to stipulate that a unit had to be vacant for a certain period of time, we would put a perverse incentive into the system and a local authority might be enticed to keep a property vacant for a period of time in order to avail of additional funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#C00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":908,"content":"<p>I do not deny that the Minister is spending the capital funding on getting these homes back into use.

The first was touched on by Deputy Casey and the Minister and it relates to compiling the register of vacant units across the country.  The issue here is the integrity of data.  In the past 12 months, we have received different data and different figures from different people, which is something we need to address.  It is changing and we are getting more and more data so we need it to be authoritative.<\/p> <p>  The report states that we are to review the system of differential rents for social housing.  I will strike a note of caution here.  There were some very imaginative local authorities who, when doing boiler maintenance or another improvement scheme, entered into an agreement to add &euro;1 to the rent per week for a contribution to maintenance.  I know of one such practice in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and it leads to responsible tenancy, which I like.  There must be flexibility within local authorities as we are not homogenous and we do not want everything to be centralised.  We want accountability, centrally, but we must leave a certain amount of flexibility for local authorities.  If they come up with imaginative schemes such as the one to which I referred, and there is an agreement with tenants, we should allow them.<\/p><p>The previous Administration suggested a national rent scheme, as Deputy Alan Kelly mentioned.  There were objections to that from a range of sectors.  Public engagement with local authorities is very important.  A certain amount of flexibility is needed though at the same time one wants some sort of standardisation or margins, which I want to talk about.  On exploring ways of promoting available step-down facilities, we know where we have pressures on social housing, particularly in Dublin but also Galway, Limerick and Cork.  We have older people in communities who wish to remain in their communities.  Forget about their status or income.  They might have a large property and want to step down.  We do not have those facilities.  We need a range of options, whether co-operative housing, social housing - since we see it in social housing stock too - or in the private sector where people want to realise their capital and step-down.  The key issue is that it has to be within their communities.  People want to remain in their communities.  That needs to be enabled so we need to look at some of the big new housing schemes which are coming on.  That may need one or two bedroom units, smaller units, or new types of arrangements.  That is worth emphasising.<\/p><p> On choice-based letting, I hear reports from a number of local authorities which have run pilot schemes that there is huge resistance in some local authorities to choice-based letting.  I will single out the local authority in Wicklow specifically.  I met people in the area recently who do not know where they are on the housing list.  They are told that is confidential.  They have no way to know whether they are number 10, 40 or 80 on a list.  We have to have a transparent housing list, particularly for social housing.  We need to look at and standardise that.  We need to ensure the right of any person who is homeless or waiting to have a home to be able to contact the housing authority and ask for his or her position and be assured that nobody else is jumping ahead and getting a place due to knowing somebody.  I am not suggesting that is happening but I want a transparent system where people have an individual ID number they can access on the system to see where they are and where the movement is on the list.  I do not believe in giving that discretion to local authorities.  That should be a central direction.  There has to be a proper open and transparent social housing list.  It would be helpful for this committee for, within perhaps a month, us to have a report on all the choice-based lettings and the situation in each of the 31 local authorities.  I am not interested in pilot schemes if they are not going to be assessed.  A number of these pilot schemes have gone on for a year.  We want to know the outcome of these pilot schemes and the standard.  There was great talk here about people having rights.  There were many refusals for social housing and many suggestions about why people were refusing it.  Some suggested that people did not like the location and others said it was a flat above something else, while others thought the accommodation was not appropriate for their needs.  Let us have the choice.  We thought choice-based letting would allow other people who wanted to take the property, which might have had eight, nine or ten refusals, to take it.  We need greater clarity.  I think it would be helpful for this committee and would like to request that we have some sort of spreadsheet report on all 31 local authorities and where we are with choice-based letting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#C00800","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":915,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his comments on the work of the Department on focusing the reporting to drive greater accountability and delivery.  That is the intention of what we have been trying to do over the past six months as we reviewed Rebuilding Ireland and went to refine and introduce new things, to ensure Oireachtas Members were aware of exactly what was happening.  In giving that accountability and reporting, we were not taking up unnecessary resources, so this is what we have tried to do in this engagement, in the tabular review of actions in 2017 and in additional reports that have been provided, for example, on the housing assistance payment or the 2017 summary of social housing indicators.  The housing summit is also about transparency and accountability and the targets and figures that will be published off the back of that but I might come to that later so that I can answer the rest of the Senator's questions first.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is absolutely right about the integrity of data.  It has been to the forefront of my mind and my actions since I took office.  The Senator will be aware that since I came into office, we stopped calling ESB connections \"completions\".  We still publish the figure because I think it is still important because of what it includes, including house builds and homes that are vacant for two years.  Work on that data is happening and it will conclude in the next quarter, covering completions in a year and other things.  It is also important, if there is a difficulty with a figure like that, that we do not give the public the impression that all of the figures are wrong.  We can count our own social housing homes or commencement notices when they are logged on the building control management system, BCMS.  This data on vacancy has been very difficult to handle because there is a perception in the public that there are tens of thousands of vacant homes in high demand areas that could quickly and easily be brought into use.  The data to date is showing that that is not the case, from the work that each individual local authority is doing.  With this group, working with the CSO, we want to come to a figure that people can have greater faith in.  That work is happening at the moment and will begin with getting a proper definition of vacancy.  The definition the CSO is using is perhaps not the definition of vacancy that most people on the street would use.  We are then going to do a field-based survey of a subset of data as a project.  It would not be too different from what local authorities have done themselves but it would take a wider focus across different local authority areas.  It would involve the CSO.  We might then get a better understanding of what true vacancy rates are when we talk about liveable properties.  That work is happening because I think it is important that we use the right, agreed numbers when making comparisons.<\/p> <p>  Discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the differential rents review are continuing.  I have had a number of conversations with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on this issue.  Our officials have had a number of discussions on the review and changes that will come.  This is a key challenge that we face in every aspect of our dealings with local authorities, with a need for flexibility and authority at the local level, since we believe in local government and the devolution of power to local authority areas.  We also need to give them a national standard or framework to which they can work and have flexibility within.  I take the Senator's point about certain local authorities - he cited D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council as one - doing things that make sense from the point of view of the tenant and which encourage responsible tenancies.  We want to ensure such local authorities can continue to pursue those.<\/p> <p>  Step-down is a key part of our management of stock, as well as building new stock.  If one can build new stock to one and two-bedroom unit specifications, then one can have a more ambitious step-down approach and therefore bring family homes or larger homes back into use.  This has been done very effectively with some housing bodies.  The Iveagh Trust did it with a local authority in Annamore, where 70 to 74 new apartments were built in a new scheme.  It also released between 18 and 20 homes in the area because the local authority issued a circular informing people that if they wanted to downsize into a modern building and let their house for social housing, they could, while they made different arrangements for existing social housing tenants.  Consequently, there were between 90 and 100 new homes even though only 70-something had to be built.  We are looking to improve this.  It is part of the national planning framework.  As we look at future population needs, over a quarter of the population will be above the age of 65 by 2040.  This absolutely has to be part of our forward planning.  I like the way the Senator puts community in the centre of that, because as we fix the crisis today, community has to be at the centre of all we do or else we will just build fragmented communities for the future if we do not do this in the right way.  We continue to engage with different housing bodies.  I recently had a meeting with a housing body which is an NGO about how we can use the new apartment guidelines on co-living to develop new properties that do not yet exist which would enable things like peer supervision for the elderly, which will be important because there will be more community space in the development.  It is to the forefront of our thinking as we approach new builds and work with the approved housing body sector.<\/p> <p>  There will be a report on choice-based letting because I have similar interests in how it is working.  We are having a discussion in the Department about what data we will gather from that and how useful it might be.  I have heard very positive things about choice-based letting from people who are using it.  I have not heard some of the concerns that the Senator has mentioned today.  When I operated as a councillor and as I operate now as a Deputy, there is complete transparency on where people are on a list.  They can contact local authorities directly and will be told, or their local Deputy or councillor can find that out for them.  The impression is often given by some, unfortunately, that they will help people to jump the list or get a place and one will hear that a certain councillor or Deputy got a person a house or apartment.  It is almost impossible to do that when one engages with the officials involved, from what I have been told.<\/p><p>I believe there needs to be some flexibility at local authority level because they know better themselves, when it comes to people who are at the top of the list, what might work for one person and what might work for others.  They need to be able to manage that themselves.  I would not think of taking that from them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#D00200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":917,"content":"<p>I apologise for cutting across, but the words accountability and transparency are key words the Deputy is using all the time.

I have had some incidents recently in my area.  If a person gets on the local authority housing list and qualifies for HAP, he or she is entitled to a first-time deposit as a one-off.  We have now returned to what we would have known as the social welfare offices, or Intreo as it is known now.  It has come to my attention several times that if a house comes up and a person qualifies to go on the housing list and is on the HAP, he or she has to give a deposit.  One is lucky not to be asked for two deposits, but in fairness many places only look for one.  The person then has to go to his or her family, who have to lend them the deposit because, naturally enough, these people cannot come up with the deposits.  When they go back to get their first-time deposit, they are being told that because their family have loaned it to them, it cannot be paid back.  They might have borrowed from three or four family members, but they are being told they cannot get their first-time deposit.  Someone should step in here.  We are bringing out many schemes, but there is no communication on the exact policies.  People are told that they can have a first-time deposit, but they cannot if they borrow the deposit.  I can name five different cases where people have had to borrow money from family and friends, only to be told that they cannot get the money back.  That definitely needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Returning to HAP, there is a clause within it that I was not aware of.  I know of a case where a man had to leave a HAP premises because it was damp and the landlord would not do work on it.  He had to sign a form with the local authority to say that he would not go on the HAP for a year.  He cannot get any rent allowance.  Is there any way that a system can be put in place so that people can find out what they are entitled to?  <\/p> <p>  On 5.03, which promises that \"We will work with the local authorities to speed up the refurbishment\", it has to be said that staffing is the biggest issue.  Delays with funding is also a massive issue.  The maintenance of local authority housing by local authorities is the biggest issue we face, and the Minister is going to have to step in.  My own local authority in Carlow will only carry out leak repairs and roof repairs.  Other local authorities will fix gas boilers, doors, kitchens and bathrooms.  Every local authority seems to be able to decide what it will repair.  That needs to stop.  Everyone is paying their rent.  It does not matter what local authority a person lives in - everyone is entitled to the same treatment, whether they are in Kilkenny, Waterford, Laois or anywhere else.  That is not happening.  It is a massive issue.  There have been so many cutbacks in this area.  I had an incident recently where an old lady, who was a local authority tenant for 20 years, could not get her gas boiler fixed by the local authority.  I tried on four occasions to get it done for her.  In the end, she had to borrow the money to get a new gas boiler.  That is not acceptable.  <\/p> <p>  Another part of Pillar 5 states that, \"We will review the tenant purchase scheme following the first year of operation\".  I firmly believe that scheme has been an absolute disaster from the beginning.  If a person was in a local authority house and had worked for years, but had to retire or stopped working due to ill health, he or she does not qualify to buy out the house because there has to be earnings of 50% in place.  The scheme is a disaster.  A person came to me who had come into a bit of money.  She had enough to buy the house but she did not qualify.  She was a good local authority tenant, a mature woman, but she could not buy out her house.  That needs to be looked at. <\/p> <p>  Regarding the &euro;70 million capital in Exchequer funding that will be working through the different Departments, who will be accountable for all this money and what projects will receive funding?  Is it to be run on a first come, first served basis?  Perhaps the Minister could explain that.  I want to make sure that there is accountability for all local authorities when capital funding is in place through the Exchequer.  <\/p> <p>  A trial of the lease and repair scheme was carried out in Carlow.  I have major concerns about that.  Some of the conditions have been changed, and that is welcome because the &euro;40,000 required was causing much of the concern.  It was originally to have been over ten years but I believe it has gone back to a five year basis.  That is welcome, but there are concerns about the conditions.  It is helpful to try to work on the repair and lease scheme, but there is a reason there has not been a good uptake on it.  I believe it is to be rolled out to every local authority, but I want to know what feedback the Minister is getting.  I can only give my own feedback from Carlow where people felt there were too many conditions and that it could not be justified in the long term.  I know local authorities were willing to take on the repair and lease scheme and put tenants into those properties, but I have concerns about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#E00700","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":923,"content":"<p>The Senator has had almost six minutes, so we will go back to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#E00800","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":924,"content":"<p>I have many more questions but I will ask them another time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#E00900","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":925,"content":"<p>I have no doubt about that.  A detailed report is available on HAP and how it has been operating in different local authorities.  I hope it is helpful in terms of understanding its uptake, the different discretions that are given, the percentage of discretions above the existing rents, and how that is being implemented.<\/p> <p>  The issue of two months deposit came up over the summer, and at the time I said that we would bring in legislation to prevent that from happening if it was seen to be the case.  I consulted with the Residential Tenancies Board at the time, which said that it was not aware that this was happening and that it had received no complaints about it.  I am not aware that it is an actual issue in the market at the moment.  One month is absolutely sufficient.  It is the practice, and if we have to establish that in law as the practice, we will do so.  <\/p> <p>  The deposit under the homeless HAP is there to assist families.  If an individual applies, the deposit will be sourced using Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection officers.  I understand the point the Senator made about people being confused as to where they are supposed to go or how they are supposed to get the supports because there is no single point of contact.  The place finder person is supposed to work in that area to help those people, and it is their responsibility to get them to the right person.  We are rolling out the place finder programme nationally, and local authorities are taking that on board because they believe it is a resource they need.  <\/p> <p>  If there are problems around individual cases, we can talk about them offline.  It helps in getting them resolved, but it also helps us to get a better understanding nationally of how housing measures are being interpreted at a local level.<\/p> <p>  On the staffing of local authorities, it is picking up, but it needs to increase more quickly.  Over the past two years, local authorities have been increasing their staff numbers.  At the housing summit on Monday, we made a commitment to local authorities on the build side that more staff required on that side could be hired and that those costs could be recouped in the budget line through the Department to make sure they had enough people on the ground, whether in design, driving projects or otherwise.  They will work with the increased number of staff that we have in the Department.    <\/p> <p>  What will be repaired by the local authorities is not consistent from area to area, and we heard from the Senator's colleague on the committee about one of the approaches that D&uacute;n Laoghaire takes.<\/p><p>It is important when we talk about what a tenant is paying in rent that we discuss what that rent gets them in so far as the landlord's responsibilities are concerned.  Again, this comes under the review of differential rents.  Everybody should be clear what their rights and responsibilities are.  I have seen some cases in the newspapers recently, one of which was mentioned by the Senator as an example.  We are doing a piece of work in the Department currently which will provide greater clarity to local authorities as to what exactly is to be included and what is not.  However, I do not want to remove flexibility where a local authority wants to go a bit further and then create an additional charge for tenants.<\/p><p> On the review of the tenant purchase scheme, I understand how people are getting caught.  Some people are also taking advantage of it, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#E01000","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":927,"content":"<p>It is a good scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#F00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":928,"content":"<p>As part of the review, we are trying to find the balance and determine the best approach.

We are close to finalising what the new scheme will look like.  Some people will be happy with the new scheme and some will not.  That is the nature of things when they are reviewed.  I want to be careful about how we manage this.  At its centre, obviously, will be the aspiration for home ownership.  That must be in the scheme.  At the same time, we must be mindful of managing local authority stock at a time when it is low and we are trying to increase it.  We must be cognisant of the costs foregone by the State also and of the fact that, unfortunately, there are some people who might take advantage of the scheme.  We are trying to square those pieces while at the same time not having people in unfair situations who are good tenants who have lived in a home which they are now in a position to buy.  I would like to get that published as soon as possible.  We have been finalising and publishing a lot of material over recent weeks, but this is one of the next things we want to move to.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Agency and the accountability for the &euro;70 million in capital were raised.  The Housing Agency is accountable to me and I am accountable to the committee.  We have published numbers on what they have been doing on securing some of these homes and selling them on to approved housing bodies.  There are a number of potential portfolios becoming available and I have told the Housing Agency to go for them and not to wait to secure them; to get them assessed and to take what is suitable.  We are doing that piece of work at the moment.  The repair and lease scheme was raised by Deputy Casey, but I did not get a chance to answer him on some of the reforms we have brought in.  There are still concerns about some of the conditions.  In fact, one of Senator Murnane O'Connor&rsquo;s colleagues, Senator Coffey, visited one of what are unfortunately very few repair and lease schemes.  This was in Waterford city.  He saw how it had worked and how the individual had been able to get involved.  Only seven or eight were completed last year, which is very disappointing when one looks at the target we had.  However, there were hundreds of applications of interest and more than 200 have been assessed.  As we move through, it begins to come down to potential agreements.  However, the Senator is right about difficulties in the scheme and the length of time it is taking.  I am running out of time but when I come back to Deputy Casey, I might go through some of the changes we announced at the summit on Monday and which we will announce more publicly today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#F00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":929,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Dowd is next but he has just stepped out.

Paragraph 4.1 says the Government will develop a rental strategy.  With the homeless figures showing no sign of abating and the private rented sector being the place where people generally become homeless, the Minister will agree that this is urgent.  Rebuilding Ireland says the Minister will deal with the issue of tenants <i>in situ<\/i>where there is the sale of a property.  We all know this has been happening for years.  It is not new that landlords are using this as a way to evict people.  In some cases, some people may be selling homes because of the banks, but there are also people who use it as a way to get rid of tenants.  There has been very little strengthening of the protections for tenants.  Is the Government going to bite the bullet and bring in legislation to amend the Residential Tenancies Act to prevent people being evicted for that reason?  If a landlord wishes to sell a property, the law should be amended to ensure that it must be done with the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>.  Does the Minister agree that it has come to the point that, notwithstanding the over-representation of landlords' rights in the D&aacute;il, barriers must be erected to prevent landlords doing that?  Another issue I have is refurbishment.  It probably only applies where there is large-scale ownership of properties rather than in respect of individual landlords.  When is this going to be brought out?<\/p><p>The third issue I want to raise with the Minister is one we raised when rent pressure zones were being introduced by the Minister's predecessor.  We proposed an amendment to the legislation involved to provide that landlords would have to get a certificate from the RTB stating the rent for a property so that a new tenant would know what the rent was and would not have to negotiate over that rent from a position of having less power than a landlord looking at 30 others in a queue.  If the Minister wanted to prevent the breaching of the rent pressure zone legislation, that is something he could implement.  Clearly, breaches are happening when rents in Dublin have gone up 23% despite the legislation.  I know the Minister will say that is because new tenancies are exempt from the legislation, but it is not just new tenancies.  It is also because when someone moves out or is forced out, landlords bump up the rent.  Nobody has any way to check it.  A Bill is being proposed this week and we proposed an amendment over a year ago.  It is a tiny demand on landlords to produce the certificate rather than to have tenants try to get the information out of them.<\/p><p>Is the committee taking HAP separately or is it part of rental?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#F00500","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":931,"content":"<p>It comes in under rental and another pillar.

Given that this is such a significant part of the Government's social housing strategy, how concerned is the Minister about the rate of rent being paid in local authority areas?  When I was reading through the briefing, I noticed that the top rents under HAP are paid in Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown where the average monthly payment by local authorities under the scheme is &euro;1,292.  Obviously, the other Dublin authorities are not far behind.  The State is paying &euro;1,292 to private landlords to house social housing tenants.  That does not surprise me given how acute the housing crisis is, in particular in those locations.  Has the Minister looked at the figures from housing academics showing that if the State built houses, it would save billions over the course of 30 years?  If one built a home rather than to continue with HAP, the figures speak for themselves.  The taxpayer is paying &euro;1,292 into the pockets of private landlords when people could be in public housing and paying a differential rent, as I know they still are under HAP, but the taxpayer would not be subsidising the profits of a private landlord.<\/p> <p>  The Government's data says that in the third quarter of 2017, 20% of the total households supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits.  Can the Minister see how unsustainable this strategy is in a context where no housing is available?<\/p><p>This is just going to continue to escalate.  I also want to point out that while 31,700 households are being supported by the scheme, including an additional almost 18,000 last year, 9,300 are transfers from rent supplement.  They are not actually additional new homes being provided for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#F00700","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":934,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Coppinger, she is over time.

The latter is a big part of the market.  We need to ensure that there are enough homes to rent.  I do not dispute the need to make sure that we have proper protections for tenants.  I do not think that we have a mature rental market in this country.  We need to try to develop one because renting is becoming more of a lifestyle choice for a lot of people.  However, there are many who are forced to rent who would rather be able to buy.  That is why we have been focusing more on affordability for buyers under the affordable purchase scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.<\/p><p>A rental strategy was developed under Rebuilding Ireland and is being implemented.  However, one of the first conversations I had when I took over and met representatives from the RTB related to the need to give the board greater powers under legislation and a more sustainable financial base and to move it into a position of being a proper independent regulator for the sector.  Last September I announced a two-year change management programme for the RTB to facilitate this in order that it can be in a position to balance those rights between tenants and landlords effectively.<\/p><p>I disagree that there is very little protection for tenants.  I think there are strong protections.  However, I recognise that we need to make certain protections stronger.  We have two items of legislation coming, as part of that change management programme for the RTB, that are going to look at those aspects.  For example, people caught up in rent evictions and issues of that nature.  There is a case before the courts at the moment to see those how robust the existing legislation is.  We need to do more in that area and I am committed to doing more to ensure that individuals are not interpreting existing laws in their favour to the detriment of people and their security in their homes as renters.<\/p><p>Prevention is absolutely key for 2018.  In 2017, we brought in more emergency beds.  We have accelerated the hub programme.  On Monday, at the housing summit, I spoke about accelerating it even further by using rapid technologies.  This year, prevention is key.  Tenants <i>in situ <\/i>are going to be part of that.  I will come back to the point the Deputy made HAP and the numbers separately.  If a landlord is selling a property and we make it an absolute condition that property can only be sold with tenants <i>in situ<\/i>, then that means the landlord can only sell to another landlord.  That is going to potentially breach that person's rights.  If we can do it by way of an incentive through the tax code whereby, if a person is selling a property, he or she is actually going to make a lot more money from it if he or she spends a bit of extra time working to sell it to another landlord, then that is something worth exploring.<\/p><p>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, brought this matter to my attention.  We are working together to see if there is something we can do with the Minister of Finance, Deputy Donohoe, officials and the Cabinet to see how we can incentivise the selling of homes with tenants <i>in situ<\/i>.  It is a key aspect of the prevention measures on which we need to work in terms of prevention and keeping people in their homes as we build new houses.  If we cannot work harder at prevention, then it going to be very difficult through 2018 with families and individuals becoming homeless.<\/p><p>We had a definition of substantial refurbishment produced last year.  As part of our change management programme, we will move to put that into legislation over the course of this year.  In respect of rent transparency, that information should be provided today to someone who is moving in as to what was the previous rent.  However, I recognise that we can actually be more effective on this ourselves.  We can actually only do it from a public transparency point of view once we have annual registrations of tenancies.  That is part of the change management programme for the RTB.  It needs to be able to build a system that can handle that.  It is doing that at the moment.  Funding is being provided.  That will take six to 12 months.  We are putting in place the legislation to allow the board to carry out annual registrations of tenancies.<\/p><p>We talk about the rent increases in Dublin that we are experiencing.  If we look at the quarterly reports from say quarter two yo quarter three last year, we do not have the fourth quarter report yet, we are still trying to understand the data.  However, because we do not have annual registrations of tenancies, it is difficult sometimes to understand the data.  If we look at quarter two to quarter three, there is an increase of at least 6,000 new registrations of rental properties.  Are they brand new properties onto the market?  If they are, that is very welcome.  That obviously will affect the rental rate of inflation because they are not captured by the rent pressure zones.  However, they may not be new properties.  They may be properties that may have been registered previously under a different owner or maybe a different partner who owns the property.  Work is needed to drill into that data so we can get a proper understanding of how the rent pressure zones are working.<\/p><p>If we look at HAP, the recommendation from the joint committee was for 50,000 new homes in social housing stock.  That is something we can now do because of the additional &euro;500 million that was secured in budget 2018 under the capital plan.  Obviously, however, 50,000 is the number of new homes going into the social housing stock.  This implies that another mechanism will be needed to look after people on the housing list to get them into secure tenancies.  That is the purpose of HAP.  If we look at the top rents - Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire were mentioned in this regard - and how high they are, this is why we introduced the homeless HAP.  This is why they are so high there.<\/p><p>If the choice is for someone to fall into emergency accommodation or for us to pay more to keep that person in said accommodation, then we will pay more.  It is a bit of a Hobson's choice in one way.  It is not a choice that we would not necessarily like to have to make.  While we do not have the stock - we do not have it because Rebuilding Ireland is a five-year plan - we are reliant on the private rental sector.  Rather than having the disruption, the distress and the crisis that would pose for the person or the family falling into homelessness and emergency accommodation, we use the homeless HAP as a preventative measure and as an exit measure to keep people in their homes.  This means we have to pay more.  That is where we are at the moment because of legacy issues around the outsourcing of responsibility for social issues made by previous Governments.  We are now taking those responsibilities back.<\/p><p>According to the report that was provided, 20% are benefiting from the flexibility that is in HAP to extend the payments.  That is actually quite low given what is actually happening in the private  rental sector and inflation of rents in part of the country.  It is being presumed that will escalate and HAP is doomed because it will eventually reach a point where every payment is at 100% in terms of the flexibility.  However, that is not the case as we increase our social housing stock.  If we look at the figures for 2017, an additional 2,000 more homes were brought into the stock of social housing than we had planned for in the year.  I think it is a 40% over what was planned, 7,000 homes in social housing stock.<\/p><p>As we exceed those types of numbers and targets, it means that more people will be benefitting from social housing stock than from HAP placements.  As we get to 2020 and 2021, on the existing timeline, which might be brought forward if we work as well in 2018 as we did in 2017, we will be placing more people into the social housing stock than will be relying on HAP for their tenancies.  It does not necessarily imply then that 20% differential is only going in the one direction. <\/p><p>In regard to the question on-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#G00500","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":938,"content":"<p>I am going to stop the Minister there because we are over the six and half minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#G00600","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":939,"content":"<p>I will come back to those final questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#G00700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":940,"content":"<p>We will be going around again.

On Pillar 5, I am disappointed that there has not been a publication of a vacant homes strategy.  The Minister has decided to do rolling announcements of policy changes but a considerable amount of work was done by both us and external bodies in order to make submissions.  A considerable body of work was also done by Minister's officials and his predecessor.  Having a vacant homes strategy would facilitate us in tracking progress, or otherwise, by the Department.  While the information we have on this sheet is welcome, it is not the same.  Would he reconsider the publication of a strategy, in some shape or form, in order that we would be able to track progress?<\/p> <p>  The one point on which I would disagree with the Minister is that thousands of properties are available.  There may not be ten of thousands of them, but there are thousands.  It is important we have a clear and coherent strategy to tackle those.  Has the idea of introducing a vacant property tax or a vacant unit tax been dropped completely or is that still being considered?  I might have missed this at the start of the meeting but can the Minister confirm on the record the total number of repair and lease and buy and renew properties that have been bought into stock in order that we have those numbers?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the planning exemptions, while I acknowledge that we will debate them briefly later today, some of us have a particular concern about them.  We all want to see a quicker turn around of above-the-shop commercial units into residential units and, therefore, there is no objection to that in principle.  However, some of us have deep concerns about how a statutory instrument will ensure compliance and would not facilitate some unscrupulous property owners from converting units into very small and unacceptable units of accommodation that might have fire safety risks in particular.

Regarding the vacant homes strategy, the fact that the document has not been published does not mean that there is not a strategy.  It is one of the first things that landed on my desk when I was appointed as Minister.  This is no reflection on the people who put it together but I was not happy with the document.  I wanted to get the teams up and running and rather than taking that piece of work and putting it out for public consumption, my direction to the officials was to get people into the unit in the Department, get them into the local authorities and for us to get a proper appreciation of what is this number actually.  The desktop exercise that had been run at the time told us that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figure was nowhere near what we thought we were talking about.  I am not sure if the Deputy was here for the earlier engagement I had with Deputy Casey on this issue, but I will give some of the numbers again as they might be useful.<\/p> <p>  The strategy is in place.  We have the unit in my Department and the local authorities are doing their work to identify the actual level of vacancy that might be there.  I will give a few brief examples.  If we consider South Dublin County Council, the CSO said there were just under 3,500 properties vacant and the geodirectory brought that down to 609.  The local authority estimated a vacancy rate of 250.  It went for a targeted pilot inspection and it found the real level of vacancy to be about 56.  That is a huge drop.  We are talking about a demand area, a property that is vacant and one that the council considers might actually be liveable.  Each of the local authorities is experiencing that problem, namely, that the number we have is way off what we think it should be.  One item of work we are doing involves the data analyst group working with the CSO to see if we can come to an agreed definition of what vacant actually means for the purposes of trying to get vacant homes back into use and then to see if we can do an analysis looking at a couple of areas to see what the true level might be.<\/p> <p>  People say that even if it is 10% of the CSO number, which would be 17,000 or 18,000 homes, it is worth pursuing, but it is nowhere near 10%.  Is it thousands of homes?  I am not so sure of that when we look at high demand areas.  Obviously some local authorities in places like Donegal have identified vacant homes and they have gone to the banks and bought the homes or have pursued certain strategies because it has been useful for them to do so.  However, in the high demand areas where we thought there was going to be this low-hanging fruit, I am not sure it is there.  That said, the teams continue to do their work and to drill down.  It will be a question for some local authorities as to how much time they spend trying to pursue a vacant home that could be brought back into use as against trying to get new homes built, but the work is being done.  When we have a better idea of what the actual number is and what could be achievable from it, we will look to see how we will publish that and what work we would do off the back of that.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the introduction of a vacant property tax, that idea has not been dropped.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has set up a group to examine that issue to ascertain exactly how it might work.  The difficulty is to know what we might be taxing.  What the local authorities said to me in relation to this at a summit on Monday was that vacancy could be quite a fluid thing.  Obviously we are not talking about properties between lettings or properties for sale, but a vacant property might be vacant only for a short period and by the time we get it on to the register, it might then back off the register.  There are difficulties around this, and there is also a difficulty about taxing something when we do not know what it is and what is the amount.  Both the work that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is doing and the work we are doing separately will go towards informing the potential for a vacant property tax, but it comes back to the point I made to Deputy Casey at the beginning of the meeting that vacant homes are not the low-hanging fruit that we thought they were.  We have to build new homes and supply is key, but we also have to manage our existing stock efficiently.  A huge amount has been done by local authorities regarding their own vacant stock but vacancy in the private sector is not what we thought it was even six or seven months ago.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the repair and leasing scheme and buy and renew properties, at the end of 2017, some 347 properties had been deemed suitable by local authorities under the repair and lease scheme, 226 properties were being inspected for suitability, 31 agreements to lease had been signed and only nine dwellings were operational.  Obviously that is far below the targets that we set for ourselves.  We are publishing today the changes that we have made to the repair and lease scheme, which were outlined at the housing summit to local authority chief executives under the buy and renew scheme, and I will get the Deputy that number in a moment.<\/p> <p>  In regard to exempted developments and how we will ensure compliance, there will always be unscrupulous people and we have seen that with landlords - we should not call them landlords, rather we should call them criminals.  What we are trying to achieve with exempted developments is to bring back into use above shops units and we all know them in our towns villages and city centres.  Exempted development is one aspect of this and we need to be clear on what is exempted and allow an efficiency in terms of timelines for the above shop units to be converted into a residential property.  <\/p> <p>  Regrading all the different certifications they will need, work is currently being done by a group that is due to conclude very shortly as to what certifications will be needed and how they will be complied with.  Obviously, traditionally, we are taking about buildings that are not new builds, so there will be different standards for different types of buildings, but we have to make sure that it is safe for them to be inhabited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#H01900","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":974,"content":"<p>This is a genuine question but would it not have been better to include those certification requirements in the statutory instrument because a concern we have is that the statutory instrument is silent on the issue of compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#H02000","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":975,"content":"<p>Can that be clarified?

It is something we had hoped to see progress on.  The Bill I put before the committee sought to address it.  As a previous speaker has said, and as I said in a communication to the Minister when I became aware of it yesterday, the statutory instrument does not go as far as I had hoped.  The Minister is saying it cannot; he is saying he is merely exempting conversion developments of up to nine units from planning permission and he is saying it is subject to existing building control measures.  Is there a streamlining of the various certification authorities within the local authorities to provide the exemption in a manner that meets the demand in the marketplace and will allow these properties to come into use more quickly than is the case?  In the absence of clear certification models or improvements, I do not know if that is possible.  If it is the case, I do not see the need for that statutory instrument to be brought forward at this stage when we do not have clarification on the other matter.<\/p> <p>  I apologise again to the Minister for not being here on Tuesday when the Minister of State, Deputy English, brought this before the committee.  I had to attend a conference as others had and when I became aware of the content of the statutory instrument I made the Minister aware of my concerns in writing.

I appreciate the call I got from the Department to go through it with me but I still requested that the Business Committee schedule a debate because the issues are important.  I appreciate it agreed to that debate which will take place today.  I will leave that aside.  The key thing is it is a good idea but we need to ensure enforcement.  If we do not have enforcement of standards we could have a problem and it could be abused.  That is the key area.  I will move on from that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister produced the numbers who had their housing needs met in 2017.  He includes in those figures 17,916 HAP tenancies and 910 RAS tenancies.<\/p><p>The vast bulk of the people which the Minister, Deputy Murphy, claims to have met the housing needs of are in RAS and HAP.  Does the Minister think he should acknowledge that is misleading?  They have not had their housing needs met.  An example I used in the D&aacute;il, just one but I have loads, referred to Gemma, a mother of two, in college, working, and who got a HAP tenancy last February.  In April the landlord pulled out of the agreement.  Gemma found herself living in a hotel with a four year old  and two year old.  She stayed there until September when she could not bear it and her kids needed to go back to school.  She is now living with her grandmother, her three uncles and her aunt.  Eight people and four generations are living in a two bedroom house in Glasthule.  <\/p><p> She is down in the Minister's figures as having her housing need met.  It is nonsense.  Stop doing that.  It is misleading people.  Is the Minister going to do that with HAPs?  Stop describing HAPs as a solution which has met anybody's housing needs.  It clearly has not.  Supplementary to that, I refer to the housing list.  People who get HAPs tenancies, which are precarious in the extreme, are taken off the housing list.  That means that we are manipulating the housing list figures because the housing list will look as if it has gone down.  However, it has not gone down because these people are in precarious HAP tenancies.  I want the Minister to acknowledge that point.  I believe that people who are in HAPs tenancies should stay on the list.  I ask for that change.  <\/p><p>  Anything else is misleading as to what is going on.  I am not saying some people.  I heard the Taoiseach come back in response to me and say HAPs suits some people and some people would prefer to stay in HAPs.  Fine, if people are happy in HAPs, happy days.  However, for huge numbers of people it is precarious and it is not a permanent housing solution.  What we need are permanent housing solutions, particularly for families with kids who have been in and out of rent allowance, RAS, and HAPs.  This is happening to so many of these families.  They just cannot take it anymore.  I am dealing with families who have just gone into a hub in the last two days in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  They have been through several of these kind of tenancies and now they are being pushed to go and find HAPS again.  They cannot take it anymore, their kids cannot take it anymore.  They are going back into another form of precarious housing rather than a permanent housing solution which means a council house.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.<\/p><p> Also, will the Minister clarify what exactly people are entitled to in terms of HAPs in areas where the average rents, as is the case in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and South Dublin, exceed the current HAP limits?  People feel like banging their head against the wall when they go into the council and they are faced with an eviction.  I have three new evictions in my office this week coming into force at the end of the month.  They are faced with homelessness, all of them families and they are told to go find HAPs.  What are people supposed to do?  There is nothing.  Then they have to fight with the council to see if the HAPS limit can be extended up, and be told that it cannot be extended because that is too far.  People have to be offered a solution when they go into the council as to what they are supposed to do in these situations or we need to do something to stop the flow into homelessness, that is their eviction.  <\/p><p> It has to be one or the other.  If people come into my office, or the Minister's office or whatever, and say they are going to be evicted on 31 January, they need to be offered something.  What is the Minister proposing to offer, given that rents in many areas, and certainly in mine, exceed the HAP limits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#J05200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and Deputy Boyd Barrett for his questions.  On the first point he made around the exempt regulations, enforcement of standards is key.  The Department has been doing work since before I came in to improve standards around the rental sector.  I refer to improving standards generally around what is being built and everything else.  I do not want to do anything that is going to undermine that progression towards better standards.  It is important that does not happen as we move to something that has not been addressed for far too long, and that is the management of the existing stock of buildings.

We are going to do that piece of work on enforcement.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the HAP payment, and the Deputy cited the numbers from 2017, it is not misleading to say that their housing needs have been met because that is how the HAP system was set up.  If we look at the more than 32,000 people on HAP, the vast majority are in stable tenancies and are happy to be in those tenancies.  We know that from the numbers.  There will always be individuals who are having difficulties with HAP as they will with anything, whether it is an individual who is not using HAP in the private rental sector and the different problems that will arise.

Obviously, it is pointing to a particular problem in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that other local authorities are not experiencing.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire's numbers seem to be higher than other areas.  We will have to look at what is happening there.  There are particular pressure points because of lack of supply in the market because it is a very desirable area to live.  The point of publishing this document was to give greater transparency over how exactly HAP is being used.  I am sorry if the Deputy has not had a chance to see it yet.  There is a lot of detail in it.  If the Deputy wants, we can go through it again.<\/p> <p>  I know as well that we cannot rely on HAP to meet our social housing needs for our citizens.  The joint committee recommended 50,000 homes go into the social housing stock.  We secured additional funding of &euro;500 million into the capital budget out to 2021 so we can achieve that goal from the committee.  Given the number of people on the housing list, we need another solution as well and that solution is the private rental sector and it is the HAP.  It is not misleading in terms of numbers because if a person uses the HAP payment that is meeting his or her housing need.  <\/p> <p>  People who are getting the HAP are able to use the transfer list.  We have numbers around the people who are availing of the transfer list as well.  It is important to note we have a commitment of &euro;6 billion to increase the stock of social housing.  Last year we came in 2,000 units above the target we anticipated bringing in, which I think is somewhere in the region of 40% above target.  That is very welcome.  As we get to 2020 and 2021, we will be placing more people into social housing stock than we will be relying on the HAP.  That is where this is going.  We cannot get there overnight though.  We do have a chronic undersupply of housing.  While we are making progress in the first 18 months, we do have to rely on the private rental sector.  That is why we brought in the homeless HAP as a preventative measure.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#K00800","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>I want to ask one question.

As the Minister said, the Joint Committee on Housing and Homelessness recommended 10,000 units per annum.  That was a very large target and is clearly not going to be met.  There are a few key issues.  One is the housing summit.  The Minister spoke to us last week about the importance of the housing summit.  He has set targets for the chief executives but we are not yet privy to them.  We should see them quickly.  I read in a number of local and national newspapers yesterday that some chief executives said they will not be able to deliver.  The committee does not know the targets but the chief executives are talking to the press, in two or three cases, suggesting there may be difficulties.  It is very loose language but it is nearly setting up the scene that it is not going to happen.  That is where we come in.  We must turn the screw.  I wish to hear about the targets.  When can the Minister release them to the committee?  We should have them.  More importantly, as I said the other day, there must be sanction.  I have heard the talk about the carrot-and-stick approach, the reluctance to do that and I accept what the Minister said.  However, this is about sanctions and the accountability gap.  The key word here is \"accountability\".  The Minister, the committee and the people who deliver the services locally have a role to play.  Everyone has a role.  How will we address accountability in the context of a failure to deliver?  What sanctions will be imposed?<\/p> <p>  The second issue is the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  The Sunday newspapers reported that NAMA said it is on course to clear its original &euro;32 billion debt this year and that the remaining surplus will be returned to the State.  There is a possible role for NAMA.  Nobody should rule it out.  NAMA is a focused organisation.  Yes, it has had difficulties and we have had problems with it in the past.  However, the possibility to which I refer should be considered.  Can NAMA deliver?  Can it use the capital it says it has, its expertise and, more importantly, the knowledge it has about real estate and the lie of the land, for want of a better phrase, in this country?  I wish to hear a response on that at some point.  It need not necessarily be today but I wish to flag it as a possibility.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is the local authority land that is lying idle, to use that horrible expression.  We hear there are land banks all over Dublin that belong to the local authorities, which have primary responsibility for the delivery of houses, and the authorities are doing nothing about it.  We must review the inventory.  I have been told there is an inventory and this committee needs a detailed inventory of all State lands, be they in health authorities, harbour port authorities or local authorities.  We must have a tracking system and accountability in the short, medium and long term for how these lands will be put into use.  In addition, as part of the lands inventory we must see what the zoning is on each site and whether the sites are serviced.  Let us get realistic and not be dreaming about pie in the sky.  With the land aggregation scheme, the local authorities are up to their oxters in debt and in servicing that debt.  They will never deliver houses in the short to medium term.  These are issues I am flagging for the Minister.  I am not expecting a response today.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is the Part 8 housing scheme.  I have asked about this previously, and I am asking again today, because it will assist our work.  We want to see an inventory or list setting out each of the Part 8 planning applications that exist.  Part 8 has a life.  It does not end but continues on and on.  We must see where the applications are across the 31 local authorities, why they are not delivering, if they are stuck in the pipeline somewhere and what they plan to deliver.  We should examine that and if there are difficulties, setbacks and blockages we want to know that.  It is all about integrity in data, streamlining and putting systems in place.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said in press commentary recently that the Government must take a direct role and must ensure it does not outsource all of the solutions to the private sector.  We want housing solutions and, personally, I do not have a hang up about who provides the houses or where they come from once we provide people with housing solutions.<\/p> <p>  The next issue is local government.  Each chief executive prepares a monthly report.  These reports exist and I have taken the time to look at them.  I am not sure if there is collaboration but each local authority presents a report to its elected members and I understand the reports are also sent to the Department.  I am not sure what the Department is doing but all the statistics and the key objectives are in the reports.  We need to find out about them.  There might be a case for extending the remit of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, in terms of the delivery of key objectives.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance affordable housing model in Poppintree in north County Dublin and the Ballymun project are good news.  This is a very good story.  I hear that housing associations are finding it very difficult to negotiate with housing and planning authorities to get sites and land, yet I referred earlier to all the idle land that is available.  The associations are delivering units, which is important.<\/p> <p>  I do not expect the Minister to deal with all of that today but I wish to share my concerns.  It goes back to the multifaceted approach to addressing the housing problem and finding solutions.  It has to be about increasing the social housing stock.  Direct provision of social housing must be a key element of it, although it is not the only one.  There is also the construction of private affordable housing, private affordable rental, social rental, homes for the elderly and the downsizing the Minister has discussed.  Rent to own is a viable option.  People want that option if it is good accommodation in the right locations.  Housing options for people downsizing, and the community around that, as well as student accommodation are required.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that it requires a multifaceted approach, as does the Minister and Rebuilding Ireland, but it is about delivery and accountability.  It is possibly about considering the idea of project managers to deliver targets and specific big projects that the Government and the relevant authorities put in place.  Then there is the issue of sanctions.  The accountability gap must be closed because it is all over the place, with sanctions if people do not deliver.  Finally, the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, is exceptionally good at his job.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, announced that he would lead the housing delivery unit.  That is a good idea.  It is the type of focus we need.  Perhaps the Minister will share with the committee in the coming weeks how that will be rolled out and what will the priorities in the context of the roll-out.<\/p> <p>  I do not expect the Minister to respond on those issues now but he might engage with the committee and provide it with feedback on them at an appropriate time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#L00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1051,"content":"<p>Regarding the housing summit, we will publish the targets quite quickly.  I wrote to local authorities at the beginning of the year to ask them to provide information regarding projects under way, what is in the pipeline and the various things they were thinking of doing.  We discussed that information as it was fed back in advance of the summit and at the summit to drill down into the numbers.  Over the next two or three weeks we will meet with the housing teams of each local authority to agree their targets for 2018, how they are going to meet them and to look beyond 2018.  However, the detail for 2018 is crucial to ensure, as the Senator mentioned, we drive that delivery.  I hope to publish that at the beginning of March and then we will probably move to quarterly publishing of the figures, so everybody can see what is happening, or is meant to happen, in each local authority area.  Through transparency, we will get the accountability on where we are falling down and what is not happening and, through that, we will get delivery.<\/p> <p>  I have set up a new project team, essentially for project management and under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy English, in the Department.  The team has visited eight local authorities in the past two weeks.  We have hired new staff to work with that group.  I also told local authorities at the housing summit that if they wish to hire new staff on the build side to help manage individual projects, they can charge that staff to the capital side of their budgets as well.  More resources are being provided because much of what is needed now is that key project management.  We will do it from the Department's side by working with the people in the local authorities to ensure we get delivery of sites.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, when we really put people under pressure and got into the weeds with the local authorities, we were able to deliver a significant increase in the number of units, getting them in place before the end of the year and getting families into them before Christmas.  That was welcome.<\/p> <p>  Regarding a potential role for NAMA, the heads of the legislation for Home Building Finance Ireland are due to be published shortly.  Home Building Finance Ireland will sit alongside NAMA because it is using some of its expertise to get competitive finance to non-NAMA debtors around the country.  Are there other potential roles for NAMA and some of the staff and their expertise?  I believe that there are, particularly as we look ahead to the national planning framework and some of the things we wish to do.  However, I made it very clear to local authorities last Monday that it is their responsibility to build new houses, get new schemes open and to work with housing bodies to bring about the delivery of social housing, which is ramping up quickly.  We are not taking that responsibility away from them.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about sanctions.<\/p><p>I understand the motivation behind that.  One could tell a local authority that if it does not meet its target, that it would be sanctioned by withholding money or whatever.  The difficulty is that if the local authority misses its target and one imposes a financial sanction, there is a question as to whether it will further undermine its ability to meet its targets.  On Monday, I told the local authority managers that if they had a target for their areas for 2018, they will have to plan for in excess of that target.  If they are to be sure of meeting their targets, they must build in risk or a buffer, so that rather than falling 8% below their target, they could ensure the targets are met or exceeded.  Rather than falling 8% below last year's target, they could ensure that this year, the target is met or exceeded on the build side.  It is important that we do that.  <\/p><p> Land is an incredibly important resource and potentially the most important we have.  Members may not have had the opportunity to look at the land map on the Rebuilding Ireland website.  One can click onto individual sites marked with a red house icon, and learn the site is serviced and its status with regard to readiness to build.  We will bring other State land into that plan, rather than just local authority land which is owned and zoned for housing, because a key component of the national planning framework is to become involved in these strategic pieces of land, whether in Dublin or the north quays in Waterford, for instance, to ensure we can deliver it according to the existing needs and future populations.  That is not only for housing needs but also commercial needs, including job creation, leisure amenities and so on.<\/p><p> Land debt continues to be an issue in certain areas.  I have spoken to some of the housing bodies about what they might achieve on certain pieces of land if local authorities made them available to them.  With debt over-hang on some pieces of land, that will not be possible and we are working on the matter.  <\/p><p> I have met the housing bodies in advance of the housing summit, as I did with the previous summit.  I regularly meet individual housing bodies about specific sites, but when I met them as a group, we discussed the issue of how, when we identify land for local authorities to build on - which we are doing and is one of the outcomes of this summit - that we also identify land that can be made available to housing bodies in order that they can have certainty about what they can do.  At the housing summit, we renewed that commitment that local authorities and housing bodies are partners in how we get homes built and meet the needs of people through social housing.  <\/p><p> The &Oacute; Cualann model has driven much of my thinking about the affordable purchase scheme.  I have met representatives from &Oacute; Cualann several times and met them very recently to go through some issues in either the last week or December or the first week of January.  We have published the income limits in the affordable purchase scheme that we are currently designing, which I want to bring to the committee to flesh out.  They are &euro;50,000 for an individual and &euro;75,000 for a couple.  We must now decide what other eligibility criteria might apply for applicants.  I want to do this soon.  The first schemes under the affordable purchase scheme will commence towards the end of the year so we have some time to do this but I want to ensure there are no delays on the local authority side.  The sooner we can give them clarity the better. <\/p><p> The Senator also asked -----  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#L00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1053,"content":"<p>I asked about the comprehensive report on the Part 8 housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#M00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>There is no problem about doing that and we will do so.

I have serious reservations on this.<\/p> <p>  The fast-track planning process was rushed through the D&aacute;il before Christmas last year and then it took another six months before the Minister took office and signed it into law.

Of that figure, a total of 33 schemes or 685 units have been waiting for more than two years.  The average scheme size is only 15.9 units.  The bureaucracy of going through the four-stage process is almost the same for one house as it is for 50 or 100 houses.  I do not think that we are getting value here and something must be done to address this and speed up the process.

As we come through this fast-track planning process, we need to understand why applications are successful and why they are not.  Approximately 14 strategic housing development applications are on hand which cover 1,977 houses, over 1,300 apartments and 1,400 student bed spaces, which is just under 5,000 in total.  In the consultation pre-application phase, there were 37 requests, totalling 8,700 homes and just under 5,000 student bed spaces.  Not all of those consultation pre-applications have gone to application stage.  At the last meeting on this, I was told there are about 4,000 to be submitted and the turnaround time for them is three months.<\/p><p>I have been discussing the skills issue with several people in the industry because there is a potential for a skills shortage, not just in housing building but infrastructure development across the country.  We have ambitious plans to invest tens of billions of euro in all sorts of infrastructure projects over the next ten years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, met with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, last week to discuss this area.  I have met with several groups which do skills training through different local authorities and schemes.  Although it would not normally come through my Department, I am looking at several proposals for additional funding to see how we can fund some of the schemes.  Those conversations are ongoing at the moment.<\/p><p>We are not talking necessarily about all of the skills and all the people we used to have in construction because of the amount done through prefabrication along with new innovations in construction methods and technology.  For example, rapid build, which has become the industry norm, one is able to build houses with far fewer people.  That does not mean that we are not going to always need people to finish these units on site with certain skills.  I visited one centre which had taken ten long-term unemployed people, and one person who was homeless, into a construction skills course, got them the skills and certified them.  Each person got a job within a week which shows the demand for these skills.  This work is happening but there are several more matters to be addressed.  We are engaging with the CIF to see what more can be done.  Again, it is not just relevant to my Department but to several.<\/p><p>I discussed Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, during our last engagement.  The heads of the Bill are being drafted and the timeline is to have the legislation introduced and passed later this year.  It will ensure we can begin funding later this year for non-NAMA debtors under the terms of the legislation.  This will be brought before the D&aacute;il by the Minister for Finance.  My Department obviously has a role in developing that legislation as it comes before the House.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>I have a growing concern about the delivery of affordable housing units.  I get information on LIHAF, local infrastructure housing activation fund, the &euro;25 million fund and the new proposal around an equity share from the Minister through parliamentary questions.  How many units will be delivered and at what price for both this and next year?  I am looking for an answer to those two simple questions every time I frame a parliamentary question on this issue.  I am sure the departmental staff pull their hair out when they see my questions because it is a lot of work.  However, I am not getting the answer to those two simple questions.  Will the Minister either answer these questions or admit he cannot answer them at this point and indicate when he can?  When I say prices, I do not mean an answer such as less than &euro;320,000.  I have given bands and I am going to keep on coming back.  I prefer not to waste the Department's time with freedom of information requests.  However, this reluctance to give us this information makes me all the more nervous about the delivery of affordable housing.<\/p> <p>  On the land initiative, the Minister knows the Sinn F&eacute;in Party does not like this model of delivery.  In good faith, however, we have engaged constructively with the two local authorities involved, in the absence of direct state funding for large-scale public housing developments.  Our councillors in the two local authorities in question are increasingly concerned that there will be no genuinely affordable units in these schemes.  Our difficulty is that it is going to be a red line for us come the final approval of which lands have to be disposed.  We are not looking to play politics with it but, again, we cannot get answers from managers on the number of units and the actual cost of units which could be affordable even at a general level.  I hope the Minister will shed some light on this.<\/p> <p>  I would more than welcome the opportunity to outline some suggestions for the affordable loan scheme criteria.

That is materially relevant to the deadline we all had to meet at 11 o'clock today for submissions on apartment standards.  When will the Minister publish those two studies in full?  We are hearing rumours of significant disagreement between the Department, the Housing Agency, and the construction industry professionals over the content of those?  Is there any truth to that?  Will the Minister explain the reason for the delay in the publication of these reports?<\/p> <p>  I do not want to get into a big row about social housing figures.  I am choosing my words carefully.  I do not accept the 7,000 figure, partly because it comprises 800 units which are leased and are not real social housing units as the majority of them are owned by private operators.  I have a concern about the build in terms of the speed and the increase in the final quarter.  We cannot judge that until we see the Q4 reports.  However, I am now convinced the void figure is not what we were led to believe or what we understood it to be.  There is a significant number of properties in that 1,700 figure which at the start of 2017 had a tenant.  They are not voids in the sense of how the scheme was originally designed.  Instead, they are expensive standard re-lets and above the cap.  We have to get some clarity on which are long-term voids, which we can genuinely say are additions to the stock, and which are expensive re-lets.<\/p> <p>  I welcomed the Minister's assurance at the last meeting and in parliamentary questions about approved housing body re-designation.  What does the Minister expect the impact on the fiscal space for 2018 will be and how will he manage it?  I welcome the reduction in all three categories of homelessness in the December figures.  I am vocal in my criticism when the figures go up.  I would like the Minister to know, however, that I am equally vocal in welcoming their reduction.  I also welcome the fact the Minister has changed his media strategy in how he releases those figures.  I hope he continues to do that, irrespective what the figures are over the next several months.  Will he consider adding a new metric on the length of time individuals and families are spending in emergency accommodation?  It would be useful.<\/p> <p>  I strongly suggest we stop using the term \"rapid builds\".  It is 12 months planning and approval and nine months construction which is marginally quicker on both ends than the standard build.  However, it is not rapid.

We have to make sure we get these numbers out, that they are published and that they are accurate numbers which people can stand over.  In regard to future reporting of numbers, work is going on in the Department to see how we can improve the numbers behind the numbers.  As they are published at the moment, these numbers are not really telling people anything - it is just a number one month and a number the next month, with no trends or background data.  Therefore, we are doing work around how we can improve the numbers.  I would have hoped it would be ready so we could begin our reporting for this year with that new framework, but it may not be.  It is never easy to try to come up with data sets and to be able to get into the numbers as quickly as we would like.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the 7,000 figure for stock, if we are entering into a long-term lease arrangement and we are the landlord, then we can say that is the stock of social housing because it is a secure tenancy for that person and is a very different situation from being in the private rented sector.  I believe we can count that in the stock of social housing.  We were very clear in the report, and when I published the figures for 2017, that this is what we were counting.  For the tenant who is living in that house, there is no difference as to whether the local authority built it or someone else did.  The landlord is the local authority or the AHB and the tenant has a secure tenancy for the lifetime of that lease arrangement.  It is important to point that out.<\/p> <p>  We had a lengthy discussion in regard to voids earlier in the committee session.  When we started the voids and vacancies programme, we were talking about homes that were boarded up and derelict.  Huge progress was made and thousands were brought back into use, although there are still some derelicts which are counted in our void numbers.  Eventually, there will not be a voids figure and we will just be talking about casual vacancies, where a property is empty for two or three weeks and is quickly turned around.  We do not have casual vacancies in our voids figures as matters stand.  We are talking about homes where, if a significant amount of money had not been put into them, they would be vacant today.  If I were to say to local authorities that properties have to be vacant for more than 12 months, we would be putting the wrong incentive into the system and there is a risk a local authority would keep a void vacant so it could then avail of that capital money after a 12-month period.  The figures for 2017 show our target was 766 whereas the output was 1,757, so it was 229% of our target, although this was actually down 551 units, or 24%, on 2016.  We are making huge progress on voids.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#O01500","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>I am not disputing that.

The Minister is correct that the level of refurbishment that is required is significantly in excess of a standard re-let but the work could be done in three or four months and it is then re-let.

The uptake of rapid-build housing is disappointing.  I always felt this was very much targeted at cities like Dublin, Cork and Limerick and that we needed more in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On the issues of homelessness and emergency homelessness, it is very disappointing that the rent pressure zones were not rolled out further as we are currently in an emergency housing crisis.  Carlow County Council has an average payment of &euro;537 every month whereas average rent for a house in Carlow is &euro;900 to &euro;1,000 a month.  This means that anybody on HAP or rent allowance has to come up with nearly &euro;500, which is not doable.  I know there is a hardship clause that might go up to &euro;700 but, even still, it is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>  On an issue I have raised with the Minister before, I am glad he has announced the mortgage programme.  I am a firm believer that mortgages should be given to people who do not qualify.  I have a  massive issue with the thresholds, in particular in my area, which has one of the lowest thresholds in the country at &euro;27,500.  I had three couples come in to me last week.  One couple works part-time and a person in another of the situations works full-time and would be taking in &euro;350 to &euro;400, which is an average income in rural areas.  These people were put on family income supplement, FIS, but they did not qualify to go on the housing list.  I have families coming in to me where one partner is working and the other stays at home to mind the child or is looking for work.  They are getting FIS but they do not qualify to go on Carlow County Council's housing list.  Do they give up work, go on the local authority housing list and get HAP and the &euro;600 a month?  This is where people are falling through the brackets and we are not seeing improvements.  The issue of rent pressure zones needs to be urgently addressed.<\/p> <p>  The Minister wants to improve policy in regard to victims of domestic violence.  There is no policy.  I can tell the Minister of cases where people have been victims of domestic violence.  They are homeless so they just fill out a normal homeless form but they are not put in any special category.  The policy is not working and it needs to be looked at.<\/p><p>Mental health is another problem.  I have had several cases of constituents who have mental health issues recently.  There is no special funding to help them, and I was told there would be.<br\/><br\/>The biggest area that needs to be worked on is the national awareness campaign that was rolled out for families and individuals worried about the risk of losing their homes.  I acknowledge the Minister is working with the campaign through the Citizens Information Board, but it is a massive issue.  A huge number of people do not know about this and are worried.  There is supposed to be a freefone number for tenants but people are unaware of it. <b><\/b>I ask the Minister to provide more help in this regard this year.  A woman contacted me recently who was crying and upset because she did not know where to go to get help.  She did not know what lines to use.  I tried to get her as much information as I could.  The Minister is trying to help but there is a lack of awareness and more information must be given in this regard.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has been working with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, on the crucial issue of notices.  People on rental schemes who get notice from their landlord deserve three or six months' notice at least, depending on how long the tenant has been in place.  We often speak about landlords in this committee.  There are good landlords but there are also landlords who do not do enough.  Rental accommodation must be inspected as people are living in places that definitely do not conform to health and safety standards and nobody is helping them.  I do not suggest that all landlords are like that as there are very good landlords but perhaps some are not in a position to fix their properties.  I have visited people in cases where I believe the local authority needs to step in.  There must be more accountability in that sector.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the establishment of a &euro;200 million local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  Every local authority needs to be accountable in this regard.  We need to build houses regardless of whether they are Part V homes or are privately built.  That is what is missing and every local authority needs to step up to the mark and be accountable for this because the &euro;200 million is a nice bit of money and the Minister can work through the local authorities and his Department to deliver houses.<br\/><br\/>On the facility to purchase newly-built houses through the local authorities for the approved housing bodies, AHBs, can the Minister give the local authorities more information on that scheme?  There are some good initiatives for the future but I believe the information is not going out correctly.  The Minister was talking about figures and giving out to the newspapers.  He should make sure everything goes out to the newspapers.  He has to create awareness, because people do not know what is going on.  They hear that there is no money for something but then hear the opposite from the local authorities.  I am asking that the Minister make an awareness campaign his priority going forward.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#O03200","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1116,"content":"<p>Rapid-build housing was initially brought in as a policy response in the context of homelessness but things have changed very quickly since then.  Rapid build has almost become the industry standard.  One of the things we discussed at the housing summit on Monday was the need to stop separating rapid and non-rapid builds in terms of local authority housing in our minds.  The local authority chief executives said to me that as rapid build will become the default, we should stop reporting it as something separate.  All developments should be proceeding as rapid builds and if they are not, we need to know why not and what reason a body would have for not using that type of construction.  We know it works and provides incredibly good quality and standard buildings.  It is a quicker way of ramping up delivery.<\/p> <p>  The legislation on rent pressure zones, RPZs, which effectively introduced rent caps in certain areas, is new.  We have reviewed its impact and how it is working, and that work is almost completed.  There are two qualifying criteria under which an area comes under the designation of an RPZ.  In the last quarterly report, no new area came under that designation.  I understand the point that some people make, that while rent inflation in four of the six previous quarters was above 7% in some places, it still does not get above the average rent of the country because certain parts of the country, such as Dublin, increase the average.  I hear those points.

We do not want people to feel that they are worse off because they are working.  These are the kinds of traps we try and avoid in designing policies.  We are looking at the income limits issue.<\/p> <p>  As for victims of domestic violence, I had a meeting with the Homeless Network, the alliance of NGOs, last week.  It was the first time a Minister has attended that meeting.  It was a very constructive meeting because of all the different bodies and NGOs that were there, including those which meet the needs people have due to health care issues or domestic violence, among others.  They also face the same challenges everyone else faces in terms of rent and housing.  We had a very good exchange of views on certain things that need to be done, and we are taking those on board at the minute. <\/p> <p>  Prevention is key for 2018.  We have brought in additional emergency beds and supports.  We have the homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, and we exceeded our targets in that area last year.  These things are working but we must now make a concerted effort to keep people in their homes until such time that the stock of social housing and housing generally is much greater.  We will need 2018 to do that.  There is a big piece of work to be done this year under Rebuilding Ireland to build on the good work that was done in 2017.  Prevention is a focus of mine.  <\/p> <p>  The RTB has carried out a number of focused outreach programmes using social media channels and other methods to make people aware of their rights regarding rental increases and so on and it has given us good feedback on the engagement it has had on that.  There is a new provision for when a notice of termination is served by a landlord to his or her tenants.  The landlord now must also notify the RTB when that happens.  We are progressing that provision, in that the legislation is on the priority list for publication in the first half of this year.  The change management programme we spoke about earlier is coming online as well. <\/p> <p>  By 2021 a quarter of all properties will be inspected.  That means that if one has a property, it will be inspected every four years.  If the property is leased out or comes under the HAP, it is inspected more quickly than that.  In general, however, local authorities take a risk-based approach to this.  We have asked them to refine that approach and use things like social media to identify those properties.  Printouts from Facebook were brought to my attention during the course of some of the debates last year.  As some of the advertisements were presented in a foreign language such as Portuguese, translators are required to try to identify properties.  We are also looking at ways in which technology can help us carry out a first pass on a property voluntarily.  These are some of the conversations that are happening in the background at the moment.  We want to make better use of existing technology to help us expedite the number of inspections that happen.  Under the forthcoming legislation, we are looking at the area of rogue landlords who really are criminals and the type of sanctions that will fall upon them where they are putting the lives of people living in their properties at risk, that is, where they are basically abusing people's human rights.  That work is progressing in the Department at present. <\/p> <p>  On the LIHAF funding, the initial investment fund was &euro;200 million.  In budget 2018, I secured agreement for an additional &euro;50 million.  We have signed agreements under LIHAF 1 worth almost &euro;200 million.  There is an agreement which is about to be struck which will bring us to just below the &euro;200 million.  As we actually allocated &euro;226 million, we over-allocated to make sure we hit the &euro;200 million target and we are almost about to hit that target.  A couple of schemes have fallen out.<\/p><p>I will very soon issue a call for submissions to LIHAF 2.  I informed local authorities of that fact at the housing summit and told them to get projects ready.  Some projects that were unsuccessful in the context of LIHAF 1 might have been close to acceptance and should be resubmitted to the Department.  A few projects that for various reasons were not completed under LIHAF 1 might come under LIHAF 2 as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#P00400","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1120,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting the Minister.

It is somewhat incredible that an affordable mortgage scheme operating in tandem with local authorities is not currently in existence.  Earlier in the week, the Minister announced a scheme that local authorities will have to administer through their staff but which relates to private rather than public or publicly built housing.  I wish to ask him about the latter because this is the first opportunity for members to so do.<\/p> <p>  People around the country were somewhat gobsmacked at the suggestion by the Taoiseach relating to how people might raise deposits to be able to participate in the scheme.  I refer, for example, to someone putting together a deposit of &euro;30,000 for a property in Dublin.  He outlined four ways for people to do so: leave the country to work; ask the bank of mammy and daddy for a bailout; borrow the money, which I thought was illegal because one is not meant to borrow for a deposit but, rather, raise the deposit and then have a 90% loan; or stay at home for a few years and live with their parents.  What is the Minister's view on those comments?  All members know that the most recent census showed that up to half a million people under 30 were stuck at home with their parents because of the housing crisis.  Parents are faced with the choice of packing off a child to Australia or keeping one in Ireland.  It is incredible that the Government has prioritised a scheme for private housing, which is currently unaffordable.  The Minister announced a scheme that forces people to participate in unaffordable private housing rather than an affordable mortgage scheme utilising public lands, for which many people have been waiting for a long time and which councils used to offer.  What is the Minister's next plan?<\/p> <p>  I met the management of Fingal County Council to discuss the landbank north of Wellview in Damastown.  I hope those officials have raised that matter with the Minister.  For that scheme to work, a portion of it would be social housing but if the Minister wants the famous mix of tenure that is so often talked about, an affordable mortgage scheme must be introduced that would allow the council to get those houses built and let people buy them through an affordable mortgage.  If that was done, rather than young or older people being forced to spend &euro;320,000 on houses in Blanchardstown or elsewhere, they could buy them for &euro;165,000 or &euro;170,000, certainly less than &euro;200,000, and make mortgage repayments of &euro;600 to &euro;700 per month.  That is possible and a reality.<\/p> <p>  People have mentioned the &Oacute; Cualann scheme, which is very welcome because it shows that if it can be done there, it can be done elsewhere.  However, councils have landbanks.  The &Oacute; Cualann scheme is illustrative of what is possible but I would not choose that model because I think the council should hire a contractor.  It is obvious that direct build is not currently an option because of understaffing but councils should hire a contractor and pay a set price to build houses rather than giving away land to a private developer.  In the case of &Oacute; Cualann, there is no particular profiteering by the developers but there are issues with provision and the scale thereof.  When is the Government going to bring in such a scheme with local authorities or what is its plan in that regard?  We need real affordable housing rather than subsidising people to go in search of unaffordable housing on the private market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#Q00300","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1122,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Coppinger.  I appreciate the opportunity to clarify some points on the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, which it is not solely for private houses.  Local authorities have previously given out mortgages but this scheme is different because it offers a very low fixed rate over the lifetime of the loan, which is quite exciting.  It is linked to net disposable income and the ability of a borrower to afford the repayments.  One of the examples we gave of how the scheme would operate concerned a couple earning &euro;75,000 who have a 10% deposit.  Their repayments over a 25-year mortgage for a house with a purchase price of &euro;320,000 would never be more than 24% of their income, which is incredible.

As regards the Deputy's point that the scheme will be used to purchase unaffordable houses, between January and the end of October 2017 more than two thirds of houses purchased by first-time buyers in the Cork, Galway and greater Dublin areas cost less than &euro;320,000, which is the relevant cap on the scheme.

She stated that houses will be unaffordable for such people under this scheme.  I am saying that under the scheme such people will be able to afford these houses, as evidenced in the example I gave, whereby the repayments of that couple would be less than one quarter of their income.  That is affordable in that context.  Some 91% of homes outside the Cork, Galway and greater Dublin areas purchased by first-time buyers in 2017 up to the end of October cost less than the relevant &euro;250,000 cap for the mortgage scheme.  That is why this product will be beneficial.<\/p> <p>  As regards what the Taoiseach said, he was simply stating a matter of fact.  People get help from a number of different sources to put together deposits.  He did not get such assistance when purchasing his house and was making the point in the context of the Government not wanting a return to 100% mortgages because of how dangerous they are and how they helped to destroy our economy.  Under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, one can use the help-to-buy measure that was previously introduced or prove savings of 3% and verify a gift of 7%.  There is flexibility in the scheme to ensure that people are able to avail of it, which is what we want.<\/p> <p>  The first tranche of available funding is &euro;200 million, which will allow approximately 1,000 people to avail of the scheme.  As that draws down to approximately &euro;50 million, the Housing Finance Agency will go back to the market to secure an additional fund which will probably be administered on a slightly higher interest rate likely to be at 2.25% for the 25-year rather than 30-year product.  That will be kept under review to monitor its success.  The current mortgage market in Ireland is worth approximately &euro;99 billion, while the local authority mortgage market is in the region of &euro;1 billion.  The &euro;200 million available under this scheme is only a fraction of the overall market but it will grow if successful and as it grows we will make changes to its administration, depending on feedback.  People will be able to apply for loans under the scheme from 1 February.  One day after the call centre opening we had to double the number of staff because of the level of interest that was shown.  The number of website hits was told to me last night and although I cannot remember it off the top of my head I think one quarter of hits were return visitors.

At the moment the house prices are capped.

My statement goes into some of the details for the affordable purchase scheme that might not have been covered in the newspapers because, naturally enough, they fixated on this new product of a lifetime - a fixed rate mortgage - which does not exist in today's market.  In budget 2018, I confirmed funding for 2018 and 2019 of &euro;25 million for a serviced site programme.  I also secured an additional &euro;15 million for the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF 2, which will build on the &euro;200 million from LIHAF 2.<\/p> <p>  With those two measures together, as well as some of the existing large sites we have, particularly in Dublin like the O'Devaney and Poolbeg sites, we will have this affordable purchase scheme that will be the qualifying criteria to enter into homes under those three different pieces at present.  We also have the affordable-to-rent scheme, which is cost rental but there are a couple of innovative things happening in other parts of the country.  For example, I refer to the build-to-rent stuff into which Cork is getting involved and which also was mentioned in my press release that is available on the website.  <\/p> <p>  The affordable purchase scheme will have the same income qualifying criteria as the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  They do not have to work together but they can work together if people want them to.  Annual gross income cannot exceed &euro;50,000 for a single applicant and &euro;75,000 for a couple.  We need to now decide what other qualifying criteria should apply.  We can look at the &Oacute; Cualann model.  I have met officials from the organisation on at least two occasions and we have considered its qualifying criteria.  People might think the criteria are too restrictive but that is a piece of work we need to do.  Earlier, Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about feeding some ideas into that and I believe that would be more than welcome.  My Department does not have a monopoly on wisdom in terms of what the best scheme might be.  Everyone has different experiences from their own local authorities as to what qualifying criteria might or should apply.  The scheme will use land that is owned by the State.  It will also use finance as well, potentially, to buy new land if we need to do so.  My Department and local authorities attended the housing summit.  On that occasion we asked them to begin to identify sites that have not already been identified for affordability in order that we can start to plan.  We expect the first houses to be built under this scheme to commence construction towards the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  As for the potential cost of a house, I gave an example that is included in my statement on the website.  A house that cost &euro;250,000 might actually be sold for &euro;200,000 and then the equity stake will be taken by the local authority.  If one looks at the &Oacute; Cualann model, some of its houses were for sale for a price as low as &euro;170,000.  We can achieve the same with the affordable purchase scheme but that will depend on what cost factors went into the site in question.  Not all of the &Oacute; Cualann houses were sold for such a low price.  Of course, the price will also depend on the size of the house, the number of bedrooms and everything else.  It will depend on each scheme.  We are talking about an affordable purchase scheme as most of us would understand it.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#R00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1140,"content":"<p>The Minister has gone well over time and I call Deputy Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#R00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance.  I do not wish to go over old ground considering the questions that have been asked and the answers that have been forthcoming.  I simply seek information from the Minister and his officials to measure the success of the future but to measure any success or failure that we have seen in recent years.  To that end, I welcome the efforts to ensure there is transparency regarding the targets that will be set and the ability of the Department and local authorities to deliver.<\/p> <p>  I seek a spreadsheet, if possible, that outlines how many people were on the housing waiting list for each local authority on 1 January 2016 and, during the course of the year, how many houses were constructed by the local authority, how many houses were constructed for the local authority in co-operation with approved housing bodies, how many properties were purchased by the authority, how much land the local authority had in stock at the beginning and the end of the year and what was the waiting list at the end of 2016.  I would like the same data for 2017.  When we see the targets for 2018, we will be able to put a bit of shape and background on those targets, thus allowing us a better opportunity to measure performance and whether it has been enhanced and improved.  Perhaps such data would help us to identify the failures of the conventional system as we know it over the past number of years.  <\/p> <p>  I am sure the frustration that is evident among my constituents and throughout my constituency is replicated throughout the country.  Irrespective of the arguments we might have about figures, data and statistics, no community in my constituency has seen the Government or local authority construct homes for those who cannot provide or afford them in their own communities.  When I consult my constituents, that is their response, that is the reality and that is what is reflected in their views to me.  I need a simple concise mechanism that will allow me to report back to them, as is my duty and privilege, as to how taxpayers' money, the Government and the parties in government are working with the Department and with those who are charged with the responsibility to deliver within local authorities to deliver to those poor unfortunates.  I do not use that term lightly.  I share, as do we all, the terrible frustration of meeting the same people for the past number of years in our constituency offices and not being in a position to help despite the record achievements in recent years with regard to having got our finances back in shape and despite having record levels of income and revenue coming into the State.  The Government now has an opportunity to prioritise how that money is spent and that is the greatest issue that faces society, the economy and the country.  We can all agree on how the Government is handling Brexit.  We can all, to some extent, agree on taxation measures, the universal social charge and so forth.  However, we have not reached agreement on how to tackle housing.  We have been told that money is no obstacle when it comes to resolving this issue but it is not.  I need to simplify for myself and my constituents what happened in recent years and how the situation will be improved immediately.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#R00500","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Cowen's commitment to transparency, which I am trying to bring about in my own work.  It is good that we are able to publish indicative targets for 2017, and publish them so quickly, that we can confirm with our quarterly construction report that includes all of the figures we have published for 2017.  We need to be able to measure what we are doing and what local authorities are doing.  That is why I want to publish the targets for 2018 quite clearly for every local authority in order that everyone - both the public and the public representatives - can see exactly what is expected of them so we can achieve those targets.  Recently, the Minister of State, Deputy English, published the social housing needs assessment for 2017.  The report showed a small decrease, which is welcome.  Off the top of my head, I think the decrease was between 6% and 7%.  There was a decrease in almost every local authority area.  Of course we need to do more.<\/p> <p>  My focus for 2016 is to get an accurate understanding of what was completed in the private and local sector in that year but also what was completed in 2017 because it is one figure that we not have.  It is very important in terms of judging progress over the lifetime of the Rebuilding Ireland programme, which extends to 2021.  My data analyst group is focusing on that aspect at present.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy talked about identifying the failures of the conventional system.  Many of them have been identified.  The conventional system is not the same system that existed pre-crash.  Many changes have happened in terms of the new one-stage process.  We introduced a new four-stage process that has been sweated down to 59 weeks.  We have a new procurement framework for rapid build and rapid build has become our default in terms of what we do.  We are using a shared services model when it comes to planning for public private partnerships, planning and design and procurement from the rapid framework, which is very important.<\/p><p>The shared services model is working very well and is progressing in other areas.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke about the need for a national turnkey campaign.  Turnkeys have been very successful for local authorities and we will progress a national turnkey campaign during 2018.  I have spoken about this with local authorities, the County and City Management Association and other groups, as an effective means of delivery for our local authorities.<\/p><p> We have a new land management unit that will drive delivery.  The money is there in the form of the &euro;6 billion.  Even when we were racing ahead of our targets in 2017, I was able to secure additional funding that went to delivery in 2017 for house completions and regeneration projects, along with some of the family hub accommodation we delivered for those people who were in emergency accommodation in hotels.  The money is being spent and it is delivering houses.  This is seen in the numbers we have for 2017.<\/p><p> When we talk about economic recovery and how we achieve it, as each of us meet with our constituents it is important that we talk about the changes and the changed approach we took to the taxation system and the tax base, the moving of some of the credits and some of the discounts, so the tax base was not too narrow.  We also focused on increasing the number of people in employment with the Action Plan for Jobs.  This five-year plan was aimed at increasing the numbers of jobs - I cannot remember by how many but it may have been 100,000 - and in the first two years, people wondered if it would actually work.  In the third, fourth and fifth years they saw the benefit of the action plan and what it actually meant in the context of overachieving on our targets.  We had the same approach in the context of Rebuilding Ireland, which is also a five-year programme.  We are 18 months in to that plan and we are already exceeding almost all of our targets, which is very welcome.<\/p><p> As we build new homes, we have to do so in a sustainable way that does not erode the tax base for the future.  This means that we cannot just build thousands of homes all over the place.  It also means that we cannot just say \"If it is a supply-side measure, then we must pursue it.\"  In pursuing that, we may be building in serious crises for the future.  We must maintain this balance.  All of the data on what has been achieved for 2016 have been published.  We will now publish the figures for 2017.  My focus is on the future and on getting things built.

I have the floor.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Department and the Minister for facilitating a meeting with the committee last Thursday when a huge amount of data, information and clarification was given to the committee.  I thought that we had teased all of them out last week.  Since Rebuilding Ireland was introduced, this committee has been afforded an unbelievable amount of data and construction statistics.  That information is  always available to the committee.  I want it recognised that everything has been put on the table and has been made very clear to the committee.  Some members may pick it up differently to others, but people are always available to clarify matters for us.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions about performance indicators within local authorities.  Will we gauge certain local authorities against each other?  If one authority is not providing the same level as a similar local authority, are there sanctions that can be imposed?  The Minister said that under capital funding in local authority budgets they can take on staff for project managers.  Are local county managers aware of this and if so why are they not doing it in areas where we are aware of massive landbanks and where we know we can deliver vast amount of lands.<\/p> <p>  I hugely welcome the affordable mortgage scheme.  It is another piece of the jigsaw of Rebuilding Ireland.  We have all been waiting for such a measure and I do not know why we had to wait for it.  Can local authorities come forward with affordable schemes of their own under that banner, such as the rent-to-buy model that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown councillors have pushed for.  Councillors John Bailey, Shane O'Brien and Michael Merrigan brought a cross-party proposal to their local authority with a rent-to-buy model that is very suitable for a local authority such as  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and for south County Dublin, where there is huge demand.  Will these proposals be looked at in totality?  Where local authorities have ownership of extremely valuable properties, the purchase prices of those properties and the costs associated with turning them into social housing is not good value.  Eight properties could be purchased elsewhere for same the cost as turning these protected structures into four units, for example.  I can provide the details of such a case after the meeting.<\/p><p>Can local authorities sell properties like that and ring-fence that money and use it then to purchase properties under Part 5?  I think there is a misconception around that and I would like clarification on that.  Can I also ask about the delivery office?  How often does it meet?  I am glad to see that pressure is now going to be put on particular local authorities where there are vast amounts of lands.  It might be the runner in me but I do not accept excuses.  We are hearing excuses that it is water or it is road infrastructure but local authorities have the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and they have not drawn it down.  Why have they not come in with a solution regarding those sites?  If they have not drawn it down, why have we not taken this funding from them and given it to a local authority that will use it?  It is about building the houses where people need them, and we need to put serious pressure on local authorities to deliver.  We know that some local authorities are delivering, but there are some that are not delivering to the same level.<\/p><p> Can I finish up by saying thank you again for the amount of information that has been given to us?  Department officials have made themselves available to a number of committee members at all times when they have asked for clarification of data or statistics, and the information has always been transparent and on the table for us to digest at this committee.  There has never been any attempt to hide any data from this committee and I want to put that on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#S03700","speaker":"1246","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1181,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for her compliments in regard to the Department and the staff who do a huge amount of work.  I think they have been engaging very positively with members of the committee even when I cannot do so.  Sometimes we will have testy exchanges, which I understand, but, by and large, the committee and the Department work very well together.  We are all trying to work to the same objectives.  In regard to the performance indicators for local authorities, local authorities will have different needs, and different things they will need to do.  Obviously, some are working much better than others, and that is very clear.  It comes back to the exchange Deputy Cowen and I just had.  Obviously, local authorities are coming from a very low base because of what happened previously in the economy and obviously many of them are not yet hitting the kind of targets that we want them to hit.  I am not trying to give the impression that all is good with the local authorities in terms of this form of delivery.  The purpose of the housing summit is how we actually implement Rebuilding Ireland and how we make sure that we can hit our targets and get this work done and publishing the targets for 2018 could be very useful in that context.  The local authorities will have different requirements, depending on the demands they have.  As we publish the targets, some will be using other streams more than others.  Some will still use the acquisitions stream because they will not necessarily be competing with  young couples and families as they will not be high demand areas.  However, they will believe there are properties on their books that can achieve value for money and can be delivered as social housing.  Some will do more through acquisitions, for example, than through build, but we want to make sure that what they are getting is new houses into the social housing stock that are secure tenancies for the tenants in them.<\/p> <p>  In regard to staff under the capital budget, I informed local authority managers of this on Monday, that they can book staff to that budget.  The examples always given to me are that if they had just one more person to drive a particular project, which is a large scheme, they could get it done within the 59 weeks.  We want to make sure that they can do that, and that will allow them to do so.<\/p> <p>  Under the affordable purchase scheme and the cost-rental model, we want local authorities to be more pro-active with their land, and tell us where they think that they can help us get above the ambitious targets we have set for ourselves and above the land we have already identified and the money that has already been put aside.  This is a co-operative partnership.  The Department works with the local authorities to get these things done.  There was a wide-spread welcome for these new schemes.  For example, a local authority might be engaging in a contract with a developer on a turnkey site and the developer has the capacity to build 50 but the local authority may only want 30.  The affordable side now opens it up the idea of going for the whole site.  That means it can sign the contract and the builder can start works, knowing what is going to happen.<\/p> <p>  The delivery office is a new unit, so it is not a question of when it meets.  It is constantly working.  The delivery unit is working with the local authorities and with the new staff.  We also have the new land management group which the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, is leading.  I believe I said earlier that it has facilitated each local authority in the first two weeks of this year.  That is about them identifying the kinds of snags referenced in regard to Irish Water and other problems, such as a site not progressing to the timelines.  What are the issues?  Is there an issue around the bond, the developer or around some enabling infrastructure?  How do we untangle that quickly?  Delivery is all about having people allocated to particular projects and sitting on them, and driving them home.  That is a piece of work we know we need to do now.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the LIHAV contracts, almost all of those have been agreed but a few fell out.  We had over-allowed in terms of the financial resources of &euro;226 million, in the hope that we would get to &euro;200 million.  We are not too far off &euro;200 million in terms of contracts-agreed.  The first drawdowns began towards the end of last year.  It was a very small amount but we only finalised some of the contracts into the fourth quarter of last year.  Many of these are complex arrangements and involve a number of developers and a number of different pieces of land, so one cannot view them as readily as if one was working with one developer or one landowner.  However, what we will see in the course of 2018 is a much larger drawdown now that 28 of the 34 contracts have been signed.  That will happen.  Any of the money that was not drawn down in the course of last year was put to better purposes in terms of reaching the targets we had for 2017.<\/p> <p>  The Chair asked a question on local authorities.  Was she talking about Part 5?  I was not quite sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#T00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1182,"content":"<p>Where a local authority owns a building, which happens to be protected structure, and on which it is going to carry out works to convert it into four homes for four people, the cost of purchasing that property and turning it into four homes far outweighs what one can buy on the open market, and to me this is not value for money.

What I do not want to do is have a local authority in a high demand area all of a sudden making acquisitions where either it fails in the acquisition, which then drives the price up for the private buyer who actually buys it, or where it takes away much-needed stock from young families and couples.  We also need to be sure that local authorities are doing some regeneration, even if they were not previously residential homes, to make sure we can keep a vibrancy in communities.  I am not speaking of the particular case the Chairman is talking about, because I am not familiar with it, but I am speaking about one in Tramore in Waterford where an old cinema was brought back into use as apartments and homes.  There is a mixed community there in that some of the apartments there are for people with certain disabilities.  What we have now in the centre of Tramore is an iconic building that was restored and that has a number of new people living in it and who are very happy their homes.  That has been very good for the community and for regenerating the town.  While it cost a bit more money and took a bit more time, in the longer term, it is a much more positive development.  When I talk about Rebuilding Ireland and fixing our housing problem and doing it in a sustainable way, it sometimes means taking a little more time, and spending a little more money, but the long-term gain for the community and for the people is greater.  There has to be flexibility on a site-by-site basis.  If the Chairman is particularly concerned about a particular site, in terms of a massive cost differential, then maybe we could talk about it offline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018012500002#T00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1516872600,"counter":1184,"content":"<p>Can I ask for two clarifications?

Cost-rental is a huge percentage of some of the markets in European countries.  When I think about cost-rental in some of the places in which I have lived, one of the ideas around it and where it would be of benefit is where someone did not own or buy a house over the course of his or her working life and he or she will be retiring and will be on a pension and is worried about being opened up to the vagaries of the rental market and how it might undermine his or her pension and even his or her security of tenure over the next 20 or 25 years.  If the person was able to get a cost-rental rent, the rent would be fixed, based, more than likely, over the lifetime of the rent, because it would be linked to the cost of construction plus management fees and some upgrade fees.  The person would not be exposed to the vagaries of the rental market.<\/p> <p>  There is huge potential here for those who do not and will not own homes and those are the types of ways that I want to bring in cost-rental.  However, it will take time to bring in cost-rental and to have it as a percentage of our rental market, as we see in other cities.  The pilot project that is currently being progressed with D&uacute;n Laoghaire, with the housing body there and with our Department is going to pave the way.  I will be visiting the European Investment Bank shortly to talk about how we can expand the ambition we have for that at the moment.<\/p><p>Just for the record, I will be pushing the rent-to-buy model.

I wish it good luck with the work.  We found this difficult as we had so much to say.  Broadly, we want to draw attention to ongoing issues of capacity, competence and culture in the development of Intreo and in the implementation of Pathways to Work.  We also want to draw attention to the absence of a more general employment service for the broader public.  We are concerned about how a \"work first\" activation regime works alongside weak employment regulation to potentially pressure unemployed workers into a low-paid precarious employment.<\/p> <p>  The issues we really want to draw attention to today are: gender issues in what we see as a relatively careless activation regime which focuses on a male breadwinner; issues of procurement and employment services; issues around adult guidance; and issues in respect of conditionality.  In respect of male breadwinner activation, labour activation rests on the nature of the social welfare regime, which is still predicated on the idea of full-time work.  To be eligible for jobseeker's payments, one has to be available and genuinely seeking full-time work.  That sets up a whole scenario of rules that make our activation regime highly unsuitable for women.  For example, we force lone parents whose eldest child is 14 years old or older into being available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.  That really does not fit with the reality of those women and often does not fit with what their parenting obligations and values are.  Professor Jill Rubery says it is like being made \"to 'work like a man' while still 'caring like a woman'\" at the same time.  We are forcing people into very unrealistic situations.  At the same time, many women who might want to access employment do not pass the availability for full-time work condition, which means that they cannot access Intreo.  That would often be the case in respect of qualified adults.<\/p> <p>  We then draw attention to the nature of the rules, which results in a gendered inequality in access to active labour market measures.  When we do the analysis we find that men account for three quarters of the active labour market measures available and women only one quarter.  That is not necessarily an intentional result of policy design but is an outcome of the rules which are being set by the regime.  <\/p> <p>  We have included in our statement some background on the recent changes to the lone parent's payment and what has been happening in that regard.  We draw attention particularly to the fact that there have been some welcome reversals to cuts introduced in previous budgets but those who are really standing outside and not receiving the benefits of those welcome reversals are those who were moved from the one-parent family payment to the full jobseeker's payment.  They have not benefitted from any of the reversals to the cuts.<\/p> <p>  We signal that we have been very slow to make any progress in the area of qualified adults.  There are a number of targets and objectives in Pathways to Work but we have missed the deadlines.  The targets with regard to the reform agenda in respect of qualified adults are highly unambitious.  We suggest two reforms, namely, using the jobseeker's transitional payment and abolishing the limitation rule.  Why not look at an ambitious reform that would actually make a real difference?  With regard to labour market shortages and labour market supply, this is an area where we want women to come back into the workforce.  It seems that this is a logical time to look at the issue in a more ambitious way.<\/p> <p>  Before I hand over to Mr. Finn and Ms Whelan, I wish to make a very short statement.  I wanted to say something about the procurement of employment services and the integrated delivery of social services.  We have been using a payment-by-outcome system for JobPath.  There is a policy intention to extend that to the local employment services, job clubs and the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  We have serious issues with this.  In our research we see that the extension of tendering and commissioning into these non-governmental organisations forces them to compete with one other to meet outcome targets and it is changing how they operate and co-operate with one other on the ground.  It is making them compete with one other for the attention of recipients rather than figure out what the best service for those recipients is.  There is a good word used in this regard - co-opetition.  This means that they are still trying to co-operate but in the context of competition, which really changes the nature of the game in which they are involved and stops them being able to integrate services for the end benefit of the recipient.  We really believe that not enough attention has been paid to the quality of what is happening on the ground when it comes to looking at these procurements and at paying by results.<\/p><p>There is a sense that we have little choice but to move into this procurement space because of European rules but we believe the application of social clauses offers more space for flexibility than we are using.  We urge attention on this space because some decisions are now being made, about local employment services, LES, and jobs clubs in particular, which bring such services into the realm of payment by outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516876200,"counter":1210,"content":"<p>I will speak briefly on research in which I have been involved looking at the impact of Pathways to Work on well-being and the employability of long-term unemployed jobseekers, with a particular focus on adult guidance.  This recent research evaluates the effectiveness of Pathways to Work and points to the importance of focusing on well-being because the unemployed tend to have lower levels of well-being than employed people.<\/p> <p>  The study used a randomised control methodology to look at the effectiveness of high-support guidance intervention on well-being, career efficacy and some employability factors.  A wider outcome of the study was that the significant reform in which F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social Protection merged, and the introduction of Pathways to Work, had a major impact on the delivery of guidance, particularly in the local employment service.  It also presented a depersonalised service, which is interesting because many jobseekers felt the service had become depersonalised and was no longer about them but about a system of rules by which they and the service had to abide.<\/p> <p>  The main outcome was the missing \"how to\" of implementation.  While the policy presents many goals that should be achieved in working with jobseekers, how to implement a guidance process was missing.  An important finding was that levels of psychological distress among long-term unemployed were high and 72% of participants who presented to the local employment services scored above a clinical well-being cut-off.  <\/p> <p>  Other findings suggested that high-support guidance intervention and the usual local employment service led to improvements, over time, in well-being and employability and a decrease in the levels of psychological distress as people went through the guidance process.  This was particularly evident in the case of male participants.  Men fare quite well in terms of high-support guidance intervention and presented much better levels of psychological well-being.  Measures of employability, such as hopefulness and career efficacy, also improved for people who went through the high-support guidance intervention.<\/p> <p>  Qualitative findings were that the client-practitioner relationship was extremely important, as were the service setting and skilled staff to deliver the guidance intervention.  This study is the first to examine Pathways to Work with regard to psychological well-being and employability outcomes for the long-term unemployed.  It focuses on how we can develop a healthy workforce and policy documents such as Pathways to Work and Enterprise 2025 state that we should build a healthy workforce for the future.  The model shows that investing in the long-term unemployed contributes to this goal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Whelan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516876200,"counter":1211,"content":"<p>Conditionality and sanctions are a controversial aspect of activation policy.  The relatively low levels of sanctions in Ireland do not provide reasons for complacency.  In regimes where claimants are fearful of sanctions, one may expect high levels of compliance and low levels of sanctions.  Some qualitative data from Ireland suggest that the threat of sanction negatively impacts both claimants' well-being and their relationship to caseworkers and agencies.  International evidence highlights that, while claimants are generally aware that sanctions exist within the system, there is a lack of understanding among claimants of when, how and why they are implemented or reversed.  Qualitative research here suggests that Ireland is mirroring this trend.  It may be the case that claimants are sanctioned for a lack of understanding rather than a deliberate choice to avoid conditions.<\/p> <p>  Further qualitative evidence suggests variable practice across regions.  There is a lack of transparency in this regard, which is probably felt most acutely in respect of the practice of conditionality in the two JobPath services, namely, Turas Nua and Seetec.  Transparency requires publication of sanctions across Intreo and JobPath, including reasons for sanctions, gender and age disaggregation, regional analysis and quarterly reports to be included with the Pathways to Work quarterly monitoring report.  Policy learning and evaluation require a high-quality qualitative follow-up of sanctioned individuals to understand the impact of conditionality and sanctions on clients' lives, employment prospects, risk of poverty and risk of homelessness.<\/p> <p>  Current qualitative research suggests that claimants are critical of work-related conditionality, which is often perceived as failing to take account of their interests such as returning to education or personal issues, such as mental or physical health, financial concerns or their housing situation or both.  This is probably most acutely felt by unemployed claimants who are experiencing and are required to meet the requirements of multiple conditional regimes such as methadone maintenance programmes.  International evidence suggests that the most vulnerable individuals have a particularly poor understanding of sanction regimes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Finn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516876200,"counter":1212,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak and to share the experience of what it is like for disabled jobseekers interacting with current labour activation measures.  I represent the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, which represents more than 120 member organisations.  We have been very active in looking at policy on activation, in particular the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, which is a ten-year strategy designed to support people with disabilities into work.  Although I will focus on this strategy, it does not belie the need for all activation measures to be accessible for people with disabilities.  We must avoid the trap of &quot;othering&quot; people with disabilities and assuming they cannot walk through the Intreo system or other support systems like everybody else.<br\/><br\/>Two years into the comprehensive employment strategy, there has been no impact on the employment rates of people with disabilities.  At the height of the boom, when long-term unemployment was at an all-time low, the percentage of people with disabilities in employment was only half of that for those without disabilities.  As far back as 2008, the OECD expressed concern that Ireland was parking people with disabilities on the sidelines of Irish life and that hiding unemployment in the wrong welfare system was a failed and costly strategy.Today, little has changed.  The numbers in work have not changed significantly and the numbers in receipt of disability allowance are increasing year on year.  Yesterday's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>stated that, at the end of 2017, there were 133,929 adults of working age in receipt of disability allowance and that this was rising by approximately 32,000 year on year.  This is a means-tested payment for which it is extremely difficult to qualify and people would not choose to live their lives on this.  The most recent CSO survey on income and living conditions of December 2017indicated that consistent poverty was highest amongst those not at work due to illness or disability.  This is not a comfortable place for people to be.<br\/><br\/>Long-term unemployment almost halved between 2013 and 2016 and unemployment in general dropped by 5.3% in the same period but the rate of employment for people with disabilities saw just a 0.4% increase.<\/p><p>Some 71% of adults of working age with a disability are not in work.  This figure does not equate to an unemployment rate because people with disabilities are not included in the unemployment figures; hence my point about the OECD.<br\/><br\/>The Wellbeing of the Nation report launched earlier this month points to much of what Ms Whelan from NUI Maynooth said earlier on the well-being of people with disabilities.  Disabled people are more at risk of suffering the negative impacts that are commonly associated with unemployment, for example, reduced financial stability, stress, and lower levels of mental and physical health.<br\/><br\/>At the same time DFI recognises that work is not for everyone.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, which Ireland has yet to ratify, affords people the right to social protection as well as the right to work.  Those who can and want to work should be supported and empowered to do so.  Those for whom work is not a viable option should be supported to live the life they choose without, as is happening in the UK, having to repeatedly prove their eligibility for social protection or their incapacity to work.  Everybody, regardless of their work status, should be afforded a minimum income that allows them to live with dignity.<br\/><br\/>What are people with disabilities doing if they are not in work?  Based on data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the ESRI we know that 56% are interested in some kind of training or education; 56% also state they had previously worked; 13% said they are currently working either part-time or full-time.  These results are in line with the Department's administrative estimates which suggest that approximately 10% of all those in receipt of disability allowance are doing some form of work.<br\/><br\/>The ESRI also found - this is extremely worrying - that many people with disabilities are more likely to exit the labour market than to enter it.  Four out of five people with disabilities acquire their disability during working age.  The odds of leaving work are twice as high for people with disabilities as they are for others of working age.  They are even higher for people with deafness, or learning, psychological or emotional disabilities, including mental illness.  This raises many questions for us as a country, not only on how we are supporting people into work through activation but also how we are retaining people in work.  There is no point in activating people into jobs which in the long term are unsustainable if we do not address serious issues relating to reasonable accommodation, what we are willing to consider as acceptable around that and also around further engagement with employers.<br\/><br\/>The current suite of interventions set out in the comprehensive employment strategy consist of many well-meaning activities and programmes that do not add up to increasing the number of people with disabilities in employment nor can it do so.  We can discuss this further, but in brief it sits in a policy vacuum quite apart from the realities of the local labour market as presented by our colleagues from Maynooth University, including the precarious nature of work, youth unemployment and underemployment.  While I know NESC and others are giving consideration to in-work poverty and jobless households, we are not seeing any effect and no joined-up thinking is going on.<br\/><br\/>It also locates people with disabilities in a vacuum and assumes they have only one singular identity.  Gender has been mentioned this morning.  The comprehensive employment strategy does not acknowledge that some of these people with disabilities are actually women.  That might come as a surprise.  It also does not take into account any other caring responsibilities, including child-care responsibilities, or the complexity of people's lives.  We see fixing the employment problem of disabled people outside of any context, including the family context.  We should view it as what the literature would describe as a &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; issue which demands an appropriate response to that complexity.<br\/><br\/>The strategy also focuses on supplying people to a labour force without looking at where the jobs are.  This is an ongoing issue and speaks to where the comprehensive employment strategy is located within the Department of Justice and Equality.  I wish to read out a tweet that was posted on Twitter yesterday in response to the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>report.  One gentleman said: &quot;I'm back on DA after a year's employment.  Really don't want to be on it but it's so hard to find appropriate employment with a disability.  The financial stress I'm under is immense and unsustainable.&quot;  This is the reality of people's lives.  The strategy individualises blame on the person who does not succeed rather than creating an employment market that is receptive to and supportive of including all members of Irish society.<br\/><br\/>We also have concerns over how narrowly work is interpreted by the CES.  It is either a vocational support or people need to be professionals and we do not understand the diversity of work in between.  <br\/><br\/>Underlying all that is a serious concern about the capacity of different Departments to work together to support people into work from where they are at.  This kind of siloed work has its consequences.  For example, it is difficult for school leavers to make life choices based on what they want rather than funding.  There are two critical areas in which this is evident.  First, school goers are supported throughout their school and college career only to find that once they leave all supports they had are withdrawn as they came from the Department of Education and Skills and do not carry over to a work environment.  This includes funding for a personal assistant, assistive technology and any other supports they were getting.  They find themselves high and dry looking at a labour market that is unsupportive.<br\/><br\/>While the education system relies heavily on the rhetoric of choice and opportunities, the literature shows that for students with severe and profound learning difficulties there is no choice.  If a school leaver does not fall into the category of needing the level of support offered by a &ldquo;New Directions&rdquo; day service, they are not eligible for any funding at present, which means more people are being steered into day services than is desirable or necessary. <br\/><br\/>We need to look at what we understand as reasonable accommodation in the workplace.  We need to overhaul our reasonable accommodation fund to make it fit for the workplace of the 21st century.  Research conducted by FreedomTech, a collaboration between DFI and Enable Ireland, indicates that appropriately deployed technologies are effective ways of sustaining people in work yet there is little uptake of the grants available.  This implies a complete mismatch between the design of the schemes and the need people have in work. <br\/><br\/>There are a couple of positives.  We hope to see some move on medical card eligibility which has been a huge barrier for people going into the workforce in the past.  We have known of people who have had to leave work because they lost their medical cards.  We understand that we will hear some news from the Department of Health on this very soon.  We also commend the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on its collaboration with the sector in dealing with the tricky issue of eligibility to Disability Allowance for 16 to 18 year olds.  We are working with the Department on this complex issue.<br\/><br\/>Not only do all activation measures need to be designed to be inclusive from the outset, they must be designed to meet people where they are at.  This is not happening at the moment.  For example, we have an employability service that very often insists that people be job-ready in order to avail of the service.<br\/><br\/>At the moment rules begin and end where Departments meet.  This is not the space in which people live their lives.  Last year the OECD made much comment on this kind of siloed policymaking, which it states is unsuitable for the speed at which 21st century change is occurring.  It promotes the use of a systems approach to deal with the complexity.  Certainly that applies to an issue such as disability and work.<br\/><br\/>The focusing on access to and performance of the institutions supporting people into work rather than requiring transformation of those institutions will not result in the inclusion we seek or the employment levels of people with disabilities that we need see.  That said, we strongly assert that people with disabilities must not become a new underclass of underpaid, underemployed workers.  They must have an adequate income.<\/p><p>To do that we must completely overhaul the comprehensive employment strategy and stitch it back into the mainstream activation programme if we are to become a sustainable economy where the well-being of all is respected and people with disabilities are seen as a cohort of the population who can contribute to the collective and economic well-being of our nation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan O'Donnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516876200,"counter":1215,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to attend today.

Rather, I am saying that I am well able to do things, except one thing, which is get a job and have a career.<\/p> <p>  To refer again to attitude, let me give one example.  I was offered a job.  At the time I was, and still am, in receipt of disability allowance.  I rang up the section dealing with disability allowance and asked how I would get off the allowance as I would be getting an income.  I spoke to a lady who said I would need a letter from a doctor on my rehabilitation.  I asked why it was needed given that I had been offered a job with a proper income and she said that I might not be able to do the job.  I thought to myself, \"Thanks very much for the vote of confidence.\"  That is the negative attitude from the Government though.  These are the people who are meant to help us.  <\/p> <p>  Then I went for my medical with the company.  I will not say its name.  Before this, I had been working with people with disabilities one-on-one for five years through another organisation.  I was a volunteer, which is quite common.  During the medical the doctor asked me if I had any conditions and I said that I had some mental health issues.  I thought that would be a problem but she said that it should be okay.  Then I told her I have epilepsy but that I am 20 years clear and am able to drive.  The doctor recommended, however, that I undertake \"no lone activities\".  This means that I cannot work one-to-one with a client, which was basically my job.  Therefore, with a flick of a pen by the doctor, I lost my job.  This was a result of the doctor's attitude towards epilepsy.<\/p> <p>  My mental health is also affected by not having a job and feeling impoverished.  A lot of people with disabilities are on the poverty line.  I am also socially isolated because I cannot afford to go out with my friends.  All this affects my mental health.  It is also affected by the feeling of not being able to be part of and give back to society.  I do not want special treatment.  I just want an opportunity to give back to society and be part of it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Lysaght"},{"type":"speech","time":1516876200,"counter":1216,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their opening presentations but Mr. Lysaght's first-hand experience is very insightful into what we would call the \"real world\" as it affects an individual.

It was powerful and personal and it means so much to hear it first-hand.  Unfortunately, we hear such stories every day of the week but it is brilliant to have heard from Mr. Lysaght.<\/p> <p>  I read the Disability Federation of Ireland's presentation and listened intently today.  The increase of 32,000 people in receipt of disability allowance over the past five years is, to say the least, very concerning and it shows that the current activation measures are simply not working.  The increase is enough to sound alarm bells.  Have the witnesses a breakdown of the numbers of people with disabilities who are engaged in the job activation schemes such as the community employment scheme, T&uacute;s, and JobPath?  Were they able to obtain those figures?<\/p> <p>  It would be interesting to hear the witnesses' views, if any, on the new Ability programme announced by Government.<\/p> <p>  On the comprehensive employment strategy, WALK PEER is one of 14 disability activation projects set up in 2012 and every year there is a concern funding will not be in place.  There have been threats after threats.  I have met with representatives of WALK PEER on a number of occasions and, to my mind, it is a programme that works and the people involved do fantastic work.  Did the witnesses' organisations have any direct contact with WALK PEER?  Do they think the programme works?  It is concerned with assisting young people who are in receipt of disability allowance obtain paid employment.  I think it works but I would like to hear the witnesses' views on whether this model could be replicated and rolled out throughout the State.<\/p> <p>  I have tabled numerous parliamentary questions seeking a breakdown of how many people with disabilities were employed through the comprehensive employment strategy.  Surprise, surprise, the Department states that it does not record those figures.  In my book, it is crazy that the Department is not in a position to assess how well the strategy is working.  What are the witnesses' views on it?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Murphy's excellent presentation touched on a lot of areas which this committee has examined, including the area of lone parents.  We know the high poverty levels that exist in that regard.  It is much the same for those with disabilities.  I want to home in on a number of specific areas because I am conscious of the time.  I have huge concerns around JobPath, its impact and the privatised model the Department is rolling out.  The sanctions that are imposed were touched on already but I have heard horrific cases about JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec.  I produced a report before Christmas on JobPath which deals with the first-hand experiences of those who have been engaged.  I do not know if the witnesses have seen it.  I also have serious concerns about the local employment service, LES, which appears to be an attempt to push this to the side.<\/p><p>We see that through the annual decrease in referrals across the State to the local employment service which is a major concern.  Staff in the local employment services would say people are forced on to the JobPath scheme and at the end of the 12-month period they go the LES, but the LES should have been the first port of call.  Do the witnesses consider there should be more of a role for the LES as opposed to JobPath?  <\/p><p> There are major difficulties in lone parents' accessing education and we have heard different presentations on that.  Do the witnesses have specific views on lone parents in terms of employment activation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#G00800","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516876200,"counter":1223,"content":"<p>I call Senator Higgins and she has five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#H00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1516876200,"counter":1224,"content":"<p>There are many questions and issues on this topic but many of them have been covered by Deputy Brady, which is excellent.  I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.  They were very strong and there is even more in their written submissions, which I am sure will be incorporated when we come to put together our report.  There is a huge body of evidence behind all of the points the witnesses have made.<\/p> <p>  I will pick up on a few points where there is a little overlap on some issues.  It was interesting that the witnesses focused on the role of the jobseeker's transitional payment.  As a committee, we had recommended that being extended for lone parents up to the age of 18.  One of its aspects is that it waives the requirement on full-time availability.  The witnesses might comment on how that might be a useful way of offering a support and an invitation into the system to those, for example, who are currently qualified adults and others without bringing in a sanction mindset, and how it might work because it is a really practical and good proposal.<\/p> <p>  On the question around procurement rules, my understanding of the rules is that there is huge scope, particularly in areas of social services, in that they are not bound in the same way by some of the European procurement rules and there is huge scope within the social clauses.  Within the European procurement rules, there are particular supports and exemptions in areas around disability and disability support within sheltered workplaces.  The witnesses might like to comment on that issue.  We need to have a more ambitious approach in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  An issue that was raised by Mr. Finn and also potentially by Ms Whelan, was the question of appropriate placing and appropriate case-work.  This is also a question for Ms O'Donnell.  Are people being offered the full range of options?  For example, are they being offered education and training or job-readiness supports or employment in terms of what is right for them as they move forward?  That has come across as a concern as we have examined this issue in the committee and sometimes it almost seems to come down to the luck of the draw with respect to when one happens to come into a system as to what one gets offered.  The witnesses might tease out that issue of appropriate placing and quality of the case-work.<\/p> <p>  A specific issue which cuts across the question of both sanctions and appropriate placing is progression plans.  Do any of the witnesses have insights on that question?  We have heard concerns around progression plans, which I and others have debated with the Minister.  The understanding the Department seems to have is that this is a collaborative process done with the case worker and the client or citizen.  However, there are concerns about how that is playing out in practice and the fear of sanctions attached if one does not sign off or agree to a particular progression plan.  It would be great if the witnesses could tease out that issue.<\/p> <p>  Some of the points raised in the presentations are ones we will be able to address in our activation report but some other very important issues were flagged in the context of employment, in terms of precarious work and reasonable accommodation, which comes under the other brief of this committee.  We can certainly note those issues and find other opportunities to bring them forward.  When one considers the arrangements which those with a disability in particular often have make around their participation in employment, we can appreciate the impact precarious work, uncertain hours and uncertain arrangements can have on them.  That is another interesting point of overlap.  <\/p> <p>  I was very struck by what Mr. Finn said around the idea of multiple conditional regimes where people have to navigate a number of bureaucracies.  I would be interested to hear comments from one of the witnesses from the Disability Federation of Ireland or the other witnesses on that issue.  When people try to navigate the medical system and appointment structures, there is a set of different bureaucracies that they must navigate.  The witnesses might comment on how that could be better approached and streamlined.  <\/p> <p>  I would share very much the concerns regarding the LES and some of the approach in terms of the pay by results.  I worry that it can be very disadvantageous for those who are more distant from the workplace and it can incentivise an element of cherry-picking.  We have been told that people can walk in and seek supports, but if we are introducing a competitive dynamic where services are competing with each other for the number of people that they can show in X position at X time, I would be concerned.  I have heard of excellent services that I know have done extraordinary work, for example, with hard to reach young people in empowering them to link with the workplace who have been losing out on contracts.  It is vital with respect to the issue of job-readiness and investing in the emotional work required and giving those supports, that such work does not become a disadvantage to those seeking to provide supports.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by one of the witnesses' comments to the effect that those in receipt of disability allowance do not cover the cohort of those with a disability in Ireland.  I imagine there is a huge cohort who may have a disability and may not pass a means test because their spouse is working and who do not have access to independent income, and may not have access to labour market access supports.  The same question arises with respect to many who are qualified adults, but there are those who may not register as qualified adults because their spouse is not taking a payment.  I would like to hear the witnesses' input on those who disappear from the live register and then eventually from the system and also on the jobless households pilot scheme which relates to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#H00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1516876200,"counter":1225,"content":"<p>I call Senator Dolan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#H00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1516876200,"counter":1226,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to contribute.

What would be the one key element that might improve that?<\/p><p>Ms Nuala Whelan spoke about the &quot;how to&quot; of the implementation issue.  That theme came through in the presentations and much of the discussion.  I refer to the usefulness of high supports and the way they might be progressed.  There were many similarities in the presentations in that in many ways there were not two different presentations.  There was great synergy between them.  <\/p><p>I ask Mr. Philip Finn if he considers there is undue, unwarranted and dysfunctional pressure on service providers to get to sanctions prematurely or too quickly?  <\/p><p>I should mention that Ms Joan O'Donnell from the Disability Federation of Ireland and I are colleagues and I would have done a good deal of work with Mr. David Lysaght.  I also knew Dr. Mary Murphy many years ago from being involved in a similar kind of space.  What are people with disabilities doing?  They are not in work.  Nearly 60% of them have worked previously.  It seems crazy that we cannot put those people back in saddle.  They already have life experience.  At the other end of that spectrum we have young people with disabilities.  This raises the conundrum of value for public investment.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>The Departments of Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs and Employment Affairs and Social Protection together with the HSE, are providing supports to people.  There has been a major sea change in the education supports for people with disabilities.  Twenty years ago the thinking was to find a special place and put them there.  Now the policy is to integrate those with disabilities in the education mainstream.  We have issues on how to make this policy better.  When those with disabilities come to the end of the education cycle, they face a cliff.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the State stops investing in their education, but that it should get value for money and make it possible for them to use their education.  In his statement Mr. David Lysaght made the point well, he states that he is well able to do things, except to get a job and have a career.  I know and Mr. Lysaght knows that this is not because he cannot fulfil the role, but because a system that is not a system conspires in its own sweet way to block him.  Dr. Murphy referred in her opening statement to capacity, competence and culture.  Mr. Lysaght used the \"A\" word, attitude.  The disabled are not different.<\/p><p> It would be very useful to get discussion and engagement with other relevant Departments.  It is in the interest of the public purse to have inclusion policies for those with disabilities.  Even in Departments with different agencies, they are all co-opetitioning with each other.<\/p><p> Ms Joan O'Donnell referred in particular to the withdrawal of supports, post school and college with people being steered into day service.

Is the psychological wellbeing of a person who is long-term unemployed at such a low ebb that it is debilitating and prohibiting and preventing people getting back into the workforce?<\/p> <p>  I was taken by the point made by Ms Joan O'Donnell that the odds of employment exit are twice as high for people with disabilities as they are for others.  She then went on to pick out a couple of particular disabilities, for example deafness, where the odds of employment exit are even higher.  <\/p> <p>  I was in business long before I was in politics and we used to have a rule of thumb in our business and it probably varies from business to business that the cost of getting a new customer was seven times higher than the cost of retaining an existing customer.

If there is an underlying theme, it is that in part the attitude of the State to the issue of activation policy is very dominated by an old fashioned agenda, that it is the job of the State to control the public purse to ensure that people are doing what they are supposed to be doing for the relative payments they are on.  That is what dominates their attitude when they start their engagement with an individual.  The officer of the State sees the individual as a social welfare recipient who is costing the State money and the job is to manage that payment.  There is a control agenda.  An alternate view is to consider the individual as a citizen with particular barriers to work and with particular experiences that are causing their psychological well-being to be undermined.  If we could change the attitude of the State to one that was ambitious for its citizens rather than wanting to control the cost of its problems, I think we would be at a very different starting point in our discussions.<\/p> <p>  In large part, the reason that activation is not working for people, particularly for more vulnerable people, such as those with disabilities, lone parents, long-term unemployed is that the State is too keen to push people far too speedily through a process to get very specific outcomes from it that are predetermined by procurement outcomes and such things, rather than realistically looking at what is the situation that this person is coming from and how can we work with this person to get a long-term outcome that will be sustainable for their well-being.  <\/p> <p>  I think we are not asking the right questions and that is why we are not getting the right answers.  Let us look at what procurement is doing because the contractors are being paid by results.  We are looking for results far too quickly.  The feedback from SICAP and LES is that under their contracts they are being asked to do quite impossible things for the people with whom they are working.  They see that they are forcing people far too quickly through processes.  They are being forced to offer them the wrong opportunities.  There is a significant level of frustration on the ground among the workers as well as the clients that they are not able to really do what the person needs.  They can see what the person needs and the services are potentially there to do it, but they are not able to package them in the way that makes sense for people.  I think the underlying attitude informing the design of the services need to be examined again.  There are false pressures, I mentioned the false pressure of procurement dominating how we arrange the design of the actual services themselves.  We can see that on the ground.  We can see organisations competing and not co-operating with each other.  We can see people being referred to the wrong services.  We can see people being told we cannot do anything with them for a year because some other provider has got them right now but if they can wait it out for the year, the person will be eligible for a community employment scheme again and that will be okay.  There are crazy things happening to people.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if members watched \"I, Daniel Blake\", which shows what happens to a person's life when bureaucracy goes mad.  We have the Irish style experience - I call them \"D&oacute;nal\" Blake's stories - where people are being caught in bureaucratic quagmires because of the design of the system.  We recently conducted a very large research programme on the integrated delivery of social services.  What we can see is that there are a lot of integration issues not happening both vertically and horizontally on the ground.  What we are assuming is connected up is not connected up and some of it is that the target organisations that clients work with, are too speedy for what people need.  We are pushing them to get through education outcomes far too quickly.<\/p><p>If we take lone parents as an example in terms of our ambition for people and look at the education and training options also, the data indicates that almost 50% of lone parents have very poor educational outcomes.  Our ambition is to get them into something like a FETAC 5 course, which will get them a care job at the minimum wage and then we wonder why that is not moving people out of poverty and why activation is not working for lone parents.  We know that if we want a lone parent to get a job that is sustainable in terms of lifting her and her family out of poverty, we need to invest in education at a much higher level than FETAC level 5.  We need to let people move up the education ladder.  Research done recently by Delma Byrne on loan parents and access to third level education, for example, shows that in terms of the student cohort in third level, only 1% of them are lone parents.  They are not getting a chance to progress up the ladder into education and training options that will get them jobs that are realistic in terms of moving them out of poverty.  Unless we do that, and regardless of whether our activation policy pushes them into jobs, it will not matter because those jobs will not be good enough to lift them out of poverty.  That is about ambition and attitude.  It is not about the attitude of the lone parent.  It is about the attitude of the State towards that lone parent and being more ambitious for her and her children.<\/p><p> What is ironic about the reforms and the cuts to lone parents benefit over the past ten years is that, by accident, we designed a jobseeker's transitional payment.  In typical Irish style we did not set out to do it.  We created a crisis of cuts to loan parents where we wanted to move them from the one parent family payment to jobseeker's benefit.  The political reaction was very strong and the system was forced to come up with a stop-gap arrangement, and it came up with jobseeker's transition, but it has many positive features.  For example, it is not as mandatory in terms of what happens with jobseeker's payments in that workers are allowed work full time or part time, the three day rule does not apply and the income disregards are better.  We have created a space that has the potential to be a creative policy area.  With the right investment, capacity and training of case workers I believe it offers potential for both lone parents and qualified adults, and even perhaps as models for other vulnerable groups, namely, asylum seekers coming in to work and people with disabilities.<\/p><p> To make that work, however, there are a few aspects that are important.  Jobseeker's transition payment gives us an alternative approach to activation where people are allowed take their time and where we can be more ambitious about the level of education and training we offer but only if those options are available and if we invest in the selection and training of the case workers to ensure they are appropriate and have the right attitude to work with people.  That is crucial.  Much of the feedback we get from the Pathways to Work service is that it is dependent on the individual experience of people, and that is dependent on the attitude of the individual case worker.  Some of that can be achieved by training but some of it cannot.  It is about the person who is picked for the job and put into it.  Serious issues arise in that regard in terms of the structure of the way Pathways to Work was put together.<\/p><p> Senator Alice-Mary Higgins asked about the five pilots for qualified adults.  It is useful to consider doing those pilots but the issue is the case workers, the training and whether they are approached with the attitude of the jobseeker's transition space in terms of seeing what these qualified adults need and how we can open up a progression pathway for them or whether it is about getting them into the first low-paid job we can find and make them take it.  They are two completely different worlds in terms of starting points for understanding what can be done about it.<\/p><p> There are a number of innovative proposals we could have about lone parents, qualified adults and other vulnerable groups that jobseeker's transition offers us a policy and institutional space to work in to be creative with, but only if we invest in the appropriate training for the workers and also the range of options, particularly education and training options rather than employment options, that give people the opportunity to lift themselves up over time.  That is about the ambition of the policy for people and what the policy wants to achieve.  Is it savings, getting people off the live register or welfare or well-being and a better quality of life in four or five years time?  Which one do we want?  Currently, it is clear that we want short, cheap outcomes and we are not putting in the level of investment, or the level of thinking or creativity, that could help us achieve the other ambition, which is better quality of lives over a longer timeframe.

With my other hat on, I work in Ballymun Job Centre, which manages the local employment services in the Ballymun area, and for many years I have seen how people present to the service, which often was not that well or enthusiastically about work, feeling very low in terms of their self-belief and confidence, not aware of their skills and aptitudes or what they can bring to the labour market.  In the study I conducted, 85% of that long-term unemployed sample - 150 people - had previous employment.  Forty per cent of them were unemployed for over five years at the point they came into the study and 72% of the full sample came in with quite high levels of psychological distress.  People are entering the service like that so if the attitude is negative or punitive when they come in, we are creating an environment in which they do not feel it is safe to discuss their barriers to the labour market.  They do not believe they can start to explore their career options and feel under pressure because of the conditionality attached to taking a particular job.<\/p> <p>  In my study I looked at high support intervention and whether that created different outcomes for people as opposed to the Intreo model the local employment service, LES, was being asked to deliver.  People going through the high support services were twice as likely to end up in education and training, in an active labour market programme such as community employment, CE, T&uacute;s or something that was helping them to increase their jobs than jobseeking.  Some 22% of the participants who went through the service as usual were jobseeking so they were coming in with very low levels of education, highly distressed psychologically and with no belief in or understanding of what they could contribute and yet they were being forced to take a job.  They will end up in short-term, precarious work.  That is the type of job they will get.  I see it all the time.  They are the jobs people who come in get, and they end up back in the service after two or three months feeling worse than they did in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  It is about the \"how to\" of implementation.  What do we do when that client walks in the door?  How should the service receive them?  What types of interventions might the staff choose to use depending on the specific needs of the client?  That must be detailed, and that is what this study tried to do.  Not everyone needs high support guidance but some people do.  Some people work quite well in the normal service.  Women seem to fair well with both the LES and the high support models, but men fair particularly well with the high support intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1516876200,"counter":1235,"content":"<p>Would it be possible to make available information about that high support model the university piloted because it might be useful to the committee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#K00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516876200,"counter":1236,"content":"<p>Yes, absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Whelan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516876200,"counter":1237,"content":"<p>In terms of my own research I would echo much of what Dr. Murphy and Ms Whelan have seen already.  I have certainly seen evidence of a work first model where people feel that they cannot discuss the barriers to work or where training and education is not being presented as a viable option for them and that they must go out and find work.  As part of my own research I spoke to many people who were in education and training boards and have taken on courses.  The vast majority of them had to find those courses themselves with little help from Intreo or other service providers.  They couch these things in terms of the lack of dignity and respect when they go into Intreo in that a holistic view of the person is not taken account of.  While we might have a better economy now, people are still living with the past in terms of mental health, financial concerns and housing problems in recent years, which creates barriers to returning to work.<\/p> <p>  In terms of a collaborative process, one of the approaches I take in interviews is to present people with the record of mutual commitments, which all jobseekers must sign.<\/p><p>We talk about the progression plans.  At the vast majority of interviews, people cannot remember signing the record of mutual commitments.  They have no recollection of it at all.  I think that comes down to need.  People need social welfare payments like jobseeker's allowance.  When we deconstruct their records of mutual commitment during interviews, they tell us that the idea of training and education was never made available to them as something they could pursue.<\/p><p> I was also asked about the multiple regimes.  As I have already said, it has been suggested during interviews I have done that factors like child care, a lack of education and mental health issues are preventing people from getting work.  It has been considered that such factors are not accounted for by case workers.  I made a similar point when I spoke about multiple regimes and conditionality.  Along with one of my colleagues in Maynooth, I am currently engaged in exploratory research on unemployed drug service users.  At present, an unemployed drug service user is treated in each service as a methadone patient and as a jobseeker.  Consideration is given separately to these individual factors rather than how they intersect with each other.  People in these circumstances are obliged to get their methadone.  There is a lot of work involved in keeping appointments.  They do not have enough time to look for work.  They must also deal with the stigma associated with drug use.  Employers are reluctant to hire drug service users.  When their appointments and obligations clash, it can lead to sanctions being imposed and this can result in people being in danger of losing their social welfare or their methadone.  I think there needs to be much more interaction between services.  Rather than seeing the individual as a jobseeker who needs to be activated as part of the service delivery model, a holistic approach needs to be taken.  The other point I would like to make about unemployed drug service users is that substance abuse is no longer regarded as a reason for being eligible for disability allowance.  This means that a drug service user has no option other than to be a jobseeker.  As I have said, this creates all kinds of difficulties.<\/p><p> I was asked whether there is pressure on case workers to impose sanctions too quickly.  My research focuses on the lived experience of jobseekers.  It does not take account of the experiences of people who work in the services.  I know from other colleagues that it is quite difficult to get institutional access to interview case workers, etc.  We are not really familiar with the kinds of organisational pressures they are under.  As I said earlier, the level of sanctions imposed in Ireland is still relatively low in an international context.  Since the introduction of Pathways to Work, however, there have been annual increases in sanctions, from 359 in 2011 to over 1,600 last year.  There is evidence that sanctions are being used more frequently.  Before 2010, it was possible to disqualify people from receiving payments as a nuclear option that case workers were reluctant to use.  Now there is a penalty rate that can be applied for up to nine weeks and disqualification can take place thereafter.  The use of such sanctions has become a tool or technique to be used by case workers as part of their repertoire when encouraging jobseekers into particular positions or courses.  While there is some evidence that the use of sanctions is increasing, it is important to acknowledge that it is still relatively low in an international context.  We do not yet know how this will change in the coming years, or how it is already changing, because Ireland does not have a culture of sanctioning within the system and we do not have access to case workers to see what kinds of organisational pressures they are under.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Finn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516876200,"counter":1239,"content":"<p>I would like to echo much of what has been said about attitudes.  The system does not understand the people it is supposed to serve, such as lone parents, people with disabilities and people with substance abuse issues.  Among the disabled cohort, the issue of having to deal with multiple regimes is multiplied again because people are dealing with medical services and their caring and family responsibilities, etc.  The system does not seem to understand that people have multiple identities.  It merely sees a disabled person who needs to be activated.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, one of the big issues the system is trying to deal with is making work pay.  Although a substantial report on this issue in April of last year looked at how we can make work pay, it is being done in isolation.  An effort is being made to contend with the extra costs that people with disabilities encounter when they go out to work, including transport costs and the cost of accessing a medical card.  It was agreed in the report in question that the medical earnings disregard should be increased from its current level of &euro;120 a week so that people can earn more and retain their medical cards for up to three years after they start working.  This was a huge barrier for people who were entering the workforce.  In the past, it caused many people to leave the workforce.<\/p> <p>  We were asked where those who have left are now.  Many people who have left the workforce are quite scared or nervous about engaging with the system again.  I understand from the Department of Health that we can expect to hear some news in this regard before the deadline of the fourth quarter of this year.  The Department says it will come in on this sooner than the deadline.  We hope that will be the case.  It would not be a moment too soon.  This issue is keeping a significant cohort of people out of work and has been the cause of many people leaving the workforce.<\/p> <p>  Other issues, such as access to a personal assistance service, are not understood.  As we have said, many supports are provided all the way up through school and college.  People get the assistive technology and equipment they need, but they cannot take such supports with them when they leave.  We worked last year with a woman in County Meath who had been working with a local authority for many years.  After her personal assistance supports were pulled, she could not go to the toilet during work hours.  How can someone work in such conditions?  What kind of violation of human rights is that?<\/p> <p>  I think it is pretty clear from everything we have been saying that this is spilling over into mental health.  I think it is worth pointing out again.  Many people become disengaged.  The term NEETs was used in the past to describe those who are not in education, training or employment.  We do not seem to use that term anymore.  Those involved in the Walk project in County Louth had to walk the streets to find the people who were no longer engaging with services.  The Department could not provide that information.  People were not engaged with schools or other services.  People in their early 20s were sitting at home and wasting away, which is not an acceptable situation for anybody to be in.<\/p> <p>  I do not have the number of people who are engaged in mainstream activation programmes at the moment.  I would be curious to know whether the Department has that number.  We know from the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, that unemployment in general fell from 13.9% in 2013 to 8.6% in 2016, but it did not change for people with disabilities.  I think that gives a very clear answer about the effectiveness, or otherwise, of the comprehensive employment strategy.<\/p><p>I ask the committee to consider the resources this country is putting into that strategy and all the professionals and services and so on that are involved in it, which brings me to the caseworkers.  We are now told that caseworkers in Intreo are trained and ready to meet and greet people with disabilities.  The reality of what we hear on the ground is very disturbing and is enough to set people back in their lives another two years.  Progression often stops at the front door.  It is not that people cannot get into the buildings any more, although I think some Intreo offices are still not physically accessible; it is that attitudinal access to the service, which the State purports to provide, is not actually there.  We hear horrendous stories about this, not just about Intreo, but also concerns about the employability service, which is a specialist service designed for people with disabilities.  A young man with an acquired brain injury, whom we interviewed as part of our preparations for our conference on employment in 2016, said of employability services that they kept asking him what he wanted to do.  He had just had an acquired brain injury.  He did not know what he wanted to do.  He had thought this was the service that would help him to discover that.  We also know anecdotally from colleagues here that people with autism similarly find they are not met with by the services or understood.  Progression is very difficult in these circumstances.  Mr. Lysaght will give an example of this.  I am trying to figure out where else I need to go with my response before I hand over to him.<\/p><p> I refer to work retention, keeping people at work and stopping the seamless cycle of people being pushed into activation and then spat out at the other end by jobs that are unsustainable, precarious, low-paid and not suitable for them.  Healthy Ireland began some work at the end of 2015, I think, on looking at early intervention.  It invited a great many people from a very HR-focused perspective to Dublin Castle.  There were only three representatives, including me, from the disability sector, which included bodies focused on arthritis and mental health.  A HR response or a technical, legalistic response to early intervention will not crack this.  People will continue to leave work once they acquire a disability unless we crack it.  Deputy Carey asked what we could change.  Stopping the cycle to which I referred is one of the most significant things we can do.<\/p><p> We are delighted to see the ability programme happen.  There has been really good consultation with the sector as to how it should be framed and played out.  However, this is a follow-on from a previous programme called the disability activation project, DACT, which WALK was originally funded by.  There has been a gap of several years and WALK has had to fight for funding in the meantime.  People were being dropped and picked up according to the availability of funding.  I am concerned to see whether the issues that arose out of the review of that have been brought over to the new funding programme.  There is one outstanding issue which we have been trying to raise with them, namely, that assistive technology and technology in general is part of the future workplace.  This is not about stacking shelves.  Work is changing for all of us.  I can work out of my bag here and I am sure most members can do likewise.  We do not seem to understand that people with disabilities might be able to do likewise or be able to avail of more flexible working arrangements, working from home, etc.  The ability programme has introduced the capacity to use assistive technology but those delivering the programme cannot give people with disabilities the technology they use without taking it off them again when they are finished the programme.  It is as if, because they are no longer engaged with the programme, those delivering the programme say, \"Thank you very much.  We will take that back now.\"  How can this be in the service of the people looking for work?<\/p><p> I could go on but I will hand over to Mr. Lysaght.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan O'Donnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516876200,"counter":1241,"content":"<p>I wish to make a quick point.

Deputy Carey asked what practical things we can do every day.  I will outline two.  I was not always on DA.  I first went onto jobseeker's allowance for a few years.  That was fine in 2008 when the Government was investing in getting people off jobseeker's and into employment and was providing job recruitment services for people on jobseeker's, as members are aware.  I went to the social welfare services and found them very helpful.  I used computers to research and look for jobs.  Then I decided to go on DA because it was a lot more structured and a sustainable payment for my disability.  The moment I went onto DA I lost access to that recruitment service.  The services providers said: \"Sorry, you are not in our remit.  We only look after people on jobseeker's.\"  People on DA are the most vulnerable people in the country and need that little extra help finding a job, and then it is taken away from them.  That is a practical thing that can be done: stop that and provide that service to people on DA.<\/p> <p>  Another practical thing that I quite often come up against is access to form writing.  As part of my cerebral palsy I have a shake in my hand and, like many people with cerebral palsy, find it hard to write.  Still, for many Department services one must fill in forms by hand.  I cannot do that.  I still have to go through the embarrassment of asking someone else to fill it out for me.  We live in a world where we can control a robot on the other side of the world, yet we cannot put forms online.  If they are online, I have no problem filling them in, but we still get paper ones, which is a barrier for me.  They are two practical things that can be achieved.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Murphy said something that struck me about our Government's approach and society's approach and society seeing people on jobseeker's, DA or lone parent support as dependants.  I can tell the committee from my own experience - and I guarantee members it is across the board - that this has a detrimental effect on the mental well-being of the person because no one, disabled, lone parent or able-bodied, likes to be seen as a dependant or a burden on someone.  We quite often feel we have to justify why we are getting DA, why we are getting &euro;220 a week.  We are told by such people: \"We are paying taxes and going to work.\"  I would love to do that but I cannot.  That was a mental burden on me - and it is not just me, it is across the board.  Again, it is back to that word, \"attitude\".  We need to change that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Lysaght"},{"type":"speech","time":1516876200,"counter":1244,"content":"<p>Before I conclude, do colleagues with to make any further brief comments or are they all happy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018012500002#M00500","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1516876200,"counter":1245,"content":"<p>It is as much an invitation to the committee as to the witnesses.
