This morning's Commencement matter follows one I raised on 12 November with regard to disability services in Cavan and Monaghan.  That matter concerned waiting times for joint physiotherapy and occupational therapy assessment in the HSE.  Since then I have been inundated by parents contacting me with their own experiences and stories of the disability services for children and young people in Cavan and Monaghan.  Their stories tell of despair, concern and, in some cases, anger at what they feel is a system that is failing their children's needs.<\/p><p>My office is contacted weekly by parents of children who have great difficulty getting answers from the HSE with regard to diagnostic assessments or access to therapies for their children.  Many of those waiting on those appointments are in their formative years.  It is not just the odd case; it is becoming the rule rather than the exception.  Many of the problems I hear of stem from what happens once children transfer from Enable Ireland to the child development team.  Instead of just taking my word for it, I will read some accounts into the record.  One parent said:<\/p><blockquote>My experience is one of a child already diagnosed transitioned from enable Ireland to CDT 2006, put on a waiting list for over two years for OT and SLT.  The result - regressed so severely - now in a residential therapeutic assessment center.  The progressing disability is a result of initial poor services.  Presently my child&rsquo;s care and therapies are costing the government a lot more had they addressed the needs earlier.<\/blockquote> <p>Another parent wrote:<\/p><blockquote>6 year old transfers from enable Ireland to Child development team and has to rejoin the nearly 3 year waiting list for OT!!!!  This child is diagnosed and recurring treatment since he was 2!  He will be nearly 9 before he sees someone again!!!  It's just horrendous!<\/blockquote> <p>Another parent wrote:<\/p><blockquote>Our son was referred from Enable Ireland to the Child Development Team in Cavan in July 2014 and have recently been informed by the HSE that he won't have access to Joint Physiotherapy\/Occupational Therapy Assessment till MARCH 2017.  We have a Physiotherapy Home Plan dated 2012 - we are left on our own with no support.<\/blockquote> <p>Another wrote:<\/p><blockquote>6 year old son is autistic and was transferred from enable to the child development team in June 2015.  We have just received our first speech and language session however I'm told that the wait for Occupational Therapy will be 2 years 11 months.<\/blockquote> <p>When the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was in the House last, she noted:<\/p><blockquote>Between 2010 and 2014 there was a 32% increase in referrals of children to the physiotherapy and occupational therapy service in Cavan-Monaghan.  In 2010, there were 221 children referred for assessment.This figure increased to 292 in 2014.<\/blockquote> <p>Furthermore, she advised that &quot;Cavan-Monaghan is restructuring its services in line with the national programme for progressing disability services for children and young people.&quot;  She continued:<\/p><blockquote>The Cavan-Monaghan implementation plan for progressing disability services for children and young people proposes the establishment of a network of paediatric teams at primary care level as this will facilitate children with non-complex needs accessing services in primary care, as appropriate.  The establishment of these teams at primary care level should ensure that therapy services for children are more accessible and available within acceptable timeframes.<\/blockquote> <p>An implementation plan that will ensure therapy services for children are more accessible and are available within accessible timeframes is welcome.  I welcome it.  This plan should be rolled out as a matter of priority.  Saying that there is a plan and advising that there are proposals in place will not alleviate the burdens of assessment and waiting times in the short term. <\/p> Snippet Ref No: B00100 ...

I have a few questions on the specific services that are being restructured and proposed in Cavan-Monaghan.  While the Minister of State may not be able to answer them this morning, I would be appreciative were he to refer them on for a response.  Can a timeframe be provided?  In addition, for those interested parents and families affected directly by this issue, can the Minister of State advise how the plan can help their children?  Essentially, how will this plan help those children on the waiting list at present and those who are being put on it and who may be in the middle of a long wait for assessment or services?  Will it mean availability and access will be facilitated in the next month, three months, six months or a year?  Alternatively, will it only help those who will be referred in the future?  In the last contribution, when I asked when the networks were to be established, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, advised the process would take time.  I accept that change takes time and that overhauling or implementing a new system cannot happen overnight.  However, as the Minister of State noted, the demand for services is growing, as evidenced in the surge in referrals.  I would welcome the indication of a timeframe as to how this change is to happen, when or how the network teams are to be built up, when gaps are identified and when posts will be allocated.  It would go some way to allaying the concerns of parents who truly believe their children are being lost in the system.Snippet Ref No: B00200 ...

Toisc go bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Lynch, as l&aacute;thair inniu, tabharfaidh mise an freagra a bhaineann leis an &aacute;bhar f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach seo.  The Government is committed to providing and developing services for children with special needs and to improving access by these children to therapy services, in so far as possible, within available resources.  As the Senator will be aware, health-related therapy supports and interventions for such children can be accessed through both the HSE's primary care services and its disability services depending on the level of need.  Significant additional resources have been invested in recent years in the State's primary care and disability services with a view to enhancing therapy service provision.  For example, in 2013, additional funding of &euro;20 million was allocated to strengthen primary care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts.  The HSE also has recognised that its early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities must be standardised.  To this end, a major reconfiguration of therapy resources for children with disabilities aged up to 18 years is currently under way.  This involves pooling the resources of all service providers in defined geographical areas.  The HSE's national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people up to 18 years of age aims to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services regardless of where they live, what school the child attends or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.  Implementation of this programme is taking place on phased basis in consultation with stakeholders, including service users and their families.  It is a key priority for the executive's social care directorate.  An additional &euro;4 million was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million, equating to &euro;6 million in a full year, has been provided this year to support its ongoing implementation.  Full implementation of the programme is expected before the end of 2016.  Reconfiguration of disability services in line with this programme is already under way in Cavan-Monaghan.  I understand that four additional therapy posts have been allocated to the region to date to assist in this process, comprising two speech and language therapy posts, an occupational therapy post and a social worker post.  To date, two early intervention teams are being operated by Enable Ireland in line with the programme's policy and two school-age teams in the area are due to be reconfigured by the end of this year.  It should be remembered that moving to this new service model is complex and requires considerable preparatory work on the part of the multi-agency local implementation group, in collaboration with all key stakeholders, to ensure as smooth a transition as possible.  Clear integrated policies, procedures and protocols must be developed, together with a clear governance structure for the newly-formed multi-agency and multidisciplinary teams.  While the HSE is facing challenges in some areas in meeting the statutory timeframes that apply to the assessment of need process under the Disability Act in light of the number and complexity of current cases, I understand there are no particular problems at present in Cavan-Monaghan and that assessments are being carried out in a timely fashion.  Research conducted by the National Disability Authority into the statutory assessment of need, AON, process has found that where services are reorganised on an integrated basis, such as under the model advocated by the progressing disability services programme, the statutory assessment process works more smoothly.  I assure the Senator that improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  In this context, further funding of &euro;8 million is being provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy through primary care services and to support the re-organisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the progressing disability services programme.Snippet Ref No: B00300 ...

I raise the need for him to clarify the issue of a second year of free preschool care for a child who already has received his or her first year of free preschool care.  I have met a number of people who had children who were almost four but had missed the cut-off date to enable them to attend school.  As they already had participated in the preschool year, they wished to participate in a second year and the parents felt that, in such circumstances, they should be entitled to a second year.Snippet Ref No: B00600 ... Edit Snippet  |  Insert Snippet  |  Delete Snippet |  Insert Heading  |  Quick Edit   [Speaker]   Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy James Reilly): I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address this matter.  The early childhood care and education programme was introduced in 2010.  Aligned with the school year, the programme provides one year, that is, the 38 weeks of the academic year, of free preschool to every child before he or she starts primary school.  At present, children aged between three years and two months and four years and seven months in the September of the enrolment year qualify for the programme.  This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 qualify for the preschool provision in the current school year.  Children born after 30 June qualify in the school year commencing in September 2016.  In budget 2016, I announced additional funding of &euro;85 million for the child care sector to support the achievement of affordable, accessible and high-quality child care.  This funding represents an increase of 33% in the annual investment in child care supports in my Department and allows us to deliver significant enhancements to a number of child care support programmes.  Given what is known about the importance of quality investment in the early years, I am pleased the Government has been able to implement one recommendation of the expert advisory group on the early years strategy, which also was made by the interdepartmental group on future investment in child care I established earlier this year, namely, to provide free preschool care for every child in the country from when he or she turns three until he or she starts primary school.  To ensure that children can benefit from this entitlement at the earliest opportunity, they will be able to join the programme at three different points in the year, as opposed to the current position in which one can only join in September.  In addition to the regular intake point of September, children in future also will be able to join free preschool in January and April.  This new entitlement comes into effect from September 2016.  This start-up date was deliberately chosen.  This new entitlement to free preschool for all children means the number of children who benefit from free preschool is estimated to increase from approximately 67,000 at present to approximately 127,000 children when fully rolled out.  A significant expansion of the capacity of the preschool sector is therefore required.  The September 2016 date was chosen to give providers enough time to make any changes they consider to be necessary to their preschool service and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional numbers that will benefit from the programme.  The three registration points we are providing for in the programme means the total number of weeks children will spend in free preschool will depend on two factors, namely, their birth date and the age at which they start primary school.  Children qualifying for the preschool provision in September 2016 will have a birth date between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013.End of Take<!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Some of these children, those with birth dates between 1 January 2012 and 30 June 2012, will have already qualified for the provision under the age criteria for this year, which I outlined earlier, and are currently availing of the programme.

There is no question that the recent budgetary change represents a major improvement for children.  The specific point in the matter I raise relates to the fact that one of the particular children whose parents I spoke to will start school next September.  The child is already in a second preschool year.  It appears to me that many children would be in that category.  By its nature, the intention of the preschool year was that most children would go to school directly afterwards because there was not a second preschool year but in certain limited cases, parents may take the decision that their child is still a little too young to go to school.  The situation prevailed in advance of the Minister devising the new programme.  I expect that cohort of children to be quite small and in those circumstances, I did not think it would affect the industry and the provisions the Minister has made to cater for the expansion many facilities must undertake.  The crux of the matter is the new entitlement in terms of the cut-off date, which comes into effect from September 2016.  That puts an end to any case the child in question would have for a second preschool year.<\/p> <p>In case the Minister thinks I do not know what I am talking about, a limited number of children are availing of a second preschool year, where that was not the original intention, but who would otherwise have gone to school.  I thought that perhaps the second half of that year could have come under the remit of the new regulations for children who are already in the system.  I do not anticipate the number involved would be large.  However, I appreciate the great efforts that have been made to introduce the second preschool year and the attempt to get children into preschool at different stages with the three entry points.  I congratulate the Minister on his work in that regard.  I do not know the number of children in the category I have raised but perhaps the Minister considers it would be too many to facilitate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#C00200","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>It is just a technical situation.  To be honest, nobody has lost out as a consequence of the change, although some have not gained as much as others.  Senator Noone's point about the school starting age is an issue that did consume us for a while.  We were very concerned about the fact that due to expense, many parents feel under pressure to send their children to school a little bit younger than they might otherwise like to.  International evidence shows us that in some such instances, children are disadvantaged because they are not as intellectually mature or physically mature.  By extending the programme from three years to three years and two months and stopping at five and a half years rather than four years and seven months, we will double the number of children in the preschool sector in a couple of years.  That was done purposely in order that the sector itself would grow into the space and grow capacity because there was concern that providers would not be able to cope.<\/p> <p>I pay tribute to preschool leaders and providers who perform a most valuable service.  This service has been proven not alone to improve the ability of children to read and in other areas but also in terms of being able to socialise.  Another benefit is that later in life, they might attain higher educational achievements, which also leads to better employability and more independence for them.  The core of what we are doing is to try to give every child a fair chance because some children, through no fault of their own, are disadvantaged and that must be addressed.  They are the ones who have been shown to gain the most from the preschool curriculum.  I am very pleased with the new scheme which means that children from the age of three onwards will be able to stay in preschool until they are ready to go to school at five years and six months.

Senator Mooney has highlighted a case in which coastal erosion is posing a threat to an imposing and historic building.  In other cases, coastal erosion may threaten human life, land or infrastructure such as roads.  However, it must be recognised that coastal erosion also has beneficial effects such as providing natural nourishment and supply of sediment to adjacent beaches.  Due to the considerable extent and nature of the Irish coastline impacted by erosion and the fact it is an ongoing natural process, it would be uneconomical and impractical for the State to protect all of this coastline.  That is the balance the Office of Public Works, in conjunction with local authorities, needs to strike.<\/p> <p>In the first instance, it is a matter for local authorities to identify and prioritise areas of their respective coastlines considered to be under significant threat from erosion and to put forward proposals central government for funding of appropriate erosion management measures.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Office of Public Works has a scheme in place entitled the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.  Under this scheme, applications are considered for measures costing not more than &euro;500,000 in each instance.  Studies are also funded under this scheme.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for eligible projects.  Any approach to addressing problems of coastal erosion must be informed by an assessment of the risks involved, in some cases a do nothing or no active intervention approach might well be the most appropriate management response and international studies have borne this out.  Some previous interventions to solve local erosion problems have exacerbated coastal erosion at other locations or have generated other environmental problems.  It is quite a complex matter.<\/p><p>The OPW requires that proposals and funding applications for structural measures to prevent and mitigate coastal erosion should be done in conjunction with an appropriate coastal erosion risk management study which fully investigates, substantiates and demonstrates the merits of any measures being proposed.  Such measures usually require the investment of substantial amounts of public funds.  In order to ensure value for money, it is considered best practice to carry out a study in advance of undertaking any measures.  A study should include technical, economic, social and environmental criteria and should ensure that due consideration is given to the full range of management options.  I understand that the local authority, in this case, Leitrim County Council, is considering making an application to the Office of Public Works, under the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme for funding of a coastal erosion risk management study at Tynte Lodge.  Council officials have sought a meeting with the OPW to discuss how the case may be progressed and I am happy to confirm to Senator Mooney that my office will make senior engineering staff available to meet with council officials in the near future to explain the guidelines relevant to the minor works scheme so that they can submit the best possible application.

These volunteers are either retired teachers, those who are studying for their higher diploma in education or social studies students who are assisting in providing one to one education for these 45 children.  Last year, nine children sat the junior certification examination and two sat the applied leaving certificate.<\/p> <p>The total funding the facility is getting from the Department of Education and Skills is &euro;47,500 for the entire year.  Up to last year, the Christian Brothers were able to provide &euro;100,000 per annum but are no longer able to do so.  A group has put together a package to provide the facility with &euro;40,000 per year for the next ten years.  A small amount of money is being given to it and it will not be able to remain open if it does not get adequate funding.  Some &euro;47,500 is not adequate and it needs State investment.  It is getting some hours from the education and training board but it is not adequate.<\/p> <p>Let me put this into context.  In July, I visited Oberstown where are 46 detainees.  My information is that 241 staff work there and it costs &euro;350,000 per detainee per annum, whereas the total allocated to the Cork Life Centre is &euro;47,500 for 45 students.

The centre has the support of the local Garda and all the services.  Even the school attendance officers are referring children the Cork Life Centre because the children do not fit into the school structure and are falling between two stools.  This facility is helping a significant number of children.  It is important it gets adequate funding so that it can continue to provide the support to these children.<\/p> <p>I am requesting co-ordination between the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and, to some extent, the Department of Justice and Equality to ensure the project continues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#D00500","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Burke for raising this important matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I welcome this opportunity to clarify the position of the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p> <p>As Senator Burke will be aware, the Cork Life Centre is an out-of-school educational facility in Sundays Well, Cork, which supports young people who are not engaging with mainstream education.  The Cork Life Centre was established by the Christian Brothers in 1996, with the assistance of the Holy Faith Sisters to provide education and other supports for young people between the ages of 12 and 18 years who are out of the mainstream school system.  The centre prepares young people for the junior certificate and for other education and training pathways.  In recent years, a number of young people have completed leaving certificate studies and accessed further and third level education.<\/p> <p>The Department's contribution to the funding of the centre commenced in 2000 under the children at risk fund, CAR, and has continued to date to the current level of &euro;47,500 in non-pay funding and 968 teaching hours at a cost of &euro;81,840.  This represents an overall annual total of &euro;129,340.  With the hours allocated, tutors are employed by the Cork Education and Training Board, ETB, to work in the centre and deliver tuition in subjects across the post-primary school curriculum.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Education and Skills is aware that Cork Life Centre is currently experiencing financial difficulties due to a combination of a decision by its main funder, the Christian Brothers, to withdraw direct funding to the centre, and a decision by the centre to expand its enrolment.  In this regard, it is important to note that the Department has not reduced its funding or support to the centre in recent years.  Rather it has maintained its contribution to the cost of education provision to its current level of just over &euro;129,000 per annum, broken down as I have outlined.<\/p> <p>The Minister is also aware that the numbers attending the Cork Life Centre have increased in recent years.  The life centre has advised the Department that the number of pupils enrolled in the centre has increased from 11 in 2009 to the current number of over 40 in the current school year.  The Minister is advised that the pupil cohort currently attending the Life Centre includes referrals by Tusla's educational welfare and child and family services, the HSE's child and adult mental health service, CAMHS and other health professionals.<\/p> <p>As Senator Burke is aware, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, which provides educational welfare services is the statutory body with responsibility for the administration of educational welfare functions contained in the Education Welfare Act 2000.  These include assisting parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child and ensuring school attendance, participation and retention for all pupils.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Tusla is also responsible for the provision of supports for children in the care of its child and family services.<\/p><p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has confirmed to the Minister for Education and Skills that Tusla refers young people to the Life Centre because of their complexity of needs which are not only educational but also social and emotional and because of the multi-disciplinary and holistic approach of the centre.

This is the first time I have seen the figure of &euro;129,000.  The Minister of State is correct in saying that 925 hours are allocated by the ETB but the problem with 925 hours is that it only equates to 1.5 teachers for the year for 45 students who have dropped out of school.  These children have not fitted into the existing education system, as the Minister of State pointed out.  A sum of &euro;100,000 was being provided by the Christian Brothers for administrative and other supports for the people working at the centre.  Were it not for the 16 people who are working there on a voluntary basis, the service would not be provided at all.

In fairness to the Minister for Education and Skills, a representative from her office phoned me this morning to apologise for her absence this morning.  I understand she is attending an EU meeting abroad and I fully appreciate her responsibility in that regard.  However, we are now falling between three stools, that is, between the Departments of Justice and Equality, Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs.  All I am saying is that if the centre is given adequate funding, it will save the Department of Justice and Equality a lot of money in the longer term.  The Government must get its act together on this.  The Life Centre provides a great service and the staff working there are hugely committed, particularly those who are working on a voluntary basis.  The least we can do is give the centre a bit more support.  We need the &euro;100,000 the Christian Brothers were providing up until recently.  The Government must replace that funding; otherwise, the facility cannot stay open.  Simple issues like insurance, maintenance costs and so forth must be taken into account but the sum of &euro;47,500 will not suffice.

As he has rightly stated, the Minister for Education and Skills would have liked to be here this morning but she is currently abroad on Government business.  A key consideration for the Minister in this matter is the Department's policy of inclusion, where the objective is for children to be educated within the mainstream system to the greatest extent possible, although obviously that is not always possible.  In this regard, it is important to note that the level of additional supports provided to schools to meet a range of additional educational pupil needs has increased significantly since the Department first began funding the Life Centre in 2000.  The Minister must also take account of the Department's funding of national programmes catering for early school leavers in the Cork area.  It is very important that the supports provided by the Department to schools are fully availed of by students who need them, both to ensure value for the investment being made and in recognition of the importance of early intervention in meeting individual needs.<\/p> <p>The Minister is committed to working with her colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to ensure the particular needs of this student cohort can be met.

These include counselling and therapeutic services, which are considered to be of particular benefit.  <\/p> <p>The Minister has assured me that she will work with her colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to ensure the needs of these students are met.

In the past few years I have spoken about Fampyra, a drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  It took 18 months to have it put on the list.  It seems we spend an inordinate length of time in giving effect to EU approvals.  I have also written to the chief executive of the Health Service Executive, asking for a timeframe in giving effect to the EU approval of this drug.

The Personal Injuries Assessment Board was established in 2004, which is more than 11 years ago.  Its activities should be reviewed to see if it is working.  From what I can see, it appears more inclined to settle claims without really defending them.  This adds to the situation regarding excessive and allegedly fraudulent claims and is affecting the insurance costs of every individual in the country.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Terry Leyden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Insurance is very important and motor insurance specifically because this is what the board was really set up to deal with.  It assesses claims but it is taken as a <i>fait accompli <\/i>that somehow the claim is legitimate.  One particular claim has been brought to my attention. It was made in February 2015 for injuries that occurred on 23 December 2014, and the individual had already made two other motor claims in 2011 and in 2012.  Either it was a very unfortunate driver or a bad driver, but whichever the case might be, it seems a very convenient way of raising funds.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board is not defending the cases.  Once a doctor, a GP or a medical officer, gives a report saying that the person has some sort of injuries, then the board just settles without any debate, defence or investigation.  I ask that the Leader would, in the new year, invite the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to come to the House to review the working of the board.  Some of the claims that have been awarded have been higher than claims in the UK.  A claim for whiplash, for example, should be the same in adjoining countries.  There is no reason a person should be compensated more in Ireland than in the UK.  It would be worthwhile to look at these issues.  The Bill in question was passed through this House when former Deputy Mary Harney was the Minister and former Senator Joe O'Toole was vice chairman of the Personal injuries Assessment Board when it was established in 2004.  While the Senator had every right to be a member of that board, it was unusual for a Member of the Oireachtas to be on that board.  I ask that the Minister would consider a review of the board to see if it could be more fit for purpose.  <br\/><br\/>I will give an example.  A claim can be made within two years of an event.  Surely a person would know within weeks or months if they were injured.  Two years is a long time during which a person can decide if they are affected by some scratch to a car or somebody running into a car and then claim.  Such a claim could be sent into the board which might say: &quot;Yes, how much do you want?&quot;  The person could say: &quot;We'll settle for &euro;7,000 or &euro;8,000&quot; to which the board could say &quot;Excellent&quot;, sending a cheque and closing the file but it is the ordinary citizen who picks up the pieces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#H01700","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I remind those present that today is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.

Great praise is due to the Minister of State.  We had dialogue on Committee Stage and it was important that the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey recognised the role of the Seanad in advising on environmental matters such as climate change.  The timing works well because the Paris Conference on environment and climate change, COP 21, will go ahead at the end of this month, despite the problems in Paris, so it is an important item on the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>I also note there are some 294 amendments to the Legal Services Regulation Bill, about 240 in the name of the Minister.  This shows the important role of the Seanad in the dialogue we have with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald because the Bill will be completely different from the one which was passed by the D&aacute;il due to points raised in this House.

No. 47, which has one of those mysterious small numbers referred to by Senator Norris, remains outstanding.  It was an attempt to leverage the ability of the Government to borrow money at low cost to help to increase the supply of housing at average or below average prices.  That would contrast with the previous regime where the banking inquiry found that 29 people had borrowed &euro;34 billion and sent the bill to the taxpayer.  No. 47 is in line with a new way of looking at housing costs at below average and average prices, not lining the pockets of millionaires and billionaires, as happened the last time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#J00800","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I echo the call I made yesterday for the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and the HSE to actively engage with the Workplace Relations Commission to avert the proposed strike for 15 December.

There are problems in the health service at the moment.  The State has an ageing population, we have an increasing population and there has been major under-investment in facilities for the last decade.  However, the emergency department task force which was put in place earlier in 2015 is making progress.  There are fewer people on trolleys than there were a year ago and 200 additional hospital beds have been opened since October 2015 with more coming on stream.

I support the proposed amendment to the Order of Business.  For almost six months now, Senators from Government and Opposition have been calling for the Minister for Health to come before the Seanad, not to deal with legislation but to take statements on health care.  An awful lot has happened in those six months.  The Government has abandoned the plan for universal health insurance.  We have chaos in accident and emergency wards across the State.  Capacity has been stripped from our hospitals because of five budgets delivered by this Government.<\/p> <p>Every single Government representative has to take responsibility for what is happening in our health service.  It is wrong for any Government Senator, be it Senator Mullins or anyone else, to put the blame for whatever chaos they say might arise from industrial action on the shoulders of the nurses.  They are operating on the front line under fierce pressure, and have been for years, because of the policies adopted by Fine Gael and the Labour Party and decisions the current Government took when it voted for budgets that took billions of euro out of the health service.<\/p> <p>In the Leader's own county there are 300 fewer staff at University Hospital Waterford.  One and a half surgical theatres are lying idle because we do not have the nurses, doctors or consultants to make sure people are treated.  The Leader knows the figures because I have presented them to him before.  The result is over 8,000 patients waiting longer than 12 months, with pressure points in orthopaedics, ophthalmology, and ear nose and throat, where people are waiting in some cases over two years.  We still do not have 24-7 cardiology.  We do not have the palliative care unit we were promised.  We do not have the community nursing unit we were promised.  That is why we have pressure in our accident and emergency ward in University Hospital Waterford.  That is why we have the lead consultant talking about the chaos in that department.  It is a symptom of all the other failures of this Government.<\/p> <p>It is good that at some point the Minister for Health might come before the Seanad but that is not going to provide one extra bed, nurse or doctor, or one extra cent for the health service.  If the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is coming into the Seanad, I want him to present a plan on how we deal with this problem.  It is at crisis point and it is not fair to blame the nurses.  They are going on strike not because they want to but because they are forced into it by the unbearable conditions in which they are being asked to work.  That is the responsibility of the Leader and the Minister.  I ask the Leader to get the Minister into the House so we can have a debate, but let him come with an action plan and let him tell us how he and the Government - the Labour Party and Fine Gael - are going to do something about the crisis in our health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#K00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>We would all welcome the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to the House for a further debate on health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#K00300","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#K00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>To be fair to the Minister, he is always very accommodating with this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#K00500","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Not for questions and answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#K00600","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>When he was only in his ministerial role about five or six days, he came in and took a Private Members' motion which I had tabled, to which he gave a very comprehensive response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#K00700","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Well done.

This is not that they might see ahead of them but to ensure that they are seen.  It is particularly important that motorbikes are seen.  All cars in the European Union manufactured after 2011 have daytime running lights, DRLs, to improve safety.  However, what about cars that were manufactured before that?  In 2012, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, said that Ireland's motorists could be obliged within three years to keep their headlights on at all times in an effort to improve road safety.  He said that the Road Safety Authority was likely to consider the measure by 2015.  It is now almost the end of 2015 but an initiative in this regard has not been introduced.  The Road Safety Authority encourages motorists to use dimmed headlights on a voluntary basis.  It believes the cost of forcing motorists to have DRLs fitted to their cars retrospectively would outweigh any safety benefits.  Could motorists be required to use headlights at all times, as is the case in other countries?  I have a list of the other countries where they are obliged to use them.  Studies have shown that where motorists are obliged to use their headlights at all times, it is likely to reduce accident rates by a certain percentage.  This matter is worthy of consideration and it should be brought to the attention of the current Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  We should do this because it could save lives.  It would simply involve following what other countries in Europe already do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#L00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Paul Coghlan about locating fast food outlets in close proximity to schools.

The figures that were published in the media in the past few weeks were distorted and have been proven to be inaccurate.  The figure given in the media was 40%, which compared very unfavourably with the UK rate.  However, it was clarified this morning that these figures were based on summonses rather than convictions and that, in fact, Ireland has a very high conviction rate for drunk driving at over 85%.  The message is loud and clear - if one drinks, one does not drive.<\/p> <p>Another statistic emerged this morning from the Road Safety Authority.  Please God and fingers crossed we will end this year with no more road deaths.  The figures indicate that this year we will have the best road safety record for decades if the current trend continues.  The figures for the period up to this week indicate that 30 fewer people have died than in the comparable period last year, which is, thank God, a great statistic.  Every life lost is an unnecessary loss.  The statistics show, however, that 65 people died as a result of not wearing seat belts.  That is astonishing.  Imagine, in this day and age, that 65 people - both drivers and passengers - died on our roads because they were not wearing seat belts.  What madness is that?  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to embark immediately on a nationwide media campaign to inform people not only of their legal obligation but also of the folly of not wearing a seat belt?  Such a campaign should highlight, as graphically as possible, the consequences of not wearing a seat belt, regardless of whether one is a driver or a passenger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#L00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Senators have mentioned locating fast food outlets near schools.

If we are serious about health issues, then let us at least resolve this one as it affects hospitals.  On one hand, we are facing a major task in tackling obesity but, on the other, we are providing vending machines in hospitals.  I have no difficulty with staff requiring access to vending machines but the machines should not be placed close to a children's unit in a hospital.  The reason many hospitals give for having vending machines is that they are good for providing money.  This must be examined.  There should be a policy in the HSE on this matter.  The issue of locating fast food outlets near schools might not necessarily be within our control at this stage but this matter is within our control and we should deal with it.

I was watching CNN at the weekend and it seemed to me there was nothing but wall-to-wall coverage of ISIS.  I heard an envoy of President Obama speak about the need to isolate and slaughter.

Last month the Government announced a responsible, balanced and pro-employment budget.  The social welfare package included in the budget was carefully designed to ensure a number of core groups would benefit.  They include pensioners; families with children, including lone parents; carers, and people with disabilities.  The budget was prepared in the context of the country moving in the right direction, with living standards gradually being raised in every home.<\/p> <p>My Department has carried out a social impact assessment of the main tax and social welfare measures included in budget 2016.  This assessment was based on the tax and welfare micro-simulation model, SWITCH, which had been developed by the ESRI.  Social impact assessment is an evidence-based methodology which is used to estimate the likely effects of policies on household incomes, families, poverty and incentives to take up employment.  The assessment found that average household incomes would increase by 1.6% or &euro;14.30 per week as a result of budget 2016.  Importantly, there are higher than average gains for the bottom two quintiles, the lowest income households in society, while the smallest gain is for those in the top quintile.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The biggest beneficiaries are lone parents, dual and non-earning couples with children, with an average gain of 2%.  Non-earning lone parents and single earning couples with children fare above average, gaining around 1.8%.  I should emphasise that child benefit expenditure, although universal, favours lower income households.  Budget 2016, therefore, will deliver considerably bigger gains for the poorest households.<\/p><p>I refer to the State pension and the Christmas bonus.  Throughout the worst of the crisis, the Government protected the State pension.  I am particularly pleased that the Bill provides for an increase of &euro;3 a week for pensioners and carers aged 66 years and over.  It is small, but it is important to indicate that circumstances are getting better.  There is also an increase of &euro;2 a week for adult dependants aged under 66 years and an increase of &euro;2.70 for adult dependants aged 66 or over.  This will benefit 583,000 pensioners and more than 93,000 qualified adults and is the first weekly rate increase for pensioners since 2009.  That is important because they have been without an improvement in weekly income for quite a long time.  There has been a significant welcome from pensioners for the fact that we are able to increase payment rates.  This is all part of our approach of properly assisting the different groups in society, most particularly those who are less well off and vulnerable.  Pensioners asked us to maintain the free travel scheme and we have done so.  The budget added &euro;3 million in additional funding to the scheme, making a total of &euro;80 million in 2016.  Pensioners value their free travel.<\/p><p>On Monday the Ministers for Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform signed the regulations for the payment of a 75% Christmas bonus which will benefit older people, carers, people with disabilities, long-term jobseekers and lone parents at a financially stressful time of the year.  We hope the first payments will be made in the first week of December.  This will mean a bonus payment of &euro;141 for a single person on disability allowance, while a pensioner couple, both of whom are in receipt of the non-contributory State pension will receive a bonus payment of &euro;328.50.  Some 1.23 million people will receive the Christmas bonus in the first week of December and we make absolutely no apologies for paying it.  Our focus is on ensuring we can improve circumstances for every person, not just a few.  Importantly, the bonus is spent in the local economy in businesses and stores, providing a stimulus for communities across the country.<\/p><p>When the Government took office, there were grave fears that the numbers unemployed would exceed 500,000.  The deficit in the Social Insurance Fund was heading towards &euro;2 billion and unemployment would eventually peak at 15.1%.  It is currently 8.9%.  Therefore, we now have an unemployment rate under 9% for the first time since December 2008.  Employment increased by 56,000 in the past 12 months, which means that more than 1,000 people are returning to work every week.  There has been an increase of 59,400 in full-time employment in the past year, with a corresponding fall of 3,400 in part-time work.  This means that more than 1,100 people are returning to full-time employment every week.  It is welcome that people are securing full-time employment rather than being under-employed or in part-time work.  This is making a significant difference not only to the people concerned but also to their families.  There are still, however, too many people unemployed, but it is clear that unemployment is falling rapidly, thanks to the sustained focus of the Government on restoring the economy to growth and helping people back to work.  The Government has ensured there has been a focus on a jobs-led recovery.  <\/p><p>As a result of people returning to work in high volumes and more employers being able to reward employees with pay increases, the Social Insurance Fund has been transformed.  The 2016 budget estimate provides for Social Insurance Fund income to increase to almost &euro;8.9 billion in 2016, with expenditure estimated at &euro;8.67 billion.  This means that there will be a projected surplus of &euro;216 million in the fund, the first such surplus since 2007.  If we can continue to increase the surplus, those who have contributed to their pensions can be confident that they will receive their pensions and that we will be able to improve them as time passes.  The certainty that pension levels will be maintained with the possibility of increases is significantly important, especially to older people.<\/p><p>The increase in the minimum wage to &euro;9.15 an hour from next January is a hugely important measure for low paid workers.  We made a pledge earlier this year that if we increased the minimum wage, we would address PRSI \"step-effects\" arising from such an increase and we are doing so in the Bill.  The measures will reduce the weekly PRSI bill for more than 88,000 employees and ensure the benefit of a national minimum wage increase will be felt by all those in receipt of it.  This is, of course, in addition to the gains from the USC changes announced on budget day.  This is the second time the national minimum wage has been increased under the Government and while there is a still a distance to go, the increases have been welcomed.<\/p><p>The legislation provides for a &euro;5 increase in the rate of child benefit, making it the second budget in a row in which child benefit has been increased.  This will bring the monthly rate from &euro;135 to &euro;140 per child, with effect from 1 January 2016.  Child benefit is a crucial support for families, in particular, low and middle income families, through difficult times.  A total of 623,000 families and almost 1.2 million children will benefit from the increase.  <\/p><p>The introduction of a paternity benefit scheme to take effect from next September was also announced in the budget.  The family income supplement income threshold is also being increased by &euro;5 a week for each of the first two children from next January.  This will mean an additional &euro;3 or &euro;6 a week for in excess of 59,000 low income working families with a total of more than 131,000 children.  <\/p><p>The Minister will shortly make regulations to provide for an increase in the earnings disregard for jobseeker's transition payment, from &euro;60 to &euro;90 per week.  The improved disregard will apply to existing and new recipients from next January.  All earnings above &euro;90 will be assessed at a rate of 50% from January; they are currently assessed at a rate of 60%.  <\/p><p>Funding for the school meals programme will increase by &euro;3 million next year to &euro;42 million.  The programme currently benefits 217,000 children in more than 1,700 schools and other organisations.  The allocation of an additional &euro;3 million in 2016 will be used to provide breakfast for an additional 27,800 pupils or lunch or a light meal for almost 12,000 additional pupils.<\/p><p>As is very clear from the figures I gave, the strong economic recovery we can see around us is, above all, jobs-led.  That is crucial because secure and fairly paid work remains the best protection against poverty.  The budget is, therefore, pro-work.  Our aim is to move towards a full employment society, with work for everyone who needs and wants a job.  In the budget increases of &euro;2.50 a week were also announced in the top-up payments for jobseekers availing of the community employment scheme, the rural social scheme, Gateway, job initiatives and other such schemes.  Earlier this year we introduced a new incentive called the back-to-work family dividend which helps jobseekers with families to return to work.  This dividend provides an incentive of &euro;1,550 per child in the first year of employment or self-employment and half that amount in the second year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are currently over 9,500 families and 15,000 children benefitting from the dividend.  This measure, when taken together with the employer incentives such as JobsPlus, will ensure that long-term jobseekers also benefit from the strong recovery in the labour market.<\/p><p>Apart from the rate increases I have already mentioned, the fuel allowance is being increased by &euro;2.50 per week to &euro;22.50 for the duration of the fuel season.  This is another targeted measure and will benefit almost 381,000 households.  The name of the respite care grant scheme is being changed to the carer's support grant.  In light of the hugely important role carers play in our society, I am particularly pleased to announce that the rate of the grant is to be increased by &euro;325 to &euro;1,700 from 1 June 2016.  It will be payable to around 86,000 carers next year.  In another improvement, carer's allowance will now be paid for 12 weeks after the death of the person being cared for, instead of the current duration of six weeks.  I thank the carers' organisations which made that proposal during the course of our pre-budget discussions.<\/p><p>I will now turn to the specific measures in the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title, its construction and collective citation with the Social Welfare Acts and the Pensions Acts.  Section 2 provides for the definition of certain common terms used in Part 2.  Section 3 provides for an increase in the rate of State pension, contributory, and, in respect of persons who are 66 years or older, increases in the rates of the following schemes: widow's, widower's and surviving civil partner's contributory pension, death benefit and disablement pension.  It also provides for increases in rates for qualified adults.<\/p><p>Section 4 and Schedule 1 provide for an increase in the personal and qualified adult rates of State pension, non-contributory.  It also provides for an increase in the rate of carer's allowance for recipients who are 66 years or older.  Section 5 and Schedule 2 provide for the renaming of the respite care grant to carer's support grant.  Many have welcomed this because it recognises what that grant does.  Section 6 provides for an increase of &euro;325 to the carer's support grant, from &euro;1,375 to &euro;1,700.  Section 7 provides for an increase in the monthly rate of child benefit, from &euro;135 to &euro;140.  Section 8 provides for an increase of &euro;5 per week in the family income supplement, FIS, earnings threshold for families with one child and &euro;10 per week in the thresholds for families with two or more children.  This measure comes into operation on 7 January 2016.  Section 9 provides for the period in which carer's allowance is payable following the death of the person being cared for, to be extended to a period of 12 weeks.  Section 10 provides for two changes in pay-related social insurance, PRSI.  A new tapered PRSI credit is being introduced for employees insured at class A whose earnings are between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424 per week.  The upper threshold at which the lower 7.8% class A rate of employer PRSI applies is being increased from &euro;356 to &euro;376 per week.  These measures take effect from 1 January 2016.<\/p><p>As we are all aware, earlier this year we saw the historic result of the marriage equality referendum.  The subsequent legislation, the Marriage Act 2015, was enacted on 29 October.  Sections 11 to 18, inclusive, provide for amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 in light of the enactment of that Act.  Section 19 provides for the inclusion of registered nurses within the definition of medical assessor in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.  These nurses will be employees of the Department.  Section 20 provides for the inclusion of credit unions providing personal micro credit loans among the specified bodies for the purposes of the household budgeting scheme.  Sections 21 to 25, inclusive, provide for amendments of the Pensions Act 1990 to enable the Financial Services Ombudsman to carry out the role, duties and functions of the Pensions Ombudsman in light of the intended merging of those two offices.<\/p><p>The significant social welfare package in this year's budget consists of diverse and complementary elements.  These include the Christmas bonus as well as improvements in a range of payments, benefitting in particular pensioners and retired people, people on disability allowance, carers, families with children and families at work, who have children and are on low incomes.  These positive developments have been made possible by all the taxpayers, workers and employers in the country who pay PRSI.<\/p><p>The fact that so many more businesses and individual workers are getting back to work has been the catalyst that has enabled us to provide for the improvements and changes we have made in the budget and this Bill.  We are always very conscious of our responsibility to ensure that every cent of employee and employer PRSI contributions is used effectively and efficiently.  We are focused on making sure that all social protection monies go to those for whom they are intended, that they get the payments they are entitled to and that the special investigations unit, inspectors and departmental staff will do their best to ensure that nobody can defraud the social welfare system or take money that rightly should go to persons who require it most.<\/p><p>Over the recent very difficult and challenging years, our social welfare system has continued to play an essential role safeguarding the most vulnerable in our society.  We protected that very strong system through the worst of times.  We are now strengthening and improving it in these better times.  The social protection measures contained in budget 2016 and in this Bill are built on the foundations of the recovery.  These measures are targeted at securing improvements in living standards and creating greater opportunities for every person, every family and every community.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#Q00400","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>One has to welcome in principle any increases in social welfare but they have to be put in context.  We believe that the measures contained in this Bill fall far short of what is required to ensure that low income and vulnerable households are protected from poverty and social exclusion.  The small-scale measures contained in the Bill are not sufficient to offset the regressive budgets introduced by this Fine Gael-Labour Government since it took office in 2011.  The Government has been responsible for 40 deep and wide-ranging cuts, the effects of which will be felt by households throughout the country next year: cuts to the household benefits package and fuel allowance; abolition of the telephone allowance and the bereavement grant; reductions in jobseeker's benefit and child benefit, which is still not back to its original level; reductions in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and punitive changes to the eligibility criteria for the one-parent family payment.  These are the hallmarks of the two-tier recovery overseen by this Government.  It has also failed to address the issue of rent supplement.  The gap between market rents and rent supplement ceilings is widening at an alarming rate and the Government has completely ignored this.<\/p> <p>The Social Welfare Bill 2015 only underscores a lack of commitment to the less well off in society in the Government's pursuit of an agenda that punishes the vulnerable and rewards the better off.  The at-risk of poverty rate has risen from 14.4% in 2008 to 15.2% in 2013, the last year for which figures are available.  The consistent poverty rate has risen from 4.2% to 8.2% in that five year period and the deprivation rate has risen from 13.7% to 30.5% in 2013.  Any small gains in the budget must be considered in the context of previous budgets.  To provide the context in which these increases are being legislated, data from the Central Statistics Office reveal that between September of last year and September of this year, prices rose for the following essential goods: overall education costs by 5%; bus fares by 2.7%; travelling by train by 4.6%; house insurance by 6.5%; car insurance by 26.7% and communications, postal and telephone costs by 2.4%.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paschal Mooney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is interesting to look at the response of various organisations and associations involved with the more vulnerable in our society.  The commentary on the measures announced in the Bill has been mixed.  Some stakeholders have welcomed improvements in the rates.  Others noted the Bill has not yet restored the reductions to which I referred and seen in recent years and that the improvements provided for are too limited.  In this context, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul welcomed the thrust of the budget but noted that it was only giving back a small element of the losses people endured in recent years and could have been better targeted.  <br\/><br\/>Social Justice Ireland stated, &quot;Budget 2016 failed to deliver an increase in the minimum social welfare payment - which remains at &euro;188 per week&quot;.  As detailed by it in its pre-budget document, Budget Choices 2016, this payment has remained at this level since January 2011.  Since then inflation has eroded its value, as I pointed out in the earlier statistics.  <br\/><br\/>Age Action, in its reaction to the budget measures, some of which are in the Bill, welcomed the first increase in the State pension in seven years, although anecdotal evidence suggests the general reaction to an increase of a modest &euro;3 has been that it has not gone down well universally.  Before the Minister of State in his reply reminds me that Fianna F&aacute;il proposed a &euro;5 increase in its budget submission, I suggest that a &euro;5 increase would not have gone down all that well either.  A spokesman for Age Action stated that since 2009, an older pensioner on the State pension has seen his or her weekly income cut by more than &euro;13 a week.He noted that all of that cannot be fixed at once.  However, he said that what we have seen would indicate that much more should be done in this regard. <br\/><br\/>In response to the proposed increase in the income thresholds for receipt of the family income supplement, Stuart Duffin of One Family said:<\/p><blockquote>Government has not listened to the calls of many organisations in the voluntary sector to target resources at the poorest children in Ireland rather than giving a pre-election &euro;5 to everyone on Child Benefit.  What low-income working families need is the Family Income Supplement adjusted so that it makes work pay by reducing the qualifying hours to 15 hours per week and tapering the payment; as well as recognising the value and costs of shared parenting by providing the Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit to each parent.<\/blockquote><p>This is a laudable aspiration.<br\/><br\/>Children and families have not been protected in the Bill.  Despite the budget increase of &euro;5, which is welcome, child benefit is still &euro;10 lower than what it was in 2010 when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.  The budget increased the thresholds for the family income supplement by &euro;5 for the first child and &euro;10 for each subsequent child to apparently offset the increase in the national minimum wage, but the increase in thresholds is not enough, given that a 50 cent increase in the national minimum wage means a &euro;20 increase in gross income based on a 40 hour week.<br\/><br\/>Lone parents, for example, have not been referred to.  The change to the eligibility criteria to qualify for the one-parent family payment was a particularly callous move which was opposed by us.  There is little in the budget from which lone parents can take comfort.  We proposed to increase the maximum child age of the one-parent family payment scheme from its current threshold of seven years to 14 years.  I know the argument put forward by the Minister at the time was that we were trying to come into line with European best practice, but we are our own country with our own individual problems that need to be addressed. <br\/><br\/>I welcome the Government's initiative in respect of the increase in the carer's grant, which has been renamed the respite grant.  This has proven to be a popular move and one that is wholeheartedly welcomed.  However, it was only because of the continuous and persistent criticism on the original decision to reduce it by Fianna F&aacute;il in both Houses, allied with all of the various organisations across the country, that this was taken on board by the Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#S00200","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Not at all.

A carer's support grant, previously known as a respite care grant, valued at &euro;1,700 will be paid to 86,000 carers throughout the country at a cost of &euro;30 million.  The increase in family income supplement threshold means that over 59,000 families will benefit.<\/p><p>The Minister of State spoke about the improvements in our economy and referenced, in particular, the drop in unemployment from 15.2% to 8.9%, which is a significant achievement.  I would prefer to say that almost 45% of those who were unemployed five years ago are now working.<\/p><p>The T&uacute;s scheme benefits communities throughout the country.  However, given the increase in employment opportunities, the numbers available for participation in T&uacute;s schemes has reduced significantly.  I am aware of two men who have performed extremely well in my community on the Cooley peninsula who performed well on T&uacute;s schemes.  They are most anxious to continue working after the 52 weeks allowed under the scheme.  Furthermore, the community wants them to continue working and recognises the contribution they have made.  Those men, unfortunately, will have to go back on social welfare at the scheme's end which they do not want to do; they want to work.  Given that the number of people available to embark on T&uacute;s schemes is reducing, the Government should consider extending the schemes from 52 weeks to two years.  Common sense should prevail in this regard.  The managers in charge of the various T&uacute;s schemes should be given the opportunity to acknowledge and recognise the work done by scheme participants.  I am sure there are many T&uacute;s schemes throughout the country experiencing the same difficulty.  The Minister of State would not believe the extent to which the men in question implored me to help them.  They want to continue working, to get up in the morning and contribute to their community.  They do not want to go back to claiming social welfare.  We must look at this issue carefully.  Allowing participants to continue on these schemes for longer would further reduce the unemployment figures.  It might be possible to stipulate that if there are new applicants for the schemes, those who have been participating for longer than a year must come off them to give others a chance.  The schemes could be reviewed two months before their end date to determine whether there are people waiting to replace those already on the schemes.  If there are no new applicants, then those participating should be given the option of extending their contract for a further year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#T01300","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am sure he is delighted to be here as the bearer of good news.  We do not get good news very often but there is a quite a lot of good news in this year's Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  In the lead up to the general election the Government is prioritising legislation which will increase pay rates for civil servants, social welfare recipients and those on the minimum wage.  The first weekly rate increase for pensioners since 2009 is long overdue, as is the extra support for carers.  I am glad to see that the Christmas bonus is will be reintroduced and I hope this money will serve as an economic stimulus and go straight back into local towns and cities across the country.  It is likely that this money will be spent and not saved.  However, as I have stated on many occasions, I am very wary of such broad increases.  For example, the rise in the minimum wage has not been properly thought out.  The minimum wage should have been linked to some basic economic factors, such as inflation or deflation, instead of being increased by a seemingly arbitrary figure.  Similarly, we should be looking at incorporating economic analysis rather than simply implementing rises of a nice, round figure.  I would be interested to hear the reasoning behind the &euro;5 per week increase in family income supplement and child benefit payments and the &euro;3 per week increase in the pension.  I would like to know how the Department came up with these figures.  Is a formula used or did the Department simply opt for round numbers?  How much of a part did economic factors play in deciding those numbers?<\/p><p>In a more general sense, I ask the Minister to make more progress in terms of changing the overall ethos of our social welfare system.  We can utilise some of the best practice employed by our European neighbours in this regard.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister about where we stand in terms of the European model whereby if someone refuses an appropriate job as proposed by a State body, then his or her welfare payments will be cut.  Also, in some EU countries, following receipt of social welfare payments for 12 months, a person is required by the Government to take up a job, say, painting a local school or cleaning the floors of a local hospital, in exchange for social welfare payments.  The point is that if people do not take a job that is reasonable <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>their qualifications and experience, then they lose their benefits.  Indeed, many people here would prefer this to staying at home doing nothing.  The Government has said that it will follow the model of not paying benefits if a person refuses a job or training, as happens in countries like the Netherlands or Germany but will that ever happen?  I ask the Minister of State to give an update on any progress that has been made in this area.<\/p><p>Figures were provided a few years ago which showed that a massive one in seven people on the dole have never worked a day in their lives.  Does the Minister of State have any update on those figures and can he indicate there has been any improvement in this regard?  In the UK, the Government has been trying to tackle this problem by obliging people who are out of work for a long period to work for six months before they can go back to receiving payments.  The idea is to get people back into a working mentality and to allow them to give something back to society.  Has the Minister looked at this area and would the Government consider a similar scheme here?  Long-term unemployment is a big problem and such a concept may form part of the solution.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's views on this idea.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to give some indication of what the Government is doing in the area of child care.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Feargal Quinn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is obvious the cost of child care is a massive barrier to people getting back into the workforce and, thus, reducing their reliance on social welfare payments.  Many European countries have recognised this.  Interestingly in Denmark, families pay up to 25% of the cost of day care, with those on low incomes or single parents paying between nothing and 25% of the cost and with discounts for brothers and sisters.  The Danish Government makes up the difference.  Would our Government be better off putting money into subsidising child care rather than into other forms of social welfare payments?  At the very least, we should be considering a tax credit for child care which would encourage people back to work, especially women.  It may even get highly experienced older women back into work as child minders and have the effect of reducing the number of people on social welfare payments.<br\/><br\/>In 2014, only one family handed back their social welfare payment, saving the State &euro;1,560.  Does the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, have the figures to hand for this year so far?  This is occurring in spite of the fact Ireland has eight billionaires and approximately 20,000 millionaires.  According to a report in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, &quot;If a parent does not wish to claim their child benefit payment, they can notify the Department of Social Protection in writing to that effect and their claim will be stopped in accordance with their wishes.&rdquo;  This seems to be old-fashioned and the system is obviously not working.  Will the Department set up a website where people can give back their child benefit payments more easily?  That would be quite feasible in this era of computerisation and personal public service numbers.  A system like this could save the State money if the Government is not willing to means-test the payment.  Will the Minister of State comment on this idea?  It would be a sensible move, making giving back the money easier.  We are talking about electronic payments.  Surely, this is an area in which the Internet could be used to good effect.  It would not be a controversial development but merely a nudge towards working in that direction.<br\/><br\/>It has been a tough few years and it is welcome that a number of people will get back the benefits they lost over these past few years.  I welcome anything we can do to encourage people back to work rather than just automatically making it easy for them to avoid work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#U00200","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

It is payable over the age of 66 if the recipient does not have a full old age pension.  Perhaps this could be brought forward on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>I welcome the restoration of 75% of the Christmas bonus.  However, I am concerned that not everybody on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will get it.  Some recipients have spent 312 days on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and have moved on to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance but will not get the Christmas bonus because they are not considered long-term unemployed.  Everyone on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance should get the Christmas bonus as they would have been in receipt of a payment for a year.  Will this be examined?  I am delighted we have been able to reverse the cuts we made to child benefit and we are back where we started.  Hopefully, whoever will be in government next year will be in a position to continue that trend.<\/p> <p>The issue of carers has always been a hobby horse of mine.  The Minister of State knows that I have fought long and hard for carers.  Despite Senator Mooney&rsquo;s claim that it was due to Fianna F&aacute;il that this cut was reversed, I can assure him that I have spent the past several years fighting against this cut.  I have worked with the Carers Association and have done my best to get the respite care grant restored.  I am glad to say my work has come to fruition.  I am delighted the respite care grant has been renamed the carer&rsquo;s support grant.  I have listened to people ask why the State should pay for somebody to go on holidays.  Why should the State not pay carers to go on holidays?  They blooming well deserve it and work hard.<\/p> <p>We spoke this morning about hold-ups in accident and emergency departments.  If we did not have carers, the accident and emergency departments would be worse.  Many more people would be in need of beds in hospitals and long-term facilities.  Carers are invaluable.  I have always said, and will say it until I leave this House, that carers are one of this country&rsquo;s most important assets.  I welcome the fact the carer&rsquo;s allowance will now be paid for 12 weeks after the death of the person being cared for.  This gives carers time to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones and to reassess what they will do with themselves.  There are 187,000 carers but only 80,000 get the respite care grant.  That means many carers go unrecognised.  Hopefully, we will be in a position to recognise them.  The means-testing for carers should be totally abolished because they are saving the State a fortune.  What is &euro;204 a week to maintain a person in their home?  I had hoped the telephone allowance would have been restored to carers because it would be invaluable to them to maintain contact with the person they are caring for if they do not live in their home.<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister of State for taking steps to ensure the increase in the minimum wage makes an impact on employees, particularly for families.  Up to now, when a person reached &euro;352 a week, he or she would then enter the PRSI bracket and pay 4% on all his or her income.  This would have resulted in a payment of &euro;14.08.  However, with the introduction of the &euro;12 credit, it means they will only pay &euro;2.08.  This is a good saving for people on low incomes.  I am glad the Minister of State took time to listen to one parent families and increased the disregard for parents on jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment from &euro;60 a week to &euro;90 a week, along with the reduction of the assessment of the balance from 60% to 50%.<\/p> <p>Take the example of someone doing 18 hours&rsquo; work a week.  I use this example because a person working 19 hours can avail of the family income supplement, which is probably more beneficial to him or her.  For somebody working 18 hours, instead of being assessed at &euro;62.82 per week from the minimum wage income, he or she will now be assessed at &euro;37.35, giving him or her an extra payment on the transition payment of &euro;25.47 a week.  Someone working two days, who was being assessed at &euro;51.84 from his or her income of the minimum wage, will now be assessed at &euro;28.20, giving him or her an extra payment on the transition payment of &euro;23.64 extra a week.  That is a good help to parents.  I am sure if their income were being cut by that amount, we would hear all about it.  I am delighted this measure will help them in some way.<\/p> <p>I welcome the increase in the family income supplement.  Families benefited most from this budget with increases in child benefit, family income supplement, changes to jobseeker&rsquo;s transition, the Christmas bonus for in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance and the increase in the respite care grant and the fuel allowance.<\/p> <p>I would like to have seen payments to the under 25s fully restored, however.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Moloney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2356\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2356&amp;amp;pid=MarieMoloney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->After all, a 25 year old could be married and have children.

I agree with him; this is something I have fought for over many years.  It is not a problem for the women who want to go back to work now.  They will be fine because on 6 April 1994, a home-maker's credit was introduced.  They will be able to add that credit to whatever contributions they have paid.  It is the women who were affected by the marriage bar and those who had to give up work before 1994 who are affected.  They are coming up to pension age now and are not going back into the working environment.  They are the women I have fought long and hard for both in committees and here.  I would have liked to see the home-maker's credit extended to those women, although it has not been so far.<\/p><p>There are a couple of issues I would like to raise with the Minister of State, although they are probably not related to this Bill.  We always avail of the opportunity to do so when we have a Minister in here, particularly from the Department of Social Protection.  A kind of anomaly exists for people who do internships.  I dealt with a man who was long-term unemployed, who did a couple of years on a community employment scheme and then went on an internship.  All was going well, there was a promise of a job at the end of it and he was absolutely delighted but then he had a massive heart attack.  He had to go on illness benefit because he had contributions from his community employment scheme.  First he lost his free fuel allowance, then the special top-up rate of the SUSI grant and finally the Christmas bonus.  I got him the disability allowance, with a fight, to make sure he did not lose those payments.  It should not happen to anyone who has been unemployed for five or six years.  If the Minister of State is going to tell me that working on a community employment scheme is considered work, then people on those schemes should be entitled to draw the family income supplement, FIS.  We cannot have it both ways.  It has to be one or the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#V00900","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Your time is up, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#W00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>There are five people in the Chamber to speak on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, which speaks for itself.

Obviously, we are in a better position with this social welfare Bill than we were with the first three from this Government.  Having said that, we have to look at what has happened in the round, consider the Government's five budgets and look at this budget in its own right.  We must consider the analysis of those organisations which are tasked with examining income inequality, the effects of the budget, who the real winners and losers are and so on.  We have had five reports from the ESRI on the Government's five budgets, as the Minister of State knows.  If he was honest, they do not paint a pretty picture at all in terms of the big winners.  According to the ESRI, the top 14% of income earners were the biggest winners in budget 2016.  I will read out one quote from Cormac Staunton from TASC:<\/p><blockquote>In our analysis of last year's 'triple effect' of changes to tax bands, tax rates and USC rates we found that Budget 2015 gave the biggest cash return - in absolute and relative terms - to those earning &euro;70,000: which we dubbed the Budget 'Sweet Spot'.<\/blockquote> <p>Those with the biggest incomes in the State got, in percentage and monetary terms, the biggest amount of cash.  A single person on a middle income of &euro;500 a week gained by &euro;277, which is about one third of his or her take-home pay.  A person on &euro;700 a week gained &euro;377, which is 1.3%.  A person on &euro;75,000 per year, or over &euro;1,500 a week, gets &euro;902, three times what somebody on &euro;500 a week gets and 2% of their net pay.  That includes me, the Minister of State and the very civil servants who craft the budgets.  Maybe it is not a surprise but it is deeply unfair and it is the reality of what the Government has done.<\/p><p>It is against this backdrop that we look at what the Government has given back to the rest of society.  If those on &euro;500 a week, who are lucky to have a job, were not the big winners from the budget and if the bottom 60% gained less than the top 40%, then what about those on welfare?  It is the same old story of scraps from the table which has been the hallmark of the Government for five years. <\/p><p>We have a Government that gave &euro;181 million in a tax giveaway to the top 14% and yet did not do more for those on welfare, carers, people with disabilities and so on.  Older people had their telephone allowance cut and many of the cuts that could have been restored were not.  We have a health crisis, a housing crisis and a crisis in public services generally but none of that was dealt with in any comprehensive way.  It is mainly a Fine Gael budget if we are to be honest.  The big winners were the top 14%.<\/p><p>With budget 2016, the Government has made it clear that it is seriously out of step with the suffering of the ordinary people.  Christmas comes but once a year but the other 51 weeks have not been made any easier by the small change promised by the &euro;3 to &euro;6 increase in the family income supplement, the &euro;3 increase in pensions, the &euro;2 here and &euro;2.70 there for qualified dependents or the restoration of the &euro;5 that was pillaged from children in previous cuts to child benefit.<\/p><p>The restoration of the respite care grant is to be welcomed.  I severely criticised the cut at the time, so if there is a restoration it must be welcomed.  I also welcome the increase in the period for which carer's allowance is payable after the death of the person being cared for from six to 12 weeks.  I commend Senator Moloney for her work on this.  I am a huge admirer of carers and the work they do.  The Senator is absolutely right that without carers, we would have an awful lot more stress in our hospitals, which are already at pressure point in many cases with the accident and emergency departments and the lack of step-down beds and so on.  Any supports that can be given to carers are to be welcomed.  The reality is that this cut should never have happened in the first place.  There are many cuts about which we can ask why on earth they were made.  Choices were open to Governments throughout those years and yet these are the type of people who were penalised.<\/p><p>I also welcome the new tapered PRSI credit and the increase in the upper weekly earnings threshold to which the lower class A rate of employer PRSI applies.  This is another measure which Sinn F&eacute;in has advocated and which we costed in our alternative budget.  Sinn F&eacute;in would have introduced a new rate of 15.75% employer PRSI and a portion of salary paid in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum to address the shortfall in the social insurance fund.<\/p><p>This is really where we come to the crux in terms of the type of society and economy we want.  Obviously, we want to be competitive and to make sure that taxes on employers or businesses are not too high.  In reality, we have one of the lowest employer PRSI takes in the entire European Union at a time of cuts in social welfare, the trolley crisis and the housing and homelessness crises.  Either we are going to pay for these things and ask those who can afford it to pay a bit more, or we are not.  Senator Quinn spoke about millionaires and I am delighted that he raised the issue.  We have 14,000 millionaires in the State but what about the billionaires as well?  When we ask those people to make a greater contribution - nothing too radical - it is dismissed as fairy-tale economics and we are told it cannot be done.  We are told not to ask those at the top to make a greater contribution and yet we can bring all these cuts in for people on welfare and that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#W00800","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>You are over your time, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#W00900","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>It could not be up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#X00100","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>The Senator has had 6 minutes and 27 seconds.

We will have more time for debate on Committee Stage.  My party spokesperson, Senator Mooney, outlined our main issues with the legislation and the aspects that we welcome such as the restoration of the respite care grant.  I acknowledge that this cut was difficult for Government colleagues, particularly Senator Moloney, who fought hard for the restoration of the grant.  I commend her on that.  It is only right and proper that we say so when we agree with aspects of Government policy and legislation and I have done this during consecutive budget debates.  I will recognise good measures but I will also, in my role as Opposition leader, highlight areas where something could be done differently.<\/p> <p>I would like to focus on pensions, which comprise a small element of the Bill.  I will table amendments in this regard.  One issue relates to section 23 and this might have been lost within the Bill.  The section amends section 128 of the principal Act.  It looks to me that the Government proposes to merge the Financial Services Ombudsman with the Pensions Ombudsman.  That is a retrograde step.  Pensions are a massive issue.  The State's pension liability is multiples of the banking liability but successive Governments have kicked this problem down the road and I do not just lay the blame at the door of the Government.  That is a dangerous step forward because there needs to be a better and clearer focus on pensions into the future.  If I am correct, section 23 proposes subsuming the Pensions Ombudsman into the Financial Services Ombudsman but the officials can tell the Minister of State before he replies.  We will not agree to that and I have tabled amendments to delete the section.<\/p> <p>In the 2013 Act, the Minister provided for single insolvencies of pension schemes, which allowed solvent profitable employers to run down their pension schemes and walk away, particularly from defined benefit schemes in which they had amassed huge liabilities.  We had proposed that a solvent firm should not be allowed to close a defined pension benefit scheme except where the scheme had reached a minimum 90% funding standard.  That is what happens in the UK and many other European countries.  The Government relaxed those rules and, lo and behold, the airport pension scheme, the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS, came tumbling down and retired members lost six weeks of their pension and long-serving deferred members lost up to 60% of their entitlements.  That was facilitated by the Government's Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013.  I flagged it at the time.  That is a major problem not just for the worker within the IASS and I will table amendments to deal with these issues on Committee Stage and to reverse some of the decisions made by Government under the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014.  I will table an amendment to reverse the unilateral removal of those members from the scheme and the unilateral reduction in their scheme benefits.  That was allowed to facilitate the sale of Aer Lingus for a paltry &euro;343 million.  All these pensioners have been left swinging in the wind.  No one agrees with what happened to them.  My principal concern is that unless this is amended, this will happen to multiple other pension schemes, both semi-State and private.  This is happening because the Government has given a road map to employers on how to run down a defined benefit scheme.  People are promised a benefit on retirement based on the contributions they made but employers can extricate themselves from this commitment to their employees and set up a new scheme while writing off the deficit, thereby making the company more profitable and saleable if it is commercial semi-State company or allowing a private company to walk away from its pension responsibilities.  That is a serious issue and it is for reasons such as this that the two ombudsmen should not be merged but, more importantly, I am concerned that thousands of other workers will be affected in addition to the 5,000 retired and deferred pensioners in the IASS.  They were the first and there will be more unless this is changed.<\/p> <p>The pensions industry in Ireland is small and all the pension experts and the various companies affected know this option is available.  The Government provided for this under legislation the Minister of State brought through the House.  We have an opportunity in the final few months of this Government to reverse that bad decision and to make sure this does not happen to any other people who are entitled to their pensions.  It can be easy for us as public representatives and for departmental officials who contribute to pensions for which there is no funding as they are paid out of current revenue.  I am talking about people who are members of pension schemes, which are being ripped up and torn asunder because of legislation introduced by the Government.  I will table four amendments to undo the bad work that has been done on pensions.<\/p> <p>If I am correct about section 23 and the merger of the two ombudsmen, I ask the Minister of State to revert to the Minister and ask for the Government to reconsider that decision.  In 15 or 20  years, whether we are here or not, the State will be dealing with a much greater pension liability, which we all keep kicking down the road because it will materialise between 2030 and 2035.  We are responsible for forward planning as well.  I thank the Minister of State for his attention and I look forward to his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#X00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their contributions.

The Senator should read what is contained in his party's pre-budget submission on many of the areas to which he referred, especially pensions.  I would have liked for us to have been able to give pensioners more than a &euro;5 increase but the Government's package of measures far exceeds a &euro;5 increase.  The only submission that was made in regard to pensioners was about the &euro;5 increase.  No submission was made with regard to the fuel allowance.  One of the red herrings some of the Senator's party colleagues raised was that the free travel benefit would be abolished.  That is a timely claim that the Senator's party has raised during the past five years.  In contrast we put an additional &euro;3 million into the free travel scheme to ensure such provision is secure into the future.  I know the Senator would gladly acknowledge that we did that in spite of his party's policies.  When Deputy O'Dea made a similar speech to the Senator's in the D&aacute;il, I went through the measures item by item but I would not put the Senator through that.  He remarked that everything cannot be fixed at once and I accept that.

If we continue on that road, we will certainly be able to put many more fixes into the economy now that we are picking ourselves up from the economic crash and putting the pieces back into place.  The Government has done exceptionally well but the electorate will make that decision early next year in the spring.  We have not reached our destination yet but we are certainly on the road to it and that has been acknowledged.

A number of measures were introduced in response to addressing the level of unemployment including the T&uacute;s initiative and the expansion of community employment schemes.  A positive aspect of it is that people are finding it difficult to get workers with respect to the T&uacute;s initiative because people are returning to employment, which is a positive sign.  While this is not directly related to this Bill we have started a policy of reviewing all our schemes to ensure they operate to best effect for our society and economy.  T&uacute;s has played an important role in keeping people in contact with the workforce.  People were encouraged to prepare an updated CV and when a job placement arose they were in a position to take up that opportunity.  I will endeavour to make sure that the T&uacute;s scheme will be reviewed and I listened carefully and have taken on board what the Senator said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#Y00800","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015112500002#Y00900","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1448447400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The JobBridge scheme will be reviewed.  The tender documents for that review have been issued and we should get those documents back early next year.  When I became Minister of State I introduced a reform under the T&uacute;s scheme with a move from the random selection process in place to allowing some 20% self-referral, which has worked extremely well.  I thank the Senator for his comments about the other areas.  As I said, T&uacute;s was designed to help people keep in touch with the workforce.<\/p> <p>I would strongly disagree with Senator Quinn's view on the minimum wage.  I believe what we have done has been very positive in restoring the rate by giving people back &euro;1 and also in regard to the Low Pay Commission's recommendation.  The Minister of State set up that commission which will review the minimum wage.  There are representatives from the employers' bodies in that respect.  There is an independent and evidence-based resource in place with respect to the minimum wage and that is a positive development.<\/p> <p>The Senator made a number of remarks about people who do not want to return to work.  Social welfare is a social contract and there are two sides to the contract, one side is the State, in terms of taxpayers, which supplies support to a person who has become unemployed.  The other side of the contract is that the person would be actively seeking work.  A number of amendments and changes have been made in that regard in terms of sanctions.  I can forward the Senator the detail of that rather than going through it.<\/p> <p>A number of amendments and changes have been made since April 2011 to ensure that people live up to their side of the social contract.  People are paying taxes to ensure there is a level of decency below which the unemployed should not fall and that there would be an opportunity for them to get back into the workforce, and those people's side of the contract is that they would be actively seeking work.  In my experience the vast majority of people want to work.  They want not only the dignity of work but the social interaction and social networking that work provides, which is very important to the individual and to his or her family.<\/p> <p>From my experience as Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection with a key role in labour activation, the vast majority of people who are unemployed want to get back into work.  However, that presents specific challenges.  We have statistics on intergenerational unemployment.  When we moved out of earlier recessions, a payment in terms of unemployment benefit was made to people, in many ways, to set them aside and keep them quiet.  There was not an active involvement and engagement process to assist them back into work.  As we come out of this recession we must make sure that everybody has an equal opportunity to get back into work.  It is important we should have a role model in every family, where a member of every family is working and in that way people will aspire to work and improve their circumstances.<\/p> <p>In my role in labour activation I am very concerned about intergenerational unemployment.  That must be tackled this time.  Proposals to tackle it cannot be a shelf in the way that was done in the 80s, 90s and noughties.  We must make sure that people have an opportunity to get back into work, whether it be through education or further training.  We are doing much of that work now through the new Intreo offices where case officers give individuals a workplan and work with them to assist them to get back to work.  I very much take on board what the Senator said in that regard but there are sanctions in place and they are implemented.  In addition, JobPath is being rolled out throughout the country.<\/p> <p>I am disappointed that Senator Cullinane is not present but I thank him for his good wishes and for recognising the improvements in the budget.  He used figures similar to those cited by Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies with regard to the number of millionaires.  I am not a great reader of the \"Sindo\" if that is from where the statistics came.  I like to have a quite pleasant Sunday so I am inclined to skip over that particular newspaper.  I wonder if the Senator was referring to people's assets in his determining people to be millionaires.  Are the millionaires to whom he referred, for example, the farmer whose farm is worth a &euro;1 million, or a small businessman the valuation of whose business runs into millions of euro?  As far as I can recall, Sinn F&eacute;in's policy is not to take account of the assets of farmers but I know it is a populist party.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=25\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When one asks Sinn F&eacute;in to specify which individuals earning over &euro;100,000 it would tax, one finds that it would exclude so many people that no revenue would be raised.

In respect of those aged 25 with a family, there is no reduction in rates for jobseekers aged under 25 who have a qualified child dependant.  I will be happy to look at the specific item she raised and refer it to the policy section of the Department to see whether there is a need to change that.  <\/p><p>There have been many increases and I do not intend to go through them again.  I appreciate the contributions from Senators.  I believe we are on a better path.  For the first time, there is hope at the end of that tunnel.  The light is shining and it is not a train coming to knock us over and back.  It has been a long and difficult road for our citizens.  There have been terrible cuts and people have seen a reduction in expenditure.  The people who have been worst affected during the recession are those who lost their jobs, those who did not have an opportunity to go into work after coming out of college and those who were forced to emigrate because there was no work.  All Members of this House must acknowledge that there has been a change in respect of opportunities to go back into employment.  I hope that when members of our diaspora come back to Ireland over the Christmas period, they will see what opportunities are out there because there are shortages in certain skillsets.  Members of the diaspora could use coming back to Ireland as an opportunity to sound out the market.  We cannot take the foot off the accelerator in respect of getting people back to work.  Our ambition and the ambition of the next Government must be full employment.  It must be to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to go back into work.

However, as the list of items to be considered in section 3(2) may sometimes compete with one another, it may not always be possible to be fully consistent with all of them simultaneously when approving either national plan.  Moreover, in the case of section 3(2)(e), it does not make sense to comply with the most recent national greenhouse gas emissions inventory and projections of future missions.
