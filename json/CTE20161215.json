We welcome the Minister's efforts to bring greater transparency to the fraught area of school admissions.  This is an area of long-standing concern for Educate Together.  We are striving for a system which provides equality of access and esteem to children and since demand for our equality-based schools currently far outstrips demand, we are more familiar than we would like to be with the issues of over-subscription.  Equal access is one of our core objectives, yet with the growing pressure on them to meet an ever-increasing demand, it is a challenge for our schools to operate enrolment policies that are as fair as they can be.<\/p> <p>  First and foremost, the case we would like the committee to consider is that there is a need to reconfigure the education system to bring it in line with parental demand.  In this regard, Educate Together applauds recent Government commitments to bring the number of non-denominational or multidenominational schools to 400 by 2030.  Correcting the current imbalance in school types will reduce over-subscription and thereby reduce situations where families cannot gain access to their chosen type of school.  We would ask the committee to consider something further than that.  We believe there is a necessity for systemic reform of school admissions with the State taking responsibility for an area-based system in which parents' preferences are collected and school places are allocated in a fair and transparent manner on an area-based State controlled system.  We would like to see much stronger powers for the Minister in section 65 of the proposed Bill in order that such a system could be enabled.<\/p> <p>  We are particularly concerned with the retention of measures to allow religious discrimination in section 61(2)(b).  In our experience, this remains the most serious issue concerning school admissions facing a rising number of families in Ireland today.  Until this is addressed both by legislation and by dramatically increasing the availability of Educate Together model schools, the political issue of school admissions will simply not go away.  We are also concerned with section 62(6)(h) relating to an opt out provision for children whose parents do not wish to attend religious instruction.  While we understand the Minister's wish to shed light on an area hitherto unclear, Educate Together contends that when children of minorities simply opt out of faith formation classes within school hours, this leads to serious exclusion.  Merely requiring schools to publish their arrangements does nothing to prevent this exclusion.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the provisions of section 66, which enables the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to designate a school a child can attend, it is important that the legislation is strengthened to place the responsibility on the NCSE to ensure that all necessary resources are in place prior to the admission of the child.  Children with special educational needs have a right to more than just a school place; they have a right to an education which meets their needs, and resources must be provided.  <\/p> <p>  This is a very short statement and I look forward to discussing these matters.  I assure the members that Educate Together's accumulated experience of managing schools is at their disposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Rowe"},{"type":"speech","time":1481812200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I appreciate the allotted speaking time is short.

First, I thank the members of the Oireachtas joint committee for affording us this opportunity.  I read what was said in the D&aacute;il on this issue with interest and a number of members mentioned special educational needs and a number did not.  We welcome many of the suggested changes but we are concerned by the manner in which the legislation does not appear to take into account the necessary practice of requirements of schools catering for children with special educational needs.  We made a submission to this committee on the heads of the Bill previously and some of the changes we proposed have come into place and some have not.<\/p> <p>  However, we have specific areas of concern and I will briefly outline them.  As in section 61, there is a requirement that a school would have a specific statement of non-discrimination on all the usual equality grounds but also on the disability ground of the student or the applicant in respect of the student concerned.  It goes without saying that special schools and special classes must be able to differentiate between types of students with special educational needs.  A special school or class catering for children with a particular diagnosis should be in a position to refuse enrolment to a child who does not have that diagnosis because it is not in the best interests of the child to be there.  It would be especially essential that they would be able to differentiate between those disabilities.<\/p> <p>  Section 62(6)(c) dealing with admissions policy sets out a limited number of circumstances where a school will not be obliged to enrol a student.  Special schools and schools with special classes must be given the right to refuse an applicant on the basis that the needs of the applicant does not match the profile of needs catered for by that particular school or class.  It is imperative therefore that a fifth ground is included here to ensure that special schools and mainstream schools with special classes can refuse enrolment on the basis that an applicant student does not have that special educational need. <\/p> <p>  A few of the regulations also pose a few problems and we are of the view that a distinction needs to be made in regard to special schools and classes.  That should be hard-coded into the Act rather than in the regulations.  I will mention the five issues I have set out in my statement.  The first relates to the prior attendance at a specific specified category of preschool.  Many special schools have early intervention units and the parents would fully expect that the child would be able to get a place in the special school or class.  Another issue is the student's academic ability.  Schools catering for mild, moderate or severe disability or educational needs would need to know what is the aptitude of the student to ensure that the student is in the right place.  Another issue is the interview or open day.  It is essential that special schools or special classes would be able to meet the parents and meet the child involved because the parents and the school need to assess whether the child's needs can be met and properly catered for in that school.<\/p><p> The last piece of regulation we have a little difficulty with is the preclusion of a school from seeking information relating to any medical condition, disability or special educational needs of the students.  It is essential that this provision would not be applied to special schools or classes because, as Paul Rowe mentioned earlier, that is resource dependent.  Some of these would create obstacles for the enrolment process in special schools and classes.<\/p><p> The last issue is the designation of a school by the NCSE or Tusla.  There have been changes since the last proposed Bill in 2015 and there are provisions in it now regarding the ability of the school to accommodate the child, the best interests of the child and special educational needs.  As the NCSE and Tusla do not have a daily involvement in school affairs and do not know the make-up of the school or class on a daily basis it is important that the school would be consulted fully before making a proposal to designate.  There is another issue related to that.  If a child was expelled from a school, there is nothing in the Bill to stop the NCSE or Tusla ignoring the expulsion and re-inserting the child into that school.  It is very rare that a child would be expelled from a special school or class and if that were to take place it would be a very serious matter, so it would cause difficulty if the child were to come back into the school.  We welcome the provision in section 66(14) that a person with a special interest in or knowledge of education of persons with special educational needs will be included in the appeals committee where the case concerns somebody with special educational needs.  However, it is important that management bodies would also be consulted on the procedures for the appeals process.  They are not mentioned at all.<\/p><p> In conclusion, we recognise that under the Education Act each pupil with special needs has a right to an appropriate education.  As a school management organisation, we wish to ensure that parents can engage in a transparent manner to choose the placement most suitable for their child's needs and that any forthcoming legislation will facilitate boards of management in their efforts to respond to the needs of both pupils and their parents.  Finally, we have had detailed discussions with the Department of Education and Skills and we are hopeful of a positive outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda Corr","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>We welcome the principles of equality, transparency and inclusivity which underpin the core provisions of the Bill.  Our primary concern about the Bill is that there is no clear provision made for Irish-medium schools to protect the language ethos of the school by granting permission to them to set out criteria in their enrolment policies that would allow them to give priority to children being raised through Irish and children whose home language includes Irish.  Additionally, the prohibition on giving preference to children attending Irish-medium preschools in the enrolment criteria of an Irish-medium primary school is a cause of grave concern.  Parents and their children have a legitimate expectation in terms of progression from Irish-medium preschools to primary and post-primary education and this must be recognised in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  We recognise that enrolment criteria, by their nature, are discriminatory but they only apply where there are insufficient places in schools to meet demand.  Over-subscription disproportionately affects Irish-medium schools and our figures indicate that 29% of Irish-medium primary schools and 22% of Irish-medium post-primary schools cannot cater for the demand.  Of those that can, all applicants are accepted.  That is an important point.  We acknowledge that refusal based on over-subscription causes great dissatisfaction, narrows school communities and compromises the rights of children to inclusive education.<\/p> <p>  To protect the language ethos of Irish-medium schools and the rights of children whose home language is Irish and includes Irish, we consider the following three steps imperative.  Irish-medium primary schools should have the right to give priority to children attending a na&iacute;onra so children can continue to benefit from all the linguistic and cognitive benefits of early immersion in Irish.  Irish-medium primary schools that are over-subscribed should be permitted to give priority to children whose language is and includes Irish.  Irish-medium post-primary schools should also be permitted to give priority to Irish speaking families who might not necessarily have attended an Irish-medium preschool as well as those who have attended an Irish-medium preschool.  The basis for this argument is that we consider it imperative that schools maintain the basic right to protect and maintain the language of instruction and communication of the school and its community, so the future of both the Irish language and the immersion education model in Ireland is sustainable.<\/p> <p>  Irish-medium schools are unique in that they provide cultural and linguistic diversity through the language, as well as diversity of all faiths and none depending on the patronage of a given school.  Irish-medium schools welcome and cater for all children, including children from all faiths and none, children from all socio-economic backgrounds, children from all cultural and linguistic backgrounds, children with a diverse range of special educational needs and children from the Traveller community.  This diversity offers great richness in terms of the wider educational experiences and linguistic diversity.  Schools welcome this diversity and, at the same time, are focused on preserving and developing a strong language policy that is inclusive and progressive for all.<\/p> <p>  Mar fhocal scoir, we ask the comhchoiste to influence positively the passing of this Bill in a manner that will protect the rights of an Irish-medium school to establish and implement over-subscription criteria that give priority to Irish speaking children.  This is fundamental to protecting the immersion education system, a system that is globally recognised as a successful education system not just for native speakers of the respective language, but for all children who can avail of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bl&aacute;thnaid N&iacute; Ghr&eacute;ach&aacute;in"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I represent a group of parents from all over Ireland who are raising their children through Irish but outside the Gaeltacht area.  The group emphatically believes that there should not be a hierarchy of minority rights and we do not seek to protect the educational rights of our children at the expense of any other minority.  Indeed, as bilingual and often multilingual families, we welcome diversity of all types.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly outline our proposed amendments.  First, we propose that Irish-medium schools be allowed to prioritise native Irish speakers in their admissions policies.  This is a tiny minority at 3% of the Gaelscoil population or one child in every 30.  Why should these children be prioritised?  I am raising two little boys in Galway city.  If they do not get into a Gaelscoil, they will be educated through English.  There are consequences to that.  First, from the first day in school they will have better Irish than their teacher.  Second, their access to the language will be so limited in the curriculum that they will never develop high language literacy skills in their first language.  Unfortunately, their oral proficiency skills will also drop.  We know that from international research as well as research in Ireland.  My young child has a speech and language problem and Barbara U&iacute; Mhuirthile's child, who was here a few minutes ago, has trisomy 21 or Down's syndrome.  They need support in their first language and English-medium schools do not have the resources or the expertise to provide that type of educational support.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to our second proposed amendment.  My little boys wear Converse runners and they have Star Wars schoolbags.  They are not clearly identifiable physically as Irish language speakers, nor do they have a language passport.  For schools to identify native Irish language speakers, they must be allowed to observe the child interact with a parent or peers for the sole purpose of identifying that they are first language speakers of Irish.  We propose this as a safeguard and to ensure that any positive discrimination for native speakers of Irish outside the Gaeltacht and in Irish-medium education cannot be abused or used cynically by others.  This proposal is in line with best practice internationally in Canada and Finland.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, we welcome that, for the first time, the specific educational needs of Irish speaking children within the Gaeltacht have been recognised by the Government.  It would be very unfortunate and unfair if this Bill, if it were to be implemented as it is currently drafted, unwittingly denied these educational rights to native Irish language speakers outside of the Gaeltacht.  Our proposed amendments are cost neutral.  They are limited in scope, clearly defined and are in line with best international practice.  They are underpinned by our commitment, as daily multilinguals, to linguistic and cultural diversity and the pluralism that this Bill purports to espouse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. R&iacute;ona N&iacute; Fhrighil"},{"type":"speech","time":1481812200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Thank you.

Admission policies must be published, the Bill, through an amendment to the Education Act, puts inclusion at the centre of a school's business, and the Bill gives principals responsibility for the implementation of their school's admission policy.  This involves resourcing issues, although not hugely significant, because the principals will have extra responsibilities.  The insertion of the key provisions in the admissions framework into a new section 10 in the Education Act has merit and makes a lot of sense, and a consolidated Education Act would also make a lot of sense in that it would pick up amendments to the Education Act and bits from education, welfare, and so on in a single Act to enable everyone to find what they needed to know about schools and their management and operation.<\/p> <p>  The Bill will mean that a school's admission policy must state explicitly that a school will not discriminate in its admission of a student on the nine grounds of discrimination, which include gender and civil status, among others, plus the additional one of special needs.  Of interest and with merit is that in each case it is with respect to either the student or the applicant.  That is an important aspect and warrants mention.<\/p> <p>  The Bill specifies what must be included in an admission policy.  That was not the case heretofore.  Parent or parents will be required to accept the code of behaviour in a school.  That is a positive development.  The Bill also stipulates that the criteria for selection, where the number of applicants exceeds the number of places available, must be included in a policy.  There is clear guidance about that and there is a clear prohibition on certain criteria being used.<\/p> <p>  The following small difficulty might surprise people.  The enrolment application fees and voluntary contributions are proscribed, which is welcome.  However, it needs to be recognised that the banning of voluntary contributions will require a significant increase in capitation payments.  We estimate that the increase could be as much as 30%.<\/p> <p>  The ETBI has the following reservations.  Students can be refused entrance to their local school because of their family's religion or lack of religion.  That is unacceptable in a diverse and increasingly secular Ireland.  This is a very complex matter.  We need to get it right rather than do something about it.  Again, there are resource implications.<\/p> <p>  The Bill does not address soft barriers such as the lack of a comprehensive curriculum in a school.  By having a narrow curriculum one automatically says to some people that they are not welcome in a school.  I believe schools should be required to have a broad curriculum in order that they can cater equally to students in their community.  Schools must also have a clear commitment to special needs support.  A lack of support can also act as a soft barrier.  In the interests of students, schools and society at large, each school should take a fair proportion of students with special educational needs.<\/p> <p>  The Bill needs to define what constitutes a student vacancy.  It is not that simple to define and it is quite complex at second level.   There is a need for greater clarity around upholding the right of students who do not wish to attend religious instruction and worship.  There is probably a need for national guidelines on same.  Again, the matter is quite complex.  The matter of priority for relatives of former students remains to be addressed.  A parent or parents need to be able to appeal against a school designation in cases where they are unsatisfied with the designation.  Also, the resources required to meet the needs of the student must accompany designation rather than sometime later when a student has lost his or her way a little.<\/p> <p>  Many difficult hurdles remain to be addressed, particularly the elucidation of an appeals process that is transparently fair, administratively efficient, expeditious and cost effective.  Since the most contentious issues are of a human rights character, consideration must be given to recent comments by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Recognition must be given that the Bill has implications that extend well beyond mere ambition to attend a school.  The Bill must be considered as part of a package that provides for the vindication of competing rights in a reasonable and balanced manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1481812200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, Mr. O'Mahony.

This is the first time an Oireachtas committee has been jointly addressed on behalf of atheists, evangelical Christians and Ahmadiyya Muslims.  We are the only group here today that represents belief groups protected under the right to freedom of religion or belief who are discriminated against.  This is a human rights issue, not one of balancing different parental choices.  It is a scandal this matter has not been resolved despite ten different UN and Council of Europe human rights conclusions that the State is breaching our human rights.  The Government also has a legal duty under Article 42 of the Constitution to respect equally the rights of all parents, not just those of selected religions.  After I last addressed this committee, it had already identified the problem.  The committee concluded in 2014 that \"multiple patronage and ethos as a basis for policy can lead to segregation and inequality and that the objectives of admission policy should be equality and integration\".  It follows from the committee's conclusion that the patronage system needs to be replaced, not made even more segregated by even more private patrons.  I ask the committee please to reinforce that important conclusion and not to retreat from it.<\/p> <p>  The Government has ignored the committee's conclusion and cited an unpublished and scandalous legal opinion that it is constitutionally obliged to buttress religious discrimination.  The State has not balanced competing rights.  It has simply ignored our guaranteed right to equal access to a local school and, far more important, to have the State curriculum delivered in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner.  Instead, the State cedes control of publicly funded schools to private patrons, most of whom integrate a Catholic ethos throughout the State curriculum.  Children cannot opt out of a religious ethos.  As the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights said last month, the private patrons hold the State hostage.  This breaches the State's positive duty to respect the human right of all parents to ensure the teaching of their children is in conformity with their convictions.  This is an absolute right that should not be balanced against the rights of others or be gradually achieved.  We continue to seek a secular school system.  We also support the immediate recommendations of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that no child should be given preferential access to a publicly funded school on the basis of their religion and that the State curriculum should be delivered in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Donnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1481812200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Donnelly for her contribution.

Equally, as Ms Lennon stated, parents should be able to choose whether a child receives religious instruction in that school.  We have narrow goals and we think they are achievable through our amendments.<br\/><br\/>In regard to equal access, section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>) of the Equal Status Act allows 96% of our taxpayer funded primary schools to prioritise enrolment on the basis of a child's religion.  We call for the immediate repeal of this law in order that all children have an equal opportunity to attend their local school regardless of religion.  In short, it is profoundly wrong that four and five year old children should face State imposed discrimination and segregation on the basis of religion.  The State is conferring a significant advantage in the provision of a taxpayer funded service on the basis of religion.  The baptism of convenience is a predictable and logical result as, regardless of over-subscription, families will always be infinitely more secure in their educational opportunities by having children baptised.  Article 44.2.3&deg; of the Constitution provides that, &quot;The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.&quot;  The current situation in our taxpayer funded schools is a gross breach of this clearly worded and unambiguous provision.<br\/><br\/>In regard to equal respect, Article 44.2 4&deg; of the Constitution explicitly applies the principle of non-discrimination to the issue of religious instruction within taxpayer funded schools.  It provides that legislation providing State aid for schools shall not be such as to &quot;affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending religious instruction at that school&quot;.  It is a right for a child to attend a local school without receiving religious instruction.  That is already in the Constitution.<br\/><br\/>The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, states the vast majority of our schools work to welcome every child, but in most schools the best hard-pressed teachers can do during daily faith formation lessons is leave children not of the patron's religion sitting separately in the classroom, segregated from the rest of the class and doing non-curriculum busy work.  This is the fate that non-religious and minority children will face every day of their primary school lives.  The situation is infinitely worse during communion and confirmation years.

At the outset we wondered whether we would get 30 people to come forward.  In fact we were inundated and were blown away by the response.  We could have featured many more stories.  We had to select the stories during the month but we continued to run them throughout the year.  Each story was simply the human embodiment of discrimination against a four year old child.<\/p> <p>  I will read a few quotes from some of the testimonies that came forward.  Lucy said that their employer, doctor or landlord could not use religion as an excuse to exclude them but their local school could.  They do not want to leave Ireland but they may be forced to.  Rebecca said that her son is only 18 months old.  As a non-religious family, the worrying about what would happen began before he had even been born.  Steph said that attending their local Catholic school means being faced with isolation within the classroom and being continually exposed to indoctrination of a faith that she does not believe in.  Joseph asked who he was to say what his child's religion may or may not be one day.  How could he determine for another human being what their relationship to a god will be or if they will have a god at all?  Who gives a school the right to ask such a question?  One of the many teachers who came forward, and all of them had to stay anonymous, said that teaching religion takes up two and a half hours per week, more than twice as much as the time spent on teaching science, geography, history, music, drama, art and physical education.  We had more voices joining those brave parents who exposed themselves and their families in the pursuit of equality.<\/p> <p>  Education Equality believes that, both in terms of admissions and treatment during the school day, the State is in grave breach of its constitutional duty not to impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the grounds of religion.  Education Equality has proposed amendments to the Bill to bring about equal school access and the teaching of faith formation at the end of the school day, the latter to facilitate parents of all faiths and none in deciding if they wish to have their children attend such lessons.  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 provides a wonderful opportunity for change, but without these amendments it is not worthy of its title.

There is a perception that it is impossible constitutionally for section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>) to be amended.  Our legal opinion demonstrates that there is no such constitutional barrier to amending it.  The Oireachtas has the power to impose reasonable conditions on the provision of public funding to educational institutions.  Crucially, this power includes requiring that all publicly funded schools must accept children of all religions and none on an equal basis.  Examining the case law of the Supreme Court, we concluded that an amendment to section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>) would have the effect of striking a fairer balance between the constitutional rights of families from various religious groups by moving to a situation where all families have their rights protected to some degree.<br\/><br\/>The decisive point is that the Oireachtas, as the national Parliament, enjoys a wide discretion in balancing competing constitutional rights or claimed constitutional rights and that balance is not primarily a matter for the courts but for the Oireachtas.  Any legislation enacted balancing constitutional rights enjoys a very strong presumption of constitutionality in the courts.  Recent case law shows that the courts have been extremely reluctant to substitute their own view over that of the Oireachtas as to the correct balance of constitutional rights.<br\/><br\/>The current imbalance in the protection of religious freedom in schools is well documented.  Section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>) of the Equal Status Act 2000 is at the heart of that imbalance.  Amending this section in order that it cannot be relied on by school specifically in receipt of public funding would strike a significantly fairer balance for all families.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Ombudsman for Children, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the special rapporteur on child protection and the majority of political parties have all called for the baptism barrier to be removed.

I get a great many e-mails from people in the locality of a school who have been excluded on the basis that siblings or the children of parents who attended that school get a higher priority, even though they have to travel back to it.  This is not a religious barrier but an access barrier.<\/p> <p>  There is a view that religious discrimination is to protect the faith school minorities.<\/p><p>Perhaps Ms Donnelly, on behalf of Atheist Ireland, would elaborate further on whether that is a valued argument in the context of the earlier comments about the discrimination and segregation that occurs within a minority faith among the different factions of that faith.

Perhaps the witnesses would outline what they believe were the most important recommendations arising from those discussions, with particular emphasis on any particular recommendation they believe should be taken into account by this committee in its consideration of the Bill.

I have been involved in many discussions on this issue, which led me to understand the need to protect the Irish language and culture.  However, I was taken aback by a reference in one of the opening statements to the phrase \"home language includes Irish\", which is very different to the argument that home language is Irish.  There are many people who attended Gaelscoil and speak Irish but choose not to do so within the home.  I am concerned that in including the phrase \"home language includes Irish\" we would be giving greater access to Gaelscoil to children whose home language includes Irish than to children, such as my daughter, who benefit hugely from learning the Irish language and in respect of whom progression rates are higher.  Reference was also made in an opening statement to diversity in schools and Traveller communities.  If the rule is to be such that the home language includes Irish, that would be moving away from diversity because only a small minority would be able to access such education.  I would welcome a response on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#H01200","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481812200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I am not a member of this committee.  I am substituting today for Deputy Burton because I have an interest in this area.  I believe that the education system perpetuates inequality.  In a system that is based on competition, as ours is, one will find in any community or geographical area a school that is the least popular and in that school one will generally find a disproportionate number of migrant children, Traveller children, children with special needs and children expelled from other schools and so on in order that other schools do not have to facilitate them.  We stand over this because we want to have within the system what is known as parental choice, which if one talks to anybody from the Nordic countries, particularly Finland, is a strange priority.  It is bizarre that we still separate children on the basis of religion and gender at the age of 4 years, as has been well articulated here.<\/p> <p>  My question for the witnesses relates to the constitutional issue often thrown at me during my time in government, in particular in the context of an amendment to section 37 of the Employment Equality Act.  It is bizarre that it is still legal for a school to discriminate against a gay teacher or a teacher who is an unmarried parent.  We were only able to amend that provision rather than delete it or have it removed from the Statute Book because it is a constitutional provision.  A number of speakers have spoken about the constitutional provision and have offered their interpretations in this regard.  The Department refers to this provision in the context of the baptism bar.  I would welcome the views of the witnesses on that issue.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Irish language question, Deputy Burton and I have tabled an amendment to ensure a situation does not arise whereby an Irish-speaking family would not be able to access their local Gaelscoil and would be forced to have their child educated through English.  As Irish is the first language of this State, that is a reasonable provision to have in the Bill.  Generally speaking, I believe our system is radically unfair and unequal and that, in terms of this Bill, all we are doing is tinkering with the system.  That we are providing by way of this Bill that people, because of their royal blood lineage, should be allowed to send their sons or daughters to the schools they attended is bizarre.  I do not understand how any school body with a sense of equality in their ethos could stand over that bonkers provision.  It goes against everything I feel is right and just in life.<\/p> <p>  I recall visiting a particular part of the country, which I will not name, and the local representative showing me with great pride a newly built Educate Together school, a newly built Catholic school and a newly built Church of Ireland school, which means that, in terms of education, children from that area are spread across three different schools.  Is this the ideal?  Is it what we want for the children of this country?  I am a great supporter of the Educate Together model.  There is an Educate Together school in my constituency, which I welcome.  I worked very hard to help bring it to fruition.  The Educate Together model is needed because the overall system demands it because it is broken, in my view.  I accept that point is more of a rant than a constructive one.  The joke about the Department of Education and Skills, which is probably unfair, about how many Department of Education officials it takes to change a light bulb comes to mind, the joke being around the Department's lack of ability to change.  In terms of the constitutional issue, how would the witnesses convince the Department officials to change their view or that of the Minister on that question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#J00200","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1481812200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates to the meeting.

Educate Together has been working in this particular area for the best part of 40 years.  Over those years, we have served many families who are isolated and marginalised by the system.  We now operate schools in different jurisdictions and as such we can bring new thinking to this area.  Our main proposal is that the State would take responsibility, perhaps by way of an independent State body such as an education and training board, for the establishment of an application process which allows any family with a three year old child to express a preference for the school they would like their child to attend, be that an Irish medium school, an Educate Together school and so on.  The State would then, for the first time in history, know the real level of demand for the different types of schools.<\/p> <p>  I take on board the Senators' point about parental preference.  The Constitution is very strong on the question of parental preference.  We have only recently enshrined the rights of children in our Constitution.  Parental preference is another discussion we must have as a nation.  If we did have an area-based type admissions process, the State for the first time could allocate resources according to the real level of demand and could then address the levels of over-subscription, which are reaching crisis point in urban areas.  Educate Together schools in the Dublin area are two to three times over-subscribed routinely.  Tinkering with our admissions policy is simply trying to decide who to exclude.<\/p><p>It is not addressing the problem.  We must have a way in which the State knows what types of and how many schools are necessary and can then provide them.<\/p><p> Reference was made to siblings.  It is really important that members of families be able to access schools together in a realistic way.<\/p><p> Reference was also made to local access.  In the system we propose the State could establish on a statutory basis a transparent set of criteria whereby places could be allocated.  The statutory criteria would ensure the State would make proper provision for children with special or language needs in order to prevent the polarisation of school and communities to which Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred.  We have trialled such a system in our schools in Lucan where we have an area-based admissions policy precisely because we identified serious and significant ethnic segregation or separation in the schools within the area.<\/p><p> Ireland is in the early stages of witnessing population growth after 200 years of decline.  Other places have had proper systems in place to handle growth in population and produce a suitable range of educational provisions.  We have to start thinking in a way in which the State will take much more responsibility and live up to its responsibilities to ensure no child will be discriminated against in seeking access to education.<\/p><p> Children do not choose their parents.  They do not choose whether they are born into a wealthy or disadvantaged family.  They do not choose any part of their genetic make-up.  They do not choose their ethnicity or the religion of their family.  It is absolutely impermissible for a modern democratic state to continue to discriminate against children on these grounds.  It is impermissible not only on moral, political and ethical grounds, it is also imprudent on socioeconomic grounds because by isolating children on the basis of their identity, one is restraining the motivation to learn and depriving the State of the great wealth of the diversity of its human capital.  That is something the State has to address and it has to be addressed in this historical period.  To be honest, in simply adjusting parts of the current system, a school-based system, one will not address the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Rowe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>There were no questions for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda Corr"},{"type":"speech","time":1481812200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Does Ms Corr have any comment to make?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#K00300","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>It is amazing how special educational needs are never the subject of a question..

We have had good discussions with the Department which sees from where we are coming.  We wrote to the Minister in 2015.  We have had some very good meetings and it is very clear that there are certain things that need to be changed.  I hope that when the issue does come up for debate in the D&aacute;il, if there are amendments in that regard, they will be supported.<\/p> <p>  Our key message is that the approach adopted must be in the best interests of the child.  A total of 35% of our 200 members are in mainstream schools with units.  There are more than 700 schools with units.  There is choice.  Sometimes parents transfer children in a certain period between a unit and a special school because things happen at age 12 or 13 years such that pupils cannot cope in post-primary education.  Anyone who has teenagers knows that it is hard enough to cope in general.  Our approach is what is in the best interests of a child.  In fairness to the NCSE, it tries to ensure a child can access a suitable school in his or her locality.  Some parents choose to have their children placed in mainstream schools without a unit, while others prefer to have access to a unit into which a child can go, if an issue arises.  The best examples are where children spend time in a unit &ndash; I hate that term and should use the word \"class\" &ndash; and are included in mainstream education.  About a week ago I was in a wonderful school in Dublin.  There are, in fact, two schools on the one campus and the unit is for boys and girls.  There is also a boys' and girls' senior school on the campus.

According to the Department, two special classes constitute a unit.  There are about 1,400 special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools.  The problem which the Department is trying to address is that there are pockets of the country where the provision of post-primary schools with units is poor.  Some members will probably be aware of this from their communities.  There is good provision of autism units at primary school level, but the question is where will pupils go if they want to have the safety provided by a unit at post-primary level.  The focus must be on what is in the best interests of a child.  Sometimes placement in a special school is best.  It is a matter of parental choice.  Sometimes pupils move from mainstream schools to special schools and that is their choice.  They can move back and forth.  The ideal is to have dual enrolment to enable pupils to try both for a while, but that is another day's work.  It is a matter for the Department to work out who should receive the capitation payment.  That is the ideal in a situation where there is a special unit in a school.  If the unit is located in a girls' school, the boys in the unit could move on or move to the mainstream boys' school on the same campus to attend some classes.<\/p> <p>  I am not addressing the issue of religion today but special educational needs and how schools with units and special schools can be best provided for in the Bill.  Following on a point addressed earlier, I would like to see more schools taking more children with special educational needs.  We all know about soft barriers.  Change will come, but my final word is that there must be a willingness to change.  Schools should not be forced to provide a unit in order to receive resources.  The board of management should want to do it; then the unit would be more welcoming for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda Corr"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I will address the Gaelscoil issue.  It is important to go back to the point that the enrolment criteria only kick in when there is over-subscription.  According to our statistics, that happens in approximately 29% of cases in primary schools and 22% of cases at second level.  As an organisation, we would love to be in a position where all applicants for a place in a Gaelscoil were accepted.  Where that is not the case, it a source of great discouragement and causes upset among parents.  Where there is over-subscription, schools are forced into this position.  Many schools have a list of criteria which include language.  Their first priority might be to choose children from families who speak Irish exclusively.  As Dr. N&iacute; Fhrighil mentioned, the figure is 3%, a tiny minority; therefore, one is talking about a maximum figure of one child in every 30.  The second criterion which is often used is proficiency in the Irish language.  There might be families who are bilingual or families where another minority language is spoken.  That is also recognised.  The position varies, but the third criterion might be active interest in the Irish language where parents are learning at the same rate as their children.  Each of these groups has a special value and we welcome all of them.  The point I tried to make earlier is that priority must be given to the tiny minority of children from families who speak Irish in accessing education in the language of communication at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Bl&aacute;thnaid N&iacute; Ghr&eacute;ach&aacute;in"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":53,"content":"<p>As Ms N&iacute; Ghr&eacute;ach&aacute;in remarked, I speak on behalf of the 3% of parents who are raising their children through Irish.  This means that 97% of the children in Gaelscoileanna do not come from that background.  I will put on my professional as opposed to my parental hat.  As a linguist, the 3% group is crucial because these children allow all boats to rise, so to speak.  They are a linguistic resource who, in some cases, are more important than the teachers because they model the language for their peers.  Essentially, having a child like my son who speaks Irish when he cries in his sleep benefits other children because he models what a four, five or six year old says.  This is also very important socially because these children tend to encourage those who do not speak Irish at home to socialise through the language.  That is what we want, namely, balanced bilingual children.<\/p> <p>  While I do not wish to be too technical, I will outline a differentiation made.  For children who speak a global language such as English at home, learning another language can only benefit them and strengthen their home language.  That is exactly what is being spoken about, namely, access to another language opening doors, which is known as additive bilingualism.  If a child who speaks a minoritised language, for example, Irish or Welsh, receives his or her education through the medium of a majority language, he or she will not receive sufficient input in his or her home minoritised language.  What happens in such circumstances is that the child's core competencies in his or her first language recede.  This is known as subtractive bilingualism.  For this reason, we all want additive bilingualism and the way to achieve this is to ensure children who have Irish as their first language at home are in school alongside those who have Irish as a second or third language.  <\/p> <p>  As a group, we are seeking positive discrimination for native Irish speakers outside the Gaeltacht.  We do not mind positive discrimination for any other minority either because our commitment is to diversity.  Inevitably, linguistic, religious and ethnic diversity are all intertwined.  We welcome children for whom English is not the language of the home because it normalises our children's multilingualism.  This means that they do not come home from school and complain to their parents that they are the only children who do not speak English at home.  Diversity is, therefore, very positive for us.  However, we must ensure the indigenous linguistic minority is protected, as happens all over the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. R&iacute;ona N&iacute; Fhrighil"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Somebody referred to the issue of priority for relatives.  Notwithstanding that I am well aware that many people have an emotional attachment to the school they or their grandfather attended, having regard to all of the facts, it is necessary to dispense with this approach.  I saw this done in Australia when I worked there.  It can be done, therefore, and while it raises considerable ire, we may as well face the issue now rather than putting it off or addressing it in a piecemeal fashion.<br\/><br\/>We have to find a way of valuing schools on the basis of factors other than the Central Admissions Office or CAO points system because this approach is destructively undermining the education system.  A person appointed school principal at second level will find that the only way to build his or her school is to build its results in the CAO points race and, on that basis, children will come to the school.  Principals must do whatever is necessary to achieve this.  We have in-built in the system an almost invisible hand which forces principals to do things that are contrary to the good education of the young people in their school and the interests of wider society.<br\/><br\/>We were taken over completely by the notion that third level education was the only way to go.  However, we know, not only in Ireland but also across the world, that many of those emerging from third level education are unable to gain employment and only chose the particular route of third level because they believed it was necessary to have a third level qualification.  There are other options, including the apprenticeship and traineeship systems and the general further education and training system.  There is now evidence to show that in some instances people do significantly better if they go through the latter system.<br\/><br\/>We must consider new measures of success in education.  While this will be a big job, it will be central to ensuring we no longer have a system in which children who do not get into over-subscribed schools travel many miles to attend schools in other communities, thereby pushing out children in those schools, while there is a school next door that is under-subscribed.  The key to achieving this is doing what I have seen done elsewhere, namely, requiring schools to put forward a curriculum that is capable of accommodating the needs of all potential students in the community, rather than leaving it up schools to decide on what curriculum they wish to put forward and allowing them to narrow it as much as they like.  When the curriculum is narrowed, it attracts children who are sharp in primary school performance in the three Rs and other children are pushed away.  This is, to some extent, a critical juncture at which we have a real opportunity to do something.  We suggest the State, perhaps through the education and training boards, handle an admissions system that is fair, transparent and reasonable, while providing a guarantee that, regardless of which school to which parents send their children, it will have a curriculum that is capable of meeting their child's needs.  That is equally important.<br\/><br\/>On forcing somebody away from the school of his or her choice, one would wonder on what basis the choice is made.  It is made on a very ephemeral basis such as a headline in an article in<i>The Irish Times <\/i>or something similar. <br\/><br\/>The Bill and the Act that will follow present a real opportunity to get many things right, not only in admissions policies but also in what happens after a child is admitted to a school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat O'Mahony"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I will address some of the constitutional issues on the freedom of religion.  I am representing the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, evangelical Christians and Atheist Ireland.  Currently, the State is protecting some minority faiths and the majority faith, while discriminating against other minority faiths.  Church of Ireland schools, for example, give priority to members of the Church of Ireland.  They may then go down their lists and offer places to children from a Methodist or Presbyterian background.  Mr. Nick Park informs me that he receives letters from Church of Ireland schools asking him to confirm that his particular church is a church.  This means boards of management are deciding whether his church is a church and making a decision on whether to enrol a minority Protestant child from an evangelical background.<br\/><br\/>The two Muslim schools are under the Islamic Foundation of Ireland, a Sunni Islam organisation.  These schools will not enrol Ahmadiyya Muslims because Sunni Muslims do not believe Ahmadiyya Muslims are proper Muslims.  An issue arises with the second part of section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>) of the Equal Status Act because the Muslim schools argue that their ethos is being undermined.  Will we have some Islamic schools for Sunni Muslims and others for Ahmadiyya Muslims?  Will we have minority faith schools for children from a Church of Ireland background and others for Presbyterian and evangelical children?  We cannot go down that road.  If the Constitution protects religious freedom and freedom of conscience, it does so for everybody, not only the religious majority in a particular area. <br\/><br\/>The main problem for us is what happens in schools because the religious ethos of a particular school permeates the entire school day.  As the religious schools will tell us, their purpose is to evangelise.<\/p><p>However, as they are evangelising children from their own faith, our children are being evangelised with them.  That does not protect religious freedom, as promised in the Constitution.  If the Constitution was designed to protect religious freedom and protect all citizens, it should protect us all.  It does not do so, however, because our right to freedom of conscience in respect of religion and beliefs is being disregarded to protect minority religions.  The very same goes for minorities within minorities, which is what is happening in the country.<\/p><p> Another question concerned what we took from the last report.  We ask the committee to consider again the view that the multiple patronage ethos is undermining religious freedom, freedom of conscience and freedom from discrimination.  We should be trying to promote these rights which we do not have.  They are not in place for minorities.  The constitutional argument is that one needs minority faith and religious schools to buttress religion, but this is not being achieved.

Of course, an argument can be made against the constitutionality of the reform we advocate.  I am sure everyone appreciates that the Constitution is a very vague document or charter.  There are all kinds of legislative measure against which a constitutional argument can be made.  It is very easy to make a constitutional argument at face value, but what has happened in recent years, in particular, is that there has been a tendency to use the Constitution as a pretext to avoid making legislative changes that may in some way be controversial, sensitive or difficult.  It can be used as a pretext to avoid reform, even where there may be parliamentary consensus.  Many citizens find this deeply frustrating.  I am sure many Deputies and Senators are equally frustrated by the way the Constitution is used and distorted.<br\/><br\/>The point is that primary responsibility for arriving at a conclusion on the appropriate balance between competing social claims on constitutional values rests primarily with the Oireachtas, the national parliament.  From as far back as the 1960s the Supreme Court has always been at pains to emphasise that the task of doing this is for the Legislature, the Oireachtas, and that the only role of the Supreme Court is to police the outer boundaries of constitutional interpretation and indicate where a balance of rights is disproportionate or manifestly unreasonable, or however it may be phrased.<br\/><br\/>With all due respect to the Office of the Attorney General and the Attorney General herself, the Oireachtas cannot proceed based on secret or confidential advice from a Government legal officer.  That is not a correct interpretation of the role of the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas must sometimes make a choice on the appropriate balance between competing constitutional rights or claims.  When it comes to the substance of the basis for a secretive, unpublished Government opinion on the alleged impossibility of this reform, the idea is really one of freedom of religion.  The assumption at large, I believe, is that if section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>) were to be amended, if the baptism barrier were to be taken away, it would undermine the freedom of religion of the relevant denominations because they would not be able to maintain the religious environment of their schools which is regarded as integral to the free practise of religion.<br\/><br\/>First, there is a very vague and abstract connection between discrimination in enrolment and the right to practise a religion or uphold a school environment.  There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest it is actually necessary to deny access to minority faith children to uphold the religious values of a school.  An ethos is ultimately a set of values.  It seems incredible to suggest that, in order to uphold these values, it is required to view four and five year old children as somehow posing a threat to their being honoured and enshrined, be they Christian values or values of another kind.  It has been assumed that religious freedom under the Constitution entails a right to discriminate.  What about the other side of the equation?  The other side is a right not to be discriminated against.  The right not to be discriminated against based on one's religion is itself a part of religious freedom.  It is not a case of religious freedom versus equality but of religious freedom itself being undermined, as Ms Jane Donnelly said.  Who are we to judge them, but where parents effectively feel obliged to have their children baptised against their own beliefs in order to gain access to a public service on the same terms as others, it is in itself an assault on freedom of religion constitutionally.  That is an intuitive and common-sense position.  It is equally a constitutional argument that can be and has been made by bodies other than mine and it is a very strong one.  That is not the view taken historically by the Government or its predecessor, but it is one the Oireachtas is free to adopt.  It is free to adopt it as striking the correct balance between competing constitutional rights.<br\/><br\/>What about minority faith schools?  We considered this issue extensively when we drafted the opinion with Equate Ireland.  There is a great difficulty with any legislative attempt to define what a minority faith school might be.  It would have to be on a local or contextualised basis.  We are confident that it would not be feasible to pin down in legislation exactly what a minority school is.  The alternative is to somehow designate minority schools on a case by case basis, be it by the Minister or another party.  For obvious reasons, that also seems to be untenable.<br\/><br\/>Might minority denominational schools be affected disproportionately?  That brings us back to our previous point about the lack of any firm evidence for the link between enrolment policy and ethos.  Nowhere is there a clear exposition of the reasons maintaining a set of values in a school environment actually requires selectivity based, on the one hand, on baptismal certificates and, on the other, on how good someone is as a Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jew or subscriber to any other religion.  That seems to be completely untenable.  It is well within the power of the Oireachtas to decide that any effect on faith schools of whatever kind in terms of control of their own admissions policies is ultimately less important than ensuring parents do not have to suffer pressure or face the fear of being refused access to a public service, a fear that leads them to act against their beliefs by seeking baptismal certificates as a condition of enrolment.<br\/><br\/>The Acting Chairman, Senator Lynn Ruane, asked what form the reform we propose would actually take.  We believe it would be quite simple.  It would entail a simple amendment to section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>) of the Equal Status Act 2000 to set out that it was not permissible to discriminate on religious grounds for schools in receipt of public funding or which were State aided.  This, of course, includes the vast majority of schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eoin Daly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>We stand for two things - equal access to schools and equal respect within them.  Ms Lennon will touch on the issue of respect, while I will deal with issue of access.  This will probably address the various questions raised, all of which I will try to address in what I have to say.<br\/><br\/>First, the rights of minority religions have arisen as a defence of the <i>status quo<\/i>.  The Islamic religion was mentioned as a possible example.  That is interesting in that there are two Islamic schools in the country, both of which are located in Dublin.  I do not agree that it is good to prioritise access and to have children from only one background attending a school.  Fundamentally that is not good.  Regardless, the last census showed that in 2011 there were approximately 50,000 Muslims in the country.  Clearly, if one happens to live near the Muslim schools, one can benefit from prioritised access, but if one lives elsewhere, one will still be at the bottom of the list according to the enrolment policy.  Therefore, it does not benefit minority religions.  It certainly does not benefit the vast majority of religions that do not have any school.<\/p><p>Approximately 90% of primary schools are Catholic.  They also apply a discriminatory enrolment policy.  Accordingly, there is not a strong argument that this benefits minority religions in any way.<br\/><br\/>The balancing of competing rights arises quite a lot in the Constitution.  It contains the right to free primary education, freedom from discrimination and freedom of practice of religion.  These are all rights from which individual citizens benefit.  On the other hand, there is a competing right where there is an institutional right to run schools in a particular way under the freedom of religion for institutions.  The difficulty is that we have strong rights for access to education and freedom from discrimination for individuals but the State - the Government - still favours the rights of institutions as somehow superior, solely on the right to freedom of religion.  Last year, Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, when Minister of State in the Department of Justice and Equality and quoted the Constitution.  He stated, &quot;Every religious denomination shall have the right to manage its own affairs, own, acquire and administer property, movable and immovable, and maintain institutions for religious or charitable purposes&quot;.  This is put forward as a defence of the current <i>status quo<\/i>.  One needs to see schools as institutions for religious or charitable purposes for that to make sense.  Most of us agree that a school is an institution for education, not for religious or charitable purposes.  It seems to be a particularly skewed reading of the Constitution to see this as somehow benefitting institutions as opposed to individuals.  We have senior counsel opinion from Michael Lynn supporting this.  EQUATE also has constitutional experts who support this point.  The Government appears to depend on the opinion of the Attorney General.  This is not a particularly sensitive issue.  I do not see why it cannot be published so we can at least see what the defence is for doing nothing.  Essentially, nothing is being done.<br\/><br\/>Education Equality proposes very much what EQUATE proposes, namely, an amendment to the Equal Status Act to allow free full access to local schools.  The Chair referred to the Labour Party's Equal Status (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016.  It is important to knock that on the head.  There are aspects of the Bill which are good.  In terms of school access, however, it is not good legislation.  Schools can prioritise children of the patron's religion from virtually anywhere in the country ahead of a child who happens to live next door to the school.  Labour's Bill proposes that children from outside a catchment area will no longer be prioritised on the basis of religion but that those within it still will be.  Take the example of two children who live next door, either side of the school.  If one child is not of the patron's religion, under Labour's Bill, he or she will still not have equal access.  Labour's Bill moves children from third-class citizens to second-class.  That is not sufficient when we are talking about human rights.<br\/><br\/>We need to go back to the drawing board and ensure we just have equal access.  What concerns me about Labour's Bill is that if it were successful, it might be deemed an incremental success, might knock things on the head for 15 years and be seen as some sort of compromise.  My concern is that we would have second-class citizenship of our children cast in stone for future generations.<br\/><br\/>Senator Warfield referred to the numbers affected.  Numbers or percentages are not particularly relevant when we are dealing with human rights.  When we are dealing with racial or any other type of discrimination, it is important we uphold everybody's rights.  It was stated earlier that enrolment criteria only kick in with oversubscription.  The Department's numbers indicate that 20% of schools are oversubscribed.  One in five schools will prioritise on the basis of enrolment criteria, which, typically, are religion-based.  Besides that, a parent will never know from year to year whether their local school will be oversubscribed.  The safest bet is always to baptise as one will be prioritised on that basis.  The marriage rate is interesting when people are free to choose the type of ceremony they undergo.  In 1995, 95% of marriage ceremonies were Catholic and 5% non-religious.  In 2015, 56% of marriage ceremonies were Catholic and 33% non-religious.  When people are free to decide for themselves and there is no State-imposed advantage, these are the type of decisions people make.  We suggest that the baptism barrier and the advantage one gets from baptising a child is completely inappropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Monahan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>The Labour Party's Equal Status (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 addresses, in a relatively strong way, the twin goals of education equality, which is equal respect.  The Government's Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 is relatively weak.  Section 62(6)(h) states a school's admissions policy shall \"provide details of the school's policy in relation to its arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction\".  Publishing the way in which a child will be segregated in the school day does not achieve anything.  The Labour Party's Bill proposes schools would not qualify for public moneys unless they are organised to enable the right of the child to opt out of religious instruction.<\/p> <p>  According to the Department of Education and Skills, one in five schools are oversubscribed.  The majority would be in areas of population growth anyway.  To address that, it is proposed to produce 300 new multi-denominational schools in the next 14 years.  Today's four year old will not necessarily benefit from this.<\/p> <p>  The issue of choice is a red herring.  Choice is important but, in some cases, it could be a Hobson's choice.  I live in an area in south County Dublin with three national schools, two Roman Catholic and one Church of Ireland.  My three and a half year old child is category 7 and category 9 in both of those schools.  In terms of south County Dublin being highly populated, accessing those schools is essentially impossible.<\/p> <p>  If we were to access these schools, the big issue is how my son would opt out of religious instruction.  The Bill, as drafted, would not assuage me or give me any confidence in his ability to opt out of religious instruction.  The Labour Party Bill is stronger in this regard.  However, Education Equality's proposal is that, in essence, to afford equal respect and dignity, regardless of religion or religious ethnicity or family background, religious instruction and faith formation should take part in a discrete part of the day - either at the beginning or end of the school day - outside of core hours.  That is a relatively simple and straightforward change which would enable parents to effectively opt their child out without the child being segregated within the school day, sent to the back of the classroom with a book on their own, or maybe as a pair if they are lucky.  That straightforward change would enable parents to effectively make the choice as to whether their child participates in faith formation.<\/p> <p>  To strengthen that, we propose religious instruction and faith formation relating to or arising from the characteristic ethos of the school should not take place at any other time during the school day so as not to permeate the education at any other time during the school day.  This is an issue some parents have experienced with examples such as learning to count by counting angels or using religious iconography.<\/p> <p>  It is a relatively straightforward amendment.  We would appreciate an opportunity for the committee to strengthen what is already in the Bill by actually specifying what opting out would specifically mean and how the Labour Party's Bill on qualifying for public moneys would work.

The problem for special education lies in the post-primary sector.  It is not the fault of the schools because many primary schools set up special classes but when the children move on there is nowhere for them to go.  I know two schools on one campus where in one there is much more openness to children with special educational needs.  They are not members of our association but I am very familiar with them.  The attitude of the other school, however, is not as good, for example, it does not provide leaving certificate applied classes, etc.  That is a small point but it annoys me.  I was involved with both schools.  I agree with the need for the NCSE to have power to compel schools but where the special school or class has had the children and found it was not the right place for them forcing the children back into the school may not be the best thing for them.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Mahony spoke about the points system and Deputy Catherine Martin alluded to the list published last week.  That can sometimes drive the school not to take these children.  In the two situations I mentioned, it is a matter of the attitude of the boards and the staff.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Nolan referred to the teachers feeling ill-equipped.  That is addressed fairly well in primary schools where in the colleges there is a special education placement.<\/p><p>Rather it is beginning to be addressed.  There is also a special education module.  That is welcome.  There is a longitudinal research study from NCSE that will trace the student teachers who graduated this year.  The results of that study will be interesting.<\/p><p> There is a need for more resources to be invested in order to address the issue of teachers feeling they are ill-equipped for it and making the presumption that those in other schools are better equipped.  There is an attitude to the effect that \"The special school down the road would really be a better place for your child because they are all very well trained.\"  I am representing special schools and special classes at this meeting.  Not all teachers in special schools have the additional training either.  It is not an easy option.  Additional resources need to be put into place for training of all staff, from SNAs, teachers and bus escorts - some committee members are probably wondering what is a bus escort but others know what it is - to everyone in the school so that the child coming to school gets the best and the school day goes well for him or her.  More needs to be done to encourage schools to take children with special education needs rather than simply compelling them to do so.  Resources must be put into the system in order to make teachers and staff feel comfortable and boards of management need to be support them in the context of taking in students.  There is no point in forcing a school to take in a child and then discovering that it is not the best place for him or her.  Does that address the question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda Corr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481812200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#P00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Loughlin talked about the specific statement of non-discrimination and the other matters being hard-coded into the legislation.

We want to opt in to an education that is objective, critical and pluralistic.  The Constitution talks about opting out of religious instruction but if one looks at the Education Act, it talks about opting out of anything that is against one's conscience and, arguably, that is more broad.  As a result of ethos and the integrated curriculum, religion goes into all the subjects under the curriculum.  As it stands, our children sit at the back of the religious instruction class.  However, religion is integrated, for example, into relationship and sexuality education and we cannot opt out of that.  Our children would still be sitting in the back of the class in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Another problem is that the schools do not write down their ethos and we do not know where they are integrating religion into the various subjects under the curriculum.  Arguably, we have a constitutional right to opt out of that.  If one thinks about it, our children would be going to school and they would be opting out of the religious instruction class, relationship and sexuality education and any other where during the school day religion is integrated into the curriculum because that is how it works.  We do not really understand ethos but it does integrate into the curriculum.<\/p> <p>  We want to opt in to an education that is objective, critical and pluralistic.  There are international guiding principles of the teaching of religion and beliefs and those are called the Toledo guiding principles.  The NCCA, on foot of a recommendation from the forum, is trying to introduce a course entitled \"Education about Religions and Beliefs\".  We would be supportive of that to the extent that if the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill is amended in line with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's recommendation that the curriculum be delivered in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner, then we would be able to opt in to \"Education about Religions and Beliefs\" in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner.  We would be in a position for the first time in schools where we could opt in to that instead of trying to opt out.  We want to belong.  We do belong.  We do not want segregated schools and we do not want to be in a position when our children go to school that they are segregated again.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy O'Loughlin, I addressed minority schools.  Mr. Daly addressed them as well.  Ireland has a unique system of education.  No other country has that system of education.  What usually happens is that if states fund religious schools, there is a parallel system of non-denominational schools where the majority of children attend.  Even in one particular area in France - Mr. Daly might know more about this - the authorities fund some religious schools but they do not let them discriminate on entry.  Our system is unique.  That is how we discriminate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Donnelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Teasta&iacute;onn uaim d&iacute;reach bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Teachta as an taca&iacute;ocht agus an t-aitheantas a l&eacute;irigh s&iacute; ar riachtanais na hearn&aacute;la.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the transition from na&iacute;onra&iacute; to primary schools, we, as an organisation, actively encourage that transition because we see it as a basic and important step for children.  Not all primary schools would specify attendance at a na&iacute;onra in their enrolment criteria and there are different reasons for that.  It could be geographical, basically, that there is no na&iacute;onra in that area.  Possibly, even the na&iacute;onra could be oversubscribed.  If the primary school is oversubscribed as well, that adds another complication to it.  Also, we have to acknowledge that not all parents will choose a preschool for their children for varying reasons.  However, a large number of Gaelscoileanna do prioritise.  This is particularly important now seeing as the ECCE scheme has been expanded to two years that offers children the opportunity to be immersed fully in the language.  That gives children with no Irish coming into the system and children with varying degrees of Irish an added advantage when they reach primary school that they have those linguistic supports behind them.<\/p> <p>  In terms of special educational needs, as weak as the provisions are in English-medium schools, they are very poor in Irish-medium schools.  There is a wide spectrum of special educational needs throughout the Irish-medium sector.  It is growing - we very much welcome this - but there are no supports in place for those involved and there is no training available.  There is no recognition that they have particular needs in an Irish-medium school.  It is something that we are trying to address with the different partners at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Bl&aacute;thnaid N&iacute; Ghr&eacute;ach&aacute;in"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481812200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I will be brief because we are coming towards the end of the meeting and the Acting Chairman has been good to us so far with time.<\/p> <p>  On the opt-outs, to respond to Deputy Catherine Martin, what we want to see alongside the regulations around admission are regulations for opt-outs for schools so that the parents, children and teachers are empowered to enable the children to opt out of religious instruction during the school day.  We have had public meetings across the country and an issue that has come up a great deal is that parents who choose to do it and who engage with the school on how to do it are being essentially denied it by the school.  In some situations, it is not the parent who suffers; it is the child.  One child, in particular, who we were told about, did not make communion.  On the Monday after the ceremony, there was a party in the school and the child was placed in third class and not allowed to participate as a result of not being involved.  In such a situation, the only person who suffers is the child.  In our opinion, that is not good enough.  With the provision in the Bill making a school publish an opt-out provision, if the Department gives the school the criteria to do that with, it gives everyone more power with which to do it.  In addition, if one has continuous professional development for teachers to enable them to engage with it, it will be better for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Anthony Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1481812200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I am conscious that Mr. O'Mahony was asked a direct question by Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin.

It constitutes a profound denial of the human rights of children and families in the education system for far too long.  It is simply not an acceptable way to address the rights of minorities.  What happens over and over again is that parents think about and consider whether they should exercise their rights under the Constitution and the Education Act.  In our experience eight out of ten families who think about the matter consider they are in a completely invidious position.  At the end of the day they decide that the socialisation of their children is more important than imposing their religious views in such a way that they might be separated.  Education Together provides the only model of education at primary level in which children are never separated, labelled or registered according to their religion at any time during the school day.  There is an opt-in facility to participate entirely on a voluntary basis in faith formation or religious instruction classes outside the normal school day.  That is the only way to address the issue.  Isolating children on the basis of the religious identity of their families is simply inimitable to human rights legislation, educational values and what we think should be the standards of a modern democratic state.  That is why we think the issue must be address in a much more profound way. <\/p> <p>  A question was asked about children with special educational needs.  In Ireland families with children with special educational needs have been treated appallingly.  They have been forced into a situation where time after time they must adopt a confrontational attitude to obtain even minimal services for their children.  This is something the Oireachtas must address as a matter of priority.  The Bill must give the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, the right to ensure resources will be made available for the placement of children.  In our experience there are far too many examples.  Almost all new schools make provision in an integrated manner for children with autism.  In far too many instances, however, we have found that a child has been allocated a place in a special needs facility or a special school.  We are proud of our reputation of being welcoming to children with special educational needs, but repeatedly schools have had to fight for resources to provides the services such children require.  It is fundamental that resources should come with designation.  Otherwise schools will simply use resources that should be allocated for the education of other children to provide such services.  That scenario creates negative dynamics.  I am very much in favour of the NABMSE's position that has been articulated here.  Many of our schools are members of the NABMSE and Educate Together.  As a result, the two organisations work closely together on this matter. <\/p> <p>  I wish to reiterate my main point that the system must change and that the State must take responsibility.  In Lucan, Dublin 15, families apply to every one of the 12 schools in the area.  Literally every child is registered with every school, which means that the schools do not know for sure what are the real preferences of the families.  Therefore, they will allocate a number of places which will not be taken up and which must be reallocated sometimes four, five or six times before they find out the children who will arrive in September.  The initiative that we have seen work in other jurisdictions involves a local authority or an ETB making an application process available with parents being allowed to indicate perhaps three or four preferences.  The local authority or ETB can allocate places based on criteria such as quality, social needs, proximity and retention of the integrity of the family, etc.  If the State was to adopt this regime, it would know the level of demand for different types of schooling, whether it be through the Irish language or otherwise.  It would also for the first time start to allocate resources to meet the real needs of families in our society.  We have to move ahead in that way.  The State must think in a much more systemic way.  As the population grows, the problem of the over-subscription of schools will be exacerbated.  We must, therefore, find a much better way of managing the system as a whole.  We ask the committee, particularly in the context of section 65 that refers to the power of the Minister to require boards of management to combine, to strengthen the provision to enable an area-based admissions system to be introduced with statutory backing.<\/p> <p>  Education Together wholeheartedly supports the EQUATE campaign on education equality.  We fully support the campaign undertaken by Atheist Ireland, Ahmadiyya Muslims, minority Muslim community in Ireland, and Evangelical Alliance Ireland, the members of which are Christians.  We also support the rights of the schools that teach through the medium of Irish.  We fully support families who wish their children to access an education which involves full immersion in the Irish language.  One of the founding schools, Gaelscoil an Ghoirt &Aacute;lainn, is a member of Educate Together.  We are very happy that that is the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016121500002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Rowe"},{"type":"speech","time":1481812200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank the delegates for their attendance.

We gave evidence as a team representing stakeholders in Newry to the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee in the House of Commons two weeks ago.  It is a privilege to be here today.  We are not politicians and this is not what we do.  We are here today because we are deeply concerned by the risks that Brexit presents to the transformation of the Newry Border region.<\/p><p>We will be as honest as we can be, and, as <i>The Irish Times<\/i>put it, we are here because &quot;it is hard to imagine anything so pervasive and critical&quot;.  <br\/><br\/>Having contributed with others to the transformation of our area from a European record high unemployment rate of almost 30% in 1972 to 2.5% in 2016, we will not countenance decades of sweat equity being put at risk by people who do not seem to have the interests of the well-being of our people at the centre of their considerations, but we will not be negative.  We have a positive message.  The success of the work in Newry Way was founded on open-mindedness, collaboration, being outward-looking and not being constrained by borders or sectarianism.  We want to disseminate our perspective and share our experience with agencies of Government North and South of the Border and beyond who have the power to transform.  It is in that approach we have achieved and continue to achieve, as a citizenry in Newry, the Border region and its hinterland and there lies the pathway to success for Northern Ireland and prosperity and stability for all citizens on this island.  <br\/><br\/>However, it is a fact that the economy of our region was devastated by partition, not only that of Newry but its sister-town, Dundalk.  Newry was a significant port and trading node midway along the east coast between Belfast and Dublin, and Dundalk was an important centre for the production of engineered goods, leatherwear  and beer.  However, through most of the 20th century the region endured some of the highest rates of unemployment in Europe, emigration, under-investment and political instability, and that predated the Troubles.  For example, Newry had 16% unemployment in 1962 when Britain had full employment and it had almost 30% unemployment in 1972.  Newry became disadvantaged by its location, close to the enforced Border.  After 1922 it was known as the frontier town.  The Northern Ireland state did not invest in cross-Border roads or other links with the Republic.  People travelling across the Border before the Troubles required approval to do so on most of the routes across the Border, which were designated unapproved.  Newry's hinterland of south Armagh was branded bandit country and Dundalk, its sister-town, was branded El Paso during the Troubles.<br\/><br\/>However, during the past 25 years, these communities, North and South of the Border, the partition boundary, have taken advantage of the dissolution of the Border as a barrier to the movement of goods and people and have grown world-leading, innovative, locally owned companies, employing thousands.  We have built an economy comprising very successful home-grown, large exporting employers but also thousands of agile micro-enterprises, trading deftly between the two jurisdictions in Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>Our companies benefit from a supply of skilled workers from a cross-Border labour pool.  They leverage now what is Newry's biggest advantage, its accessible east coast location less than an hour from Belfast and Dublin.  The vast majority of our businesses in this Border region are home market or near shore traders.  Their ability to freely access near shore markets is crucial to their competitiveness, profitability and sustainability.  Any disruption to trading modalities, and especially to the freedom of movement, will badly affect the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector.  Beyond Britain and the island of Ireland, the near shore markets with which our companies trade are in the EU.<br\/><br\/>The weak sterling currency is a windfall currently for Newry retailers, but that is only for as long as there is free unfettered movement of shoppers travelling up North from the Republic with no limits on how much product they can bring back.<br\/><br\/>A number of our companies in the Border region have used their experience in growing from small companies to larger companies, now employing thousands, to develop markets further ashore.  Those which have done so tell us that trading far offshore is complex.  There are transport issues, challenges, local market intelligence, the limited reach of legal protections with respect to intellectual property or payment defaults, political stability issues and so on.  They tell us in our consultations that the markets in the so-called Anglo sphere are distant.  Costs go up before their goods have to be shipped, so markets such as Australia and New Zealand have relatively small populations, fractions of the size of the French or German markets alone.  Those that produce within a complex regulatory framework are concerned as to how the thousands of EU laws and regulations which are embedded in UK law will be handled.  <br\/><br\/>We want to work, as we have already been doing, with the authorities of the Irish Republic and we look forward to collaborating with the committee to make the best that we can of this challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor Patterson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481811000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Patterson for his contribution.

I am originally from Warrenpoint in County Down but I was educated partly in Dublin and worked for more than 20 years in the Republic for a major multinational company, Esso, running its oil terminals in Dublin and in Cork.<\/p> <p>  Warrenpoint Harbour is located in County Down, six miles form the city of Newry and approximately half way between Dublin and Belfast, along the major economic corridor.  From a trade point of view, Warrenpoint Port is the second port in Northern Ireland and the fifth on the island of Ireland.  In recent years we have displaced Derry and Larne to take up second place after Belfast.  The port was originally developed in the early 1970s to replace the port of Newry, whose ship canal had become redundant due to the ever increasing size of vessels.  Warrenpoint's trade has continued to develop and it has seen significant growth, particularly in the past decade.  However, this is primarily due to its location and the improved road infrastructure, which has led to greater connectivity across the island of Ireland.  The port is located at the head of Carlingford Lough and is a distance of 13 miles by road from the Border but, as many of the members will know, less than 100 m by sea.  <\/p> <p>  Warrenpoint Port is a major economic driver for south Ulster and north Leinster and, critically, 48% of the trade of the port goes to or comes from the Republic.  Warrenpoint is a microcosm of a large port such as Dublin or Belfast.  In other words, it is not like Larne or Rosslare, which are only terminals.  We have a wide portfolio of business, including roll on-roll off, two ships travelling in both directions each day to Heysham, container traffic which goes from Warrenpoint to Dublin, to Bristol and Cardiff on a milk run, bulk timber imports, steel, bulk cement exports from County Cavan and major animal feed importation.  The major animal feed importer is a company from Dublin, which invested along with us in a joint venture less than two years ago of &pound;3 million to service the agrifood industry in Down, Armagh, Cavan and Louth.  We also handle recyclables, fertilisers and we have a small facility for fishing and marine leisure craft.  <\/p> <p>  In 2010, a &pound;22 million investment was made to purchase additional land for storage, new cranage, new ro-ro berth and to deepen the quays.  Warrenpoint Harbour provides employment for 75 people directly with more than 200 working in the port every day between the shipping agents, companies and hauliers.  The success of the port is in many ways due to its ability to market and service its natural hinterland, which is geographically rather than politically determined.<\/p><p>The emergence of the Single European Act in 1992 and the dismantling of trade barriers has ensured the success of the business.  The implications of Brexit and the possibility of restrictions in trade by the imposition of tariffs or additional administrative burdens could be catastrophic for the business and for the multiplier of 1,200 jobs in the local area on both sides of the Border.  We have a workforce that emanates from both sides of the Border and I am proud to say that the first female harbour master in Ireland and the UK is Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Dowling.  She was appointed recently and she is from Drogheda.  That is a good example of cross-Border jobs.<\/p><p> With regard to the harbour authority and our desire to maintain and continue to grow our business, develop it and create more jobs, we are working very hard in both jurisdictions to ensure a sensible and what I will call a soft Border.<\/p><p> Finally, the competition that exists between the main ports on the east coast of Ireland is good for the economies of both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  I am sure the committee understands why I say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Conway","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481811000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>To give some background on Autoline Insurance Group, we started life as a small business more than 40 years ago in 1975 selling mainly personal lines insurance in Newry, which was at the time in the full throes of the Troubles.  We gradually managed to grow the business against the odds and we diversified into commercial insurance and financial services.  Challenges in the insurance market during the Troubles, specifically in our region, meant that it was much more difficult to attract insurers into the market, with fringe companies withdrawing completely and only the large corporates remaining.  That had an impact on the level of premiums and pricing.  Insurer visits on the ground were few and far between and insurance premiums for clients were extremely high.<br\/><br\/>I acquired control of the company in 1997 and began to work through our vision of growing the company to its full potential.  One of the challenges prior to this current era was the attraction of talented employees to Newry and the Border area in general.  Over the past ten years, we have grown from 50 employees to almost 200.  Turnover has grown from &pound;11 million to just less than &pound;50 million.  In 2007 and 2008, we acquired five additional brokerages across Northern Ireland, which expanded our geographical reach across all the main regions.  Three years ago we opened a greenfield site in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, which is also affected by its close proximity to the Border.<br\/><br\/>We have a reputation in the market for innovation in both products and talent management.  We secured the gold accreditation from Investors in People in 2012 and have positioned ourselves as an employer of choice to attract the right talent from all over Ireland, North and South of the Border.  We have twice won the <i>Irish News<\/i>innovative employer of the year and, for each of the past two years, we have won insurance industry awards for UK broker innovation of the year.  In November 2014, we secured financial assistance of &pound;500,000 from Invest NI towards the employment creation of 60 new jobs related to our young driver telematics product, which has been exported to Britain and the Republic of Ireland.  Recently, Invest NI has pledged a skills growth programme grant of a further &pound;285,000 for training and development of staff related to that project.<br\/><br\/>Also in 2014, we commenced a knowledge transfer partnership with Queen's University, Belfast, through which we recruited a Vietnamese data scientist to work inhouse on our telematics data for two years.  He earned his first-class masters degree in data science from the UCD Smurfit Business School and was part of a well-established community in Dublin.  Coming North to work for us was not a huge move for him.  However, he was unfortunately the first casualty of Brexit.  Having previously agreed to remain with us after the end of his knowledge transfer partnership, as soon as the leave vote won UK referendum, he made plans to look for employment in Dublin as he felt it was important to remain within the EU.<br\/><br\/>One of our significant market opportunities is to grow into the Republic of Ireland market, particularly with our young driver product.  I know that insurance and its rising cost in the Republic of Ireland market has been a very topical point here.  As such, it is a strategic development market for us, especially for our innovative ChilliDrive app, which paves the way to offer affordable insurance to consumers.  A key expansion opportunity for us would be to set up an operation South of the Border to allow us to offer our ChilliDrive driver coaching app to young drivers in the South and to allow us to benefit from the rich talent pool in new areas of research and technology.<br\/><br\/>One of our major concerns is how the flow of talent will be affected by markets across the Border.  A significant portion of our agri-business growth strategy was the natural step into the Republic, given that two of our offices, Newry and Enniskillen, are so close to the South.  This will inevitably become more difficult from a regulatory perspective if there is a hard Brexit, with the possibility of the passport rights we currently enjoy to trade in other EU jurisdictions being withdrawn.  We may also be inadvertently affected by our insurer partners' passport rights being similarly affected.  A key element of our business development plan is to acquire brokerages in the South.  All in all, despite the natural organic growth potential for expanding into what is already a market we trade in, any impediment to doing business in the South will inevitably adversely affect our growth strategy or, at the very least, slow us down significantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Blaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1481811000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I will open it up to questions now.

I must declare an interest as a representative of the Newry and Armagh constituency, which, as the witness has indicated very clearly, is going to be badly impacted by Brexit if it comes about.  The resurgence of Newry in terms of business is down to people like Mr. Blaney.  It is not down to outside influences or outside investment.  Autoline, Warrenpoint Port, the Newry and Mourne Enterprise Agency, First Derivatives and Norbrook all come from local people and do not depend on the outside.  It is a Newry thing that people have that get-up-and-go approach to make it a success.<\/p> <p>  When I started as an advice worker in the 1980s, Newry had the third highest unemployment rate in western Europe.  That has changed.  Dr. Patterson said that we are now at 2%, but we are still a low-wage economy.  Taking the quays for example, one could walk from Debenhams at one end to Sainsburys at the other.  Most of the profits from all of those shops and organisations goes back to Britain.  The only thing that comes into our economy from those particular sources in most cases is the minimum wage, or what is now called the living wage.<\/p> <p>  There is one practical issue that I have come across that perhaps has not been fully addressed.  It is the dependence of people in our area on the likes of tax credits because of the low wage.  We have many people, and I deal with them daily, who work in Newry and live across the Border or vice versa.  They are going to be badly impacted.  At the moment, living in one jurisdiction and working in another is called a complex case.  If Brexit is to happen, that situation is going to become even more complex.  I know that some people are left without benefit on top of their wages and without a supplement.  There are issues like that.<\/p> <p>  The common travel area is something that has been spoken about with regard to Brexit.  For many people, I believe that is a red herring.  People in Newry tend to gravitate to the South socially.  Very rarely would young people in Newry go to Banbridge, Dromore, Hillsborough or even Belfast, although maybe that is more so the case now.  There has always been that connection with the South.  If Brexit is to happen, it is not necessarily going to stop people travelling from Newry to Dundalk to socialise or whatever.  It is more about the tariffs and how businesses are affected, particularly the likes of the port.  In the case of the enterprise agency, the location of the enterprise centre in Flurrybridge, which is right on the Border, was a deliberate move to encourage that diversification between North and South.  Therefore, there is no doubt that Brexit will have a huge impact.<\/p> <p>  We talk about employment rights in terms of the Good Friday Agreement, much of which was predicated on human rights from Europe, employment rights and all of that.  The British are intent on rewriting the script on that.  There is no doubt that will have an adverse effect.<\/p><p>Most farmers in the constituency rely on the single farm payment because we have a lot of small farmers, unlike the co-operatives in the south east of England.  As Mr. Michael Blaney said, a lot of his staff and business are cross-Border so there is the issue of how that might be impacted.  It is the same with workers in small businesses.  People may want to stay within the EU if Britain pulls out.  How frustrating would that be with Warrenpoint port?  If one takes Omeath and Greenore in Carlingford as examples, people would have to pay tariffs to travel that relatively small distance.  All these issues will have a huge impact on our area if Brexit is put into place.  The witnesses have articulated very well the difficulties that our area in particular and the whole Border region faces.  Along the Border region, since partition, people in Newry, Dundalk and Drogheda and places like that have done the business themselves and not relied on outside influences.  That continues and is to their credit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mickey Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481811000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>We will take one contribution at a time.

We had armed patrols on the Border through the 1950s and 1960s.  We had a hard Border through most of the 20th century.  People needed approval to travel on unapproved roads.  It is a red herring.

I already had the benefit of hearing the witnesses' evidence in the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee in London.  Do the witnesses have any statistics on the number of people travelling from North to South and from South to North for work?

I do not know if they are defensible or not but they suggest there are about 12 million movements per annum.  That includes shoppers and people travelling back and forth socially, that is journey movements.  We do not have any disaggregated figures from Newry.  First Derivatives is a major employer in Newry which now employs 1,700 people from its Newry base.  It operates in centres around the globe and 60% of its recruits are from the Irish Republic.  It recruits from across the island.  The talent pool, as it describes it and as Mr. Michael Blaney has described it, here in the Republic is very important to that company.  Similarly Norbrook estimates that about 25% of its workforce comes from the Irish Republic.  Employers in Dundalk are important to people from Newry who work in PayPal, Heinz and so on in Dundalk.

It was an initiative we came up with about five or six years ago to address the ridiculously high cost of young driver insurance.  It was initially for customers who were commercial business owners who were trying to get their sons and daughters on the road for the first time to facilitate travel.  It was very difficult to attract insurers into that marketplace.  We developed some technology, which Dr. McDonnell may have heard referred to as black box technology, which puts a box into a car and measures how they drive.  We took it a stage further.  We found that black box technology was prohibitively expensive to install so we designed a phone app to do exactly the same thing so it was much more cost-effective.  For the first time, an insurer could see how a driver performed when he or she got behind the wheel, particularly a young or inexperienced driver.  It scored them on a number of areas such as braking, anticipating and appropriate use of speed.  It gave them an insight very quickly into who the more reckless drivers were.  The most positive part of it was that the good drivers, who represent the vast majority and are not reckless in how they approach driving on the road, were able to get up to 50% discount off the rates we had previously been able to offer in the marketplace.<\/p> <p>  It was an initiative which has been welcomed by insurers because they are able to enter that sector which is quite attractive to them considering the size of the premiums.  They are also able to manage it from a profitability perspective which was always the challenge previously.  Most insurers decided to stay away from it completely for that reason.  We built a data hub and we managed to share the data between insurers and our clients and it has been growing.  This year, that particular part of our business grew by 124%.  It has been a huge growth area.  There is a big market opportunity in the Republic of Ireland market to develop further.  Anything that would block the movement of trade and stop us being able to establish a presence here to offer that into the market would be a retrograde step.<\/p><p>Such trade is firmly on our roadmap for development for next year but we must question the impact Brexit might have on our ability to trade into the Republic of Ireland as our UK Financial Conduct Authority regulation allows us to passport into any other EU state.  That currently allows us to trade, without any barrier or difficulty, into the Republic of Ireland.

I would have been very mad to come here today without taking into account the very pertinent question on whether trade lost to us would go to Drogheda, Dundalk, Greenore or Dublin.  When one considers this matter, one must remember that one of the great advantages of the Single European Act was that it cut away borders and tariffs and created a marketplace with competition.  I am an economist by profession and I believe competition is good for business across the board.  Drogheda, Greenore, Warrenpoint, Belfast and Dublin all compete against one another.  If one location gains a little business and the another loses, that is life.  What concerns me is the imposition of what we will call a non-natural border.  I made the point earlier that it is a geographic hinterland to which we appeal.<\/p> <p>  There could be distortions.  For example, there is a large amount of trade from Northern Ireland to Dublin.  I refer to haulage.  If there are tariffs at the Border, that trade will stay within Northern Ireland and go to Britain via the link from Belfast to Liverpool or Stranraer, or from Warrenpoint to Heysham.  There will be benefits to one jurisdiction in certain cases and to another in other cases but, overall, my view and that on both sides of the Border and among businesses is that competition is very good.  It is believed that imposing tariffs or trade restrictions is of the past and should not really happen.  That is one of the reasons we are trying to lobby as best we can.<\/p> <p>  We hosted a very large conference, the British Ports Association conference, a couple of years ago.  I was delighted that the chief executive of Dublin port addressed it.  That is not something we should be afraid of.  We should embrace it but I am obviously very much aware that there might be other voices with a different opinion.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Patterson touched on the mood within the United Kingdom suggesting this will all be resolved by having trade with Canada, New Zealand and Brazil.  Canadian vessels come to Warrenpoint with grain and there is trade from Ukraine; we still have that.  The point being made is, therefore, another red herring.  I was in Dover recently at a conference where I noted that very many of the vessels outside the window were travelling back from and to France.  I assure the committee that in ten years' time, they will still be going to France.  In 20 years, they will still be going to France; they will not be going to Canada.  Floating the idea that trade with Canada will resolve the problem is anathema and incorrect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1481811000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I must interrupt because there is a vote in the D&aacute;il and we need to suspend for ten minutes.

In the mid-1990s, I moved back to Newry from Scotland where I had been working in Aberdeen, which is in the north-east of the country.  At that point, part of my role was to try to encourage early cross-Border collaboration and so I carried out an audit of the Newry-Dundalk cross-Border region that was funded by the International Fund for Ireland.  One of the findings of that audit was that there was very little contact between the two public sectors, never mind the people who crossed from one jurisdiction to the other to work in the public sector.  The officials in the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in the North had next to no contact with, or knowledge of, their equivalent departmental officials in the South.  It is no exaggeration to say that the two public sectors worked back to back.<\/p> <p>  Many observers take the view that the cross-Border bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement, including InterTradeIreland, are under-funded relative to their aspiration when they were set up and that this has constrained their ability to work.  To my knowledge they are the only areas of the public sector where there is significant mixing of experts and officials from both sides of the Border.  The problems that are being experienced here, for example, in the health service in terms of recruiting doctors and nurses apply equally in the North.  There is also a skills shortage in the North.  Similarly, the public sector contraction being experienced in the South is also being experienced in the North.  The public sector is not a sector brim-full of opportunities of employment.  One area of the public sector in which there has been a lot of collaboration is health, with many people from the North travelling South to Dublin for heart surgery funded by the NHS.  This is an acknowledgement that Dublin has a critical mass of resources and expertise in that discipline.  There are other examples where the opposite applies, including Altnagelvin Area Hospital in the north-west and the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen.<\/p> <p>  On education, Mr. Conway and I are graduates of a Dublin university.  We have both observed that since we studied here in the 1970s and 1980s, there has been a significant decline in the number of people travelling from the Northern Ireland jurisdiction across the Border to the South to study.  There are issues around the valuing and weighting given to A levels relative to the leaving certificate in terms of how A levels matriculate for entry into higher education institutions in the South.  However, I do not propose to go into detail in that regard now.  Dundalk Institute of Technology has worked hard to attract students from the North but the numbers remain low.  For example, at the last count there were almost three times the number of students from China attending the institute as there were students from the entire jurisdiction of Northern Ireland.  Dundalk Institute of Technology is a fabulous institution with great facilities but, again, young people are experiencing difficulty matriculating into particular courses based on their A levels, which are relative to what they can do within the further education, FE, sector in the North.  As I said, the two jurisdictions are developing back-to-back.  On this issue and many others, including the treatment of qualifications, there is a need for greater harmonisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor Patterson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481811000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's point regarding insurance and regulation, the advantage that we have is that we can operate, currently, with a single regulator, namely, the UK regulator, and that allows us to passport into the Republic.

We would have two standards to which we would need to operate because the professional exams do not translate as they have different levels and standards.

Effectively, it would be difficult for us to operate a dual-regulation system.  It makes perfect sense the way matters are now.

They comprehensively outlined the difficulties which face us but also the significant progress made on our island since the Good Friday Agreement.  I come from a Border area, Bawnboy, west of Ballyconnell, near Fermanagh.  I grew up with the customs posts and the permanent vehicle checkpoints on both sides of the Border.  Psychologically, any of us who grew up in that environment never want to see any restrictions, within reason, on the movement of people on the island again.  Psychologically, much damage has been done already by the decision of the British people in the referendum to decide to leave the EU.<\/p><p>I am reasonably familiar with Newry, a fine town which has the status of city.  Along with my good friend and party colleague, Deputy Breathnach, we canvassed with Justin McNulty, MLA, for the &quot;Remain&quot; vote prior to the referendum.  Dr. Conor Patterson used a quote from <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, &quot;it is hard to imagine anything so pervasive and critical&quot;, which is accurate.  He also mentioned in the context of the progress that has been made and how we trade deftly.  I have referred to the fact there is a seamless movement of people, goods and services on our island to this committee before.  We have underestimated the progress made in commerce and socially since the Good Friday Agreement.  There has been significant growth in trade between North and South.  I think of Cavan-Monaghan, which I have the privilege of representing, and the movement North and South of people for jobs and goods and services.<\/p><p>Mr. Peter Conway spoke about the all-Ireland dimension of the goods imported and exported through Warrenpoint Port.  Products coming into the port are distributed North and South while products leaving the port come from the South as well as the North.  This shows how the port is an all-Ireland facility.<\/p><p>Take the example of our food processing companies.  Lakeland Dairies, a company with which I am familiar in my constituency, has taken over agribusinesses north of the Border.  It has manufacturing and processing sites on both sides of the Border.  Its raw material, milk, travels North and South, depending on the time of year, where the needs are and the different processing plants.  LacPatrick Dairies, the result of a merger between the Town of Monaghan Co-op and another major co-op north of the Border, Ballyrashane Co-op, is in a similar situation.  Where are we going to be with regard to regulatory systems and requirements?<\/p><p>At the recent North-South Interparliamentary Association meeting at Stormont, I said the first people who would oppose the dumbing down of food standards will be farmers.  Farmers on both sides of the Border work to highly demanding and exacting standards.  That is why as an island we can sell food to 161 countries worldwide.  Our farmers, both North and South, will want to continue to work to those standards.  We hope there will be no variation in the standards in animal husbandry or food processing between North and South.<\/p><p>I had a spat with the Northern Ireland First Minister on the need for an all-Ireland industrial promotion agency.  We live in the real world.  With this island's population, we are a small player worldwide.  We need to be marketing our island as one unit, not to be building barriers between North and South.  Mr. Michael Blaney referred to human resources.  In my area, I see the movement of people from Enniskillen and Tyrone working in the insurance industry in Cavan.  There is a pool of people available and there is no Border when their particular skills are needed.  We hope impassable barriers will not be erected.  I accept that there will be changes.  If Britain leaves the EU, unfortunately, that decision will not be reversed.<\/p><p>Is there good co-ordination and co-operation between the various organisations in the North with their sister organisations in the South?  The danger is if the different sectors North and South get into silo-thinking.  Unfortunately, be it public administration or the private sector, too many issues are confined to silo-thinking.  If we have silo-thinking, North and South, then we will compound the problem.<\/p><p>What is happening between Invest Northern Ireland and Enterprise Ireland?  Over the years, different Northern Ireland firms have gone on trade missions with our industrial promotion agencies.  That is the way it should be.  I hope there is interaction and dialogue between representative organisations north of the Border with our promotional statutory agencies south of the Border.  If that is not happening, we need to initiate it.  Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, and Bord Bia are competent organisations with good international standing.  I am sure Invest Northern Ireland would have a similar standing.<\/p><p>The number of people travelling between North and South and <i>vice versa<\/i>is not captured in total because it is more impressive than we think.  From the car registration plates in the school car parks, one can tell large numbers of teachers in my area live in Northern Ireland.  A significant number of people working in our health service are from Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa<\/i>.<\/p><p>This committee should be discussing the potential to build on the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, that referendum decision has put a certain stop on what our aspirations should be.  During the course of the previous D&aacute;il, at this committee we would have been making the case for building on the potential of the Good Friday Agreement.  During the previous D&aacute;il we would have talked and had presentations at the committee about the need for all-island thinking and an all-island body on the provision of educational services and health services.  It goes back to the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen, which should be providing specialist services for Sligo, south Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan as well as its own immediate hinterland.  The educational services should be planned on an all-island basis.  We were discussing that type of potential in the past and, hopefully, notwithstanding the considerable challenges that face us today, we can discuss that in the future as well.<\/p><p> Mr. Blaney mentioned the lack of co-operation between Departments, North and South.  From my time in the then Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, there was significant co-operation between the Departments with responsibility for agriculture, North and South.  In my time as Minister, we would have had veterinary surgeons from here working and attending public meetings in Northern Ireland as well.  Significant collaboration took place.  It is probably the Department that would be the best example of good co-operation and collaboration.  To a certain extent, that probably was born from and given momentum by the fact that we had to fight disease on an all-island basis.  A good job was done and there was never silo thinking in respect of dealing with those particular issues.  As Dr. Alasdair McDonnell stated, the presentations that were made are exemplary - they are both concise and powerful.  More people would want to hear them.  We need to have, and be influencing, those who will be making decisions as soon as possible.  I am concerned about silo thinking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#P00200","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481811000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brendan Smith.

I suggested that if some in Northern Ireland, because of their political perspectives, were uncomfortable with collaborating on an all-island basis, they could at least encourage cross-sectoral collaboration within Northern Ireland.  I was given short shrift in that regard.  It is always good to collaborate.  We, for example, have strong links with peer organisations in the Republic, namely, the chambers of commerce - for example, the British-Irish, Dundalk and Drogheda chambers.  We work closely with all those organisations.  The bigger challenge for us is having the conversations that need to be had within Northern Ireland.  We made the point that Dr. Alasdair McDonnell and I spoke to parliamentarians at the French National Assembly and our problem was what is the Northern Ireland plc proposition because it is not coherent.  We have people within business and within other stakeholder organisations who, frankly, are uneasy about asserting their position on Brexit because it has become so politicised because it has become tainted and mixed up with the issue of national identity.  One view is that this asserts UK sovereignty more strongly than has been the case in the past 20 years.  There is another perspective that this threatens Irish identity and parity of esteem.  Deputy Brendan Smith, with his experience in public service and as a Minister, will understand how toxic all of that is.  For us, the challenge is as much to encourage dialogue within Northern Ireland and encourage those who are decision-makers in Northern Ireland to facilitate the sort of forum discussions that were put in place by the Taoiseach that envisage in the next round the discussions will be sectoral and all-island, and some of the meetings might actually take place within Northern Ireland.  There is always more that could be done but, certainly, there has been leadership shown here in Dublin on our behalf.  The Irish Government in Dublin is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and it is important that that is understood.<\/p> <p>  In terms of collaboration, those of us who can speak more freely who are not members of the public service would say that the all-island bodies have been constrained in what they could do.  Those politically who were lacking in enthusiasm for the all-island proposition, the concern is, as we have moved through this Brexit debate, are, if anything, much more hawkish and we are currently in a position where there is less collaboration rather than more.  That is something all of us, for example, those within influence within this committee, need to address because this has implications for the whole island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor Patterson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481811000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Is \"Teachta D&aacute;il\" the correct address?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1481811000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Teachta D&aacute;la.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#Q00500","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481811000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I will try and say it properly.  My school Irish is a long way back.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's observations about the regulations are of very serious concern to those of us who work in a trade which is cross Border.  To use the example to which the Deputy alluded, in the context of the importation of grain - which is used for the agrifood sector, North and South, for feeding animals, such as cattle and pigs, in particular, and the poultry business, which is prominent in the Border area - if the two jurisdictions diverge in their regulations in the future because one will be external to the EU and one will be within it, does that mean that we will not be able to commingle the product?  Does that mean we will have to hold different storage for that going south and going north?  That starts to create more costs and expense and in the end, the consumer pays.  Therein is a complete minefield.  The Deputy is correct to raise the matter.  It goes right through all sorts of other businesses and industry.  It could even be in the medical line in regulations for manufactured goods.  If these start to diverge, we could have a very serious situation.  For example, if we are importing maize from Finland, Sweden, Germany or France - in fact, 70% of the grain trade goes south - does that mean, if there will be tariffs on it landing with us, that those tariffs have to be adjusted when it crosses the Border again.  It would be a nightmare.  Let us hope that does not happen.<\/p> <p>  The question about collaboration was also a good one.  I can speak a little on behalf of the Confederation of British Industry, CBI, because we are members of that organisation.  The CBI was very much in favour of remaining and would still hold that viewpoint.  Indeed, the current chairman of the CBI, Mr. David Gavaghan, addressed the forum in Dublin.  He came south for that, as did the chief executive of the Ulster Farmers' Union.  It would be wrong to say that there are people there who do not want to engage.  That is not true.  This is a very serious issue and I am quite sure that we can embrace and take more and more people to be involved.  With regard to CBI, Mr. Simon Hamilton, MLA, the Economy Minister at Stormont, addressed a recent session in Belfast I attended.  He stated clearly that there may well be opinions put forward in the political arena but behind the scenes there is a serious concern about these sort of issues, and I think we just need to encourage people to engage.  The CBI works closely with IBEC.  That is a good forum and we should encourage it.<\/p> <p>  We have talked here about these concerns and about the issues that face us but we should not forget that perhaps there are solutions as well.  I agree with Senator Craughwell and Deputy Brendan Smith that, unfortunately, this will happen.<\/p><p>Therefore, we very much need to consider how we might make it work for us and try to resolve these issues.  Some examples have been used, such as the relationship between Norway and Sweden, which is a good example.  Perhaps we should concentrate on trying to see how we might get something similar to work here so that there are not these delays on the Border and restrictions on cross-Border workers or movement of goods and people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Conway","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481811000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Blaney wish to make a contribution at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#R00200","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481811000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Yes, briefly.  All-island business units are already very common in the insurance sector.  A number of the main insurers, for instance, Allianz, AXA, RSA, already operate on an all-island business unit basis.  They have offices in Belfast and Dublin but are managed from Dublin.  This level of co-operation has been in place probably for the past nine or ten years.  From a natural perspective, it has made more sense for the Northern Ireland business unit to team up with the Republic of Ireland unit as a single trading unit.  There is a natural level of collaboration in this regard.  There is a concern in our industry as to how this will continue beyond the outcome of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  At the next level down, regarding representative bodies, there is the Irish Brokers Association, IBA, which is very active here, and we fall under the British Insurance Brokers Association, BIBA.

Like Deputy Smith, coming from a Border constituency, I empathise with and realise the difficulties Brexit has brought upon us.  It is important to acknowledge Justin McNulty, MP, MLA, and Peter McEvoy, who are in the Gallery.  They are interested in today's proceedings.<\/p> <p>  Little did I think when I entered D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as a first-time Deputy this year and was appointed to work with cross-Border bodies and issues pertaining to North-South co-operation that I would find myself thinking Brexit might happen.  That was until I went to canvass in Newry, at which point I saw we would be building on the progress made over the past 20 to 25 years on the collaborative approach to which Mr. Patterson and others have referred.  I have spent much time thinking about this.  I grew up at a time when we had our backs to each other on the Border.  We began to face each other and then, over recent years and prior to 25 June, we were very much shoulder to shoulder.  Having spent 25 years on a local authority, I know much of this concentration was on attempts to build on uncontentious issues, be it tourism or green energy, and this spirit of co-operation.  It is startling to read the passport statistics, which show there has been a 46% increase over a two-year period in passport applications from the North.  That speaks for itself.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the issue of free movement of people, the only figures we have on this are for 2011.  They are based on the CSO book to which Senator Landy and I referred.  I do not believe the statistics.  It is interesting that figures ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 are being bandied around, and I think Deputy Smith referred to this.  The figures we have from the CSO indicate that 8,295 residents of Ireland in 2011 were in full-time education or employment in Northern Ireland and that 6,456 residents of Northern Ireland were in full-time education or employment in Ireland.  We can talk anecdotally about the figures.  My experience from visiting the local authority offices of Louth County Council or schools, to which Deputy Smith referred, is that the degree of movement is much greater than these figures would suggest.  I referred earlier while we were in private session to the need perhaps to upgrade the statistics for Northern Ireland to engage better to understand the situation.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Conway comment on the statistic regarding Warrenpoint Port?  He stated that 48% of goods either go to or come from the South.  I am interested to know what percentage is going either way.  Will he refer to this in his response?  I have referred to things that could be done despite the difficulties of Brexit.  Our broadband service is one example.  I am sure in the insurance industry or anywhere else there is an essential need for proper broadband services.  We have had major problems with our train services.  While I know the witnesses represent individual groups, be they representing industry, enterprise or port company businesses, connectivity is important.  Will the witnesses comment on this connectivity and how we might ensure post Brexit that this shoulder-to-shoulder approach continues and that we hold hands and ensure the all-island economy is not affected?  I ask the witnesses to comment on these wider issues.<\/p> <p>  People move from one place to another.  Deputy Smith was in America last week, as he said.  The witnesses have travelled to various places.  I have been in Stormont.  We have been to the Houses of Commons, at which presentations were made.  Lord Jay of the House of Lords has presented to us.  We are all talking but in a vacuum.  Road hauliers, for example, a number of whom I have met in the North, talk about the dearth of and difficulty in getting people into the business because of a lack of numbers.  In the farming community, there is a need for fruit pickers to be brought in as many people in Ireland will not take up such menial tasks.<\/p> <p>  It was interesting that Mr. Patterson referred to co-operation in the health services.  I was party to the re-signing of the Ballyconnell agreement, which brought in co-operation and working together between the health services in the North and South.  This was important in the development of our health services.  Mr. Patterson gave the example of cardiac services in the North.  I have had personal experience of the degree of trauma and the surgery involved in these services as well as the seamless movement across the Border of people involved in these services.  Equally, I have spent a long time considering Dundalk Institute of Technology.  Reference was made to the number of Chinese students and the difficulty in ensuring seamless progress in education.<\/p> <p>  The more people come to us with a southern perspective and put forward their cases, the more we can develop this all-island economy regardless of Brexit.  We must be positive and ensure both economies, North and South, are protected and enhanced.  I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations.

They were very informative.  Like my colleagues, I was amazed to discover that more than 50% of trade through UK ports involves the Republic.  It just shows the consequences of a lack of restrictions on free movement of goods and people.  I may be wrong about this but I think the British Government is in denial of the position in which we find ourselves.  Despite huge co-operation over the past 20 years, issues such as the levies on HGVs and tyres remain, and this is without the UK having left the EU.  One or two other such issues were mentioned.  I see hundreds of them, and we may not have the mechanisms to be able to solve them.  Long before I got involved in politics, I was once told by a barrister to fight but never to ask what the fight is about.  Certain people will fail to do anything about these issues, which is a huge difficulty.<\/p> <p>  My grandfather comes from Cullyhanna, and I think most of our family lived in Newry and the surrounding area, so I am very familiar with that general area.  I am familiar with it also because I was elected twice by the people of Roscommon-South Leitrim, particularly those in the Enniskillen end of the constituency.<\/p><p>Like my colleagues I consider this to be a huge issue but nobody seems to know what to do about it.<\/p><p> My colleagues also alluded to this point.  I welcome the fact that last Monday the European Union committee in the House of Lords issued a report on Brexit concerning UK-Irish relations and containing up to 80 pages.  It was very informative, measured and helpful.  I will highlight one or two points from it.  The report said the implications of Brexit for Ireland are more profound than for any other member state.  The report also said the House of Lords welcomed the Irish Government&rsquo;s strenuous efforts to ensure our EU colleagues are informed about the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the particular challenges of Brexit.  The report went on to say that the primary responsibility for drawing attention to and finding a solution to those issues lies with the UK Government.  The report further stated Ireland now faces challenges that are not of its own making and closer UK-Irish relations and stability in Northern Ireland must not be allowed to become collateral damage from Brexit.  That is, in effect, saying what I said, namely, that they see that Brexit could be used for, let us say, a lot of mischief making.<\/p><p> On page 85 the report said that despite ministerial recognition of the substantial implications Brexit could have for cross-Border economic activity on the island of Ireland, there is still significant uncertainty over how the UK plans to mitigate these effects and over the priority they will receive in withdrawal negotiations.  Finally, on page 86 the report states that it is extremely important for both Northern Ireland and the Republic that an agreement is reached which takes into account the all-Ireland nature of their economies.  It is in the interests of the Irish economies, North and South, that the current movement of people, goods and services within the island of Ireland is maintained.<\/p><p> We are hopeful, but the statements I have read are from the House of Lords and the report is not very encouraging.  Two issues arise.  The first is somewhat of a curve ball.  How do the witnesses honestly think we can deal with a hard Brexit?  Are there modern security systems that will work or is it just talk and a case of kicking the can down the road?  I do not know whether my second point has been mentioned because I was in and out of meetings.  The Narrow Water bridge project is an iconic one from North to South and it was shelved three years ago because of cost overruns.  The EU was involved.  I do not wish to cause mischief but a bridge is now being talked about in terms of a southern bypass in Newry.  Could the witnesses see the two projects going ahead?  We would all love to see that.  What are the views of witnesses in this regard?  I am sorry for throwing the curve ball to them but I would welcome their views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#R00600","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481811000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I will reply to a few questions.  I will take Deputy Breathnach's questions in addition to some of Senator Feighan's.  It is incumbent on the Irish Government to assert its position as a sovereign EU member state.  In response to Deputy Breathnach, connectivity requires Irish Government engagement.  It cannot happen without the sponsorship of the two states.  It is an intergovernmental challenge and both Governments have to assert a commitment to it.  The Irish Government's role, in particular with respect to Northern Ireland under the auspices of the Good Friday Agreement, as co-guarantor, is crucial.  As he correctly said, free movement depends on that connectivity being guaranteed.  The issue is how we handle all of this.  It requires special status for Northern Ireland.  The Good Friday Agreement is a special status framework.  There is precedent.  It is underpinned by &euro;2 billion of funding from the EU, so the special circumstances or status of Northern Ireland is widely recognised across the EU, but that must be asserted by the Irish Government because, unfortunately, it is not likely that the British Government will have the special circumstances of Northern Ireland at the head of its negotiating objectives, whereas the Irish Government must have.<\/p> <p>  The House of Lords report is comprehensive and it at least recognises those special circumstances, but the Irish Government, to use a phrase with great resonance in Northern Ireland, in particular for Northern Nationalists, cannot stand idly by on this subject.  This is as big a challenge as the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement, if not greater, because the currents then were moving in favour of greater all-Ireland collaboration.  The background circumstances were advantageous and helped the commitment being made by both Governments and externally by the Americans and the EU.  Those circumstances have changed and the intergovernmental challenge, as was rightly said, for UK-Irish relations is much greater now and is truly a challenge.  The scale of the situation needs to be understood in Dublin.  This is a Good Friday Agreement moment that we are in just now and that needs to be faced up to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor Patterson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481811000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I will go back for a moment to some of the ideas raised by Senator Feighan and also Deputy Brendan Smith in terms of solutions.  Deputy Breathnach also made a contribution in that regard.  If I could just look at the ports industry for a moment, the way I have to describe this is as a double whammy because, first, the ports throughout the UK and including Northern Ireland have a challenge we are dealing with on the maritime side with European Union countries.  Just over 50% of UK trade is with countries in the European Union, so something has to happen there.  Some people say it will be just the same as how we currently deal with trade coming from Canada.  That does operate fairly much on a modern basis, digitally, with very little paper involved, but the scale of the systems that are required to handle all of that in the future if there are tariffs will be colossal.<\/p> <p>  That is one challenge, but the bigger challenge for the main ports in the North - Derry, Warrenpoint and Belfast - relates to our landward trade, which is the trade we have once the goods are landed or prepared for export.  In Warrenpoint's case, 48% of our overall trade is to and from the Republic.  That breaks down in different markets.  If one takes the timber business, the majority of that, 70%, comes to the South.  That is because of the major construction market in the South versus the North.  When we had the recession back in 2009, we could see for a short time before that that the recession would hit because our timber volumes dramatically dropped.  When one takes steel, for example, most of the steel that was used for the construction of the new terminal in Dublin Airport came through Warrenpoint.  One might ask why that was.  I suspect it is to do with competition, price and costs.  This is all good for the economy both North and South.  In terms of agricultural goods such as grain, the importation is split both ways.  It is a double whammy and it is a serious challenge to business, not just the ports' business but all businesses because in this day and age we cannot put ourselves in silos.  We must think of marketing on both sides of the Border.<\/p><p> On the solutions, the Norway-Sweden solution seems to work quite well but Norway is not in the customs union and makes major contributions to the EU.  That model could work but there are still spot checks on that border.  It is not just as it is today on the Border between North and South here, which does not really exist.  One can drive to the North and not know the Border is there.  Switzerland has borders with France, Italy, Germany and Austria, which are all in the European Union, and it seems to be able to manage all right.  We should not be a naysayer for everything but it is not going to be as easy as it is there because it makes contributions also to the EU and it is a very wealthy country, so that works for Switzerland. The border between Canada and the United States of America has special arrangements for cross-border workers who do not need to stop at the border.  Their cars can go into a separate lane to go through, but there are checks on that border also.  These solutions being put forward are worth investigating but we need to have a tailored solution, as Dr. Patterson has said, with special arrangements for Northern Ireland because of the geography, relationships, politics and people on this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016121500002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Conway","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481811000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I want to echo those points.  It is really the issue around free movement of people and labour that could pose the biggest problem for development in the financial services and insurance industries.  There has been talk of employers and landlords perhaps having to verify the nationalities of people. That is an extra burden that may be placed on employers who may employ people coming across the Border to work for them and on landlords who have tenants staying in their properties.  I am not sure how viable that plan is.  It certainly would not be popular among business owners as it would be another check they feel they must carry out on behalf of the State.  It is about the availability of talent and the importance of the continuation of the free movement of talent.  We have a strong ambition to develop our trading in the Republic, but if there are too many barriers put up to that development, we would end up having to consider expanding to the market in Britain as an alternative.  We are already regulated there.<\/p> <p>  From talking to other businesses about this, one of the major concerns is around the uncertainty of it all and the length of time it is going to take for certainty around issues to become clear.  One chief executive officer of a large business in our area has told me that business will not wait.  Businesses will decide to invest in a more stable climate and that, potentially, would be a shame.  It is very important for these types of discussions to lead to action, one hopes.

I believe that my substantial range of regulatory, legal, financial, insurance and general business experience equips me for the challenge of acting as chairperson of IAASA.  The committee will see from my curriculum vitae that my regulatory experience extends over a period of 25 years both as Registrar of Friendly Societies for 18 and a half years and as a senior official in the Central Bank of Ireland for more than seven years.  These positions involved the regulation of credit unions, co-operatives, friendly societies, trade unions and building societies.  I was the last registrar of building societies.  Those positions also involved consumer protection enforcement as well as anti-money laundering, terrorist finance and financial sanctions enforcement.  I attended the international meetings of the financial action task force, FATF, in that regard on behalf of the Central Bank.  My past experience as a board member of various entities and, indeed, my current experience as a board member will be invaluable to me in chairing IAASA.<\/p> <p>  I refer in particular to my role as chairman of VHI Healthcare for a period of almost three years.  I served as chairman at a critical juncture in VHI Healthcare&rsquo;s history.  The company was obliged as a result of a judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union to apply to the Central Bank for authorisation to act as a fully regulated insurance company.  To do so, VHI Healthcare would have required a capital injection from the Government of approximately &euro;300 million as well as other significant changes, both structural and otherwise.  Under my chairmanship, a radical five-year strategic plan was developed and implemented, significant cost savings were achieved both internally and externally and successful reinsurance arrangements were entered into with the international reinsurance company, Berkshire Hathaway.<\/p><p>The net result of these and other measures was that VHI Healthcare managed to generate the necessary capital required, without Government assistance, and after a complex process, authorisation by the Central Bank was achieved.<\/p><p> I believe that the experience I have demonstrated, more details of which are to be found in my curriculum vitae, makes me a suitable and capable person to act as chairman of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA.  The functions of IAASA, as an independent body responsible for ensuring the quality of auditing of public interest entities, supervising the regulatory functions of the prescribed accountancy bodies, and examining and enforcing listed entities&rsquo; periodic financial reporting, are important in assuring the citizens of this country that auditing and accounting continue to be of the highest standards.<\/p><p> I have already assured the Minister, and I wish to assure the Chairman and her fellow committee members, that this position will receive committed and intense engagement on my part.

The advent of the Brexit situation may have implications for the auditing and accounting area in the context of Irish-British relations.

The accountancy firms, large and small, will say there is no conflict of interest, that there is a Chinese wall, and that it is regulated, but others take a different view in that if one is the auditor of an organisation, one should not be involved in supplying it other services, including consultancy and other related services.

Statistically, there are approximately 35,000 members of prescribed accountancy bodies in this country.  That is a great number of people working in the economy in that sense of the word, whether they are providing, as the Deputy said, business services or taxation services before we even get near the auditing side of things.  They are providing an invaluable service to their local communities, local small businesses and so on.  There are a vital cog in the economy.  Then there are 3,500 accountants who are much more tied into the auditing side of things and 1,500 firms that are registered as statutory auditors.<\/p> <p>  As a result of EU directives that have come into play recently from June 2016, and I will be very interested to see what progress has been made on this issue, IAASA now has an obligation and the responsibility of inspecting, investigating and directly overseeing the performance of the statutory auditors, the big firms.  Up to now it did not have that responsibility.  There are eight big firms that carry out the audits of entities that sell and trade in marketable securities on the open market.  I am referring to all the credit institutions, in effect, all the banks, and all the insurance undertakings, so we are talking about all the insurance companies.  IAASA, for the first time, is now the direct regulator of that issue.  Under those EU regulations, there are rules specifying that these firms can only audit, say, a bank for a limited period of time.  The maximum period they can audit a bank now is ten years.  They can possibly apply for an extension of another two years but that is it.  A bank, insurance company or one of those big firms trading in securities has to change its auditors, effectively, after ten years.  Up to now that rule did not exist.  There were no specific rules like that.<\/p> <p>  Another other issue is the rotation of the individual partners within the audit firms.<\/p><p>There are new rules about that as well which are much stricter.  Up to now, those obligations were not there.  I will be interested to see how that initial process has progressed.  In addition, I will be anxious to see that it is enforced quite strongly and quite rigidly as we go forward.<\/p><p> The bigger question on the smaller firms is a difficult one.  I agree there is a perception that there are conflicts of interest, left, right and centre.  I would be anxious, perhaps, in due course, subject to discussing this with the board and the staff in IAASA, to examine the possibility of widening that set of rules to come down the chain to the smaller firms.  There are practical issues involved.  In any rural town, there are only so many firms.  Local communities, understandably, would be anxious to still use those local firms rather than having to off, 50, 60 or 100 miles away, to another firm.

Depending on the committee&rsquo;s work programme, it might like to consider inviting them to a future meeting to discuss the impacts of Brexit on areas within their remit.  They would both be more than happy to do this.<\/p> <p>  The committee has already heard views on Brexit from a wide range of agencies and representative bodies over the last number of weeks and I thank it for its invitation to attend today to be involved in its deliberations.  Undoubtedly, our economic and cultural ties with the UK mean that its decision to leave the EU has significant and direct consequences for us.  The committee will be aware there is a whole-of-Government approach in place focusing on Brexit and my Department and its agencies are to the forefront of this effort. <\/p> <p>  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU will impact on all policy fields of my Department and agencies.  Over the past number of months, I have tasked my Department officials with making Brexit their number one priority.  In this context the Department has conducted a risk assessment of the potential impacts of Brexit across policy areas, which has fed into the national level assessment led by the Department of the Taoiseach.  We have since been working with agencies to mitigate risks and maximise opportunities.  To support a co-ordinated and coherent approach to Brexit across the Department and the enterprise agencies, I have also established a dedicated Brexit unit and a senior officials group with representatives from across all divisions of the Department.  I established a co-ordination group on Brexit to oversee the management of our response.<\/p> <p>  The co-ordination group, which I chair, consists of the CEOs of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and relevant enterprise, single market and trade officials from the Department.  I have also taken every opportunity to hear the view of companies operating at the coalface.  I have met with a wide range of representative organisations, including IBEC, ICTU, ISME, the Small Firms Association, the Irish Exporters Association, the American Chamber of Commerce, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the IFA.  The committee has heard from many of these groups.  I have also had discussions about the impacts of Brexit at the retail consultation forum, which I chair, and it is a regular item on the agenda of the implementation committees for the regional action plans for jobs.  I welcome the fact that many representative organisations have already published papers identifying challenges for their sectors.  These represent valuable inputs to Government as we develop policy responses.  In addition, my Department is planning a stakeholder engagement event to hear the views of all stakeholders on 30 January.  I extend an invitation to this event to all the members of the committee.  I have met with my EU counterparts in Brussels and my UK counterparts in London to convey the unique impact of Brexit on Ireland in advance of the commencement of the detailed exit negotiations.  <\/p> <p>  I will turn now to our enterprises.  Brexit presents a range of challenges but also opportunities for our companies.  Some sectors will be more impacted than others, based on their dependence on the UK market and their exposure to currency fluctuations.  Ireland is and will continue to be a trading nation.  We are fully committed to continuing our membership of the EU and in that context we will have access to the single market of 27 countries with 450 million customers.  The UK will also continue to be an important trading partner for Ireland.  I want to reassure companies that we will work to preserve Ireland&rsquo;s fullest market access to the UK in the framework of any future deal between the EU and the UK.  Ireland already enjoys trade benefits from some 50 EU preferential trade, partnership or association agreements.  We are working with the EU on the development of more ambitious and comprehensive bilateral trade agreements with third countries for the future.  We are refining our analysis of risks and opportunities, examining possible models for future UK relationships with the EU, from single market membership to full exit of the customs union.  This is challenging as it is still not known what relationship the UK will want to have.<\/p> <p>  My Department and the enterprise agencies are fully committed to supporting all our stakeholders in this period of uncertainty.  Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices are working with companies to make sure that they are better prepared to respond to the challenges that Brexit will bring, helping them to drive down costs, diversify into new markets and innovate in the way they do business.  Enterprise Ireland has been systematically engaging with its 1,500 clients, employing 100,000 full-time employees, that export to the UK.  Currency fluctuations are a particular issue of concern.  In order for me, as Minister, to respond to this I need to fully understand what businesses need.  To find out what they need, I have put in place a structured dialogue with companies of different sizes, across different sectors and regions.  When fully analysed, the outputs from this work will give me a clear indication of what SMEs need to help them address this challenge.  That will form the evidence base that I need in order to bring any proposals forward. <\/p> <p>  In our efforts to address the challenges posed by Brexit, we should not overlook whatever opportunities may emerge for Ireland.  One such opportunity is in attracting increased foreign direct investment.  I have directed IDA Ireland to explore the potential for winning more FDI as a result of Brexit and they are already working hard with this goal in mind.  This will not be easy.  The global FDI market is extremely competitive and we must fight hard to secure each and every new investment into Ireland.  Other countries will also be doing their best to win new mobile investments.  Fortunately, we can continue to rely on the selling points that make investing in Ireland attractive in the first place, including our continued membership of the EU, our talent, the ease of doing business and our tax offering.  I have also secured additional capital and current funding for my Department in 2017 to help deal with the challenges and opportunities posed by Brexit.  This will help the agencies to support more job creation and innovation.  <\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the implications of Brexit for relationships between North and South.  Our first priority is to ensure that the peace process is protected and safeguarded.  I have a particular focus on the trade implications for the Border region.<\/p><p>We will do our utmost to protect the interests of those companies and businesses that engage in cross-Border trade and InterTradeIreland will have an important role to play in that regard.  On foot of recent engagement with InterTradeIreland, we have agreed to fund a special study that it is commissioning from the ESRI on the cross-Border implications for SMEs, North and South.  I have also allocated some additional funding for 2017 to support more intensive engagement by InterTradeIreland with companies.  In the research and innovation area, members will be aware that the EU's Horizon 2020 programme is an important source of funding for these activities in Ireland.  Horizon 2020 also provides a mechanism for researchers and companies in Ireland to network and collaborate with the best researchers and leading companies across Europe.  While the UK is an important source of partners for Ireland in Horizon 2020 programmes, it is not the largest.  We are well diversified in terms of international collaboration through Horizon 2020 and beyond and are already working hard to strengthen our relationships with other European countries for future collaboration.<\/p><p> I am aware that competitiveness concerns related to Brexit also arise in relation to employment and social rights policy, including rights for workers and the national minimum wage.  The terms of any future EU-UK trading relationship will dictate with which provisions of EU law the UK will continue to comply.  This has relevance in a number of policy areas across my Department, including employment rights, company law, intellectual property, standards and state aids.  The issue of regulatory divergence will be one which we need to monitor closely.  I conclude by noting that work in my Department and agencies will continue in terms of assessing the possible implications and impacts of Brexit.  As I said at the beginning, Brexit will have a profound impact on all policy areas of my Department.  However, my Department and its agencies are working hard to ensure the most advantageous outcome for Ireland and for the EU for the benefit of Irish enterprises, employees and consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016121500002#F00300","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481810400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive report.

The reasons for that are well documented.  Ireland is remaining as a member of the EU and the eurozone and our capital has become internationally recognised as the home of an array of international financial service providers.  Ireland's proximity to the UK and the fact that we are an English-speaking common law jurisdiction are other factors that will make us attractive for new FDI.  While the Government will do its best to capitalise on whatever new opportunities emerge in financial services, we must remember that there is stiff global competition in the area.  We must be realistic about the scale of any new investment and we should not expect tens of thousands of jobs in the short term.  It is clear, however, that there are opportunities in this sector.  The IDA is already engaging with potential financial services investors and we hope that in time new investments will be secured for the country.  As with all other European member states, we have regulatory standards that we need all companies to comply with in this regard.  This is managed by our Central Bank.  I am confident that the Central Bank's workforce and contingency planning reflects the additional resources needed to deal with any increase in authorisation applications arising as a result of Brexit.

This centralised approach will ensure that there is a fully informed response to the Brexit challenge and a fully-prepared Irish position for the Brexit negotiations ahead whereby Ireland will seek to ensure the best possible outcomes.

I welcome her comment that the peace process is the first priority.  We all agree that when the referendum took place in England, it was not really discussed.  English people were not aware of the implications it would have for themselves and for this State and as such it is very welcome that in this regard it the first priority of the Government.<\/p> <p>  The Minister might be aware that a document was produced on Monday from the House of Lords commission on Brexit.  I do not know if the Minister has read it yet, but I encourage her to do so.  It is probably one of the best documents on Brexit to have been released so far.  Some of the comments I want to make relate to some of the suggestions in it.  Similar topics have been raised here already.  In a line that jumps out at me and which should be red-flagged by everyone, it warns that Ireland's unique vulnerability is not being taken seriously enough in Brussels or in London.  That is a report from the House of Lords dealing with the impact of Brexit on Ireland alone.  Last year and before the referendum was triggered in the UK, the Irish Government warned of potential negative consequences for the country's economy and of the still-fragile place in which the peace process remained.  We need to ensure that the peace process is protected.  The House of Lords report also warned that the North must not become collateral damage as part of the Brexit process and expressed concern the implications, of which are all well aware, for the Irish economy.  The report noted that Brexit will impact on all aspects of life and in particular on the substantial cross-Border trade in meat and dairy products.<\/p><p> The report also stated that Northern Ireland's economy was already characterised by the highest levels of deprivation, unemployment and poverty, a fact that we are all well aware of.  It said that while the Republic might be well placed to respond to the economic challenges that Brexit will represent the North will not be in a similar position.  One of the conclusions reached in the report reads: \"The only way to retain the current open border in its entirety would be either for the UK to remain in the customs union, or for EU partners to agree to a bilateral UK-Irish agreement on trade and customs\".  Having sail all of that I would like to know the following.  What are we going to do to ensure that the North's special status is maintained?  Let us remember that 56% of the people in the North voted to remain.  We do not want them taken out of the European Union against their wishes.  A retention of the North's status must be delivered in the upcoming negotiations between the Irish Government and whoever conducts the negotiations.   <\/p><p> I wish to talk about infrastructure.  Last Monday the House of Lords EU committee report was published.  On page 12 it reads: \"Dublin&rsquo;s limited infrastructure and shortage of housing might deter financial firms from relocating there\".  I have raised the issue of infrastructure on a number of occasions during D&aacute;il Question Time.  Infrastructure is of critical importance in Dublin and across the country.  For example, data provided by the Department of Finance found that the food and beverage sector and the manufacturing sector are the most at risk from Brexit.  As has been said here before, these sectors primarily consist of small Irish-owned SMEs that are significant regional employers but with comparatively low profit levels.  The report continued:  \"The Irish Department of Finance has also noted that profit margins make it difficult for Irish SMEs to diversify away from the UK market, given the lower fixed costs associated with exporting to the UK ... due to a shared language, legal system and culture\".  Does the Minister accept that infrastructure is central in her efforts to minimise the impact of Brexit?  If so, what does she intend to do about infrastructure in this country?<\/p><p> My next question is on trade with the EU.  The report states: \"A paper by Durham and Newcastle Universities also suggests that Brexit is likely to rebalance Ireland&rsquo;s trade relationships away from the UK and towards the remainder of the EU\".  Does the Minister have a contingency plan in the event that Brexit becomes a reality?  Does she agree with the suggestion made in the report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016121500002#G01000","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481810400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned the report published by the House of Lords.

It will be game on when Article 50 is triggered.  It is important that the Irish State's relationship with the UK is understood.  I have met Commissioners Biekowska and Malmstr&ouml;m.

On that occasion he noted that we are in uncharted territory and explained his personal understanding of border issues on the island of Ireland.  He also underlined his commitment to preserving the success of the Good Friday Agreement.  I believe the European Commission understands our position.  It is our job to ensure the Commission understands our unique relationship and that the status of Northern Ireland is protected in the negotiations.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also inquired about infrastructure.  The Commission did mention infrastructure.  Ireland's selling points are that we speak English and we have a good track record, skills base and education system.  Some deficits have been highlighted and one of them is housing.  As the Deputy will know, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is bringing a housing plan through the Houses and has called on funding to be made available in the budget.  We must work our way through this matter.  During the recession there was no investment in housing and now we must tackle the housing deficit.    <\/p> <p>  I became Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation eight months ago.  I recall that during the first few weeks of taking up office, which was when the UK referendum took place, I continually heard about a shortage of office space.  More office space has come on the market and the problem is righting itself.  We should promote the positive things, particularly when selling Ireland abroad.  Broadband is an infrastructural deficit, especially in rural and regional Ireland.  The Minister for Communications, Climate and Environment, Deputy Naughten, is working on the broadband service.  I am sorry that we did not have adequate infrastructure in place when Ireland enjoyed better times but we are catching up.  The development of ports and airports is an issue for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I know that such development is on his agenda.<\/p> <p>  As a small open country we sell quite a lot to the UK every week.  Recently Enterprise Ireland reported that ten years ago the Republic was 45% dependent on exports to the UK but that figure has now been reduced to 37%.  We rely on external demand.  Direct trade between Ireland and the UK is worth &euro;1.2 billion and sustains 100,000 jobs here and almost the same amount of jobs in the UK.  Exports to the UK represents 17% of our overall exports.  We export 16.9% to the UK, over 7% to Belgium and Germany and 4.8% to France.  The UK is a substantial market for our exports but we are diversifying.  Enterprise Ireland is working on diversification and it is important that we increase our efforts.  <\/p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland has held meetings with the 1,500 members of its client base that export into the UK.  Enterprise Ireland has identified the companies that may be under pressure and one aspect of that conversation has been diversification.  We will seek to preserve the fullest market access to the UK in the framework of a future trade agreement between the EU and the UK.  Access by the UK to the Single Market must be based on acceptance of the four freedoms of goods, service, capital and people.  That is the stated position of the other 27 EU countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016121500002#H00400","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1481810400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Neville wish to ask a supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016121500002#H00500","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1481810400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Yes.

Limerick is a very good example of this.  UL, LIT and Mary Immaculate College will respond in this regard.

If any representatives of the educational institutes are listening to the proceedings of this meeting, I say &quot;well done&quot; to them.  We need them.

I acknowledge the very good work that the IDA has done in Limerick in particular in recent months.  It is important to acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  I want to follow up the point on the expected job losses.  The Minister said there was no certainty and I accept that as well.  I think there was a common theme across all of the people who presented that they were expecting difficulties in quarters 1 and 2.  I ask in particular about the suggestion made by my colleague, Ms Patricia King, from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to set up an early warning system, comprising trade unions, employers, State agencies.  It strikes me as a very good idea and I wonder if it is one the Minister is willing to pursue at this point in time, given that quarters 1 and 2 are upon us?  The ICTU made another suggestion in respect of a strategic investment bank to help assist with new jobs and new enterprises and I would like to hear the Minister's view on that.<\/p> <p>  As we are grouping questions, I might add a number of simple ones that relate to the resources of Enterprise Ireland.  Since 2010, Enterprise Ireland will still be down 130 jobs from its peak in 2010, even with the 39 additional jobs that have been announced.  That is a concern because as we all agree Enterprise Ireland will be a key player in the biggest challenge facing us for many decades.  I know from personal contacts at a senior level in Enterprise Ireland that there is real concern in respect of knowledge and skills because of the exit programme in the past number of years and that is impacting on staff morale.  The Minister has acknowledged in her opening statement that there is a huge job of work for Enterprise Ireland and yet the organisation is down by 140 posts, which is a significant number.  Has the funding cap on InterTradeIreland been lifted?  InterTradeIreland will be a key player and I would like to hear the Minister's view on that<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016121500002#K01100","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1481810400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>The funding cap on InterTradeIreland has been lifted very recently.

In 2010, there were more employees than the current 659 employees.  Enterprise Ireland has brought about a strong downsizing and reorganisation in recent years to support clients in meeting the challenges of new sectors, markets, technologies and ways of doing business.  It reorganised itself around sectoral businesses.  There are experts in those sectoral businesses throughout the country.  For example, if a person in Ireland wanted to expand a medtech company, the medtech experts are available.  In the past, it was sometimes more geographically led.  As a result of the challenges associated with reducing staff levels to meet Government controls, Enterprise Ireland underwent a voluntary leaving programme in early 2015.  This saw 51 staff members voluntarily exit the organisation.  Enterprise Ireland was then permitted to recruit more than 20 new staff to bring much-needed new skills into the organisation.  Those numbers do not include the 39 new sanctioned posts in Ireland and overseas that are to be filled as soon as possible to respond to the challenges of Brexit.  Overall, Enterprise Ireland is well positioned to assist its client base and to undertake existing activities while also reacting to needs that arise as a result of a fast-changing business world, the challenges in responding to Brexit and other global economic uncertainties.<\/p><p> We are working with the Strategic Investment Bank to bring new products for SMEs to the market.

I welcome the Minister and thank her for her presentation.  I will echo a few of the concerns that have been raised, particularly those around our collective responsibility to project the positive image of this country.  That is not to say that we ignore the problems.  This committee has been very good at highlighting and addressing the problems.  The Minister has been very good at it as well but the overriding message has to be that we have the talent, the people and a young, well educated population that is full of energy and ambition and ready, willing and waiting to welcome new industries, whatever they might be.  It is clear that there has to be opportunity as well as challenge.  For those companies which have rightly been on a watch list in terms of possibly feeling they must have a foothold in the sterling area if they are to continue their businesses, we need to be taking the opportunity to invite new industries here.  I know the Minister has been strong on this when on trade missions.  I was struck by a conversation that I had with the Indian ambassador some years back.  I do not know if he is still <i>in situ<\/i>.  He may have been replaced by a successor.  We have approximately 1,000 Indian people learning English in this country, but there are 100,000 in the UK.  This presents a huge opportunity.<\/p><p>During our meeting on Brexit in Malahide, there was a presentation by Professor Brian MacCraith from Dublin City University.  He spoke of the possibilities for education in the country in terms of bringing jobs and students here and it being a hub of excellence.  Ireland is now very much seen as a friendly, properly regulated place and a safe place to send one's children and to come to do business.  As the Minister has pointed out, the referendum on marriage equality projected a powerful image of the country as a welcoming country.  That is important because, as the Minister said, there are gaps in areas and we need to bring in outside expertise for those companies that want to set up here so that they can be as successful as they wish.  Is there a group made up of officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Education and Skills that is examining all these possibilities and how we can enhance job opportunities in our education sector, be it secondary, language or tertiary education?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016121500002#L00300","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1481810400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>We work closely with the Department of Education and Skills.

I also thank the Chairman for introducing my colleagues.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee will know, pensions policy is a large and complex area and it will not be possible to treat all the relevant matters in an opening statement.  The areas covered under pensions policy in the Department include the State pension contributory, the State pension non-contributory, both the contributory and non-contributory widow's pension, and a range of secondary benefits, including fuel allowance, the household benefits package and free travel.  We also cover private and occupational pensions, European law relating to pensions, such as the institutions for occupational retirement provision, IORP, directive, and pensions reform such as the development of a new universal retirement savings scheme.<\/p> <p>  State pensions cost approximately &euro;7 billion each year and this figure is rising rather rapidly.  There are three main factors driving this: greater longevity; increased PRSI coverage in the population; and increases in pension rates paid.  The biggest factor, happily, both in Ireland and across the world, is greater longevity.  In the 2006 census, the number of people aged 65 or over was nearly 468,000.  By the time of the 2011 census, this had risen to over 535,000 - an increase of about 14.5% in only five years.  This is consistent with the longer-term trends that have emerged.  In effect, there is an increase in the number of people turning pension age each year, but the numbers who die each year is, thankfully, reducing as a result of a range  of factors.  This places a higher burden upon those who are still of working age.  The ratio between those of working age and pensioners was over five to one at the time of the most recent census.  Even with the increases planned for in pension age, this is projected to fall to about half that by 2050 and will then hopefully stabilise thereafter.<\/p> <p>  Expansion of PRSI coverage has increased the number of pensioners who now qualify for a full pension.  Most notable of these was the creation of class S for the self-employed in 1988.  This brought most self-employed people into the system, including farmers.  PRSI-related benefits are good value for workers.  This is especially the case for the self-employed who gain access to a pension that is worth approximately &euro;300,000, or closer to &euro;500,000 if they claim an increase for a qualified adult on it, based on deductions of just 4% each week.  Unlike employees, this is not supplemented by a significant additional payment by their employers, as they have none.<\/p> <p>  The third factor involves increases.  Over the decades, the rate of the State pensions has steadily increased, from what was a very low base at the time of its introduction, to a much higher level now.  Therefore, today's workers and their employers are funding a pension that is about a third higher than the one originally introduced, relative to their ability to fund it.  The current rate is approximately one third of gross average weekly earnings - at &euro;233.30 - and this is set to rise by &euro;5 in March 2017.<\/p> <p>  Increases in pensions have had a positive impact upon pensioner poverty rates.<\/p><p>Between 2004 and 2014, the at risk of poverty rate for those over 65 years of age had more than halved to 10.3% and the consistent poverty rate for that group had almost halved to 2.1%.  This compares very favourably with the general population, where the risk of poverty rate is 16.3% and the consistent poverty rate is at 8%, or nearly four times the pensioner rate. <\/p><p> The State pension age has gone through a number of revisions, up and down, over the years.  When the old age contributory pension was introduced in Ireland in 1961 for 70 year olds, life expectancy at birth was 68 years for men and 72 years for women.  During the 1970s, the age for both old age pensions was gradually reduced from 70 to 66.  As pointed out earlier, the earlier trends in life expectancy have continued, and this is not just the case in Ireland.  All countries across the world are, at the very least, planning to increase state pension age and in most cases they have already started this process.  In Ireland, it commenced with the abolition of the State pension transition from January 2014.  The same Act which made this change also increased the future State pension age to 67 years from January 2021 and to 68 years from January 2028.<\/p><p> The State pension transition costs approximately &euro;140 million each year, but it was always understood that the net saving would be lower as significant numbers of people would claim alternative working age payments instead, such as jobseeker's benefit and invalidity pensions.  Currently, the figures indicate that the annual saving is approximately &euro;80 million.  In time, if more people have the opportunity to work longer, this saving will increase.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recently chaired an interdepartmental group on this matter and I understand that colleagues in other Departments are looking at the means for encouraging this to a greater extent.  While our Department participated fully with the work of this group, the policy areas lie outside our remit.<\/p><p> Another reform which was introduced at that time was the restructuring of the yearly average bands of the State pension contributory, SPC.  These have been restructured a number of times over the years.  When savings were required in 2011, the Government decided that a restructuring of the bands would be preferable to a general decrease in rates, which would hit all pensioners including those of limited means.  Under the new bands, which apply to claims from September 2012, people with lower yearly averages still attract a better return on their PRSI than others.  A yearly average of 20 contributions now will attract a contributory pension of 85%.  However, in many cases, the person will instead claim a non-contributory pension at a higher rate.  This is up to 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension, and over 70% are paid at the full rate, after the means test.  Those who are not, and are on reduced rate SPC of 85% or less, will generally have their own income, such as a private pension or rental income on a property, over and above that payment.  If there is very significant household income, it may instead be more advantageous to claim an increase for a qualified adult, at a rate of 90%, as this is based on the means of the qualified adult and income and capital in their spouse&rsquo;s name are not considered in that means test.<\/p><p> People often ask how much it would cost to revert to the structure which was in place prior to 2012.  This is difficult to calculate with precision, but we estimate that it would be a minimum of &euro;50 million in 2017 and would rise at a rate of about &euro;10 million per year.  In reality, it is likely to be considerably higher when all the calculations are worked out properly.  This would not benefit the less well-off pensioners, who are either on a non-contributory pension or a full rate contributory pension if they have the contributions, so any budget which introduced such a change would have to find the resources from somewhere.  If it came from money earmarked for pension increases, this would be to the detriment of the poorest pensioners.<\/p><p> Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced in the State, the yearly average contributions test has been used to calculate the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48 to 52 contributions and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of ten to 14 contributions per year.  The Department is actively working on the development of a total contributions approach, TCA, to pension qualification which would replace the yearly average contributions test for State pension contributory.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  An important factor in the final design of the scheme will be the treatment of homemaking and caring periods.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative and technical elements in its implementation.  There will be further consultations on this, including with this committee.<\/p><p> I will now turn to occupational and personal pensions.  The first matter is defined benefit, DB, schemes.  The committee is well aware that the funding challenges facing DB schemes are well aired and are reflected in the steady decline in the number of DB schemes over recent years.  In 1997, there were over 2,200 funded DB schemes.  Latest figures indicate that there are 682 schemes.  Membership of DB schemes in Ireland totals approximately 125,000 active, 435,000 deferred and 100,000 pensioner members.  The total assets of these schemes were just over &euro;60 billion with liabilities of over &euro;58 billion.<\/p><p> DB schemes have been under increased strain, particularly since the economic collapse of 2008.  While our increasing life expectancy is welcome, the fundamental problem facing DB schemes is that the promise they provide has become significantly more expensive to maintain because of increasing life expectancy, lower than expected investment returns and the very significantly increased cost of purchasing pension annuities in a low interest rate environment.  According to the latest available returns made to the Pensions Authority, approximately 70% of DB schemes are meeting the regulator funding standard, which is a considerable improvement over recent years.  Of the schemes that do not meet the funding standard, almost all have funding proposals in place to address funding shortfalls.  Generally, where schemes have encountered funding difficulties, the process has been managed through dialogue between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps to be taken.  To this end, while under Irish law responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring DB schemes are properly funded and managed to meet the pensions promise, the Minister has expressed his view that where difficult situations arise employers, unions and trustees should continue to make strenuous efforts to protect the viability of their schemes.<\/p><p> Turning to defined contribution, DC, schemes and personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, in Ireland and throughout the world pension provision is gradually migrating from the DB to the DC model.  Year-on-year data indicate a continual increase in the number of occupational DC schemes.  At the end of 2015, there were 67,000 active DC schemes with 280,000 members, an increase of over 18,000 thousand members compared to 2014.  The total assets under management for such schemes is estimated to be over &euro;40 billion.  The number of PRSAs, which are individual contract based DC products, increased to almost 240,000 at the end of 2015, up from 227,000 in 2014.  The total assets held in PRSAs increased to over &euro;5 billion in 2015.  However, notwithstanding these increases, figures indicate that only 47% of workers aged between 20 and 69 years have a supplementary pension.  This figure falls to approximately 35% if the private sector is considered in isolation.  This relatively low coverage is of significant concern for the Government as it may mean an unwanted reduction in living standards for large numbers of retirees.<\/p><p> To respond to this problem, consideration is being given to the introduction of a new, universal, supplementary workplace retirement saving system.  This employment based DC system would be intended to progressively achieve universal coverage.  A high level interdepartmental universal retirement savings group, URSG, which included international pension reform experts, was established to develop a roadmap for consideration by the Government.  The work of this group concentrated on whether such a system should be a mandatory or an opt-out model and the potential design characteristics of such a system.<\/p><p>The development of a universal system would require a multi-annual programme of work and the Minister has confirmed this area of work as a departmental priority.  Data from the Pensions Authority show that with a total of over 160,000 occupational pension schemes, including very many small and single member schemes, Ireland has significantly more schemes than any other European country.  As a result, many schemes are not benefiting from the competitive charging structures that would accrue through economies of scale.  Given this proliferation of schemes, the Pensions Authority has also raised concerns regarding the potential for inconsistent scheme governance standards and the regulatory capacity to supervise this number of schemes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I must interrupt Mr. Duggan for a moment if he does not mind.

It is fine.  I will carry on from where I left off.  I am right at the end of the written submission.  I was talking about the reform and simplification of occupational pensions.  The important point is that in July 2016 the Pensions Authority launched an open consultation process on a range of pension reform proposals, many of which are consistent with our transposition obligations under the new EU pensions directive, IORPS II.  It is anticipated that the authority will issue a report and recommendations for the Minister&rsquo;s consideration in early 2017.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, I note that, as with other sectors of the economy, the last number of years have proven challenging for pension provision.

As Mr. Duggan said, after 6.5 million have been registered in the UK of a total target of about 11 million, it represents around 90% with a 10% opt-out.  The initial indicators are that the opt-out rates are highest among the over-50s.  The opt-out rates are not higher for lower-income earners compared to others.  Typically, the over-50s would opt out at a level of somewhere around two to one, based on the fact that they are closer to retirement and do not see the same demands or opportunities from the system.  On initial evidence, therefore, the opt-out rates are highest among the over-50s.  That goes to show the crucial design element of any universal retirement savings system.  We have looked at such systems all over the world, including talking to the UK authorities and the OECD.  What has been highlighted is the need for consensus on how the system is designed.  One must get the fundamental design aspects of the system right if it is to be an opt-out system.  No decision has been made on that.<\/p> <p>  It ties in with the Senator's question about tax relief.  As regards a universal system, tax relief is a matter for the Department of Finance, not our Department.  Based on some of the work we have done, in a mandatory system tax relief does not necessarily come into it if the State decided it does not want it to.  That is because if somebody has to be in the scheme, one does not have to give a financial incentive.  If one decides on an enrolment, opt-out system the financial incentives become critical.  As part of the consultation process on universal retirement savings, the discussions included a number of views.  Among some it was felt that the tax relief is skewed towards higher earners.  According to the feedback we got from particular interest groups, it was stated that that was not surprising because higher earners typically pay a much higher level of income tax.  It is therefore not surprising that they would get a higher level of relief.  A similar constituency also said that we pay higher PRSI which is redistributed through the first pillar State pension.  They also said that one needs to look at it not just on what relief is obtained in going in because tax relief on pensions works on an exempt tax situation - that is, tax on the outside, coming out.  So one needs to look at it in its totality.  Having said that, the target for a universal retirement savings system where we would be enrolling around 500,000 middle and low-income earners, may not be entirely consistent with the tax relief system as it is.  <\/p> <p>  Other states that have introduced automatic enrolment, examined tax rebates, matching contributions rather than tax relief, and other forms of financial incentive to ensure that the system's policy objective matches the system of financial incentivisation.  Therefore there is a lot more work to do on that in order to understand what the outcomes of any changes would be.  Without capacity, one cannot make any changes, but incentivisation is a crucial aspect of any universal system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Nicholson"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins will deal with the gender issue, but I have a final question.

In many respects, pensions constitute an important and complex issue.  It has been described as a ticking time-bomb.  In his opening statement, Mr. Duggan alluded to the three major factors driving some of the difficulties: greater longevity, increased PSRI coverage and the increase in pension rates that are paid.<\/p> <p>  I wish to focus on a few specific areas including the increasing pension age and longevity.  We know that the pension age increase from 65 to 66 has created difficulties, but further increases are expected - rising to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  We are going faster and further than any of our European counterparts in this regard, but the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has said we should look at halting that process.  I would certainly agree with the ICTU on that.<\/p> <p>  Has the question of slowing down that process been costed?  Perhaps the officials could answer that question.  If the extension to age 67 were to be pushed out by an additional five years, what costs would that incur?  Can we examine the possibility of moving more into line with our European counterparts, instead of pushing way ahead of them, because the impact on people will be immense?<\/p> <p>  Last week, I launched a Bill to abolish the mandatory retirement age.  That had been attempted previously by the former Deputy Anne Ferris, but the measure fell with the dissolution of the Thirty-first D&aacute;il.  I have reintroduced that Bill and I look forward to debating it.<\/p><p>What are the officials' views on the mandatory retirement age and the kinds of impacts its abolition may have on overall pensions?  What are their views on giving people the option, if they so wish and are able to do so, to work a little longer, rather than the current position whereby their contracts may stipulate that they must retire at 65?  I ask the witnesses to address this first.  There are a few other points I wish-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#G00600","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":255,"content":"<p>The Deputy should continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#H00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Okay.  I refer to PRSI contributions, the changes that have been made and the extension of some of the contributions and what people can receive for them.  The Minister said when he appeared before the committee that he had engaged and started discussions with opticians, dentists, etc.  I am not sure whether the witnesses are aware of the progress of those discussions or whether any progress has been made in extending the scheme and the coverage for people.  Could the witnesses give an update on this?<\/p><p>It was stated that a survey was conducted among self-employed people to discover what benefits they might like to see for the PRSI they pay.  At what stage is this at?  Has there been much of an uptake in the consultation process?  Could the witnesses give an indication of the type of feedback that has been received?<\/p><p>Regarding the State pension increase of &euro;5 a week, I understand some of the points the witnesses have made about lifting people out of constant poverty and so on.  Has the Department ever considered or costed a measure to inflation-proof pension contributions?  I would like to see this happen.  My party has advocated and costed it and provided for it in our alternative budgets.  It should be done.  Has the Department given it any consideration as opposed to the current position whereby some years pensioners might get an increase whereas other years they might not?  The index-linking of pension contributions would be a very useful measure.<\/p><p>I have just touched on poverty rates.  Mr. Duggan said consistent poverty has been halved to 2.1%, but this is not true for all pensioners.  I mentioned 65-year-olds who are forced to retire.  We are aware of the measures that have been introduced in this regard and the changes made to the eligibility of retirees to obtain their State pensions.  They are not able to do so until they reach 66, before which they are placed onto a jobseeker's payment, which is &euro;45 less than the full State pension.  Therefore, while the witnesses talk about the reduction in poverty rates, 65-year-olds forced onto jobseeker's benefit are below the poverty level in many cases, so I question the facts and figures as the witnesses have presented them.  They are not consistent across the board.  One of the measures brought in to tackle this was the transitional State pension, the abolition of which in 2014 has had a huge impact on many people across the board.  More than 5,000 65-year-olds are now forced onto a jobseeker's payment, higher than any other age category in the State.  Do the witnesses acknowledge the impact the abolition of the transitional State pension has had, the difficulties it has put people under and the fact that they must retire at 65?  In many cases these people have worked 40, in some cases 50, years, paying their PRSI and paying into the State pension, yet they are not able to obtain it once they reach retirement age.  Do the witnesses acknowledge that this has caused huge difficulties for people reaching at that age?<\/p><p>The rate bands have caused huge difficulties across the board, particularly regarding gender.  When the pension reforms were introduced in 2012, the gender gap was estimated at 37%.  It was a huge gap.  These reforms have compounded the problems and forced more and more people, particularly women, into poverty in their retirement age.  An internal survey of 5,700 claimants conducted in advance of the cuts introduced in 2012 demonstrated that annual cuts in the band categories in which women are in the majority would exceed &euro;1,100, whereas the cuts in the predominantly male band categories would be lesser.  In 2014, the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>carried out an investigation involving various Department memos and briefing notes.  One of the most glaring findings of the investigation showed that in three of the categories in which women accounted for over 60%, the cuts imposed ranged from &euro;1,196 to &euro;1,497.  In two other categories in which women only accounted for between 16% and 36%, the cuts ranged from &euro;977 down to zero.  It is therefore clear to see the changes in the bands have impacted women more, and we know the reason for this: they have been out of the workforce looking after and rearing their children or loved ones.  This has had a huge impact.  Prior to these changes, in 2012, the gender gap was estimated at 37%.  Has an analysis been carried out to discover the current extent of the gender gap?  I imagine-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#H00300","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":257,"content":"<p>It is still 37%.

This is a serious problem which needs to be tackled.<\/p> <p>  There has been a lot of media focus on defined benefit schemes over the past number weeks, and rightly so.  There have been some very high-profile cases.  I will not get into all of them now but I know the Minister has in recent days been talking about this.  It has been highlighted time and again that legislation is needed to improve the system here but it has not been brought forward.  I ask the officials whether they have considered best practice adopted in other countries regarding defined benefit pensions.  Are they aware of the system in place in the UK, for example, where a pension protection fund is in place?  This pays some compensation to scheme members if employers become insolvent and there are not enough funds in the scheme for benefits to be paid.  The scheme therefore has protections in place.  The UK model seems to work very well.  We need a pension protection fund here.  Has the Department given this any consideration whatsoever?<\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to try to respond to the matters I have raised.

I wish to touch on a few other points.  I will begin by picking up on some of the points Senator Humphreys raised.  I will begin with the universal supplementary retirement saving scheme and then move on to the first-tier pension.  The current marginal rate tax relief system will be important.<\/p><p>While it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, clearly it is a central focus when considering pension planning.  There can be a little fudging, not from the witnesses, around the idea that it gets taxed on the way out.  Of course, an income that is taxed on the way out to a pension income, which is only part of an income, will often be taxed at a lesser rate or less of it will be taxed at a higher rate, so there is a very tangible saving.  It is not the same as if that amount had been taxed as income.  There is a reduction in the revenue gathered by the State in that regard.  It is important we do not equate that or blur that line.<\/p><p> Regarding higher earners, they are earning higher incomes and paying higher taxation because we have a progressive taxation system.  It is a point of pride for the country.  It is one of the fundamental defences we have had when the OECD and others have pointed out that Ireland has one of the highest rates of income inequality.  One of the highest rates of income inequality means that we have this progressive taxation system which has a redistributive role.  There is something of an anomaly in the marginal rate tax relief.  It was highlighted by the troika and it was one of the matters in the memorandum of understanding that were to be acted upon.  A cap was put in place but that did not deal with the fundamental inequity issue that exists.  For a long time it has been at odds with the stated aim of our pension policy, which is to provide the greatest protection possible to lower and middle income earners.  With regard to the information Senator Humphreys requested, it would be useful if the witnesses were able to access that information and work with the Revenue Commissioners on it.  It would be very useful for us.  If we have a universal supplementary retirement savings scheme it would be a considerable investment and a new step for the State, and it is hard to see how that would be compatible with the considerable investment there is at present in the marginal rate tax relief.<\/p><p> That leads to another point we might discuss in terms of the type of models, and I am aware that the Department is still examining this.  I recall engaging with the process regarding the universal supplementary retirement savings scheme.  Mr. Nicholson briefly touched on the models that might be used.  For example, it might involve tax rebate or schemes that might be closer to the special saving incentive account, SSIA, model, where one is considering a pension promotion tool or a State subsidised mandated scheme.  It is a second tier mandatory earnings related social insurance scheme of some kind versus a tax subsidised private pension scheme.  The model is important because of the issue of control.<\/p><p> Another issue that concerns me is that even some of the advocates of these schemes have acknowledged that they tend to disadvantage women.  Although voluntary pension schemes might not have such a measure, it would be important that a system that would be State subsidised to a great extent would find a way to have a compensatory mechanism to address concerns regarding the redistributive role and the recognition of care.  We will return to that question further, but how do we include the recognition of care, for example, within the pension system?  It is not really dealt with here but we have not seen what the proposals might be if a new second tier was introduced in terms of how the State can ensure there is subsidisation protection for particular vulnerable categories and, indeed, potential recognition for other forms of contribution.  There is, effectively, a subsidisation in the improvements we have seen for the self-employed, because the contribution self-employed people are making through PRSI at present is not at the same level as that of people in PAYE where there is an employer and personal contribution.  The level is something to be examined as well.<\/p><p> That leads to the question of voluntary pension contributions.  I welcome that the Department has taken on board one of my proposals relating to voluntary pension contributions.  I am probably going back to the first tier, so I apologise for that.  I have too many things to say.  I will put that aside, because it relates to the first tier, and finish my points on the second tier and on private pensions.  There are huge issues of trust and risk with private pensions.  If we are considering a universal supplementary model, how do we ensure it is not simply an individualised risk and that we are not simply subsidising people to take a chance in the system, but that we are giving them some sense of a guarantee of an increased income?  That is what people are generally seeking.  If people want to gamble they can go to the stock market, but most people want the security of knowing they will have an income on which they can plan.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on how we can build that into a system in which there are private and public actors?  In that regard as well, there is the issue of the governance and the chain of accountability in the universal supplementary retirement savings scheme.  How can we enforce that governance and ensure there is a chain of accountability, so that it is not simply an input from the State but that there is an accountability level for the State in it?<\/p><p> On defined benefit schemes, and Deputy Brady mentioned the UK pension fund, the witnesses will be aware that I also proposed, unfortunately unsuccessfully, that we consider some of the other measures the UK has implemented to ensure that trust is maintained and delivered with regard to pensions.  The cost of it has been mentioned, but the cost is the cost.  Many things have a cost.  However, there is the question of a solvent company that decides that a cost which it has committed to is not a priority for it.  Potentially, there is a power imbalance there and there is a question of whether it is committed to the cost.  We are aware of the Independent New &amp;amp; Media case and I will not go into the detail of it, but in that case many employees were required to pay into the pension system.  People have shown me the letters where they were required to do that.  It has been a condition of their employment that they pay into a defined benefit scheme.  Now we are looking at a situation in which that trust is effectively being diluted.  There will be a board meeting on that today.<\/p><p> The witness mentioned the work of trustees and the importance of engagement with them.  We must think about how the State can have a fall back when the Pensions Authority is not listened to, an agreement made by the authority is flouted or when trustees are bypassed.  I am aware that actions are being taken, but we might have to look to a more systematic approach in that regard.  It never should be open to one party in an agreement to renegotiate unilaterally.  In the Independent News &amp;amp; Media case, the 2013 agreement was reached with the support of the Pensions Authority.  It was to be continued, planned and scheduled.  It was very manageable from a company's perspective with scheduled investment over a ten year period into a defined benefit scheme.  What we are seeing now is a company that appears to be deciding that it will now invest, if it invests at all, in a defined contribution scheme.  I accept that many defined benefit schemes are winding up and I would not have raised it but it was in the witness's presentation.  We must ensure that it is not a unilateral decision to move from defined benefit to defined contribution.  It must always be negotiated and agreed. <\/p><p> I will finish with the second tier and third tier, but a core question is the gender pension gap.  There is a gender pension gap.  In addition, there is an equality and gender proofing obligation.  With regard to the gender pension gap, I am interested in how care will be addressed in the supplementary scheme.  However, I believe the core problem is the question of trust.  Again, it is trust and risk and how we rebuild trust.  I would like people to engage in a new pension system, but trust must be repaired.  I have the same figures as Deputy Brady but I will not list them again because he has done so.  The marriage bar, which was ended by Europe, has an ongoing impact on many women in Ireland through their reduced pension every week.<\/p><p>There are some opinions - I do not know if the Department has had this discussion internally - that the European equal treatment directives have not been adequately fulfilled by simply ending the marriage bar because the legacy impact of the marriage bar has continued and has not been adequately addressed.  For example, the homemaker's disregard system only goes back to 1994.  It does not extend back to 1973 so even that system cannot be said to be an adequate response to address the impact of the marriage bar.  That is a concern that has been expressed to me at European level previously.<br\/><br\/>It is almost a case of adding insult to injury in that women who have been deeply, unequally treated by the pension system were effectively targeted.  It was a decision.  It is interesting that even in the presentation from the Department &ndash; I do not make the point personally &ndash; when savings were required and there was a desire to keep the top rate of the contributory pension untouched, the lower rates were effectively eroded.  We had a concrete loss in income for those on the lower rates who are predominantly women.  We saw a group that had been systematically disadvantaged, who had been inadequately recompensed, again disadvantaged.  I am particularly concerned now that when we see the steps of repair that are happening, we are talking about the &euro;5, but all those on reduced rate pensions will not get &euro;5.  They will get &euro;3 or &euro;2, a <i>pro rata <\/i>amount less than &euro;5.  Even though they suffered unequally in terms of the impact of the contribution thresholds being changed and the bottom rate just being cut, it has not been a priority to repair that or address it.<br\/><br\/>I notice the costing in terms of 2012 is put at &euro;50 million and potentially &euro;10 million every year thereafter, yet we also hear about the total contributions approach.  I put it to the Department for potential consideration.  I would welcome the thoughts of the witnesses in this regard.  Currently, under the averaging system we have anomalies where women who have paid a full 520 contributions are not getting a full pension because of the way the system is averaged due to the years in which they paid their contributions.  People who have paid in as much as someone else are getting less back for it.  When we raised it, we were told it would be really expensive to fix that and that we should wait for the total contribution approach.  At the moment the system is failing to address the point.  Since 2004, there have been policy promises to address that anomaly.  The Department must ensure that it is not making the situation worse.  It may be that it would cost &euro;50 million next year and &euro;10 million for the following two years, but I do not think women should be asked to bear the cost, given that they have borne the cost of austerity and previously have borne the cost of inequality, while the system is sorting itself out.  I suggest that it is unacceptable that we would have that gap maintained.  That is just a thought in that regard as it is a key anomaly.<br\/><br\/>I am interested in voluntary contributions, which I strongly welcome.  Part of my proposal was to increase the period to five years.  Rather than having one year from one's last contribution, one would have five years in which one could make a voluntary contribution.  That is good and it will help a lot of people who suddenly realise their pension shortfall.  The second half of my proposal is that those who have already made 260 contributions would be able to make voluntary contributions because there is still the requirement of having already made 520 contributions.  Now the repair work will only address people where there is a gap and they are suffering from averaging.  It will not help those who realise they fall just short of a tier or that they could potentially move, if not to the highest tier, to between the third and the second tiers.  I urge the Department to consider that because it would be a way to allow people to pay in and to contribute in order to improve their own security at a later stage.  I would like the witnesses to address how that might happen.  I am probably coming to the end of my time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#H00700","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The Senator certainly is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#K00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I apologise.  The final point I will make relates to the homemaker&rsquo;s credit.  The current system is inadequate.  Total contributions will not fully fix it because it only fixes it at pension age.  I know there were discussions with the Department previously on the idea of a re-entry credit.  If, for example, one were to allow contributions to be on an ongoing basis for people who were giving a period of care, those contributions might not reach a total of 520 at the end of their working life but a re-entry credit would, in effect, allow them to access activation services and link back into the system for the purposes of training, the back-to-education allowance and other such second-chance initiatives.  The question is whether total contributions will be enough to identify the care gap.  I apologise for exceeding my time but I had extensive questions.

I will make a few points before I call on Mr. Duggan to respond.  There has been much discussion on annual averaging versus the total contribution.  Mr. Duggan was very direct in his opening statement where he indicated that the additional bands that were put in were specifically to make a saving.  The irony is that the savings were imposed on a particular group of people rather than being spread across the board.  Given that this cohort of people have felt it more, it has really highlighted the issue.  It was very prevalent in the debate on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill that women who had left work for a period might have total contributions greater than others, but their total pension payment was reduced.  Two things would be very useful from the committee's point of view.  We talk about a total contribution model but as an academic exercise it would be useful for the committee to see what that might look like.  If one took the current budget figure and divided it into a total contribution model, what would it look like?  What would the entry level be in terms of minimum number of requirements?  What total maximum would be needed to get the top rate?  Such a scoping exercise would be useful for the committee.<\/p> <p>  Is it the case that at the moment to get the maximum one has to have an average of 48 to 52 contributions, but if one were to get the maximum on a total contribution basis, it would be 1,000 contributions or 1,500?  That type of scoping exercise would help the committee to examine what a new model might look like.  If there was anything detailed and specific in that regard it would help us considerably.  Talk of total contributions can mean a lot of different things to people.  Before we go down a certain road, it would be important to know what is involved.  The Minister clearly said there would be winners and losers and it would be well worth having a look at what that might mean before we embark on it.  That is one specific issue.<\/p> <p>  Second, from the point of view of effecting change, any kind of change in terms of pensions and eligibility involves a lead-in time.  If the contributory pension age is to be set at 67, one does not say it this year for next year in order to afford people an opportunity to get their affairs in order.  If the Department is to move from an annual average approach to a total contribution basis, over what period would it take place?  Would it be done on a phased basis?  Would the two systems be run in parallel or would it be for new entrants?  How does the Department see the transition taking place?  They are points that were raised already so I do not wish to repeat them.<\/p> <p>  If the Department has information on the following issue, perhaps it might circulate it to the committee afterwards.  It was said that only 35% of those in private employment have pensions.  How does that compare to other countries?  How are pensions in other countries incentivised to encourage people?  What are the various factors that encourage people to have a higher rate of private pensions than 35%?<\/p> <p>  There was much debate about class S, the self-employed.  It was said that they are only paying 4% but 4% of what?  It is a lower percentage but what is the figure?  Some self-employed people might be earning a high amount.<\/p><p>While it does qualify a person for a contributory pension, the rate is 4%, but one is buying a smaller product.  An ordinary pay-as-you-earn, PAYE, or pay-related social insurance, PRSI, contributor would traditionally have greater benefits than somebody in class S.  How are they valued?  What percentage is attributed to pension and other benefits?  What is the basis for the figure of 4% in the case of those in class S?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#K00400","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Is there consideration being given to allowing people to make another form of contribution besides class S?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#L00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>There is a voluntary contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#L00300","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I was asking about the rules in being allowed to make a voluntary contribution.

I did not think the committee was going to try to prove it to me.  I will not promise to take the questions precisely in the order in which they were raised by committee members.  On occasion I will bring in colleagues in dealing with them. <\/p> <p>  I will begin with the increase in State pension age.  It is often said we are ahead of other countries but actually we are not.  We are pretty much in the middle of the pack, of EU countries in particular.  Of the other 27 EU countries, between 2009 and 2013, 12 increased pension age for men, while 16 have increased it for women.  While pension age was largely lower than here in many of those countries during that period, by the end of this decade, 2020, many of them will have caught up with us and will have a higher pension age.  It is not just those countries that are enduring particularly acute economic pressures, for example, Greece, that are doing it.  In other much more stable developed economies pension age is the same as here or greater, for instance, in the Netherlands.  It is essentially a factor of the sustainability of the state pension system.  <\/p> <p>  During the break, while there was a division in the D&aacute;il, Senator Kevin Humphreys asked us about future cost projections.  It is difficult to be clear a long way into the future.  At present we are spending an additional &euro;1 billion every five years on the State pension system.  That will become utterly unsustainable unless changes are made to the system, or the Government and the Houses decide to dedicate a significantly greater amount of funds from the Exchequer and the Social Insurance Fund to pension payments.  It will be one or the other, or perhaps a combination of the two.  The thinking all along has been that we have to put in place measures to enhance the sustainability of the system into the future in order that those of working age who are contributing to the Social Insurance Fund will not be left high and dry when it comes to their time to receive pensions.  This is a feature of modern developed economies around the world, particularly in Europe where one of the measures is an increase in the qualifying age for the state pension.  <\/p> <p>  On those being forced to retire at 65 years, there seems to be a misconception or misunderstanding.  There is no such thing as a statutory retirement age in Ireland and there never has been.  People are not being required to retire at 65 years because there is some law or rule of the State in place.  It is a contractual matter between an employer and an employee.  EU directives require retirement impositions to be justifiable.  Employers are required, when setting a pension age, to have justifiable grounds.  While some will say they are long-standing contracts into which people entered voluntarily and so on, there is nothing to stop employers from renegotiating them.  It is very easy to change a contract when there is mutual agreement and there is nothing to stop employers from putting in place a second contract, beginning at age 65 years and moving on if they wish to tackle the problem in that way.  The 65 year age issue is not State generated.  It is a function of contracts employers have with employees.  <\/p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform spearheaded a group that examined the issue of developing mechanisms or measures to encourage people to work for longer.  Part of it is encouraging employers to allow people work for longer and not to try to enforce the 65 year retirement contracts they may have.  As a consequence, the Workplace Relations Commission is developing guidelines for employers to encourage them to behave in that fashion. <\/p> <p>  The gross cost of the State transition pension was approximately &euro;140 million.  The net saving as a result of its abolition is estimated at approximately &euro;80 million in a full year.  In abolishing it State pension age was essentially unified at 66 years.  People were required to retire before receiving the State transition pension.  It was to move from retirement to receipt of the contributory pension.  In thinking about policy objectives it is highly unlikely that somebody who was forced to retire at 65 years to reeive the State transition pension and who at 66 received the normal State contributory pension would go back to work.  Therefore, if the policy objective is to increase people's working lives or to enable them to have &ldquo;fuller&rdquo; working lives, it seems that the State transition pension ran counter to it.  It is not just that it was a mechanism to save money in difficult austere times, it was also to aid the policy objective. <\/p> <p>  The issues of pension increases and indexation were raised.  The Department has never made a formal proposal that pension payments be index linked.<\/p><p>However, the Senator is absolutely right that it is often looked at and has been under consideration for some considerable time.  The issue is when, how and by how much pensions should be increased would impact on a lot of other budgetary measures and it could not, therefore, be considered in isolation.  That said, it is the case that Ireland is somewhat unusual in an EU context, in particular, in that setting the rate each year without reference to a particular formula is not done.  The norm in other countries is that there is a form of indexation.  Various measures are used in indexing in most other countries.  Lithuania may be the only other member state that operates somewhat like us.  Of the others, 20 member states include prices in the formula; 17 include wages; three include GDP, while there are combinations of these, depending on the approach taken by each country.  If we were to consider inflation, there would be two possibilities.  We would either use the CPI or a measure called the HICP, but in deciding we would have to look at the basket of goods used in determining the rate.  Some of the things in the normal basket are not particularly pertinent to people of retirement age; in that sense, therefore, it might not be a good quality indexer.  For example, education costs are ordinarily included in the basket.  One has to wonder if they should be included in indexing pension payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":273,"content":"<p>The partnerships' research is a very useful resource in having a more tailored basket.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#M00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481796000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Indeed.  Indexing wages is another possibility and would require us to land on a particular index.  While there would be some issues, it could ultimately be done.  If we were to choose a double lock, favoured by some, inflation, on the one hand, and wages, on the other, we would have to be extremely careful in how they were put together and over what periods of time we would be willing to make the calculations.  For instance, we could have a crazy situation where, for instance, we would take the higher figure of both, a model that is sometimes referenced.  Inflation could be high in one year, with wages being relatively low, while the following year wages which tend to lag behind inflation might be high after inflation has come down.  While the economy generally might have inflated at a particular level, indexation might result in pension payments being increasingly significantly above it.  As such, one would have to look at the issue over a multi-annual period, whatever combination of indexers one would choose.  It is obviously something that can be considered by a Minister and a Government and in respect of which we are capable of providing good quality research and figures.  Ultimately, however, it is a policy matter and would have to be determined in that space.<\/p> <p>  I can come back in on details if members wish me to do so, but I will move on for now.  The 37% gender gap mentioned by Senator Alice Mary Higgins is taken from the European Union's 2015 pensions adequacy report which found that there was a slightly larger gap across the Union as a whole than in Ireland, which is interesting.  The gap is widest in countries such as Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Luxembourg, which is also interesting.  These are well developed economies which, in some cases, are better developed than ours or, certainly, have been developed for longer.  Interestingly, the countries with the smaller gaps were at the other end, including Estonia, Lithuania and the Czech Republic, some of the newer member states.  The important point is that it does not relate only to the state pension but to all pensions.  It is a measure of history in that it reflects what went on in the past.  Many households worked on the basis of the breadwinner model in which women were carers in the home or homemakers.  That, in turn, is reflected in the gap owing to the earnings related element of pensions.  The state pension works differently from occupational pensions in that sense.  Consequently, the difference in pensions paid by the Department to those over 66 years is nowhere near 37%.  In fact, it is approximately 2%.  In other words, the average male pensioner - I am talking about averages - is paid an amount that is approximately 2% higher than the amount the average female pensioner receives in the State pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Duggan have separate figures for contributory and non-contributory pension payments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#M00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481796000,"counter":276,"content":"<p>We do not have them with us, but we can certainly get them for the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":277,"content":"<p>That would be interesting to unpack.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#M00600","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481796000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>It includes pensioners over 66 years in receipt of widow's and widower's contributory pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh Doherty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481796000,"counter":279,"content":"<p>It is all included in the statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":280,"content":"<p>It would be great to have a gender disaggregation for each of the different pension categories because that would allow us to look at the measures might be taken in each category.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#M00900","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481796000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>We can go through some models and show where different possible methods of qualification would work better in certain circumstances, depending on individual circumstances.  The main issue is that the gap is primarily found in occupational pensions rather than the State pension.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about INM and the possibility of having a pension protection fund, a debt on the employer and things of that nature.  The first really important point to note is, as members know, defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland are set up and maintained by employers on a voluntary basis.  There is no legal requirement on any employer to establish or maintain a defined benefit pension scheme.  It has always been voluntary and there has never been a law requiring employers to provide fpr one or anything like it.  As a consequence, most defined benefit schemes in Ireland are set up under a deed of trust which sets out the rules of the scheme and undertakes certain liabilities and duties as a consequence of these rules.  Because they are voluntary, each trust deed varies.  It depends on what the trustees, the employees, their representatives and the employers agreed to.  There are differences in the rules which, in some cases, are considerable.  There is no essential one-size-fits all scheme.  Despite all of the difficulties which have arisen, the vast majority of employers operating defined benefit schemes have made great efforts to support them and deliver the benefits to scheme members.  They are making significant efforts to ensure their ongoing viability for as long as required into the future.  It is important to state the majority of schemes are working well and that employers are committed to them.<\/p> <p>  As I said in my opening statement, the process all along has been that the good functioning of schemes is generally engineered through dialogue between the parties involved.  Where issues arise, they sit down and work things out between them.  This usually works well.  However, there are exceptions.<\/p><p>The INM case that occurred in recent weeks is an obvious example of a case where the dialogue process that is almost taken for granted does not seem to have occurred.  If serious consideration was given to taking legislative measures in this area, such legislation would have to have a couple of significant qualities.  First, it would have to work and do what one wanted it to do, in other words, achieve the desired outcome.  One would have to think carefully about what that desired outcome should be.  Most people argue that the desired outcome is a no-brainer, namely, that people should receive the benefits they have been expecting to receive.  That may not be achievable in its fullest sense, however, and for that reason a little thought and consideration would have to be given to how one might frame it.  The second quality which is as critically important as the first is that, in addition to such legislative measures achieving the desired outcome, they would have to do so in a way that would not cause harm.  That is a tricky balance to strike. <\/p><p> Another issue that would have to be carefully considered is how applicable this might be in some retrofitting arrangement.  Given that pension schemes were established voluntarily under a trust deed, there is a degree of debate about whether one could subsequently impose a statute on them.  A question arises as to whether one could impose legal requirements on an existing debt.  While it would be okay to do this for the future, could they be applied to schemes that were or are in place using a voluntary mechanism?  That issue also requires careful consideration.  While I am not necessarily saying anything the Senator has not heard before, these are important qualities that would have to be considered.<\/p><p> There would be obvious advantages in placing a minimum obligation on an employer who is sponsoring a defined benefit pension scheme.  It would be better in trying to protect the benefits of existing and former members of a scheme.  It would also, to use a horrible phrase, prevent employers from walking away and leaving a scheme high and dry.  It might also help to reduce any potential exposure of the State if a scheme were to be wound up with a deficit.  Notwithstanding these obvious and good advantages, there could be significant downsides which also have to be considered.  I referred to retrofitting and how fair and legally permissible it might be.  A second concern is that one would not want a scenario to arise where one had a pension scheme with a company tagged on to the side of it.  If it was suggested legislation of this nature was to be introduced, one would not want a flight from defined benefit pension schemes by employers, regardless of whether they had debt issues.  Given the volatility of the investment market, it is difficult for anyone managing a pension scheme to predict with any degree of accuracy in what position the scheme will be in one year, two years or five years from now.  Therefore, if employers were to be faced with the possibility of having a legal obligation to secure debts that could arise in the future, it could force them, their boards and shareholders to think very differently from the way they think about the scheme when it is a voluntary arrangement.  We would have to be careful in considering that issue and teasing out that possibility.   <\/p><p> In addition, even if legislation was to be introduced in a way that did not allow for this scenario to arise, experience in other countries has shown that it takes time to bed these things down because it is not particularly easy to predict what behaviours might emerge with companies in such cases.  As a result, anti-avoidance structures and measures have become a feature of the system in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as other countries that have introduced provisions of this nature.  We would have to carefully try to predict and tease through these scenarios and how they might work, which would be a complicated task. <\/p><p> While this approach is fine where there is a single employer scheme or a single set of trustees scheme, a number of defined benefit pension schemes are much more complicated as they involve multiple employers and different sets of rules for different types of employee and so on.  It is not the easiest thing in the world to develop legislation.  I truly wish it were as easy as drafting a small amendment to an Act.  However, on close examination, it seems that complicated legislation would be needed to address an issue such as this. <\/p><p> A significant issue is that the extra funding burden could, unfortunately, accelerate the demise of the defined benefit pension scheme environment if one were to take the route proposed.  Some experts have suggested this approach could bring about a rather abrupt end to the provision of defied benefit pension schemes.  While some argue that this is exaggerated and could not possibility occur, we have to be mindful of this potential and tease through the realities before we would be in a position to make a decision one way or the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>My colleague, Deputy John Brady, referred to a pension protection fund, which is another approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#N00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481796000,"counter":284,"content":"<p>That approach is very unlikely to be helpful right now because a fund would have to be built up.  There are different ways it could be done.  The fund in the United Kingdom to which the Deputy referred is essentially a quasi-insurance fund which is built up over many years from charges imposed on pension schemes.  In many cases, when a charge is imposed on a pension scheme, it either impacts on the employer who is sponsoring the defined benefit pension scheme, in other words, the employer carries the can and pays more into the fund, or it is essentially a charge on the members of the scheme and results in reduced pension payments.  It depends on the way in which the measure is applied.  If one has a benign, reasonably solvent employer, he or she will usually pick up the tab.<\/p> <p>  The funds are amassed over many years and used in the event that an insolvent company is not able to fund its pension scheme.  In the particular case the Senator raised, this would not apply and would not be of any use.  As there has not been such a fund in Ireland, it would not have been of any use because the fund would not have been in place.  Introducing one now to protect schemes in the future would have obvious advantages, but there would also be disadvantages.  For instance, the big disadvantage is that it could result in some of the scenarios I outlined with regard to debt on employers and in exactly the same behaviours.  It would impose additional charges on pension schemes already with funding difficulties or facing a predicament.  For this reason, one would have to wonder how willing employers would be to continue funding these schemes if the costs were to increase continuously.  It is also possible that in the event of a downturn in the economy or a large scheme failing, the fund would not be able to withstand the calls being made on it, unless it had been in place for a considerable period and, even then, it could experience difficulties.  This concern persists in the United Kingdom, notwithstanding the fact that its fund has been in place for some time.<\/p><p>They do not expect that fund to be self-sustaining until after 2030, for instance.  This is a long-term measure and given what is happening with defined benefit, DB, schemes worldwide one wonders if there would be a lifetime for such a fund in Ireland.  In any event, such funds seem to work best in countries that have large scale.  The UK is probably almost at the edges of the type of scale that is required.  The view has been expressed, and it would appear to be intuitively correct, that Ireland may not have the scale to sustain a fund of this nature in terms of the schemes that are in place and the level of liabilities that accrue to those schemes.  <\/p><p> In his engagement on the Bill in the Seanad on Tuesday, the Minister listed many reasons that debt on the employer requires careful consideration, some of which I have repeated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duggan for his input on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#O00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481796000,"counter":287,"content":"<p>My colleague, Mr. Nicholson, will respond to the questions on the universal retirement savings system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481796000,"counter":288,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked for information on how we compared internationally in terms of occupational and supplementary pensions.  Ireland is one of only two OECD countries that does not have a mandatory or quasi-mandatory earnings related pillar, the other country being New Zealand which has in place a fairly significant system anyway.  However, one needs to look at the nature of the individual systems because they are not always comparable between the various pillars.  The first pillar is the State pension, the second is the occupational pension and the third is the personal pensions.  There are differences between the systems.  As a broad indicator, the OECD average of post-retirement income, compared to pre-retirement income, is 54% of pre-retirement wages.  In Ireland, only 35% of the population in the private sector have occupational or supplementary pensions.  The remainder are reliant on the State pension, which is 35% of the average industrial wage, such that there is a crude retirement savings gap in Ireland in comparison with our OECD colleagues in terms of overall adequacy.  Again, there are all sorts of caveats around that because this is a notoriously difficult area in that one needs to take account of housing, taxation, differences in consumption between different types of people and tertiary benefits such as free travel, household benefits and so on.  This retirement savings gap has prompted the idea of a universal retirement savings system, whereby the State removes the voluntary nature of the system and adds an element of compulsion.  Decisions have not yet been made on the appropriate model in this regard, although two models have been put forward.  The preferred model of the interdepartmental committee that looked at this issue was a defined contribution earnings related second pillar system, which narrows the frame of reference significantly in terms of the proposed solution.<\/p> <p>  As part of that process, we talked to approximately 36 groups, including trade unions, employers, pensions industry officials and officials from the voluntary and community sectors.  There is absolute consensus around the need for improved retirement savings although there is little consensus and disparate views on the manner of the response to that.  For example, a defined contribution, DC, earnings related pillar could take many forms.  It could take the form of a State-operated system in the context of increased PRSI contributions or a nominal account for an individual that is personalised and moves beyond the redistributive State pension system.  It could equally be one large State pension scheme, similar to NEST in the UK or a hybrid of both models which could involve the private sector bidding for work in that area for a large number of funds, or it could be an extension of the current system with employers and employees being compelled to enrol in a pension scheme.  The operational framework will be extremely important.  As I said earlier, all the evidence suggests that the design of such a system will be crucial.  Also crucial is political consensus.  Generally speaking, internationally, there has been cross-party political support to allow any proposed reform to move beyond the term of, in this instance, this D&aacute;il.  As mentioned by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, consumer trust and buy-in by the various individuals involved will also be crucial.  <\/p> <p>  Leaving aside the operational characteristics of the scheme, fundamental questions such as who should be included, why they should be included, the policy objective of the system, the financial incentives, how much a person should contribute, whether a person should be allowed access to some of his or her savings and so on need to be addressed.  In terms of the gender issue, it is fair to say that any system that relies on earnings and contributions from earnings can naturally result in worse or lesser outcomes for particular groups in comparison with others.  I am speaking in this regard about the gender pensions gap.  It is a difficult area in the context of an earnings related system because the triple whammy of fewer hours worked, less time spent in the labour market and more part-time work and lesser earnings generally results in lesser pots at the end for those groups, who, typically speaking, and to a large extent, are women.  What is put in reflects what goes out.  A particular challenge will be how such a system will meet the needs of carers and other groups, which leads on to the issue of financial incentives and any contribution the State may make for particular groups.  This is a matter on which a decision will have to be taken before any system could be launched.  Typically speaking, internationally, those issues rather than being addressed through an employment related system are addressed through the distributive first pillar system.  One way or the other the issues have to be considered and a position taken on them.  I agree that this is a key issue.  <\/p> <p>  On the question about people who are naturally outside the labour market, there are international systems that allow opt-ins, with financial incentives and so on.  There is nothing preventing any DC employment-related system being opened up to people outside of the labour market.  On the question regarding trust, fundamentally what is required is the trust of the consumer, particularly in the case of an opt-out system.  Again, this will be a matter around design of the system.  Typically, default investment structures with very tight parameters would be put in place.  All of the evidence we have suggests that we should move away from the current system which comprises 160,000 with significant charges because they do not achieve economies of scale and, on occasion, there are problems with governance because there are 200,000 trustees across the country making decisions about people's retirement income in the future.  It would be generally accepted that what we need to do is to strive towards having a small number of large schemes that can achieve economies of scale, result in better outcomes for members, can be more easily governed and have legislative underpinning in terms of how they operate.  All of this work is work that still needs to be done, although we have devised initial ideas around it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Nicholson"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":289,"content":"<p>In regard to the large schemes, which may be public, private or a mix of the two and involve tailored products produced for the investment market, would the ethical investment concerns that may arise in terms of State investment and the constraints already in place in that regard affect what types of packages are acceptable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#O00500","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481796000,"counter":290,"content":"<p>Generally speaking, the investment parameters would be set in legislation.

The coverage rates are quite similar.  Again, because of lower hours, part-time work, lower wages and so forth, the outcomes from those pensions are significantly lower for women than they are for men.  The issue of adequacy needs to be looked at.  The gender pensions gap in the 2013 EU report on this area showed a 39% difference in supplementary pensions income for women compared to men.  CSO data indicates that, on average, 9% of income of women in retirement comes from occupational pensions as opposed to 23% for men.  There are different ways to look at the figures but certainly there is a gender gap.  It is not lessened by employment-related pension schemes as it stands.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Tim Duggan stated, current pensions income typically reflects social norms of yesterday.  The labour market participation rate of women has gone up 20 percentage points in the past 20 years.  Some of those impacts will be reduced but it remains an issue.<\/p> <p>  The issue with the mandatory retirement age and longer working goes back to the European report on pension adequacy.  The question is what is one trying to achieve by how long someone stays in retirement.  To a large extent, it is about intergenerational fairness.  The period that individuals contribute to a pensions system and benefit from it should stay somewhat consistent across the generations.  How does one get that right?  That is a question for another day but that is what underpins the increase in age for the State pension.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform report on fuller working lives covered several areas but attached a report in 2013 around various suggested measures which would support longer working.  That included financial incentives such as tax and PRSI, changes to employers&rsquo; practices, how to reform the labour market, training and upskilling and so on.  These would cover to a large extent international best practice in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Nicholson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481796000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>The homemaker provision was introduced in 1994.  However, at the time it did not have any retrospective effect and only applied from that date on.  My understanding is that the reason it was not retrospective was that the costs involved would be significant.  It is not possible to be entirely definitive about those costs without doing a lot of spadework, so to speak.  Typically, we do an analysis based on the child benefit records which have only been computerised since the early 1980s.  One would have to go through paper to go back beyond that, which would be difficult enough.  At the time, it was estimated tentatively that the cost would be the equivalent today of &euro;160 million.  This was approximately 4% of the pensions spend at the time.  Since then, we have done quite a detailed analysis of this.  If we were to introduce a homemaker measure with no start date from January 2017, we estimate it would be an additional &euro;290 million per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>It would be useful if that costing could be sent on to us.

We have done quite a bit of analysis on this and we will see what way we can best package it for the committee.  We are reasonably assured regarding our calculation of &euro;290 million, or thereabouts.  When one thinks about it, one notes it is close to double the increase given in the budget right across the board.  It is a very substantial amount of money.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of other issues, including cost and policy choices.  If there is &euro;290 million to spend, one must decide where it is to be spent and whether there are other more pressing matters, as in the pensions space and other spaces in the social welfare budget, or more generally in other Exchequer expenditure areas.  Therefore, many policy issues arise over how largesse of the amount in question might be spent.  There is also the issue of equity.  As we have said on a couple of occasions, societal norms are changing and have been changing quite significantly over the past 20 years plus.  I hate to pit men against women because I actually have some friends who are in the homemaker or carer role who are male and who, as a consequence, get as exercised about this as female friends.  It is the case, however, that the circumstances of people who are now working and spending quite significant amounts on child care and making contributions must be balanced with those of people who are not paying large sums on child care and so on.

I am just saying the phenomenon exists and it is a matter we have to tease through when we are examining this.<br\/><br\/>On the total contributions approach, we are obviously very mindful of the potential disadvantage it could cause for women if it were just effected on a straight <i>pro rata <\/i>basis.  This is because of some of the factors we have mentioned already.  I refer to the typical work patterns that many women have experienced over the years.  As I stated, norms are changing quite dramatically.  To use a horrible word, &quot;millennials&quot; have an entirely different approach from that of 30 or 40 years ago.  The breakdown is that approximately 48% of people paying PRSI are women.  It is reaching a greater equilibrium, so to speak.  Most couples are working now.  Certainly, the numbers are going in that direction.<br\/><br\/>Even after paying for child care, most families are better off with two wages if both partners are in a position to work.  That means circumstances in 30 to 40 years will be different from those than pertain now or did pertain.  In planning a total contributions approach, because it will be a very long-lived system more than likely, we have to plan it on the basis of what now exists and will exist over the coming years.  Equally, we have to try to ascertain what circumstances will look like in 25, 30 or even 50 years.  It seems, on the basis of our analysis to date, that this will not be a rigid fix system and that there may be a degree of variability to allow for changes in demographics and people's working patterns that have emerged in recent years.  That must be properly reflected when people reach retirement in the decades ahead.  That said, it is our current thinking as we try to plan this that a pretty significant allowance for homemaking and caring is likely to feature.  We do not see any other way of designing a system like this.<br\/><br\/>We are keenly awaiting the upcoming actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund because it will help us enormously in trying to work out costings and approaches that might be appropriate to the envelopes available to us.  The Chairman did not use these words but I believe he was wondering what a system like this would look like on a cost-neutral basis.  That is precisely one of the points we are trying to tease through at present.  The actuarial review is due to kick off shortly.  While it will take until well into next year to have it completed, we hope the initial data coming from it will be relevant to this study.  In fact, that has been agreed and, therefore, it will be given priority.  We hope that, by the middle of 2017, we will be in a position to engage in very serious stakeholder consultations on possible approaches to this.  It will obviously include this committee.  We will prepare materials for the members in that sense to kick off some of the discussions.  Once we have the costings from the actuarial review and some of our own design work done, whereby we can project the costings a bit better, we intend to try to make them available to members in a form that is as easily digested as possible.  This stuff is quite confusing and one can get easily bamboozled with columns of figures.  We will try our best and then set out what we believe to be the priorities in developing a system of this nature.  We have done a lot of work on it already but we are critically dependent on seeing what emerges from the review.<br\/><br\/>I cannot answer the question directly because we are still going through all the information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duggan for his honesty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#Q00700","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481796000,"counter":310,"content":"<p>The current thinking is that this might be implementable from approximately 2020 onwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1481796000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>On a dual basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2016121500002#Q00900","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1481796000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>We have not yet landed on whether it would be on a dual basis and whether choice would be provided, or whether there should be a drop-dead date and a pick-up date.

I am not for a second going to pretend that is an absolute date that has been fully agreed.  It really depends on where we end up in 2017 in terms of the design and consultation, the associated changes to the design and how we can get through a legislative process.
