I am not thinking of ourselves in trying to table amendments but of the staff of the Houses.  Last week we held particularly good debates with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, whom I am pleased has retained his position.  I told him that he had done a good job to date.  In the first 90 days of  term only one Government Bill was published and dealt with by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Today, six Bills will be taken.  This is not the way for any parliament to do its business.  The Leader agrees and I am not making a political charge, but the House should send this message.<\/p><p>I congratulate the new Ministers and Ministers of State appointed in recent days.  I will not go through all of their names because I do not know half of them.  For them and their families, it was an important announcement.  It is an honour for them to serve in their new roles and I wish them all well.  I commit to supporting them when our group believes they are doing the right thing and to holding them to account when they do not.  I take the Leader's point about the appointment of Ministers of State today will may result in changes to the schedule.<\/p><p>The substantive issue I wish to raise relates to the property tax which Fine Gael and the Labour Party have termed the local property tax, even though we know that it is not, given the fact that not one cent of what was collected last year went to local authorities.  Yesterday, Fingal County Council, the local authority on which I served and which covers the area in which I reside, passed a Fianna F&aacute;il motion - I commend my colleagues on the council - committing to a reduction of 15% in the property tax for hard-pressed home owners.  We gave that commitment during the local elections.  Other parties supported the motion which was passed with 30 votes for, zero against and seven abstentions.  Other local authorities will, rightly, do the same, but the former Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, deliberately delayed publication of regulations governing how local authorities would go about advising Revenue of such changes.  We are nearing the recess and there is a new Labour Party Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in Deputy Alan Kelly.  Using his good offices, will the Leader ask the new Minister to publish the regulations immediately in order that local authorities such as Fingal County Council that have, rightly, agreed to pass on the maximum reduction of 15% to home owners will know what needs to be done in advising Revenue?<\/p> <p> Under section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, when a local authority avails of the capacity to reduce or increase the rate by plus or minus 15%, as Fingal County Council has done, it must inform the Revenue Commissioners so that the latter will know that the reduced rate applies to households in that area.  The regulations cannot be delayed past September because local authorities across the country will be finalising their budgets in the coming months.  I am calling on the new Minister to publish them without delay.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the former Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, on his appointment as European Commissioner and wish our colleague, Senator Pat O'Neill, all the best when he joins the Commissioner's cabinet in Brussels.<\/p><p>I ask that the new Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, come to the House in September to discuss the local property tax, particularly the issue of subventions.  I will make a final point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500003#B00800","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405424400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The Senator is way over time.

To reiterate, I am calling for the immediate publication of the regulations to allow local authorities to advise Revenue of reductions in the local property tax to be levied within their jurisdiction.

As all colleagues know, it is not a unique feature of this Government.  In fact, it has been a recurring theme every July to have legislation crammed into the schedule.  There are 11 Bills before the House this week for our consideration and we are all agreed that this is not a good way to do business.  It is an understandable human impetus to seek to get legislation through or at least initiated before the summer recess, but it does not make for good legislation.  This is not to assign any blame to the Leader or his office, because that is not where the problem is arising.  The legislation is coming from Departments.  It is important that we should lay down a marker on this issue on a cross-party basis.<\/p><p>I reiterate my call for a debate on the situation in the Middle East as soon as we return in September.  We all hope the situation will not have deteriorated further by then for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.  The offer by Egypt to broker a ceasefire is very welcome, as is the indication by the Israeli Government of a willingness to accept such a move.  We are as one in hoping there will be no escalation of the conflict and, in particular, that Israel will not mount any sort of ground offensive.  People in Gaza, particularly women and children, have suffered enough in the past week.  That 180 are dead is an appalling tragedy.<\/p><p>I commend the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and other non-governmental organisations on their participation in the United Nations Human Rights Committee hearings in Geneva yesterday and today, at which the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is answering questions on Ireland's compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  I was in the ICCL's green room yesterday, together with representatives of a range of NGOs, to watch the committee's proceedings.  It is a welcome example of transparency in the political process to see not only the Minister but also Irish NGOs participating in those hearings.<\/p><p>I will conclude by noting several pieces of good news.  First, I welcome the appointment by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, of Ms Mary Robinson as Special Envoy on Climate Change.  It is a well deserved achievement for our former colleague in the Seanad and former Trinity College colleague for some of us.  Second, I welcome the coming into effect today of the Protected Disclosures Act 2013.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, expressed his hope this morning in an interview with RTE that this legislation will usher in a new culture where whistleblowers will not only be protected but given credit for exposing wrongdoing in their organisations.  Finally, on a more local note, I welcome the passing by Dublin City Council of Councillor Dermot Lacey's motion seeking to protect the red and white Pigeon House chimneys, which were apparently under threat.  Most people in Dublin and elsewhere in the country would hope to see them preserved because they are an iconic symbol of the city and one of the most notable landmarks for anybody arriving into Dublin by sea or air.  I very much welcome the steps being taken to seek their preservation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500004#C00600","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1405424400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on the coming into law of the long-awaited legislation to protect whistleblowers.

There is an inconsistency in the Government bringing forward this particular gagging clause while at the same time enacting legislation to protect whistleblowers.  The reaction of certain colleagues on the Government side to the decision by some Independent Members to oppose the provision was less than generous and gracious.

These very small organisations give very dedicated support.  Very often the sum involved does not even add up to the amount wasted by other plans and Departments.  By not funding these small organisations, community and voluntary organisations will not be able to give families support when they need it.

That makes a great deal of sense.<\/p><p>Today we will deal with a number of Bills such as the National Treasury Management Agency Bill and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Bill.  They are worthwhile so we should have a good debate, criticise them, comment on them and make sure we improve them if we can.  When we set up agencies do we check that they work?  The Insolvency Service of Ireland was established to see what it could do to help 54,000 mortgages in arrears but it has only written-off 27 personal mortgages in the past year.<\/p> <p>It seems that when we set up an agency or organisation to achieve something, we want to follow through and see to it that it is unable to achieve more than it has set out to do.  Some 54,000 mortgages are in arrears and only 27 people have had mortgages written off.  This is probably due to something we can improve when we criticise legislation passed by the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500005#D00800","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405425600,"counter":34,"content":"<p>It is important to clarify what happened in the vote last week.

The issue that needs to be addressed is the waiting time for those who are in hospital and in need of palliative or nursing home care in order that they are not left for a prolonged period as currently occurs.  The delay in transferring patients from hospital care to nursing home care costs approximately &euro;196 million per annum.  That issue needs to be dealt with.

The Insolvency Service of Ireland will have been in operation and accepting applications for one year in September and a review is urgently called for.  There is no doubt that the numbers achieving positive outcomes from the service are incredibly disappointing, with an average debt write-off figure in the cases resolved of a mere 17%.  It is disturbing to note that the report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform notes the public refusal of lending institutions to engage with the Insolvency Service of Ireland on a debt write-down for any customer.  This makes a mockery of the service and what the country is trying to do in legislation to alleviate the distress of those in severe debt.  If legislation is not working and we must introduce amendments to make it mandatory for financial institutions to engage with the Insolvency Service of Ireland in a real and meaningful way, that is what we must do.  On a number of occasions the financial institutions have stated the service is not dealing with more cases because they are coming to the table and offering real and sustainable solutions to borrowers.  In some instances, that may be true, but in others it is far from it.  A period of 12 months is long enough in the current crisis; we, therefore, need an urgent review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500006#E01200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1405425600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>C&eacute; go bhfuil eagar &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar na pearsain at&aacute; sa Rialtas, n&iacute; fheicim go bhfuil mor&aacute;n athr&uacute; ar an bpolasa&iacute;, ach beimid ag s&uacute;il leis na hAir&iacute; agus na hAir&iacute; St&aacute;it nua isteach go bpl&eacute;ifimid na ruda&iacute; seo leo.<\/p><p>I would like to have a debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to address two mistakes made by his predecessors.  One concerns the rural transport programme, particularly as it operates in Connemara.  Under the new set-up, local offices will be relocated from Connemara to a more central location.  This is a mistake and those who run the service think so too.  A review was carried out under the previous rural transport programme under which the move was mooted.  An expert was sent to drive from Cleggan to Portumna to see how big County Galway was and said it was ludicrous to merge the rural transport programmes in the area..  I am sure there are similar instances across the country.  We need to address the issue and reverse the decision to centralise the rural transport programme under local authorities.<\/p><p>Galway is experiencing a boom because of the arts festival and the film fleadh and the race festival is coming up.  One of the issues that has been raised a number of times is that of taxi drivers.  A huge number of people come into the city and those who play by the rules tell me that a number of rogue taxi drivers are coming into the city with little regulation under the new regime.  The branding to do away with double jobbers is not working.  The branding and stickers on the sides of taxis make taxi drivers a target at night.  The homes of a number of taxi drivers have been broken into and their families put at risk.  They are concerned that they are targets for thieves.  We need to address this mistake.  We raised these issues when the legislation was introduced.  Cars more than ten years old, even if they are in pristine condition, must be replaced.  The provision which enables taxi drivers to pick up passengers willy-nilly, not at official taxi ranks but wherever crowds may be gathered, is putting bona fide taxi drivers out of business, this is a time when they need to make money to keep them going through the winter.  If we cannot have a debate before the recess, perhaps the Leader might intervene with the Minister to have the issue addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500006#E01300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1405426200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, on doing us proud in Geneva yesterday at the United Nations.

However, garda&iacute; may break the rules if they have permission from a chief for emergencies, etc.  Obviously, every garda must be trained to drive.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be the first to say that.  Is this going to handicap garda&iacute; or tie their hands behind their back if they are not trained?  It takes three weeks to train them and only ten or 12 garda&iacute; go through the training school at any one time.  This new regulation or directive did not come from the Minister.

Most disturbing is the phenomenon of violent burglaries which appear to target older people.  The closure of rural Garda stations and crimes targeting older people in isolated rural areas are connected issues.  The only way we can ensure the measures proposed by the Government do not disproportionately affect older people is by having a statutory requirement for all legislation to be monitored for its impact on vulnerable groups.

This has been the longest period of absence of a US ambassador to Ireland.  The issue of immigration reform for the 50,000 undocumented Irish in America should be foremost in his mind, but also in the mind of the Minister of State with responsibility for the Irish overseas and the diaspora, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, whom I congratulate on being appointed to that role.

Car parks such as the one at University Hospital Galway are full to capacity and people cannot use them during the day.

I am disappointed that my colleague in Cavan, Deputy Joe O'Reilly, was not promoted on this occasion.  However, I have no doubt that he will be promoted in the near future.  Perhaps I might give some advice to the new Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to the effect that she should seek the wise council of Deputy Joe O'Reilly who is a fluent Irish speaker, holds a first class honours degree in Irish history and has been involved in the arts, particularly in the arena of drama, since his teenage years.  He has been involved in many successful dramatic productions throughout the country for many decades.<\/p><p>Will the Leader invite the new Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to come before the House in order that we might discuss the transition from VECs to education and training boards and ascertain what plans her Department has to ensure the five boards which do not have training centres within their remit will be allocated both a budget and staff resources to provide training?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500008#G00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1405426800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I join colleagues in congratulating the new Ministers and Ministers of State.  It would be appropriate for the new Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to be invited to come before the House to engage in a debate on the holding of festivals and events and how we might restore the country's reputation in the aftermath of the debacle which marked the past couple of weeks.  One classic example of a festival that is tremendously successful is the Willie Clancy Summer School held in Milltown Malbay, County Clare.  Thousands of people from all over Ireland and abroad come to Milltown Malbay and stay in hotels, camper vans and tents.  They park in other people's driveways and outside their houses and busk on the streets day and night.  The only security presence over the entire weekend is a single garda who is on patrol on the Sunday when the place is heaving.  Said garda keeps a low profile and merely wanders up and down the street.  The Willie Clancy Summer School is an example of where people open their homes and hearts to visitors.  It is a model from which the country could learn.<\/p><p>In the context of tourism and business, I was delighted to read in today's newspapers that Michael O'Leary had committed to Ryanair for a further five years.  He is probably one of the greatest businessmen the country has ever produced and pays his taxes here.  Ryanair carries 84 million or 85 million passengers per year and I understand it will break the 100 million barrier in the near future.  Many distinguished individuals come before this House to address it.  Mr. O'Leary should be invited to address us because, as stated, he is one of the greatest businessmen the country has ever produced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500008#G00300","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1405426800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I second Senator Mark Daly's amendment to the Order of Business.  I also propose my own amendment, namely, that No. 21 be taken before No. 1.  No. 21 is a Bill I drafted - I thank my colleagues, Senators Mark Daly and Diarmuid Wilson for co-signing it - in respect of what is a very live issue.  Last December the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for planning announced her intention to review the planning guidelines for wind farms.  As she acknowledged at the time, they are completely out of date and do not relate to the new type of wind turbines being used.  Since the review was announced, quite a number of planning applications for wind farms have been submitted, either to local authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  One such application is for the construction of 50 wind turbines in north County Meath.  The position is unclear on which guidelines will actually apply to these applications.  The Bill I have drafted proposes that where the Minister announces his or her intention to revise, change or amend guidelines, An Bord Plean&aacute;la cannot make a decision until new guidelines are published.  Effectively, I am seeking a moratorium on the consideration of the applications to which I refer until the guidelines have been published.<\/p><p>I encourage the new Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to publish good and acceptable guidelines as soon as possible.  There is a gap and there appears to be a real rush to have planning applications accepted before the guidelines become relevant in terms of the types of turbine now in use.  Communities throughout the country are of the view that people are riding roughshod over them.  Planning permission for the construction of wind farms was recently granted in south County Meath and County Laois.  I understand an application will be submitted very soon for the massive project in north County Meath to which I refer and which was originally part of the deal to export energy to which the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, used to refer and which was cancelled prior to the local elections.  One week after the elections another application for planing permission was made, but on this occasion it was stated the project was been designed to service the requirements of the Irish domestic energy market.<\/p><p>There is a great deal happening in this area, but very little is being done to regulate the position.  The former Minister of State acknowledged that the planning guidelines relating to this matter were out of date.  I would like her former Department to publish good and acceptable guidelines.  In addition, there is a need for a moratorium on the consideration of applications until the guidelines have been published.  I drafted my Private Members' Bill immediately after attending a public meeting held in Carlanstown, County Meath last week.  I wrote the legislation overnight and have already identified a number of issues which arise and which will require amendment.  I would be open and look forward to amendments from other Members if the legislation proceeds beyond Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500008#G00600","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1405426800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I second Senator Thomas Byrne's amendment.  <\/p><p>I concur with Senator C&aacute;it Keane's request that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, come before the House in order that we might discuss events taking place in Geneva, yesterday and today, and associated matters, including the organisation of some NGOs.  The Minister could also inform the House as to why the Irish representative on the UN Commission on Human Rights voted against a pro-family motion put before it in the past week.  We have a constitutional position on this matter and it is surprising that Ireland's representative joined a minority of representatives of other countries in voting in an anti-family fashion at the relevant meeting.  I would welcome a response from the Minister on this matter.<\/p><p>I concur with Senator Aideen Hayden's comments on the need for a review of insolvency legislation.  I do not believe she or anyone else in the House should be surprised at the relative ineffectiveness of the legislation, particularly in view of the fact that not only did it give the banks all the aces, it also gave them the entire pack of cards.  That was an issue in the debate when the legislation was debated in the House.  There is absolutely no consideration for borrowers who find themselves in difficult circumstances.  There was never going to be engagement on the part of the banks.  The legislation should be reviewed and, I hope, amended.  In that context, will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Finance to come before the House to discuss the matter and also the current position in the property market, particularly in the capital city?  There are observers who have analysed the position and reached the conclusion that in the past year the release of properties onto the market has been very strictly controlled by both the banks and NAMA.<\/p> <p>The consequence, of course, is that now prices have increased, properties are being released at these higher prices.  There is a view that there could be manipulation of the market going on.  There is certainly a view that part of the objective in doing this, particularly on the side of the banks, is that it will lead to a situation where these higher prices will improve their loan books in the run-up to the stress tests.  If they are at that, and I do not know if they are, we certainly need to shed a light on it because it is not in the interest of the recovery of a proper effective property market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500008#G00700","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405427400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I want to stress my deep surprise and disappointment at the attitude of some of our MEPs to the appointment of the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, as Commissioner.  It is very unusual to see Irish people bad-mouthing their own when they are away from home.  It is not done.  As we say at home, you do not talk badly about your own when you are out of town.  Mr. Hogan has come through the process like everybody else.  He was a Minister of stature who, according to all reports, will have a great opportunity to get an important portfolio.  At a time when Ireland really needs help, we should be pulling together and working together rather than having this very silly and disappointing carry-on.<\/p><p>As others have done, I congratulate and commiserate with those who were involved in the reshuffle last week.  I welcome the appointment of Deputy Paschal Donohoe as the new Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, which is my brief in the House.  Hopefully, he will be able to take a fresh and renewed look at the ongoing problem with the LNG project, which I know the Leader is sick of hearing about but which has taken a new turn lately with the involvement of people from the Emirates who have expressed some interest in getting involved.  That might free things up a bit.<\/p><p>With regard to my county colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, I commiserate with him as he is no longer in Cabinet but congratulate him on his appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora.  He is ideally suited to the job.  He has travelled a lot through his football career and in his other Ministries.  Knowing Jimmy, he puts everything into it, so I suggest the Minister for Finance would get a price for a second Government jet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500009#H00400","speaker":"1142"},{"type":"speech","time":1405427400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Senator Darragh O'Brien referred to the rush of legislation in the last couple of weeks and I agree totally with him.  We will have to have a better approach to legislation.  As he mentioned, we were waiting for a number of weeks in the early part of this session when we had little or no legislation.  It is something the Government will have to look at into the future.<\/p><p>On legislation, I mentioned that we will probably have changes.  It is advisable that Members be aware we will more than likely be here on Friday to deal with some items that we may not get to in time.<\/p><p>In regard to property tax and a vote in Fingal, I presume it is in the context of the Estimates that such measures would be taken.  I agree with the Senator that the Minister should publish the regulations and I am sure we will do so in early course.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik and other Senators referred to the situation in the Middle East and called for a ceasefire there, as did our new Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I am sure we would all hope to see peace and reconciliation in that troubled part of the world.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik spoke also in regard to human rights and the hearings involving the Government.  Other Members also complimented the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on her position.  I will try to find out for Senator Walsh the information he sought in regard to an official or representative on a particular subject.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik also complimented Mary Robinson on being appointed as UN Special Envoy on Climate Change.  It is a great honour for the former President and former Senator and I am sure we all wish her well.<\/p><p>Senator O'Donnell raised the issue of whistleblowers legislation and the charter coming into place, and I take her points in that regard.  She also referred to Quality and Qualifications Ireland and the charging of &euro;5,000 in fees.  I am not sure whether it was Senator O'Donnell who raised this matter previously, although it probably was.  I would agree with her in this regard.  I suggest this matter should be raised on the Adjournment.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett, among others, wished all the new Ministers well.  He also commended the outgoing Ministers on their excellent work over the past three years and the service they gave to this country at a time when we badly needed it.  I join with Senator Barrett and the other Senators in commending those Ministers in particular and, naturally, wishing the new Ministers well.  Senator Barrett also welcomed the fact the 12th of July celebrations went off in a peaceful manner.<\/p><p>Senator Sheahan asked that we would explore options in regard to utilising the rail network for overnight freight in particular.  I would agree totally.  In the past, Irish Rail had many freight trains running at night.  I remember working in Waterford port when freight trains were coming from Ballina, Belfast, Limerick and elsewhere all through the night but Irish Rail has practically abandoned the carrying of freight, in particular container freight.  I agree with the Senator that this option should be explored, particularly in the context of his point in regard to regulations that are coming in for drivers.<\/p><p>Senator O'Donovan asked that we would come back in September to look at the whole medical card situation again.  I am sure we will do that with the new Minister.  Senator Comiskey referred to Irish Rural Link and rural transport, a matter also raised by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout raised the issue of the terms of reference on the mother and baby homes.  I understand statements are scheduled for the other House on Thursday following an update to Cabinet today on the issue.  I will certainly speak to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, about securing a debate with him on this matter early in the autumn session.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout also called for a debate on how we fund the national federation networks.  I would agree we should have a debate.  We have many organisations representing some groups and whether they should all be funded or not is a question we should debate.  If there are quite a number of these networks representing a particular group, should we fund them all or should we fund one or two of them?  It is a question that should certainly be considered.<\/p><p>Senator Noone called for a debate on the issue of a directly elected mayor for Dublin and said the issue should be revisited by the Minister.  I am sure the Minister, when he gets his feet under the desk for a while, will return to this matter.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn spoke in regard to the benefit of the second Chamber.  We had that debate and I agree with him in this regard.  He also called for a progress report on the insolvency service legislation, as did Senator Hayden and others.  The Act will only have been in place for one year in September and I believe it would be good after a year to have a review and to amend the legislation, if necessary.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke called for clarification of the situation regarding a draft contract and the difference between a draft contract and a real contract.  With regard to the report of the health committee, we will certainly try to have that report debated in this House.  As part of the reform of this House, we have many excellent reports from various committees of the House which I believe should be debated.  We should also have the committee Chairmen in the House to listen and in order for us to comment on these reports.  I hope that will be part of the reforms of the House.<\/p><p>I do not propose to accept Senator Leyden's amendment to the Order of Business regarding the statutory instrument.  I note his points on the Middle East.<\/p> <p>Senator Hayden also called for a debate on the insolvency service.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh called for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to come to the House to speak on the management of rural transport and to debate the issue of taxis and rogue taxi drivers.  I presume the enforcement agencies should police that area, and I find it unacceptable that rogue drivers can operate and that the laws are not enforced.  I agree with the Senator on that and am sure it is an issue we can ask the Minister to deal with at a later stage.<\/p><p>Senator Keane commended the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on her performance at the UN.  In regard to the new directives reported in the press regarding restrictions on Garda drivers, I believe that what has been suggested is ludicrous.  If garda&iacute; chasing a criminal must stop at traffic lights, this will allow the criminal get away.  I am not sure this is the situation but, if it is, it seems ludicrous.  I am sure the Minister will take a look at that.<\/p><p>Senators Mullen, Daly and Byrne proposed amendments to the Order of Business in regard to introducing particular Bills, Nos. 19, 20 and 21 on the Order Paper.  I have no objection to these amendments to the Order of Business.  I would like to commend Members who put forward Private Members' Bills, but I would also like to ask Members whose items on the Order Paper are dead to remove them from it.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins spoke about leveraging assets of State agencies, particularly in regard to the health area.  I am sure this is something the new Minister will consider.  Senator Wilson congratulated the new Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Senator Heather Humphreys, who is from his constituency.  I am sure she will accept his advice in regard to Deputy Reilly.  He called for a review of education and training boards.  This is a matter I will raise with the new Minister for Education and Skills.  <\/p><p>Senator Conway called for another new Minister to come to the House - the Minister with responsibility for tourism - and mentioned the importance of festivals and of opening our homes and hearts to visitors.  I agree with him that this is what Ireland is supposed to be about.  He also commended businessman Michael O'Leary.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne spoke about his Bill, which relates to guidelines for wind farms.  The former Minister, Phil Hogan, was here last week and dealt with that issue.  However, it is the prerogative of  the Member to raise his Private Members' Bill as he wishes.  I wish him well in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Walsh raised the issue of human rights.  I already referred to the official representative on human rights.  I will try to find out what the situation is in that regard, and in regard to NAMA.  We expect two Bills before us this week relating to these issues and I am sure the Senator can make his points during those debates.<\/p><p>Senator O'Sullivan spoke about our new Commissioner and the importance of wearing the green jersey and supporting him in seeking the best possible position.  We should be uniting on this, as we have always done in the past.  I commend Senator O'Sullivan on his proposal and agree with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500009#H00500","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405428000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500010#J00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1405428000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>It is regrettable that some people do not support our nominee for the position of Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500010#J00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1405428000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Senator Leyden has moved an amendment to the Order of Business, \"That No. 69, motion No. 11, be taken before No. 1.\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500010#J00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1405428000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500010#J00500","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"vote","time":1405428000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 16; N\u00edl, 25.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Diarmuid Wilson; N\u00edl, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500010#J00600","aye":["1157","1116","1147","1159","1140","1128","1146","1122","1139","1127","1142","1154","1145","1155","1126","1164"],"nay":["1148","1138","1150","1165","1151","1124","1158","1130","1166","1160","1117","1172","1152","1135","1161","1132","1174","1118","1187","1153","1170","1129","1125","1163","1171"]},{"type":"speech","time":1405428600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, \"That No. 20 be taken before No. 1.\"  The Leader has indicated that he is prepared to accept it.

We were all wondering this morning which Ministers might attend the various debates.  <br \/>One might say it is a case of nitpicking to choose the word &quot;prevalent&quot; over &quot;present&quot;, but it is an important distinction to make.  It is interesting to look at the definition of &quot;prevalent&quot;.  One of the dictionaries I consulted included the definition &quot;having the superiority or ascendancy&quot;.  I am sure there might be legal connotations to the word &quot;prevalent&quot; as opposed to &quot;present&quot;.  What is at issue is the diversity of content in media.  We all share concerns, including the Minister, about the convergence of media.  I have even heard stories in the local media about more mergers and more local radio and television stations being taken over by larger companies.  We find that a number of players are taking over the media industry.  Diversity of content is extremely important in the circumstances, which is why we believe it would be better to refer to the broad diversity of views, including views on news, current affairs and cultural interests, that is &quot;present&quot;.  It would copperfasten the concerns of smaller groups in society, including those who believe they do not receive recognition.<br \/>There was an interesting petition before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions on an issue like this.  I understand RTE is considering conducting its own diversity consultation process on how it should approach the issue as a national broadcaster.  It might seem like a small amendment to make, but it would have far-reaching ramifications.  We are all aware of how diverse Irish culture has become in recent years.  If media moguls need only take cognisance of the prevalent cultural interest, they will take notice only of the superior or ascendant views, which are the views of those in power and the majority.  That is not acceptable.  Therefore, I ask that this minor amendment be taken on board in the spirit in which it is put forward to ensure we would have full diversity in the media and would not exclude minority groups in the definition of &quot;diversity of content&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500012#L01200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1405428900,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500012#L01300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1405428900,"counter":111,"content":"<p>We debated this proposal in the other House and on Committee Stage here.  It goes back to the recommendations of the mergers group which clearly used the term \"prevalent\".  This is about defining \"diversity of content\".  If one uses the word \"present\", it will require the itemisation of every single strand of thought and a decision on whether these strands are represented in the context of an individual media merger.  That would be impractical, whereas use of the term \"prevalent\" indicates that a judgment must be made.  This will be done through an advisory group which will advise the Minister and include broad consultation, including consultation with the Oireachtas.  Therefore, all parties will have the opportunity to express a view where it is considered a particular point of view is not being adequately represented or which might be jeopardised by a merger.<\/p><p>&quot;Present&quot; is far too fine a definition.  It would make it a very complex operation to decide what views were present in the first place, let alone to determine whether a merger would compromise them.  The provision was drawn up with good reason by those who had done the work and I am not disposed to move away from a practical approach which requires an exercise of judgment in an individual case as opposed to a broad indication of what is desirable in terms of diversity of content.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500012#L01400","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405428900,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the word proposed to be deleted stand&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405428900,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405428900,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<blockquote><br \/>In page 84, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:&quot;(<i>e<\/i>) all other goods sold in grocery goods undertakings,&quot;.<\/blockquote>Large retailers stock a vast array of products which are not covered in the Bill.

It was considered that we needed to regulate contracts in order that small suppliers in the groceries supply chain would be reasonably protected.  The process predominantly focused on food items.  We are not here to try to write draft regulations for every sector, which is what the Senator's amendment points towards.  There was an attempt to obtain a voluntary agreement in the sector, which failed.  Recognising the special position of the groceries sector, we moved to introduce the regulatory powers to insert into contracts certain provisions to protect the supply chain.  What the Senator suggests goes way beyond what we envisaged.  In all these other sectors general competition law protects players in the marketplace.  The provision at issue represents a specific response to a specific problem in the groceries trade.

The issue of franchises has two sides.  The individual operator who holds a franchise licence is the franchisee and the overall higher-level operator is the franchisor who operates and controls the franchise.  While the majority of individual franchisees are small operations with a turnover of less than &euro;5 million per annum, the parent franchisers are much bigger concerns with turnovers of over &euro;50 million and powerful purchasing powers.  It has already been agreed to remove the reference to franchises from the definition of \"related undertaking\" in a previous D&aacute;il Report Stage amendment as there was never an intention to cover the individual franchisees through the definition of \"relevant grocery goods undertakings\".  However, on the issue of the franchisors, these are intended to be covered by the definition of \"relevant grocery goods undertakings\".  Some franchisors consider themselves to be wholesalers, others to be retailers.  To ensure both scenarios are covered, the phrase which the Senators are seeking to delete in the definition of retailer is vital.  Without it, there is a danger that retailers could try to circumvent the regulations by operating franchise arrangements.  In light of the above, I cannot accept the proposed amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500013#M01200","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1405429500,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500013#M01300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1405429500,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500013#M01400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405429500,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405429500,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<blockquote><br \/>In page 85, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:&quot;(a) having regard to the importance of and impact to the economic viability and sustainability of primary producers the decisions made at processing and\/or retail level,&quot;.<\/blockquote>We discussed this at length on Committee Stage so I do not propose to go through it again.

It really boils down to what we can reasonably expect this legislation to do.  What we are seeking to do in this legislation is to regulate contracts between suppliers - typically smaller suppliers - and larger retailers or <i>vice versa<\/i>in the case of small grocery shops with larger wholesalers.  We cannot guarantee the viability of any individual player in such a contract arrangement.  The world changes and some businesses rise and some fall.  Some products produced by primary producers cease to be produced the way they were and some other product is adopted.  This goes back to what we are trying to achieve.<br \/>We are not trying to put a floor on prices, which some people have advocated.  One cannot do that.  One cannot allow any producer, by it large or small, to insist that it get a certain price.  That would not work in any marketplace.  What we are trying to do is put in a recognition of the importance of the sector but not in a way that seeks to deliver a particular outcome because we just could not do that.  What we are trying to do is regulate different relationships in the supply chain, &quot;hello money&quot;, abuse of promotional arrangements, unfair terms in respect of wastage or loss of products and suppliers who suddenly change the forecast use of a certain product and put all that back on the primary producer.  I know that representing the area he does, Senator O'Brien would know all about those difficulties.<br \/>That is what we are trying to achieve but we cannot pretend that we can deliver a certain outcome and make any particular enterprise viable and sustainable regardless of the marketplace.  What we are trying to do is put in a citation and this is the citation section of the piece.  It is against the broad objectives against which we decide the details of the regulation.  The citations must be realistic and open.  These are the policies and principles upon which the regulations will be based.  They must be reasonable.<br \/>While I can understand the motivation behind the amendment proposed by Senators O'Brien and Wilson, in practical terms, we must make do with more modest ambitions we can deliver through policy.  We are not in the business of trying to set prices that deliver outcomes in terms of the viability of a particular business.  That is beyond our ken, which is why the wording we chose was done carefully, having consulted with parliamentary draftsmen and got legal advice as to what sort of reasonable framework we can put in place based on the sort of policy instruments we are trying to develop here.

I do not propose to reiterate the many points I made on this issue last week.  I believe what I am proposing would go a long way to protecting the consumer and, in particular, our producers.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the large multiplies have a hold over the producer who has planted 50 acres of potatoes or 100 acres of carrots because they know the producers cannot dump them but need to sell them on.  This leads to our producers not getting a fair price and, often, getting a price that is below the cost of production.  This would be addressed if the Minister were to accept that retailers in this sector should produce their profits and, if they operate across different jurisdictions, show the price in one jurisdiction versus another.  I do not propose to labour the point any further as I spoke on it in great detail last week.  However, I do intend to push this to a vote.

They also raised the issue of the price they are paid for their produce and noted how they have been squeezed by the large multiplies locating here, resulting in their margins decreasing year-on-year while the price to the consumer has not decreased as much.  The producers feel they are being squeezed out of the market by ruthless retailers and large multiples and that their lifestyles and those of the small rural farmer have been seriously detrimentally affected by the manner in which the multiples operate in this jurisdiction.

The fact of the matter is that many small Irish businesses have gone to the wall because of the location of one-size-fits-all multiples on the outskirts of small Irish towns.  It would be helpful to the people of Ireland, in terms of openness and transparency and their knowing exactly what they are paying in reality for so-called cheaper goods, to know exactly how much money multiples are making in this country.

I do not think this is the way to go about dealing with the issue.  Beneath this there are legitimate concerns, some of which were identified by Senator Hayden.  For example, there are certain products that one can buy more cheaply in the UK than in Ireland from the same retailer.  According to the National Consumer Agency, which conducts surveys in this area, differentials have come down in recent times, although they still exist.  The issue is to what extent these differentials are justified.  The way one tackles this is not by seeking to place discriminatory rules of profit publication on individual sectors.<\/p><p>As stated by Senator Hayden in her commentary, we have to know what it is we are concerned about.  We cannot on one hand say that some retailers are charging too little and this is undermining the corner grocer and on the other hand say they are charging too much because their prices here are not as cheap as they are somewhere else.  The market dictates where price points arise.  Irish consumers should perhaps be more vigilant in terms of their choices.  It must also be accepted that consumers are under a great deal of pressure.  The evidence is that they are shopping more keenly and, in the grocery sector in particular, are shifting towards cheaper and discount outlets.  We cannot stop this and should not seek to do so.  What we need to do and what we are trying to do in terms of this legislation is to ensure that in the relationship between a producer and a large retail multiple the rules of engagement are fair.  The transparency we seek is in that contract being published, available for inspection by the Competition Commission and including certain fair play rules in the manner in which it deals with different elements, be that &quot;hello&quot; money, special promotions or anything else.  These are the matters for which we are seeking to provide.  We are not seeking to provide that there must always be a product margin of X in any particular good or service.  We cannot deliver that.  At the end of the day, this is a competitive market.<\/p><p>I know that Senator Darragh O'Brien is frustrated that he cannot move his amendment dealing with an ombudsman.  To be honest, the debate has moved on beyond the.  The ombudsman scenario arose when the intention was to have not regulations but codes of practice, all of which were to be on a scout's honour basis, with the ombudsman then adjudicating on whether there had been fair play and so on.  We made a decision a long time ago that a voluntary system was not going to be possible and that a regulatory system would be necessary.  The issue of who should ensure enforcement in the regulatory system and whether we should establish a new quango then arose.  Senator Barrett would be berating me today if I were to propose the establishment of a new consumer and competition commission in groceries while we already have a consumer and competition commission for every other sector.  We are not providing for an ombudsman for groceries because there is already a consumer and competition commission that deals with every sector.  We are not setting up a new agency to deal with one sector when the existing agency has all the powers, experience and so on to deliver what is required.  That is the thinking behind it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500014#N00400","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"vote","time":1405430100,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 11; N\u00edl, 30.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Diarmuid Wilson; N\u00edl, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500014#N00500","aye":["1147","1140","1128","1146","1139","1127","1142","1122","1154","1155","1164"],"nay":["1148","1157","1138","1150","1165","1151","1124","1158","1130","1166","1160","1117","1172","1152","1173","1135","1161","1132","1174","1134","1118","1187","1153","1169","1170","1129","1125","1145","1163","1171"]},{"type":"speech","time":1405430700,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<blockquote><br \/>In page 86, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:&quot;(2) The Commission may order such redress, including financial redress, for the aggrieved person subject to the breach of regulations as considered appropriate by the Commission having considered all circumstances.&quot;.<\/blockquote>In light of the Minister's response to this amendment on Committee Stage, I will withdraw the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500015#P00100","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405430700,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405430700,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 9:<blockquote><br \/>In page 86, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:&quot;(a) subject to a grocery goods undertaking choosing to enter into a contract, relevant grocery goods undertaking shall have a contract with a grocery goods undertaking for the sale or supply of grocery goods,&quot;.<\/blockquote>This legislation presents an opportunity to address some of the imbalances in terms of negotiating power that exist in the supply chain.

I pointed out on Committee Stage that some jurisdictions would state because of the nature of such retention of title clauses, they should be registered in order that other parties who might be trading with the same company would see these as registered liens, as it were, on what otherwise might be assets in an insolvency situation.<\/p><p>I can understand why Senator Darragh O'Brien is raising this matter but seeking to make retention of title compulsory is not the way to go.

Most of the issues were teased out on Committee Stage.  However, I still have concerns about certain aspects of the Bill.  I disagree with amendment No. 16 on the appointment of an independent ombudsman being ruled out of order.  Last Thursday I mentioned that there was an ombudsman's office in Britain that cost &pound;800,000.  It has a full-time ombudsman and three staff and operates in an economy much larger than our own.  I do not agree with the Minister's fundamental point that an ombudsman could only oversee guidelines or voluntary recommendations.  Following the Bill's passage, the ombudsman would oversee the operation of the legislation and the sector in question.  The amendment would have given the Bill teeth.  For example, the Financial Services Ombudsman, the Pensions Ombudsman and the Pensions Authority oversee their respective sectors through the use of legislation, not guidelines or recommendations.  I fail to see the Minister's point and disagree with the Leas-Chathaoirleach's decision in ruling the amendment out of order.  It would not have imposed a charge on the Exchequer; rather, I was seeking to have the cost met by the retail sector, as is the case in Britain.<\/p><p>Broadly, I am satisfied with the Bill, but I have grave concerns about specific aspects that relate to producers in the agriculture sector and the grocery trade.  The powers required to ensure fair play for consumers and producers are not fully enshrined in law.  My group will support the Bill in general, but the Minister should keep a watching brief on this matter.  He and his Department should be proactive in this regard and not wait until Christmas or Easter for a raft of below cost selling cases to hurt indigenous industries, family-owned businesses and quality producers in a race to the bottom.<\/p><p>I will not repeat the points I made on Committee Stage, but my job, as a legislator, is to make points on behalf of the people, employers and consumers as best as I can.  I commend the Minister for the great deal of work done on the Bill and congratulate him on the retention of his Ministry.  He has done a good job so far.  I ask him to keep a close watching brief on this crucial industry.  The Harvest 2020 strategy was produced by my colleague, Deputy Bendan Smith, and followed up by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  Agrifood is an important sector and, while we should not introduce protectionism, we should not be ashamed of trying to protect and grow it.

We will not oppose it, but we have raised our concerns.  I appreciate the Minister's statement that some of these cannot be addressed through the Bill, but I hope he will revert to the House with a number of solutions to these pressing issues.  He is the Minister with responsibility for jobs.  The agriculture sector, in particular, is concerned about indigenous jobs on farms.  There is no point in having jobs in the retail sector only to lose them in agriculture.  It is important that the Minister sit down with the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, to discuss this matter.<\/p><p>All of the farming interests were present at the meeting I attended on Friday evening.

The farming interests called for this issue to be re-examined.  The Minister might ask for evidence in order that he might act on it, but we were asked to raise this strong sense with the Government and it should be considered.  The farming interests' other major concern was related to the impact of some international agreements, particularly with Brazil and the mooted agreement between the European Union and the United States, on jobs on Irish farms.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the Bill is limited in what it can do, but perhaps the Minister might revert to us in the autumn on the issues we have raised and outline how the Government could support indigenous horticultural, meat or fish producers.

I was glad to see that the glowing tributes paid to him last week had made such an impression on the Taoiseach that he made the correct decision.<\/p><p>As the Minister had answered all of our points on Committee Stage, I did not resubmit amendments on Report Stage.  Regulatory capture, one of the issues we discussed, is a significant feature of the economy.  When I left on Thursday, an evening newspaper claimed that there had been no arrests in the clampdown on rogue taxi operators.  The taxi industry has achieved regulatory capture of its regulator to such an extent that we have had wild goose chases on the grounds that some taxi operators were tax dodgers - this was found not to be the case - social welfare fraudsters or, most recently, criminals.<\/p> <p>The Taxi Regulator must serve the consumer as well and that post has been captured.  <\/p><p>In terms of health insurance, I have always believed that it operates on behalf of the VHI and we ignore Supreme Court and European Court decisions here.  <\/p><p>Item 46 on the Order Paper is Senator Quinn's Bill, which I supported, on trying to open up that market.  If we are making health insurance compulsory then we have got to listen to the consumer sometimes.  In the court case I did not see any witnesses produced to attest to the fact that new entrants had refused cover to old people but I did see the State represented by the Department, the Health Insurance Authority and VHI which meant there were three sets of lawyers to prevent competition in the sector.<\/p><p>The energy sector was captured also and a 55% increase in the public service obligation has been mooted.  The bus sector will not be competitive for another 100 years, it happens in airports and our financial services sector is in an appalling state.  Setanta was another insurance company which we thought was licensed in Malta but the bill will be sent to the Irish consumer.  Strengthening, as the Bill does, the Competition Authority and consumer representation is most important and badly needed.<\/p><p>Some of the discussions have led to the invention of an ogre or bogeyman.  In hugely competitive areas such as the media - and I mentioned that there are over 400 producers - and groceries - despite claims by the rest of the House that it is not competitive but I side with Senator Quinn that these are highly competitive industries - the tests are new entrants and the absence of regulatory capture.  We have had new entrants in the groceries sector.  However, we have invented the bogeyman that these people sell below cost first, get rid of their competitors and then increase the prices afterwards.  I have waited for more years than I care to remember but the prices have not gone up and the industry's concentration is going down.  Sometimes when producer groups go to the Minister, as the representative of consumers, they attempt to use consumer legislation to get at other producers or new entrants.  The Minister should be very alert to that factor and it is also part of the Government's general concern about the activities of lobbyists.  The consumer should be the voice that he listens to, not producers saying they would like their competitors put out of the market and will call it bogus consumerism.  <\/p><p>The Minister is most welcome back and what he is doing to make the Irish economy more competitive is vital.  As stated several times in the Bill, we need the sheltered sector services to become more competitive because the vital sectors that created the 70,000 jobs over the past year, as mentioned by the Minister, must compete internationally.  They should be allowed to buy inputs at the best prices we can deliver.

Clearly, certain monopolies have them because the wider public interest must be served.  In the competition sector, generally, the right approach is the one we are taking and we are merging consumer and competition together which will make things better.  Whether it is an unfair term in a consumer contract or a barrier to entry, there is one authority with strong powers that will protect consumers.    <\/p><p>Obviously competition is never done.  If there are concerns about cartels anywhere in the economy the Competition Authority has ample powers that it is not afraid to use to pursue them.

Clearly, all trade agreements are give and take.  There are opportunities and problems in any trade agreement and that applies not least to the food sector.

This is a significant Bill, providing for the establishment of the strategic banking corporation of Ireland, or the SBCI.  By increasing the availability of longer-term flexible debt finance, which is appropriately priced, the establishment of the SBCI will provide SMEs with access to the type of patient intelligent capital that will increase productive investment, encourage growth and generate additional employment opportunities.  In this way, the SBCI will play a key role in reinforcing Ireland's economic recovery.<\/p><p>The Government recognises that SMEs are the backbone of the economy, employing nearly 70% of those at work.  A stable and appropriate supply of credit to the SME sector encouraging start-ups and enabling incumbent firms to grow is essential.  Regardless of the economic and financial cycle, there always will be structural problems in the market that constrain SMEs in accessing credit.  This is a feature of SME funding across the OECD.<\/p><p>The Government's medium-term economic strategy, MTES, sets out the ambition of developing a more diversified, competitive and responsive financial infrastructure that can finance growth in the SME sector as we move into a new phase of economic recovery and growth.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 builds on the previous plan and contains an integrated suite of measures and initiatives that are designed to enhance access to finance for micro, small and medium sized enterprises.  The establishment of the SBCI will be a key element in this evolving financial architecture and will build on and reinforce the concrete measures that the Government has already introduced to support employment and growth in the SME sector.<\/p><p>The establishment of the SBCI follows directly from the announcement by the Taoiseach in November 2013, when we successfully exited the EU-IMF programme, that he had held discussions with Chancellor Merkel to specifically find ways to reinforce Ireland's economic recovery by improving funding mechanisms in the real economy, including access to finance for Irish SMEs.  Consequently, officials from my Department of Finance, with the assistance from staff of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, have worked closely with KfW, the German Finance Minister and the European Investment Bank to establish the most appropriate way to maximise and sustain the benefits to Irish SMEs of this enhanced co-operation.<\/p><p>The SBCI will be established as a private company in the first instance.  Shares in the company will be owned by the Minister for Finance.  It is not intended that the shares will be sold at any time but, to ensure flexibility, the legislation sets out how the sale of the shareholding could be enabled if deemed necessary.  Although the initial operations of the company will focus on supporting SMEs, other strategic sectors could also be supported in the future.  With this possible expansion in mind, the company is being structured so that it is as flexible as possible.  The objective of the SBCI will be to increase the availability of loans of greater duration, with enhanced terms and potentially at a lower cost to the SME sector.  To achieve this objective, the SBCI will operate as a wholesale lender and will provide funds to other lending institutions, which will be required to transmit the benefits of the more favourable funding terms to their customers, the SMEs.<\/p><p>The strategic role of on-lending development institutions is a well-established model that is both effective and successful in other markets, such as Germany, Spain and France.  It will enable Irish SMEs to access the new finance from the earliest possible date.  On-lending institutions could include not only the Irish commercial banks but also foreign banks, specialist funds or other qualifying providers of finance.  Participants will be required to meet prescribed criteria that will be set by the SBCI to ensure that the on-lender can lend prudently to the targeted market.<\/p><p>The SBCI will provide funding to on-lending institutions that will enable them to offer SME loans of longer tenure - for example, five to ten years - and with more flexible conditions attached.  Examples of the latter are capital payment breaks or interest rate holidays.  This type of financing is an integral feature of the countries with robust and dynamic SME sectors.  It is essential for both growth and employment that the development of the Irish SME sector be supported in a similar manner.  The challenges facing SMEs in accessing credit are the product of a complete interplay of supply and demand factors.  The SBCI has been designed in a manner that addresses both of these elements.<\/p><p>The provision of a steady supply of low-cost funding from the SBCI should lower the barriers for entry for new providers of funding.  Less concentration and increased competition in the provision of financing will clearly be beneficial not only to SMEs but also to the wider economy.<\/p><p>The SBCI also has the potential to incentivise the demand for credit from SMEs.  By ensuring financing of a longer tenure and with more flexible conditions attached and that is potentially at a lower cost, the SBCI will provide an important signalling effect in regard to releasing any pent-up demand for finance from the SME sector.  The expanded pool of lending products, from a potentially broader range of credit providers, could also serve the needs of a wider cohort of SME customers than is presently served by current lending institutions.<\/p><p>A more stable supply of lower-cost funding from the SBCI will also assist in building confidence within the SME sector as it increases the certainty of financing to that sector, even in adverse financial market conditions.  The SBCI will be financed from the outset by a mix of finding from KfW, the European Investment Bank and the National Pensions Reserve Fund's directed portfolio for a period up to ten years.  The NPRF will provide &euro;10 million in equity capital and a loan facility of up to &euro;240 million, which can be converted to equity if necessary.  KfW and the European Investment Bank combined will more than match that amount and, therefore, the combination of the three initial sources of funding will provide a pool of over &euro;500 million for the SBCI to use in its start-up phase.  Further details will be released as and when the funding contracts with the European Investment Bank and KfW are finalised.  This can only occur once the SBCI has been established as a company.  In its initial phase, the loans from the SBCI will fund loans to SMEs for investment purposes.  The range of financial products available to the SME sector will grow during the first year of the SBCI&rsquo;s operations.<\/p> <p>We will work with the Eurpean Commission's Directorate General for Competition on this matter.  At one level, the SBCI will operate in a countercyclical manner in seeking to compensate for any constraints in the provision of financing to enterprises, particularly SMEs.  It will also operate with a broader development mandate which will enable it to channel investment towards key strategic sectors of the economy.<br \/>In the interests of ensuring adequate time for discussion, I will briefly outline the Bill.  It has seven parts.  Part 1 sets out the preliminary and general provisions, including the purposes of the Bill.  It also provides that costs directly attributable to the SBCI will be liabilities of the company itself.  Part 2 provides for the establishment of the strategic banking corporation of Ireland through the formation of a private company under the Companies Act which will be independent in carrying out its functions under this legislation.  It further allows the SBCI to form subsidiaries.  Part 2 also provides that the memorandum and articles of association of the SBCI will be consistent with the provisions of the legislation.  Part 2 also sets out the main functions of the company, limits the board to nine members and mandates the NTMA to provide it with any business support services it requires.<br \/>Part 3 sets out the funding arrangements of the SBCI, determines the authorised share capital and provides for the initial issue of shares.  The key points are that shares to the value of &euro;10 million for the Minister will be funded from the NPRF, authorised share capital will be &euro;250 million and never exceed &euro;1 billion, and a loan from the NPRF can be converted to equity if necessary.  It is not intended that all borrowings of the SBCI will need to be guaranteed by the State.  The part further provides that the Minister may dispose of shares in the SBCI as he or she sees fit.  It is not intended to use this provision, which is included for flexibility.  The SBCI's outstanding borrowings at any particular time will be limited to &euro;4 billion.  Part 3 also provides for an amendment to section 54 of the Finance Act 1970 to allow the Minister to engage in normal banking transactions with the new company.  This enabling provision is usual when creating a State entity which involves borrowing and funding from the Exchequer.  The Minister will be empowered to direct the NPRF commission to provide credit to the SBCI and to provide funding to it in respect of the subscription of the Minister's shares in the company.  The maximum amount of funding the SBCI can be given by the State will be &euro;5 billion.  Part 3 further allows the board of the SBCI to decide what dividends will be paid to the Minister.  It also provides that any dividends received by the Minister shall be paid into the Exchequer.<br \/>Part 4 provides for the issuance of guarantees by the Minister.  It gives the Minister the authority to guarantee any moneys borrowed by the SBCI up to a maximum of &euro;4 billion.  The details of any guarantee will be laid before the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is given.  Guarantees will only be used when specifically required to enable borrowings from external providers of loans by the SBCI.<br \/>Part 5 sets out how the company will be accountable to the public through the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  Part 6 provides that the Minister, the NTMA and the NTMA's employees and staff are not to be considered shadow directors under section 27(1) of the Companies Act 1990 or <i>de facto<\/i>directors of the SBCI.  It is intended that the board of the NTMA is covered here.  The provision ensures that the Minister and the NTMA can carry out their various other functions without their involvement in the SBCI constituting a block on their work.  Part 6 also provides that certain provisions of the Companies Acts will not apply to the SBCI.  The provisions in Part 6 of the Bill will ensure that the Minister's relationship with the SBCI will not prevent him or her carrying out any of his or her functions.  They will further avoid redundant reporting requirements in the administration of the SBCI.  Part 7 sets out a number of tax exemptions which will apply to the SBCI and any subsidiary wholly owned by it.  It will be valid as long as the Minister for Finance remains the sole shareholder and, therefore, sole beneficiary of such tax exemptions.<br \/>A robust, dynamic and innovative indigenous SME sector is key to ensuring sustained economic recovery and employment growth.  Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises need access to a steady and secure supply of credit if they are to fulfil their growth potential.  The proposed establishment of the SBCI builds on the measures and initiatives which have already been put in place by the Government to enhance SME access to finance and may be considered a milestone in our continued economic recovery.  By ensuring the provision of improved credit tailored to the business needs of enterprises, particularly SMEs, the SBCI will make an important contribution to stimulating economic activity, enhancing competitiveness and generating employment across the State.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500018#S00400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405433100,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Anything that goes some way toward improving the lot of the SME sector is welcome, but while the Bill is welcome, it is most inadequate.  In the programme for Government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised a strategic investment bank.  This is not a strategic investment bank.  It is not a bank and the Minister is not applying for a retail licence.  The Minister mentioned Chancellor Angela Merkel.  This was in his discussions with her.  Does the Bill represent the scraps from Chancellor Merkel's table given that she has not seen fit to follow through on the commitment given to the Minister for Finance and the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade?  That commitment was heralded as a seismic shift in the context of the split between banking and sovereign debt and as a matter of crucial importance for Ireland, which is what it would have been.  Is this being given by Germany because we are not getting the other deal?  I note from the Minister's recent comments that he does not feel we will get that deal.  Having said that and while I am not trying to pour cold water over the whole thing, there are valid questions to be asked and I welcome the fact that the Minister is here to present the Bill in person.<\/p><p>In the briefing note prepared by the Department of Finance and in the Minister's speech, reference was made to the potentially lower cost of funding.  However, will the Minister insist on and will the SBCI set conditions for the retail banks to which they give money?  I refer to loan terms and rates, the conditions applying to loans and the mark up for the banks.  The money will be put into the SBCI from three different sources and lent on through our retail banks.  Will we set conditions as to what the banks can do with the money and as to how much profit they can make?  I note the comments from ISME and Chambers Ireland in that regard.  While they have given the legislation a cautious welcome, there is concern that the banks will simply provide this funding to their blue chip customers.<\/p><p>We have an overall issue with debt and access to credit in the SME sector.  The Minister's note on the SBCI refers to &quot;more suitable terms and conditions&quot;.  Will we know what they are at the appropriate time?  I do not expect that to be set out on Second Stage, but how do we know that will be the position?  Will there be lower costs for the SME sector?  How will the Department and the SBCI itself track the money they give to Bank of Ireland or the AIB, for example, to establish what those banks are doing with it?  Will they track who the money is being lent to and the rates and terms of loans?  Will they track what clients and sectors are being lent to?  All of us, including the Minister before he came into government, have shared a great frustration that the banks were set targets which they would not meet.  There are question to be asked in this regard and we must ensure that the money, some of which is coming from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and some from KfW, which is fine, is lent for the purposes the Minister for Finance intends.  Is there any point in just giving money on more favourable terms to blue chip companies which can access credit elsewhere?<\/p> <p>If such a company is currently borrowing from Bank of Ireland, for example, but will now be able to avail of better rates from the same bank through this fund, will it be allowed to eat up large chunks of the funding?<\/p><p>I am not questioning in any shape or form the Minister's motives in bringing forward this legislation.  We are all agreed on the need to give further support to small and medium-sized enterprises.  That need is there because the banks have failed to fulfil their function in this regard.  Time and again they have missed the targets on business lending set by this and the previous Government.  My question then - I am certain it is valid, even if the Minister does not - is why we should have faith that they will do the right thing when it comes to this fund.<\/p><p>Will the Minister indicate whether it is his intention, either on a later Stage or after the legislation is passed, to introduce tighter regulation in regard to the operation of the strategic banking corporation of Ireland?  What level of reporting will he receive from the bank?  Will it be done on a quarterly basis, for instance, and will information on lending be sectoralised according to area of the economy, size of company and so on?  Will there be scope for any of these moneys to be used to restructure existing SME debt in cases where profitable and viable businesses are being strangled by the terms of their existing loans?  These are the questions we need answered before we can assess whether these proposals will work.  The Minister may not have all the answers today, but I hope he will be able to address some of them.  We all have genuine concerns as to whether we can trust the retail banks to lend this money into the sectors where it is needed.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned that new market players will be able to access the fund.  That is welcome.  However, what is the situation in respect of banks like Ulster Bank which are actively downsizing in the Irish market?  Will that particular bank be allowed to access these moneys while at the same time shutting down branches in this State and in Northern Ireland?  Is there any intention to require banks accessing this funding to give a commitment to the Irish market into the future?  I look forward to teasing out these issues on Second Stage and in due course by way of amendment.  I give notice of my intention to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500019#T00200","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405433700,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the Bill he is presenting to the House today.  We have all been calling for initiatives to ensure more funding is put into the market more quickly, which is what this legislation seeks to do.  The only criticism I have is that it would have been better to have enacted these provisions sooner.<br \/>The SBCI will essentially function as a wholesale bank, sourced from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, European Investment Bank, KfW and potentially other sources, charged with lending moneys to the retail banks, which will, in turn, lend to SMEs.  Inability to access credit remains a problem in the Irish market.  To give a small example, a man came to see me the other day who was looking to purchase a quad bicycle for his farm.  More paperwork was needed for the &euro;5,000 loan he was seeking than he was required to complete for a &euro;200,000 loan he took out seven or eight years ago.  That type of thing is not conducive to business.  It is a minor example but indicative of what is happening.<br \/>I am not much concerned about which of our retail banks have access to the moneys that will be available from this fund, but I am concerned about how they will administer the funding.  For example, will there be a ceiling on the margin they may charge per loan?  Will there be any requirement regarding the differential between the interest rate charged by the SBCI to the retail banks and the rate they subsequently pass on to business customers?  If a business falls into arrears or default, at what stage will the retail bank be told that it is not allowed to overcharge beyond a fixed figure?  If the Minister does not have the answer today, we might discuss it further on Committee Stage.  We all know of too many examples of banks overcharging while, on the other hand, they are never slow in telling customers to read the fine print.  I do not know if such is possible, but I would like to see a ceiling put into the legislation whereby banks would not be permitted to engage in overcharging.  Such a provision would give absolute certainty to businesses where they are seeking a loan over, say, ten years.  In a context where the retail banks will be getting the benefit of a very low rate, my concern is that they will take the opportunity to do what they have done on too many occasions, namely, fail to act honourably where a business is experiencing a cash-flow problem or other difficulty.  It should not be an option for the banks to use this fund to overcharge customers.<br \/>Following on from the point made by Senator O'Brien, 70% of jobs in this country are attached to an SME.  I consider my own business, which has a full-time staff, to fit into the category of SME.  The impression I am getting - it is a welcome one - is that this fund is mostly intended to assist smaller rather than larger SMEs.  After all, the latter are capable of getting funding for themselves, while the situation can be much more difficult for smaller firms with one or two staff or whose owners are drawing only a small salary for themselves and perhaps one family member.  Would it be possible - again, I do not expect the Minister to have the answer today - to define what is an SME for the purpose of this legislation?  Is it a company with fewer than five staff, for example, or a firm with a turnover of less than &euro;200,00?  I do not have a fixed view on what the definition should be, but I would like to know whether including such a definition is feasible.  If it is, it would be a way of targeting SMEs with smaller turnovers and fewer staff, that is, the businesses most in need of this type of support.  Such a provision, if doable, would be a good day's work.<br \/>On assuming office the Minister for Finance took over not just a poisoned chalice but an unholy grail, but he has done a superb job in seeking to clean up the banking sector.  The bedding in of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and National Asset Management Agency has helped us to get back in order, together with other policy directions he has taken.  I am satisfied he is doing the right thing, too, in this case.  The State does not need to go back into an ICC or ACC scenario, with the costly establishment of institutions and premises around the country.  The retail sector is already there and will be given the opportunity to access these moneys.  Having said that, I would like the controls associated with this initiative to be sharp controls.  We must ensure there is no opportunity for chicanery - a word I often use in reference to the banks - in the operation of the fund.  We do not need to go hiring people and establishing another banking structure.  The pillar banks are there, as well as Ulster Bank and potentially other players who may enter the banking sector in the medium term.  There is also the possibility of mergers in the future.<br \/>I welcome this legislation.  We must ensure the right people get the opportunity to borrow at a low cost over a specified period.  Such an arrangement will give certainty to everybody in business, whether theirs is a very small SME or a larger company.<\/p> <p>I will leave it at that.  If the Minister does not have the answer to these questions now, perhaps he will deal with them on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500020#U00200","speaker":"1160","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405434300,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The deadline for submitting amendments was 1 p.m., so if some of the amendments I have submitted have been answered in the Minister's speech, it is because I did not know what was going to be in his speech.<\/p><p>What the Minister is doing is important.  We know our banking system was not fit for purpose and that it had the faults Senator D'Arcy has just mentioned.  When we look at how the loan book evolved from approximately 1998-2000 to the time the banks went to the Department of Finance to be bailed out, we see that one of their bigger faults was that they were obsessed with property, financial intermediation and personal lending.  The loan books show that hardly any of the extra money went to either industry or agriculture.<\/p><p>Has the corporate culture of Irish banking changed?   In addition to reducing the high cost base to which Senator D'Arcy referred, can we stop the banks using the Minister's money this time around to do a repeat performance of what they did the last time?  I do not know how we can cure the banks' obsession with property, financial intermediation and personal lending.  Do they know anything about small and medium enterprises?  Have they divorced themselves so completely from small industry that they will not know it when it comes seeking the lending the Minister proposes in this Bill?<\/p><p>The Minister said in his speech that the Bill tries to iron out the cycles of mad lending in the Irish banking system, where there were huge rates of increase in the supply of credit for those areas I mentioned.  This destroyed the environment in which small and medium enterprises try to operate.  What counter-cyclical measures can be invoked or to what was the Minister referring in his speech?  On the purpose of the Bill, the Minister seeks to address the compelling need to facilitate the availability of suitable credit in the economy of the State, and we commend that.  However, do we need to avoid pro-cyclical lending policies?  How can we restrain such policy, because it was undoubtedly a feature of what got us into so much trouble.  Do we have investment appraisal expertise in the Department, which will supervise this new strategic bank, and in the banks, given they made such a shambles during the boom period when they went on a large investment spree?  The expertise that can be brought in from KfW and the European Investment Bank will be important in that regard.  On page 6 of his speech, the Minister mentioned the counter-cyclical manner in which the corporation will operate.  I will be interested to hear what mechanism will be used to ensure this when the Minister is back for Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I note that the Comptroller and Auditor General will be involved and believe this is important.  We must get to a culture of accountability and value for money and we must find out where mistakes were made and correct them.  During his time in opposition, the Minister was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is a pity that the expertise in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is used after a disaster has happened and it will be good to get his involvement at the beginning.  He will have a pretty good idea of where things can go wrong, because he will have examined many cases in the past where they did go wrong and seen what lessons should have been learned.<\/p><p>The last page of the Minister's speech deals with tax exemptions.  Will these exemptions be allowed continue in the general reform of corporate taxation.  I am against tax exemptions in principle, on the basis that a single, low rate of corporate tax across the board is better than building in more exemptions.  The Minister also mentioned a steady and secure supply of credit.  This means the corporation must act in a counter-cyclical kind of way.  It must not have the faults of the banking system which we have already mentioned.  It must avoid a property fixation.  If any of this money ends up in the property sector, that will further restrict the development of small and medium enterprises.  We spend too much money buying and selling houses and farms to and from each other.<\/p><p>Section 11 provides that the Minister shall be sole shareholder, but is there any scope for having other partners in this operation?  The Bill provides     under subsection 11(6)(b) that the Minister &quot;shall without delay subscribe for those shares&quot;.  Might the Minister also have the option to seek market funding, to try to create a market and persuade Irish banks to lose their property fixation and join him in this project?  I welcome the fact the Minister will lay these documents before both Houses of the Oireachtas and commend him on that.<\/p><p>Do we have the expertise to do this?  We certainly need expertise.  The explanatory memorandum states: &quot;We will seek to encourage effective competition in the provision of credit in the State.&quot;  This is important and should dilute the impact of the pillar banks, but how will we ensure it happens?  This is a question I would like an answer to during Committee Stage.<\/p><p>What the Minister is doing is important as our banking system is still not fit for purpose and is remarkably slow to learn lessons.  In addition, it still has a remarkably high cost base.  The executives of State-owned banks bailed out by the State insist on paying themselves multiples of what the Taoiseach earns.  I hope this new body will not follow suit, because we are trying to get the Irish economy competitive again.  The banks are the core of our problem, but we will try to address that in the inquiry into the banking system.  <\/p><p>This Bill is a good response to the issue of the banks and I look forward to developing my points further on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500021#V00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1405434300,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and welcome this Bill which will be a central plank in providing SMEs with access to funding.  Senator D'Arcy said that one criticism of the Bill is that it is only now coming before us.  It is a pity we did not have it a year or two ago, but the fact we had no money is probably the answer to that criticism.<\/p><p>It is worth reminding ourselves that 70% of people working in the Irish economy are employed in the SME sector and anything we can do to support the sector must be welcomed.  SMEs face structural difficulties and problems in accessing finance that larger corporate companies do not face.  Last year, after the Taoiseach announced this proposal in talks with Angela Merkel, it was decried by many and they described it as a second bailout.  There was all sorts of nonsensical talk and the SBCI was greeted by some commentators and some Members here as a bad thing.  I hope those who were negative at that time will reflect on what we are doing through this Bill and agree it is necessary and should be welcomed.  However, we will not dwell on the past.<\/p><p>Senators Barrett and O'Brien have made most of the comments I would like to make, so I will not repeat them, but I have some other comments to make.  The Minister said in his speech that the maximum amount of SBCI funding that can be given by the State is &euro;5 billion.  How and why did the Minister arrive at that particular figure?  Senator Barrett has spoken a lot about the corporate banking culture. <\/p> <p>I share all of his concerns about this matter.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions for the Minister.  What mechanism will the SBCI put in place to ensure the retail banks lend to SMEs?  Will it use a dual assessment structure to monitor how the banks lend money?  If, in the context of a bank's own lending criteria, an SME is considered to be an unattractive risk, will it be automatically debarred from borrowing money under the scheme proposed in the Bill?  Will there be two mechanisms in place to allow people to borrow money or will it be a single mechanism?  How will the position be regulated in order to ensure the banks are actually lending?  Is there a danger that this new structure will displace any of the financial products already available from the retail banks?  Is there a risk that it might be perceived to be against a bank's interests to lend money under the SBCI scheme at a rate that is lower than that which applies to its own products?  I accept that there may not be a risk in that regard and that there may be no concerns about this matter.  However, if there is a risk, what mechanism will be available, either under the legislation or by means of regulations, to ensure the banks will lend the money as intended?<\/p><p>I will not repeat what previous speakers stated.  The Bill is very welcome, but there are some concerns about what is proposed, particularly as the retail banks have not covered themselves in glory in the past seven or eight years.  I was approached recently by several people who run their own small businesses and outlined how difficult it was for them to access credit from the retail banks.  When representatives from the banks come before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, they state there is no problem at all, that their lending rates are fine and that they are meeting all of their targets.  The Central Bank of Ireland appears to agree with them, yet the reality for certain customers seems to be at variance with this.<\/p><p>The Bill makes provision for a very welcome initiative that will give support to SMEs.  Perhaps the Minister might outline his opinions on the points I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500021#V00300","speaker":"1117","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405434900,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Bill, but we believe it could have been stronger and better designed.  We are concerned about that fact that even though it has taken a great deal of time for us to reach this point, the Bill is being rushed through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad prior to the summer recess.  We are not happy about this.  I am aware that the D&aacute;il only discussed the first couple of amendments on Committee Stage before the guillotine was applied.  We have an issue with this, particularly in view of the importance of the legislation and the intention behind it.<\/p><p>A number of other speakers have also raised concerns about the content of the Bill.  Reference was made to the commitment in the programme for Government to the establishment of a strategic investment bank.  We know that the SBCI will not be a bank.  This is because banks require banking licences and the SBCI will not have one.  The corporation will obtain money at low rates of interest from the EIB and the KfW and then lend it to the retail banks in the hope they will pass it on.  This is something of a convoluted way of supplying credit to Irish businesses and there are fears about whether it will work.  Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned about the lack of adequate safeguards in the context of ensuring the cheaper credit being made available will reach SMEs in the real economy.  People seriously distrust the banks, rightly so.  There should be stronger safeguards in place.  Banks which do not pass on the cheaper credit in an equitable way should be punished in some fashion.  We are informed that the SBCI will operate along the same lines as Germany's KfW.  As has been stated, however, the Bill does not allow for direct lending by it into the real economy.  The Bill is lacking in this regard.<\/p><p>The Bill allows for the guaranteeing of investments without D&aacute;il approval.  That is a bad way of doing business and a mechanism which would hold those involved more responsible should be put in place.  The Bill focuses very much on the SME sector, which is both right and good, because the sector is the most important in the State in the context of providing employment.  Prominent economists have speculated on the likely outcome of the unravelling of SMEs that are overburdened with debt.  The Central Bank has set targets for the banks in the context of debt restructuring, but, unlike those relating to mortgage arrears, these are kept secret.  These targets should be made public and banks which are not doing enough should perhaps be named and shamed.<\/p><p>I am a firm believer in stimulating the economy and in State-led investment.  In that context, I welcome the steps being taken in the legislation.  As stated, however, I am disappointed that more has not been done.  There is a need for a strategic investment bank to lend directly into the real economy.  I again welcome the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500022#W00200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1405434900,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I welcome both the Minister and the legislation.  We all have experience of dealing in our localities with small businesses which have been endured an extremely tough time in recent years as a result of the downturn in trade and the lack of credit available to facilitate refinancing and development.  The new strategic investment fund which will make an initial amount of &euro;500 million available for the SME sector is aimed particularly at small and medium enterprises and will be delivered through existing financial institutions, that is, the banks and other financial entities which qualify for participation.  The SBCI is modelled on systems which operate in various other European countries and which have been shown to work successfully, particularly in Germany.<br \/>It is clear from the regulatory impact analysis that the proposals contained in the Bill constitute the most suitable vehicle for the delivery of credit to small and medium enterprises.  The involvement of the German financial institution, KfW, in the scheme is the positive outcome of negotiations between the Taoiseach and the German Chancellor.  The moneys it will provide, in addition to those from the European Investment Bank and the National Pensions Reserve Fund, will ensure the availability of low-cost funding to the SBCI for the next ten years.  Fixing low rates for the next ten years will be of huge benefit to those SMEs in receipt of loans and also reduce the risk involved in seeking finance.  The ability to lent these moneys, the inclusion of initial capital breaks and longer repayment periods than those currently available are all huge positives.  The European Investment Bank has released a statement in which it warmly welcomes the establishment of the SBCI.<br \/>I wish to comment on a matter which was reported in last Friday's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  It appears that Opposition Members in the D&aacute;il, including, I am surprised to say, Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly who knows more about these matters than any of the others quoted, roundly criticised the legislation in terms of the speed of its passage through the D&aacute;il.  The article to which I refer also contained an allegation regarding potential liabilities of &euro;4 billion in State guarantees.  Let us be clear about this matter.  Since the Government came to office, the Opposition has been shouting for money we did not possess to be invested in various areas of the economy, including that to which the Bill relates.  As a result of the excellent fiscal discipline displayed during the past three years, the Government has been able to devise a scheme which will lead to the investment of funds which are sorely needed in the SME sector.  I will say this clearly in order that there will be no misunderstanding: the banks and other financial institutions which act as on-lenders have a responsibility to assess the risk in lending the moneys being made available.  It is they, not the State, that will carry the risk.  After Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly's reported criticism last week, he obviously had a change of heart and produced what can only be described as a litany of praise for the actions of the Government in this matter in an article he wrote for the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>.  The article did not contain one word about the speed with which the legislation had been passed in the D&aacute;il.  However, it did contain an acknowledgement that &quot;Critically, these on-lenders will bear the risk of the loans to the SMEs, minimising the risk to the public money&quot;.<br \/>I very much welcome the legislation, particularly the contribution it will make to the retention and creation of jobs in the domestic economy.  I look forward to its speedy enactment and the provision of much-needed credit for the SME sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500022#W00300","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1405434900,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  I thank the Minister for facilitating a briefing session with his officials this morning.  I found the session extremely useful in that we had the opportunity to put some of the queries we had about the legislation to the officials.<\/p><p>One of the queries I have about the Bill relates to whether it targets start-ups.  I accept that it is targeting successful businesses.  Any lender will consider the position of an existing and successful business and lend money to it.  What we need to do, however, is encourage start-ups.  I am not sure how we will do this, but I would like to rest assured that we have the means at our disposal to measure what is required.<\/p><p>SMEs claim that they were not made aware of the schemes introduced on previous occasions.  To what extent can we make them aware of the schemes available, particularly that being established under the Bill?  Would it be possible to provide a simple online facility by which they might check what is happening?  I am sure there are plans to provide such a facility and it would be a wise move.<\/p><p>Another matter which arises relates to the need for transparency.  Private banks received money in the past, but was it always passed on?<\/p> <p>How do we ensure this time that the money will be passed on to those who need it?  In this case, I am arguing strongly for start-ups rather that existing businesses because they are already successfully getting money comparatively easy.  Will a deadline in respect of the time within which a decision must be made be imposed or will people be left hanging on endlessly awaiting a decision, which appears to be one of the difficulties in this area?  Some years ago, I was involved in setting up a bank which did not succeed.  However, one of our ambitions at that time was to ensure that when a person came into the supermarket and applied for a loan he or she would know before reaching the check-out whether the loan had been approved.  This was an attempt to copy what was being successfully done in America.  However, it did not succeed.<\/p><p>Will this money be available for use by credit unions or is that out of the question?  I note this was not mentioned in the Minister's speech.  Perhaps there is no room for the credit unions to get involved in this area.  Perhaps also they do not need this money.  In regard to credit, I believe we can do even more with AVCs.  I was very happy when the Minister made the decision to allow people access to some of their pensions and additional voluntary contributions.  This is a way of releasing cash into the economy which, in turn, helps people and businesses to survive.  Anecdotally, it appears to have been a massive success, in respect of which I congratulate the Minister.  Could consideration be given to extending this initiative?  I suggest this on the basis of Denmark having allowed people access to their pensions and thereby boosted its GDP by 1% to 2%.  Imagine the effect if we could do that here.  I would welcome if the Minister could consider this.  I note there was also no mention by the Minister of crowd funding.  Perhaps it does not arise in this context.  I am an enthusiast for crowd funding.  There are some great stories of business start-ups on that basis.  <\/p><p>Setting up a business in Ireland is difficult in terms of the amount of time and effort involved in visiting the many places required in this regard.  In New Zealand, this can be done all in one day via a website.  I would like to encourage this practice.  I believe it would be a step in the right direction.  The aim of what is proposed should be to encourage start-ups rather than assist existing successful businesses.  I believe what is proposed will be successful if focused in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500022#W00400","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405435500,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their thoughtful contributions and general support for the Bill.  The establishment of the strategic banking corporation of Ireland by increasing the availability of longer-term flexible debt finance which is appropriately priced will provide SMEs with access to the type of patient intelligent capital that will increase productive investment, encourage growth and generate additional employment opportunities.  In this context, the company will be supportive of domestically-focused and export-oriented SMEs.  It is intended that the company will have a role in tackling supply-side issues facing SMEs' access to finance and attempt to tackle demand-side issues.  SMEs will now be reassured that their needs are being catered for and that the SBCI will be in place to cover their needs into the future.  This should have the effect of releasing pent-up demand.  The provision of loans that are designed to meet the customised needs of SMEs should also incentivise demand and build confidence in the SME sector, thereby encouraging investment in growth and employment.<\/p><p>Commentators have pointed out that liquidity in the Irish SME credit market is in general not a particular issue.  However, this assertion extends only as far as the credit product types that incumbents are willing to offer.  Longer-term debt finance is relatively hard to come by in the Irish SME credit market and the SBCI will be addressing this shortfall in liquidity or absence of particular product types.<\/p><p>The strategic banking corporation of Ireland is being established as a private company but will operate with a strong public policy mandate in terms of providing additional finance to the SME sector, stimulating economic activity and contributing to the economic well-being of the State.  As a wholesale lender, providing funds to on-lending institutions, the SBCI will enhance the supply of funding by using existing channels and encouraging new entrants into the market.  New entrants are not restricted to foreign banks coming in to compete with the existing banks but could be other traditional providers of credit who would expand their operations or find entirely new ways of delivering credit in the Irish market.<\/p><p>The strategic banking corporation of Ireland will seek to distribute its funding across multiple on-lenders in an effort to both diversify its portfolio of front-line lenders and also to enhance competition in the market place.  Its relationship with on-lenders will be vital to its effectiveness.  Consequently, a number of requirements will be imposed upon the on-lenders to ensure that they use funding for SME financing and to fulfil the purposes of the legislation.  These conditions will ensure that the actual benefits of the funding arrangements provided by the SBCI are clearly passed on to the ultimate end user, namely, the SMEs.  The strategic banking corporation will demand from existing lenders and other new entrants that all funding drawn down is either used as intended or returned to the SBCI.  The reporting requirements set by funders of the SBCI in conjunction with the nature of the lending agreements with on-lenders will also provide the SBCI and the Department of Finance with sufficient data and information to enable them to analyse and explore the effectiveness of the SBCI in terms of financing SMEs.  This information will be utilised to inform and shape ongoing product development to ensure that customised financing needs of SMEs continue to be met by the SBCI.<\/p><p>A key function of the SBCI is to finance projects which promote economic development.  It is also possible for the SBCI to provide, via on-lending institutions, financing to social and environmental projects that enhance economic development, provided they present the on-lender with reasonable repayment prospects.  At the same time, it is important to recognise that the SBCI, in conjunction with NewERA, and the soon to be established ISIF, will collectively provide a more robust infrastructure for financing productive investment in the real economy, thereby contributing to more sustainable long-term economic and employment growth.  Achieving this type of economic and employment growth will provide not only economic but also social and environmental benefits to the country and its citizens.<\/p><p>To establish a company which can enter into agreements with the international providers of finance and the on-lenders in the Irish SME market, we first need enabling legislation.  Waiting until the autumn semester to commence or complete that legislation would effectively mean that the work that needs to be done in establishing the company could not proceed until September at the earliest and the sequential actions which follow that, such as establishment of a board, hiring of staff, signing of agreements with the international lenders, establishing internal operations, signing agreements with the on-lenders and awareness raising initiatives, could not commence until October or thereabouts.  It was decided, therefore, to expedite this enabling legislation so that additional and enhanced lending to SMEs would be facilitated in this year and without delay.<\/p><p>The SBCI will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and will also be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts on the effectiveness of its operations.  It will later be included as a new body to be covered by the new freedom of information regime.  I am working with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, on this.  I consider that these provisions are sufficiently broad to ensure effective public oversight of its ongoing operations.<\/p> <p>Under the legislation, the Minister of Finance is to be the sole shareholder in the SBCI.  It is not our intention that the shares will be sold or disposed of any time.  The SBCI will be a key element in the future financing of the real economy and contributes to our stated ambition of creating a more diversified, competitive and responsive financial infrastructure that can finance growth in the SME sector as we move into a new phase of economic recovery and growth.  <\/p><p>State-sponsored development or promotional institutions are an integral part of the financial architecture in other countries such as Germany, Canada, France and Spain and it is recognised that they will continue to play a key role in the financing of many economies in years to come.  My Department has contacted a number of similar institutions throughout Europe and exchanged information with an OECD research team on the subject of development institution models.  Using this information on the models used in other jurisdictions and the products available elsewhere, the SBCI will be customised and tailored to the Irish market.<\/p><p>It is important that SMEs in Ireland have access to similar financial products that are available to comparative enterprises in competitor states otherwise they will be operating at a serious competitive disadvantage.  With its concentrated focus on improving the supply and availability of financing to the SME sector, the SBCI ensures that Ireland will have in place a stable State-sponsored financial institution capable of supporting long-term investment in that sector. <\/p><p>An interdepartmental policy group known as the State Bodies Group chaired by my Department will play a role in ensuring that the SBCI can be linked into other Government initiatives aimed at improving access to finance in the economy.  Many of the State bodies involved have been examining the effectiveness of their individual schemes.  It is intended that where a link between the SBCI and such schemes is possible and would be beneficial or create synergies, the Departments and agencies involved would work with the SBCI.  Microfinance Ireland has met with the SBCI project already with this in mind and will liaise further on possible link ups.<\/p><p>I do not intend for the SBCI to receive blanket exemptions from Central Bank regulation.  The company will not conduct banking business at the start of its operations.  It can bring about benefits to the economy by being established as outlined and can expand its operations to other areas in the months and years to come.  The legislation is flexible and facilitates this anticipated growth.  Should the company commence or seek to commence any activities which are ordinarily regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, we intend for the SBCI to be treated no differently from any other company and it would, therefore, need to engage fully with the relevant authorities before commencing such operations.<\/p><p>A robust, dynamic and innovative indigenous SME sector is key to ensuring sustained economic recovery and employment growth.  The establishment of the SBCI builds on the measures and initiatives that have already been put in place by this Government to enhance SME access to finance and can be considered to be a major milestone in our continued economic recovery.  As a State-sponsored private company, the SBCI is mandated to provide additional credit that is tailored to the business needs of SMEs.  In carrying out its core functions, the SBCI will make an important contribution to stimulating economic activity, enhancing competitiveness and generating employment opportunities for people across the State. <\/p><p>Some specific queries were raised by Senators.  Senator Quinn asked whether it would help start ups and the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.  It may help start ups or credit lines may be used to expand existing companies.  An online tool has been launched and collects in one location all Government supports for SMEs.  It can be accessed on the Department of Finance website.  It is also being sponsored by the local enterprise offices.  One can go to a local enterprise office, access this online and all the assistance available to SMEs will be there on a very user-friendly way.  It has already had several thousand hits and has been of benefit to SMEs.  <\/p><p>Crowd funding may also be supported.  The SBCI will examine that when it is up and running.  The Credit Review Office and the lessons from KfW will inform the setting of deadlines for decisions regarding SMEs.  Credit unions are not excluded and can be considered for funding at a later time.  If the SBCI is happy, it can work with them and the Registrar of Credit Unions concurs.  That will be kept under review but it is not envisaged at the initial start-up phase.  <\/p><p>In response to Senator Barrett, the Department will try to flexible in addressing amendments submitted to the Bills Office even if they come in after the deadline.  We will stop the clock or do some of those initiatives that develop from Brussels.  We will get the Senator's amendments in if we can.  KfW and the European Investment Bank do not want their funding being used for property development so it is not envisaged that it will be used for this purpose.  <\/p><p>In response to Senator Michael D'Arcy, rates between the SBCI and the on-lenders will be passed on to the SMEs.  Under DG Competition rules and the SBCI's intention, banks or on-lenders will contractually be obliged to pass on all of the benefits of funding from the SBCI to the end customer.  An SME is defined in the legislation.  We will aim for small and medium-sized companies but the SBCI will help all SMEs.  A total of 90% of loans in Ireland are for less than &euro;10,000.  <\/p><p>In response to Senator Gilroy, &euro;5 billion from the State is a cap, not a target.  It is made up of &euro;1 billion maximum from equity and &euro;4 billion maximum from lending.  It is not intended that the State would fund all of that but, again, flexibility is built in.  We looked at comparable investment funds across Europe and strategic investment banks.  In proportion to the GDP of certain countries, &euro;4 billion to &euro;5 billion would be the appropriate comparable balance sheet cap on a strategic investment bank here. <\/p><p>In respect of the actual mechanisms, the money will come from KfW and the European Investment Bank in the first instance but also from our strategic investment fund.  Obviously, interest rates fluctuate but at present, it would be coming at a margin of about 25 basis points so the interest rate is very low, which is one of the major advantages of getting money from KfW.  The second advantage is that the typical SME going into Bank of Ireland or AIB will apply for working capital which is probably renewed annually.  Alternatively, the SME may have to reapply at the end of the year.  Again, it can get term loan arrangements but it might be two or three years.  It is very hard for an SME in Ireland to get money from anywhere between five and ten years yet if one is carrying out a strategic expansion of a company, that is what one needs.  One of the big flaws in Ireland is that when SMEs reach a certain size, they either get stuck there or if they are in the modern economy involving any of the modern technologies, they tend to be sold on.  Quite frequently, one finds that a very successful SME in Ireland reaches a certain point of development and a US multinational buys it.  Sometimes, it transfers its intellectual assets offshore and we lose it to the economy.  We will be very conscious of that.  The advantages are not just the availability of cheap money but also the fact that there would be a range of products tailored for the start up and expansion of the SME sector and that in the Irish context, it would have novel lending terms of between five and ten years.  <\/p><p>As well as that, KfW, upon whose experience and advice we rely quite a lot, has interest rate holidays.  If one decides that one will expand one's company, quite clearly, one's business plan would not say that the company would be profitable until perhaps year three or four.  If one can gear the credit product so that one can be carried for the first two and a half or three years at which point the interest rate repayments come in at a slightly higher level when the company is profitable, one can see the advantage of that and the encouragement that gives to a company to expand.<\/p> <p>Of course, we all have the interest that companies would expand so there is more growth in the economy and, consequently, more jobs created.  That is the range of advantages.<\/p><p>The legislation provides that the fund may lend directly and it does not exclude this.  Whereas the initial model will be on lending through the commercial banks or through new lenders, the idea of lending directly is not excluded, and I would see it growing into that.<\/p><p>I believe this is a very significant initiative and I am delighted it has received such support here today.  I believe people will look back on this in 20 years time and see it as a landmark decision.  This will be like the founding of the IDA or one of the successful State agencies and it will be seen as one of the big initiatives that grew the economy.  We are very grateful to our colleagues in the European Investment Bank, to the German authorities through KfW and to our own Ireland Strategic Investment Fund for getting involved in this.  I know there are many other questions of detail that Senators would like to get into but we can do that on Committee Stage and Report Stage.  Generally, I recommend the Bill very strongly and I hope it will be as successful as I believe it will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500023#X00200","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405436700,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405436700,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Wednesday, 16 July 2014.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1405436700,"counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500025#Z00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1405436700,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I welcome to the Visitors Gallery Mr. Eoin Gahan, senior fellow and very distinguished member of the Kennedy School at Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500025#Z00500","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405436700,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.35 p.m. and resumed at 4.50 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014: [Seanad Bill amended by the D\u00e1il] Report and Final Stages","time":1405437000,"counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500026#BB00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1405437000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, to the House.

This is a technical amendment.  When the provisions in section 34 relating to &quot;replacement schemes&quot; were deleted a reference in section 23(8) to a &quot;replacement scheme&quot; was overlooked in error and ought also to have been deleted on that occasion.  This amendment made that deletion.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 4 relates to section 34.  I know that this section attracted considerable debate and discussion in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  The section deals with superannuation schemes in the State airport authorities and also contains provisions to facilitate amendments, by the trustees, to the Irish airlines superannuation scheme.  There were several substantial amendments made in the Dail, some of which reflect points made by Senators on earlier Stages.  I will highlight these for the House.<\/p><p>Section 34 was restated in its entirety to provide for greater clarity.  The original section 32A, which is to be inserted into the 1998 Act, was divided into two separate sections.  These are now the new sections 32A and 32B.  To address concerns raised in this House regarding the power provided to employers in the scheme to unilaterally withdraw their members from the IAS scheme, the provisions dealing with &quot;replacement schemes&quot; have been deleted.  In addition, the three subsections which referenced Cork Airport in the context of new pension arrangements have been deleted.  Those provisions were intended to give clarity around how any new pension arrangements in the Dublin Airport Authority would be divided between DAA employees and those of a future Cork Airport authority, if and when Cork Airport is separated from DAA.  Those provisions gave rise to a certain degree of confusion and misunderstanding and for that reason they were deleted.<\/p><p>Senators will recall that under section 32B(1)(a) the trustees will have the power to amend the provisions of the IAS scheme to cease any further accrual of benefits under the scheme and to simultaneously cease the contribution liability of both members and employers.  Another amendment to this section means the exercise of this power is now subject to a commencement order.  At the request of the trustees section 32B(2) was added to make it clear that if and when they exercise their powers under section 32B(1)(a) the trustees and the IAS scheme itself will have no obligation to provide benefits under the scheme in respect of future service.<\/p> <p>While one could argue that this is self-evident within subsection (1), we had no difficulty with providing the further clarification contained in this amendment, which also requires the trustees to act honestly and reasonably when exercising their powers under that subsection.<\/p><p>A further amendment was the addition of the new subsection (5) to section 32B.  This subsection disapplies statutory revaluation, as provided for under section 33 of the Pensions Act 1990, from the IAS scheme in the context of the particular proposals which are the subject of current discussions among the members to resolve the difficulties with this scheme.  An element of those particular proposals is the removal of the impact of statutory revaluation on preserved benefits so that the future liabilities of the scheme can be locked down.  However, under this amendment, revaluation cannot be disapplied in isolation from a decision by the trustees to cease contributions and benefit accruals from subsection 1(a) of 32B - this is a prerequisite for the disapplication of revaluation.  In addition, the operation of this amendment has been made subject to a separate commencement order.  These safeguards will ensure that revaluation under the Pensions Act will continue as normal and until its disapplication forms part of an overall solution to the problems of the scheme.  If, for any reason, it does not ultimately materialise as part of a final solution, this provision will not be commenced.  However, we want to make sure there is no legislative barrier to any resolution of the IAS scheme difficulties that is agreed among the parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500026#BB01000","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405437600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I formally congratulate the Minister, a fellow north-sider, on his appointment.

He was certainly an excellent Member of the Seanad and I am genuinely delighted about his appointment.  Obviously, he has not much time to read himself into what is being proposed in this legislation.  These are fundamental changes.  This is the first time the State has legislated to change a private pension scheme.  I debated these proposals at length with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Varadkar.  I note there have been some changes in regard to two separate commencement orders, which effectively mean that no changes to retained or existing benefits can take place without the Minister's consent.  Although I have been here since 2007, between the D&aacute;il and Seanad, I have never seen it happen that a full section of such fundamental importance to a Bill was effectively replaced.  The Minister listed a number of technical amendments in group one, which address errors including drafting mistakes and mistakes by the Department.  There is an issue relating to the Pensions Act and the implementation of any changes in revaluation or to retained or existing benefits, and the Minister has rightly inserted a reference to the Pensions Act.  I put it to him that if he had not done that, he would have been contravention of the Pensions Act.<\/p><p>I made a point on Second Stage that the changes to the IAS scheme, in view of the fact that the Government is legislating for one pension scheme as part of this Bill, should not have been made until the negotiations were completed and an agreement could be reached.  I pointed out to the previous Minister, Deputy Varadkar, that a full pension section is being shoehorned onto the back of this Bill.  It has been proven by what the Minister has brought to the House and by the Government amendments, particularly to this section, that the first draft of this proposal that the Government brought to the House was so substantially flawed that it had to be set aside.  I could take solace, although I do not, in the fact that many of these changes were brought about by the debate in this House, in the D&aacute;il and in committee, all of which I watched.<\/p><p>I welcome the two separate commencement orders, but I put it to the Minister that he is effectively giving power still to the trustees, particularly under section 32B(1)(b), which provides: &quot;The consent of the members or of a company or other employer participating in the IAS scheme or of any other person referred to in any provision of the IAS scheme shall not be required by the trustees for the exercise of the powers conferred on them by this subsection.&quot;  I genuinely ask the Minister to have a look at this.  Because he is new to this ministerial office - and I wish him the very best - he would bring a fresh pair of eyes to it.  This is effectively saying that the trustees can do what they like, irrespective of whether agreement is reached through the discussions with what is termed the expert panel.<\/p><p>The Minister may or may not have noted during the course of the past few months the effect that some of the proposals the trustees brought forward will have on the deferred members, those who worked in the companies to which we are referring - Aer Lingus, SR Technics and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA - which could result in reductions in promised defined benefit pensions of between 40% and 50% of the expected benefit.  I am sure the Minister will have received correspondence from the Retired Aviation Staff Association, RASA.  Based on the proposals put forward, upon the passing of this legislation, which would give powers to the trustees to do what they wish to do, the retired aviation members will face reductions, on average, of &euro;40 to &euro;50 per week, although they do not, in the main, have the ability to earn additional income.  Sweeping powers are being given to the trustees.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the fact that his Department has had to replace whole subsection relating to pensions because it has not got it right.  I asked the previous Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I ask this Minister again to remove this section and introduce separate legislation should agreement be reached, or if it is not reached.  I listened to what the previous Minister said about this during the debate on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and he made the point that he was only putting this in place in case there is not an agreement, rather than having to recall the D&aacute;il and the Seanad during the recess should this legislation need to be passed very quickly.  I do not get the logic of that.  <\/p><p>We are talking about 15,000 people and their families, one third of whom are retired and one third of whom are deferred pensioners, who, I note from the amendment that the Minister has introduced, do not have any say in what is happening because they do not have an employer who may move them into a scheme, as they worked for years under this scheme.  The Minister probably knows much of this already; I am simply restating the position for him.  Successive Governments, and in that I include previous Governments, have failed in this regard.  This scheme was used as a vehicle, in many instances, to incentivise people to retire early.  They were offered uncoordinated benefits in respect of early retirement.  I still have not got an answer from the trustees, nor will they have to give it to me, regarding the point that it does not appear that any additional funding was put in place to fill those holes when people were leaving the company.  The company, to boost profitability, asked a lot of people to leave and gave them an incentive through the scheme - which people took in good faith, and I do not blame them for doing that - but no requisite or subsequent contribution was made.  That is one of the reasons for the big hole in the scheme.  Instead of trying to fix this, we are prematurely bringing through legislation, in advance of any agreement, that will remove the rights of pensioners or retired members.  Many workers feel - I can understand their position - that because the scheme is unfunded, they want to get into a new scheme; they do not want to keep paying into a black hole.  I understand that.  If the Government is willing to do this once and if it is willing to legislate for a private pension scheme, what is to stop any Government in the future from doing likewise?  It sets a dangerous precedent.  I acknowledge that the previous Minister and this Minister have brought about some changes to ensure that, should the trustees come up with a proposal that involves drastically reducing members' benefits, that measure will have to come to the Minister for him to sign it.<\/p> <p>The Minister must sign away people's pension benefits.  This will mean reductions in their pensions far more drastic than any cut to the household benefits package.  There will be reductions in future benefits that people were promised and the Minister must sign off on that.  Has the Minister been informed correctly in that regard?  The Minister has been in the job a few days and is introducing a section that will effectively bring it to his desk in future.  He will be signing away the benefits for 15,000 families across the country.<\/p><p>I urge the Minister to remove the section in its entirety and introduce it as separate legislation if required.  When he considers the confusion about Cork Airport, which the Minister mentioned, it adds to my point that the section concerning pensions benefit was ill thought out, rushed and tagged onto a Bill when it has no business being in it.  It is a significant change in the benefits of retired workers and their pensions rights.  It should have been introduced in a transparent way in separate legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500027#CC00400","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405438200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Darragh O'Brien for the points made.

It is unfortunate that the Government has not during our detailed debates over the past few weeks seen fit to delete the section relating to superannuation and pension schemes.  When the new T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection enacted the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013, she provided for unilateral, sweeping changes to pension schemes, including amending the order of priority in so far as they affect retired members.

I thank the former Minister, Deputy Varadkar, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and, in particular, Mr. Brian Murphy, in the Minister's office who was a great help.  The airport is a key economic driver for the west, not just the Shannon region.  Deputy Dooley said we would need a &euro;5 billion bung every year for five years to keep the scheme going.  This is not true and the scaremongering must come to an end.  The right thing is being done for Shannon Airport.  It made a profit of &euro;149,000 last year, despite cleaning up another mess in Shannon Development and getting rid of that agency, which was serving no function.  The industrial estate, along with the airport, is beginning to recover.  Between 600 and 800 jobs are currently being advertised on the industrial estate and I have no doubt that in seven or eight years there will up to 8,000 jobs available because we have made the right decision.<\/p><p>Shannon will be set free from the clutches of the Dublin Airport Authority and the messing of Fianna F&aacute;il.

I welcome the new Minister and I regret he has come to the legislation at such a late stage because it is controversial.  We have had a great deal of discussion on it.  It is unprecedented for a Government to pass legislation to strip away the private pension rights of employees, to which they have made contributions over many years.  The Government has stripped away the rights of people who took early retirement from the airports and SR Technics on the basis of pension commitments made to them at the time, without consultation.  The legislation provides incredible powers to the trustees to undermine people's benefits.  There are difficulties in Aer Lingus and a solution needs to be reached to fund the pension scheme, which we all want.  Talks are under way to achieve that but this legislation has been railroaded through at the same time, which demonstrates incredible bad faith on the part of the Government in the context of reaching a fair resolution to the issue.<\/p><p>The OECD recommended that where there are single insolvencies, namely, where the pension scheme is insolvent but the employer is not, such schemes should not be allowed to be closed unless the employer ensures it is 90% funded.  We tabled an amendment on Committee Stage to insert the recommendation in the Bill to at least give some protection to the existing members and deferred members that will be affected but that was refused.<\/p><p>Government Members should be aware of what is happening here and of the unprecedented nature of what is being done to people's private pension rights.  This is not right.  We have fought the Bill every step of the way because we think it is wrong that people who paid for entitlements on the basis of a commitment from their employer should have them stripped away at the last minute without consultation.  I urge Government Members to think about that and about whether they are prepared to stand over that when they vote on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500029#FF01200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1405438800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I was assured five minutes would be sufficient to finish this Stage but we have been going for ten minutes.

We are all proud of him.<\/p><p>National airport bodies are an anomaly.  Airports in future will compete and, as Senator Mulcahy said, Shannon Airport will have its freedom.  I wish Cork Airport would be given the same facility under section 1 and the Minister will see when he reads the debate on the Bill that I proposed this to the former Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  Cork Airport is two thirds bigger than Shannon Airport but nobody knows what to do with the new terminal there, which cost &euro;68 million.  It was unnecessary and it is a white elephant.  It is also a millstone around the neck of the airport.<\/p><p>Page 9, line 23 states the airports shall conduct their business at all times in a cost effective manner.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation has recommended that charges at Dublin Airport should reduce by 4.8% a year for the next five years.<\/p> <p>They were overcharged to pay for Terminal 2 and we lost tourism as a result.  The Department has a vital role in monitoring the efficiency of the airports.  Cork Airport has an unnecessary terminal but good labour productivity.  Shannon Airport had a low level of passengers per square metre of terminal and had low labour productivity.  Such is the task that faces us.  Airlines and airports compete and this is going in the right direction.  While I wish Cork Airport had got its freedom, the former Minister, Deputy Varadkar, left it open for Cork Airport to become an independent airport at some stage.  If it were in the UK it would compete and would be in the top 20 airports there as a separate, independent business.  I welcome what the Minister is doing for Shannon Airport and I wish he had done the same for Cork Airport.

I will pick up on the points Senators O'Neill and Mulcahy made on the objectives of the Bill regarding changes to Shannon Airport and Shannon development.  Between 2006 and 2012, Shannon Airport lost two thirds of its passengers.  That was the situation when we drafted the Bill.  Last year, 1.4 million people went through Shannon Airport, compared to 1.39 million the previous year, showing at least stability with some signs of growth.  So far this year, figures have increased each month, with a predicted growth of 10% for the year.  This is all about trying to create an environment where two organisations have separate jobs, each with its own financial discipline and strategic objectives.  With the leadership in place in the bodies, I am confident, as Senators Mulcahy and O'Neill said, that Shannon Airport will become a hub for more passengers and jobs as a result of what is happening here.  The individuals involved will grasp the opportunities the Bill will provide and we will see further employment, passengers and growth in Shannon Airport.<\/p><p>When I walked in here with the Bill, one of my first thoughts was that Senator Barrett taught me transport economics for a full year.  I have no doubt he will remind me of that on many occasions here in the near future.  I am very much aware of the Senator's points on charging, statistics and the future of Cork Airport.  As he knows, we have a policy on the aviation sector out for public consultation.  When the public consultation is complete, the draft will return to me and we will publish it later in the year.  Perhaps there may be an opportunity in this House to examine this aviation policy and consider the Senator's points in detail.<\/p><p>Regarding Senators' points on the pensions issue, whenever I sign an order I will do so conscious of the responsibilities this office confers upon me.  I am acutely aware of the families of the people who are very concerned about their futures and the expectations they have regarding the pensions they thought they would have.

Many of us here soldiered with him in the past and remember him as a very good and forthright Senator.  I hope he will bring these qualities to his ministerial position.  He has gone via the Seanad, the European Parliament and the D&aacute;il, was appointed Minister of State and now Minister and is also deputy leader of the Labour Party.  I wish him well in his challenging role.  I pay tribute to him, too, as a representative of a rural constituency.  He did a very good job in his previous role, as Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, particularly on the issue of rural transport.  He was very knowledgeable and impactive in ensuring the rural transport system was preserved and protected.  I hope he will display the same sense of independent thinking today as he has done in the past in this House.  As he will know from his time in the Seanad, it is easy to distinguish between Ministers.  Some of them are too often caught looking over their shoulders to receive instructions from behind their seat.  Others, however, have the courage and incisiveness to differentiate between good amendments and those which are not so good and take the appropriate action in either accepting or rejecting them.<br \/>I also take the opportunity to pay tribute to the outgoing Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, who was in the House last week.  Many of us had an expectation that he might well be promoted in the reshuffle.  To see him returned to the backbenches is a surprise to many.  He is a person who distinguished himself in his time as Minister of State and I wish him well in his future political career.  He marked me at one time when I was Government spokesman on communications, energy and natural resources and he was my Opposition counterpart in this House.<br \/>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 arise from our discussion on Committee Stage.  The Bill serves to merge - some of us might use the word &quot;submerge&quot; - the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, within the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, two bodies which were heretofore independent.  To some extent, these proposals fly in the face of international trends, whereby radiological protection schemes operate independently of other bodies.  The EPA has a very distinctive function in that it is there to protect the environment from human activities and degradation.  The modern lifestyles we enjoy have been injurious to the environment.  The function of the RPII, meanwhile, is to protect individuals from the effects of nuclear fallout and harmful radon gas.  The institute has had a distinguished record in the past 25 years and is internationally recognised for the good work it has done in advising and instructing the Government on a range of radiological issues.  It is important that this is not lost in the merging of the two bodies.<br \/>The EPA has been engaged in four core activities, each of which is overseen by a director.  This legislation will add a very distinguishable fifth area of activity and a fifth director.  I am grateful to the previous Minister and his officials for giving me a note on the background to this.  The four activities are environmental enforcement, climate licensing research and resource use, environmental assessment, and communications and corporate services.  The directors in each of these divisions work with the director general of the EPA.  It is very much an executive board.<\/p> <p>I know that in a few minutes the Minister will probably say that he intends the radiological protection division to be headed by a director with expertise in the radiological sphere.  In this instance we are anxious to ensure that it does because, in fact, the Bill is silent on the matter.  Section 21 says that the agency will consist of a director general and five other directors.  We could presume that one of those posts will be a director for radiological protection, but that could change.  The note says this will ensure that the radiological protection expertise can be - and I emphasise the word \"can\" - a criterion for the selection of directors.  The section also allows the Minister to direct, by order, that a director must have specific radiological protection or other qualifications.  By way of a corollary, we could interpret that to mean that the Minister may not make such a direction by order.  The legislation gives the Minister an optional discretionary power.  We are saying that in the merging of the two bodies, particularly a body as important as the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, primary legislation should underpin the post of a director with appropriate expertise in the area.  The Bill does not say that at present.  The Minister may say that was implied, but it would be open to any Minister, or director general, to influence the decision and, therefore, the appointment might not happen, which would lead to the diminution of the role of the radiological protection objective within the new body, a move which we think is unwise.<\/p><p>I presume the Minister will repeat the assurance we were given on the last day that the person involved will have the necessary expertise and will or may be a director.  If that is the case then I see no impediment to the Minister's agreeing to specific legislation.  That is why I am happy to propose that one director of the agency shall be an expert in radiological protection, which combines the objectives sought in sections 21 to 23, inclusive.  I urge the Minister to think independently in this regard and accept this simple amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500031#JJ01600","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405440600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500032#KK00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1405440600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire.

I concur with a number of points made by Senator Walsh and with the general thrust of the amendments.  There is a sense among people who have been in and around the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland that the amalgamation will dilute the work it has done over the years.  Up to now it has been a stand-alone organisation that protected citizens.  Many people maintain that it should remain autonomous in order to be as effective as possible.  There are also fears that the Bill has gone further than a merger because the RPII will be subsumed into the EPA and, therefore, will lose its identity.  Also, and more importantly, its structure and expertise accumulated over the years will be diluted across the EPA.  It makes sense that any EPA director take into consideration the RPII's radiological work done to date, and also, the name of the EPA should be changed to reflect such a role.  Obviously, certain issues must continue to be worked on, such as the compilation of a new radon map of the country, the provision of ongoing support to hospitals, etc., and vigilance about the potential dangers posed by the likes of Sellafield.  The argument put forward is fair and well grounded and, therefore, I support the thrust of the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500032#KK00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1405440600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>We are here to debate important legislation.  I welcome the Minister to the House on his first ministerial outing and wish him the very best in his new role.  I am the Fine Gael spokesperson on the environment in the Seanad and I am sure we will work together a lot.  I wish to pay tribute to the outgoing Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, who answered questions and dealt with the Bill here.  The Department is not an easy one but I know the new Minister will find it easy and make it his own.  It is difficult to have press releases on water charges, property charges, septic tank charges and all those difficult issues.  The Department has done a lot of heavy lifting in that regard and the Minister will have a lot of heavy lifting to do.  The Department is important because it focuses on the environment.  It is true that we must protect our environment, and today's legislation deals with the amalgamation of the RPII and the EPA.  The merger will lead to an EPA that is stronger than a stand-alone entity and does not mean we will have all officers and no soldiers.  The new entity must have one officer.  As the Minister has said, it will have five directors.  The legislation gives him the power to ensure that, naturally enough, anybody in charge of radiological protection is qualified and knows what he or she is doing.  I know that the person and his or her directives will ensure that the very good work done by the RPII is continued.  I compliment the RPII staff on their work and hope it will continue in the EPA under one directorship.  Too many officers but not enough soldiers doing the work can be a handicap and I wish the Minister the best with this important sector.  The Bill has been amended to include radiological protection as well as environmental protection, which is the theme of the legislation, and I hope it will be stronger.  Also, a new report on the matter has been published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500032#KK00600","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1405440600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their good wishes.  I started off in this House and it is always good to return.<br \/>Let me commence by saying that the Bill was primarily developed by previous Ministers, particularly the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, and I compliment them on their good work.  As Senator Walsh will know, I always accept good ideas and always will, but no one has a monopoly on them.  However, I do not propose to accept his amendment.  In doing so I want to again stress to the House that this legislation should not in any way be interpreted as a reduction in the Government's commitment to radiological protection.<br \/>First, none of the professional expertise of the RPII will be lost in the course of its merger with the EPA.  All of the staff with specialist radiological protection qualifications, skills and competencies will become full-time permanent staff of the EPA.  The current chief executive officer of the RPII will become a director of the newly merged organisation for a period up to 30 April 2016 to allow for a smooth transition.  At that point the fifth director position will be filled in the normal manner.  Of course it will be open to the former CEO of the RPII to apply for the position.  He or she will also have the option to stay on in the organisation as a senior principal scientific officer after 30<sup><\/sup>April 2016.<br \/>The Bill makes a number of other amendments to the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 to ensure that the EPA has the necessary powers and functions to meet its new statutory duties regarding radiological protection.  As I have mentioned, it provides that a fifth director be appointed to the agency, at section 21.  It goes on to provide, at section 22, that the statutory selection committee for directors will include a person with radiological expertise, appointed by the Minister.  Section 23 amends section 24 of the EPA Act to state:<blockquote>[W]hen selecting candidates, the committee shall have regard to the special knowledge and experience, including experience in environmental matters or radiological protection matters, including such qualifications as the Minister may by order specify.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>Thus, radiological protection experience will be a key consideration when selecting future directors, as appropriate, and the Minister has the power to specify qualifications required for a particular directorial post.  Sections 25 and 26 of the Bill make amendments that provide for radiological protection expertise to be included on the EPA's statutory advisory committee and the committee can provide advice on such matters to the EPA.  It is also intended to set up a separate specialist advisory committee focussed entirely on radiological protection by statutory instrument that will provide advice to the EPA and the main advisory committee as required.<br \/>Taking all of this into account, there is adequate provision in the legislation to ensure that radiological protection becomes, and will remain, a core function of the EPA.  I am reluctant to incorporate an amendment that would seek to legislatively prescribe the divisional organisation of the EPA, or to confer, as this amendment undoubtedly would, one of the offices with a more pre-eminent or differentiated status.  Accordingly, I do not accept the amendment.  There is a difficulty with this proposed amendment arising from the use of the words &quot;executive officer&quot;.  As there is no definition of the position of executive officer provided for in the Environmental Protection Agency Act, the proposed amendment lacks, <i>prima facie<\/i>, the necessary legal clarity.  This situation is complicated by the fact that there are civil and public service grades that have the formal title &quot;executive officer&quot; and, without a definition of what is meant by this in the Bill, it will not be sufficiently clear what &quot;executive officer&quot; means in this context given the phraseology of the amendment.<br \/>Notwithstanding this, the Bill as currently drafted provides for the appointment of a fifth director who will manage the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  It will be the function of the director general of the newly-merged organisation to arrange the distribution of the business of the agency among its directors and this will be done having regard to the statutory functions and requirements of the organisation.  The director in charge of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland will be a full director of the EPA.  There is nothing in the proposed amendment that would improve the quality or standard of radiological protection provided by the newly-merged organisation.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500032#KK00700","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405441200,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Concern has been expressed and not just by Members.  The board of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, particularly its distinguished chairman Professor William Reville, has expressed the fear that there could be a diminution of the focus on radiological protection because of the merger.  I take the Minister's point in respect of amendment No. 2.  Amendment No. 1 is very clear, which says that a director of the agency shall be an expert on radiological protection, and is the amendment I will press.<\/p><p>Looking at other areas of responsibility, given that the body is being merged, a director for communications and corporate services cannot be regarded as on a par with radiological protection.  With regard to section 14(1), whereby the incumbent is protected and will operate as a director for a term ending not later than 30 April 2016, I thought the Labour Party had turned a new page.  I am concerned if we are back at the old method of operating whereby an individual - a senior and highly paid public servant - is being protected and protection of society as a whole is secondary.  That is why I suggest that, subsequent to 30 April 2016, the director is specifically charged with responsibility for radiological protection.

I am delighted to be in Seanad on my first outing as Minister of State at the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<br \/>The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Bill 2014 delivers on one of the key parts of the programme for Government and of our medium-term economic strategy, which was published last December.  There are four principal elements to the legislation I am introducing today.  First, it will establish the Ireland strategic investment fund, the ISIF.  The ISIF will take over the assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, and use the discretionary assets of the fund, some &euro;6.9 billion at the end of March last, for investment in the Irish economy in order to promote economic growth and help foster employment.  Second, it will put the New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA, on a statutory basis.  NewERA is up and running as a business unit of the NTMA, providing financial and commercial advice on commercial semi-states to shareholding Ministers.  Third, it will restructure the corporate governance of the NTMA and its associated entities.  These governance structures are relatively complex as a result of the assignment of additional functions to the agency since it was established in 1990.  Under the Bill the agency, in addition to its core function of borrowing on behalf of the Exchequer and managing the national debt, will be directly responsible for the Ireland strategic investment fund, NewERA, the functions of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the State Claims Agency.  Finally, the Bill will provide a statutory basis for the legal costs unit within the State Claims Agency, which deals with claims against State bodies.  The unit was established to deal with third-party costs arising from certain tribunals of inquiry.  There will be no impact in respect of NAMA.<br \/>I wish to present some of the main provisions of the Bill.  There are eight Parts and four Schedules.  Part 1 contains the preliminary and general provisions, including the Short Title.  Part 2 contains provisions in relation to the governance structure of the agency.  I will explain the background in more detail to make clear what we are proposing in the Bill.<br \/>The National Treasury Management Agency was established in 1990 under the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 to borrow on behalf of the Exchequer and to manage the national debt.  The agency was established outside normal public sector structures, with operational freedom to negotiate market-competitive salaries.  This business model was designed to enable the NTMA to compete with the private sector and attract and retain specialists in mid-career who would not normally be attracted to working in a public sector environment.<br \/>Over the years, the agency's remit has been considerably extended.  The principal additional functions are as follows.  The agency is the manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which was established in 2001.  The investment of the fund is the responsibility of the NPRF Commission.  The agency is the body through which the National Development Finance Agency performs its functions. The National Development Finance Agency was established in 2003.  Its role is to provide financial advice to State bodies undertaking major public investment projects and to procure and deliver public private partnership projects in sectors other than transport and local authorities.  It also procures non-PPP schools on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The agency, acting through its NewERA unit, provides advice to shareholding Ministers in relation to commercial semi-states.  The agency is responsible for providing risk management advice and claims management assistance to State authorities with the aim of ensuring that the State's liabilities and expenses are contained at the lowest achievable level.  The agency is known as the State Claims Agency when dealing with claims against State bodies.  The agency also provides business services and staff to NAMA.<br \/>I will turn to the governance structures underlying these functions.  The NTMA does not have a board, although it does have an advisory committee whose role is to advise on matters referred to it by the agency.  The chief executive of the NTMA is directly responsible to the Minister for the performance of the functions of the agency.  The chief executive reports directly to the Minister on the NTMA's funding and debt management and State Claims Agency and NewERA functions.  To that extent the agency is more like a Government Department than a State agency.<br \/>The NPRF, NDFA and NAMA were established under their own governing legislation and each has its own governing body.  The NTMA acts as the executive in respect of the NPRF and the NDFA.  It assigns staff to NAMA and also provides it with business and support services and systems.  The NTMA chief executive is <i>ex officio <\/i>a member of the NPRF Commission and the board of NAMA and the chairman of the NDFA.  A director of the NTMA acts as CEO of the NDFA.  That is the situation as we have it now. <br \/>The agency has carried out the functions it has been assigned with skill and dedication.  However, the governance structure under which it operates has become unwieldy and complex as new functions have been bolted on.  As we put NewERA, the ISIF and the legal costs unit on a statutory footing, we are taking the opportunity to simplify and streamline the governance structures of the NTMA and its associated entities.  The legislation will convert the agency into a body with members, effectively a board.  It will have a total of nine members, six members appointed by the Minister for Finance, serving a five-year term, and, <i>ex officio<\/i>, the chief executive officer of the NTMA, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister for Finance will nominate one of the appointed members as chairperson.  The reconstituted NTMA will continue to be directly responsible for the borrowing and debt management functions, as well as the State Claims Agency and various other functions such as the Central Treasury Service, just as it is now.  In addition, it will be directly responsible for the Ireland strategic investment fund and NDFA functions, rather than acting on behalf of other statutory bodies, and it will have NewERA.  No changes are proposed to the existing arrangements in respect of NAMA.<br \/>On foot of the changes outlined above, the NTMA advisory committee and the NDFA and its board will be dissolved, as will the State Claims Agency policy committee.  The NPRF Commission will also be dissolved as soon as practicable.<br \/><b><\/b>Part<b><\/b>3 establishes the New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA, on a statutory basis.  NewERA is already up and running as part of the NTMA, providing financial and commercial advice on commercial semi-states to shareholding Ministers.  Financial and commercial advice covers advice on a wide range of things: a Minister's statutory role, exercising rights as a<sub><\/sub>shareholder, governance, expected rates of return, dividend policy, corporate and investment strategy, acquisitions and disposals, as well as appointments and the remuneration of directors and the chief executive.  NewERA will not have an executive role in its own right.  It is a dedicated source of commercial advice for relevant Ministers who will continue to carry out their current executive functions.  NewERA will also be able to provide project management services and oversight in respect of acquisitions, disposals and restructurings, at the request of a relevant Minister.<br \/>The Bill sets out the designated commercial semi-state bodies on which the agency will provide advice.  They are the ESB, Ervia, formerly Bord G&aacute;is Eireann, Irish Water, Bord na M&oacute;na, Coillte Teoranta, EirGrid and any other State body specified by order.<br \/>The Bill provides that the agency may provide financial and commercial advisory functions relating to other bodies if requested by the Minister with responsibility for the body.<br \/>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will have power to give directions to NewERA as to the performance of its functions.  He or she must first consult the Minister for Finance and any relevant shareholding Minister.  This mirrors the ministerial power of direction over other NTMA functions.  Any such directions must be published.  NewERA will be required to submit a report on the financial performance of each of the commercial semi-States under its remit to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and relevant Ministers each year.<br \/>The Bill provides that the agency, in consultation with relevant Ministers, may develop proposals for investment in order to support economic activity and employment in energy, water, telecommunications and forestry and any other sector that is specified by order.<br \/>Part 4 gives the agency responsibility for the role in relation to infrastructure projects currently carried out by the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.  The NDFA was established on 1 January 2003 to provide a financial advisory service to State authorities in respect of capital projects over a certain size, at present &euro;20 million.  It is a body corporate with a chief executive and board, which discharges its functions through the NTMA.  It is proposed that the NDFA and its board will be dissolved and its functions will be assigned to the agency.<\/p> <p> Part 5 establishes a legal costs unit within the State Claims Agency to look after costs awarded by certain tribunals of inquiry.  The NTMA, as the State Claims Agency, manages personal injury claims, including bullying and harassment and third party property damage claims against specified State authorities, as well as associated risks.  On foot of a Government decision, the agency has started to advise on costs awarded by the Mahon tribunal on planning matters and the Moriarty tribunal on payments to politicians.  The Bill puts this function on a statutory basis.  This is being done to minimise the State's exposure and deliver significant savings to the Exchequer because third party costs represent the bulk of tribunal costs.  These costs are awarded in principle by tribunals and their amounts are determined in retrospect.<\/p><p>Part 6 establishes the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  The assets and the liabilities of the NPRF - just over &euro;20 billion at the end of March - will become the assets and liabilities of the ISIF.  The NPRF was set up as an investment fund to supplement Exchequer resources from 2025 on when the burden of social welfare and public service pensions is expected to have increased considerably.  The fund was invested on a global basis accordingly.  As Senators will be aware, a portion of the fund was used to recapitalise the banks during the financial crisis.  These investments were worth some &euro;13 billion at the end of March and are held at the direction of the Minister for Finance.  The balance in the fund - &euro;6.9 billion at the end of March - will be used by the agency for investment on a commercial basis in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in the State.  The intention is to make funding available across the board for infrastructure, SMEs and whatever.  While the issue of the future cost of pensions has not gone away, the Government believes fostering economic activity and employment in Ireland is a greater priority in the current circumstances and that the resources of the NPRF should be redeployed accordingly.  As the Minister for Finance has stated, the best way to ensure the State will be in a position to meet its future obligations is to ensure we have a growing economy.<\/p><p>The agency will set the overall investment strategy for the fund and in so doing will consult the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and have regard to views expressed by them.  An investment committee will be established by the agency which will be responsible for individual decisions in line with the investment strategy and within parameters set by the agency.  The Bill carries over from the NPRF Act 2009 the power of the Minister to direct that the fund be used to recapitalise the banks.  This is being done as a pragmatic precautionary measure.  It is not envisaged that the provision will ever be used.  However, if for whatever reason, the Government needed to provide funding for the financial system, the likelihood is that it would need to be in a position to do so quickly.  It should be noted that this is a measure that can be used only in exceptional circumstances.<\/p><p>Part 7 dissolves the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, the National Development Finance Agency, the NTMA Advisory Committee and the State Claims Policy Committee.  <\/p><p>Part 8 contains two provisions that were added on Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Section 54 allows Ministers to provide guarantees or indemnities in respect of borrowings by State authorities in respect of public private partnerships.  Section 55 allows the NTMA to use the PPSN number as a unique identifier for its State savings retail investment products.<\/p><p>There are four Schedules to the Bill which deal with consequential matters.  Schedules 1 and 2 amend existing legislation to take account of the provisions of the Bill, for example, deleting references to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission.  The SIF will be exempt from tax in the same way as the NPRF.  Schedule 3 lists State authorities for which the agency, in its NDFA role, provides advice on financing public investment projects.  Schedule 4 contains detailed technical provisions ensuring the changes envisaged in the legislation work smoothly.  It also removes the requirement to pay the Exchequer contribution of 1% of GNP to the National Pensions Reserve Fund in 2014.<\/p><p>The establishment of NewERA and the ISIF will play a catalytic role in accelerating investment in strategic infrastructure and providing commercial financing and investment in areas that support economic growth and employment.  As the economy grows and demand increases, it is essential that well priced financing is available to assist business to trade, grow and create jobs.  I look forward to a constructive debate on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500035#OO00400","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405442700,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I think we are all delighted he has been appointed.  It is slightly ironic that his first appearance is in the Seanad, but he is very welcome and we are delighted to have him.  It is a huge personal honour for him and I hope he will be a Minister of State to the full in the Department because the OPW plays a serious and important role for the entire country.  I visited Oldbridge House with which I am sure the Minister of State will become familiar.  The staff there were very interested in who would be appointed as Minister of State this week.  The Minister of State's name did not come up in the conversation I had with them at the weekend, but I am sure they will be delighted and will certainly look forward to him visiting them.  The same applies to the offices in Trim, County Meath.<\/p><p>The Seanad should possibly have given the Minister of State the courtesy of allowing him a few days to get up to speed in the Department.  It was a bit much to ask him to come here tonight to put this legislation through, but he has risen to the challenge, which we welcome.  He will be happy to note that we will be supporting the legislation.  I understand everybody will be supporting it.  I am sure we will all have our own reservations and amendments that we will bring forward on Committee Stage, but we support the passage of the Bill.  However, it is overdue, although not as a result of any delay caused by the Minister for State.  The Government should have looked at this legislation much sooner.  It seems that many things are being done with an eye to the general election when perhaps they might have been done some time ago.  <\/p><p>It has been mentioned that services such as broadband, water and energy will be supported by the SIF.  They are vworthy, but I do not think social housing is mentioned in the legislation.  It is something that should possibly be looked at because it is said to be a priority in the latest version of the programme for Government that we received last week.  It specifically relates to the private sector and working towards the provision of 25,000 houses per year; therefore, I would like to see something being done on that side.  All of us in the greater Dublin area are coming across frightening cases.  Only today I heard about the particularly frightening case of homelessness, an issue I would like to see prioritised as, I am sure, would other Members of the House.  <\/p><p>It is important to note the role of the NTMA.  Overall, it has done a very good job in managing the State's money outside the Civil Service.  It is a model that worked very well for a time - certainly when the economy and stock market were rising.  It obviously has had difficulties since and owing to the economic crisis, a lot of the money has been used for purposes other than those intended.  The Bill looks to rationalise and simplify the Government's instructions to the NTMA to establish a more integrated approach to the performance of its functions which have expanded significantly since it was established in 1990 by Mr. Albert Reynolds.  There will be a chairperson and other members with overarching responsibility for the agency's existing debt management and State Claims Agency functions and functions relating to infrastructural projects carried out by the NDFA, the ISIF and NewERA.  There will be no change to the proposals relating to NAMA.  <\/p><p>The legal costs unit will be established to deal with third party costs arising from tribunals of inquiry, which is welcome.  It is amazing because the last report was released over two years ago and those inquiries were still being legislated for.  It just proves the point that they were totally unsuitable and not fit for purpose in doing something speedily and at low cost.  We are two years on from the Mahon tribunal and over three years on from the Moriarty tribunal and these issues are still arising.  <\/p><p>Three years ago we suggested leveraging private pension funds in the NPRF as a means of supporting infrastructural investment.  Yes, the Government is doing this now, but it is belated.  Given the failure to deliver on existing promises, there must be considerable doubt about whether this will produce benefits.  We can only hope that it will, but there is doubt based on the track record of the Government.  I am not including the Minister of State in this because he has only joined the Government today.  <\/p><p>We will support the Bill.  We will have amendments on Committee Stage which will probably be taken some time this week because there is a rush to get legislation through.  I think the Seanad generally agrees that rushing legislation through at the last minute is unfortunate; there is a huge number of Bills going through the Seanad today and every day this week, yet we had days in the past few weeks on which there really was nothing to do.  That is not a very good way to carry out the people's business and to bring forward very important legislation such as this which we want to support, work and hope will bring tangible improvements to the economy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500036#PP00200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1405443300,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I agree with my colleague, Senator Byrne, that we are pleased indeed to have him in the House on his first appearance in his current official function.  I welcome the legislation before the House.  If I was to be absolutely honest about it, it is a little overdue.  It has been on the cards since the beginning of the Government's term in office.  Anyway, it is certainly welcome and contains several important features.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to acknowledge the undisputed success of the National Treasury Management Agency.  The Minister of the day took the view that to create such an agency outside of the permanent Civil Service would give a certain amount of freedom in terms of recruitment, management and so forth.  It has been a highly successful operation and perhaps as a testament to that success several other functions have come within its remit over time.<\/p><p>I wish to comment on the legislation and some of the broader issues.  I question the role of the State Claims Agency within the overall umbrella.  To my mind there is considerable justification for some of the other arms of the NTMA and its various cloaks, whether it is wearing the NewERA cloak, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund cloak or whatever cloak it is wearing.  The State Claims Agency does not necessarily fall comfortably within the NTMA in that sense.  It has 77 employees and deals effectively with legal costs.  I am simply throwing it out there.  Given the expertise of the NTMA and the various roles that fall within its remit in terms of investment, treasury management and so forth I am unconvinced that what is effectively a legal costs operation should fall within the agency's remit.<\/p><p>Several criticisms have been made about putting the National Pensions Reserve Fund within a new body whose remit is entirely investment within the State.  Those criticisms fall within two camps.  One camp maintains we should have done this far sooner, that we should put all our eggs into the Irish economy and use the money in the National Pensions Reserve Fund to stimulate the Irish economy, irrespective of whether we are looking for an economic return.  The other arm of the debate is along the lines that we must look to the future, we have an ageing population and that it took us long enough to acknowledge that we could not continue to pay pensions out of current expenditure indefinitely, especially since over many years public servants and ordinary citizens have paid into the National Pensions Reserve Fund through PRSI contributions and have a right to have that money protected.  In reality, because of the banking crisis we have seen a certain proportion of that money go towards recapitalising the banks, to the point where we are basically putting forward what is left of the fund for investment in the Irish economy.  I believe this proposal answers those two concerns.  It is important that we stimulate the Irish economy.  In fact, it is critical, but is also critical that we protect the interests of Irish pensioners in future.  Therefore it is important for the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to have a commercial mandate and I welcome that it does.<\/p><p>As Senator Byrne noted, how that fund invests in future will be critical for the Irish economy.  The Minister of State referred to certain areas in his speech.  I agree completely with Senator Byrne that we have a major issue with infrastructural investment in this country which is not covered by the areas the Minister of State mentioned.  One of these areas is social housing.  We need to look outside the box in terms of how we use the funds available to deal with that particular infrastructural deficit, which is certainly a major infrastructural deficit at the moment.<\/p><p>Several of the comments made on this legislation in the D&aacute;il were highly critical of the idea that we would require a 50% or 50% plus engagement of private funds with the ISIF.  There has been considerable criticism of public private partnerships in the context of social housing but I believe much of that criticism is perhaps overstated.  Recently, I had reason to be in Fatima Mansions.  When we consider the redevelopment of Fatima Mansions there is no question or doubt but that the community there has benefited considerably from the private investment.  It is unfortunate that PPPs are now decried as a bad thing.  This is not to say that in future we cannot have successful PPPs when it comes to investment, particularly investment in social housing.  We need to look to the stock of State assets, particularly the social housing stock, and examine how it can be leveraged in future through something like the ISIF to put investment into social housing.  I completely agree with my colleague, Senator Byrne, that this critical issue must be addressed.<\/p><p>One of the criticisms made about NewERA is that it is a vehicle for privatisation.  In fact if I had any criticism to make about how we should progress with NewERA, I would make the opposite argument.  I believe NewERA should be a holding company for the State in respect of all of its assets.  NewERA should holds assets on behalf of the State and semi-state companies.  Perhaps one of the fences that we need to jump emotionally is to see the entirety of our State investment as a source of further investment in future.  Let us think back to the 1950s and 1960s.  When State companies were set up, they were set up with a reason - to fill a gap that could not be filled by other enterprises.  Now we look at them as sacred cows that cannot be interfered with.  I prefer to see them as a source of funding in order that we can look at other issues that we are not addressing, for example, new technologies or, for the sake of argument - I would not even dream of mentioning it in this House - potentially looking at other sources of energy like nuclear power.  We should not see the stock of our current State enterprises as cast in stone.  Rather we should see them as something that we can leverage in future for the benefit of our society.<\/p><p>There is no question or doubt that unless we have stimulus in the Irish economy coupled with reasonable growth and, dare I say it, reasonable inflation we will be unable to come out of the situation we are in.  This is positive legislation, especially in terms of building on the success of the NTMA model.  It recognises that we have State assets that we can leverage.  It also recognises that we need to leverage these in a way that protects the interests of pensioners.  It acknowledges the need for stimulus in the economy.  I am very much of the view that we stand at a critical path now.  We cannot continue to remove money out of the Irish economy.  We cannot borrow as a State in the way we would like to or in the way other Governments before us had the privilege of doing.  We need to think outside the box.  I believe that moving assets into ISIF is indeed the way to go, but it must be done in a commercially sensitive way and with the future interests and security of pensioners at its heart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500037#QQ00100","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1405443300,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, on his first day or the first few hours of being elevated to that status.  It is great to have him in the House and he is welcome indeed.<\/p> <p>It is great to have him here.<\/p><p>My first impression from looking through the explanatory memorandum and from the Minister's speech is the emphasis on the strategic investment fund corporate governance.  Is this the type of jargon that got us into trouble in 2008?  How about efficient investment projects or the ability to appraise investments and publish the results?  We have had an appalling banking system, which was aided and abetted by appalling public policy failures in both the Department of Finance and in the Central Bank.  I do not know if we have remedied any of those yet or what recommendations the banking inquiry will make on them.  A greater level of economic expertise than we had is required in the banks, the Department and the Central Bank.  They imploded and did serious damage to this country, from which we are now trying to recover.  We are raiding a pension fund for an investment which we find will give us no return until 2025 - section 47 provides that there will be no payments to the Exchequer before 2025.  Earlier we had a debate about a bankrupt pension fund of an airport company owning &euro;750 million, so we must get our act together in respect of these investments.  Calling it &quot;strategic&quot; just introduces one to the problem, rather than solving it.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Hayden about the legal costs unit.  It appears to operate quite well as it is, so I do not know why it is necessary to change the way it is organised.  With regard to governance, the Minister referred to negotiating market competitive salaries for the agency.  When it was run from within the Department of Finance at Civil Service competitive salaries the country was solvent.  In the case of market competitive salaries, I hope there are no people in these agencies earning multiples of what the Taoiseach earns.  I said that earlier when the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was here.  That is a daft, artificial commercial market because of the way we rescued the banks.  If we could have rescued the banks and got rid of most of the management, then we would see what their market salaries were.  They bankrupted the country and their banks and they were not paid market competitive salaries.  There should be a serious penalty against people who conducted themselves in that manner.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned that the National Development Finance Agency was established in 2003.  It was therefore in place when the worst excesses of what happened between then and 2008 were occurring.  What was it doing at the time?  Did it not see what was happening to this country?  I am also a sceptic about public-private partnerships.  The former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, told us the ones for roads would be a drain on the Exchequer all of the time.  I liked some risk sharing in these projects but we appear to have signed up to a large number of projects, particularly the two toll roads between Dublin and Navan and Cavan, which will never raise enough money for the taxpayer.  We were outsmarted by people doing the calculations on the other side.<\/p><p>There is also the allied problem of accountancy firms that prepared books for Irish banks which proved to be fictitious when we bought the banks.  The smallest bank bailout proved to be one of the largest bank bailouts.  We require a great deal more financial expertise than we have in that area.<\/p><p>The Minister said that the agency is more like a Government Department than a State agency.  I am not sure that is the answer.  Some Government Departments ran this country on a solvent and conservative basis for many years and some State agencies did not.  The Minister said the agency may provide financial and commercial advisory functions to other bodies, if requested by the Minister with responsibility for that body.  The expertise is required right across the public capital programme.  When one looks at our debt to GDP ratio, which is one of the world's highest, about one third of it was due to the banks.  Most of the rest was dud capital projects.  We called it infrastructure.  Transport 21 was to cost &euro;35 billion, but there was not an ounce of economics in it when it was published.  They were simply campaigns to spend loads of money.<\/p><p>There is no stimulus effect in a small open economy.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has said that.  We signed up for free trade a long time ago and one creates the stimulus in countries from which people buy the imports.  In fact, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on a previous occasion in the House, said that we must forget about the multiplier because it really does not exist anymore in the Irish economy.  We need good projects rather than relying on multipliers.<\/p><p>The Minister said, &quot;The intention is to make funding available across the board, for infrastructure, SMEs, whatever.&quot;  That is a casual type of statement.  It should be for good projects that are analysed, tested and assessed as to whether they are worthwhile.  I hope the investment committee will be able to do that.  The Bill carries over from the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2009 the power of the Minister to direct that the fund be used to recapitalise the banks.  The Minister said, &quot;This is being done as a pragmatic precautionary measure.&quot;  That would cause an immense reaction.  People have had it up to here with the way the banks have conducted themselves.  Indeed, I welcome what the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was doing earlier in his visit here to try to bypass that with the strategic bank.  Apart from investing in property, and that is damaging the economy, I do not envisage the Irish banks being able to invest in small and medium enterprises.<\/p><p>With regard to the PPS numbers and the NTMA, that is controversial.  In fact, the controversy this morning is their use by Irish Water.<\/p><p>Interest rates have never been so low.  What is holding back the development of the economy is the immense weight of debt we have.  Much of that debt was incurred by ill-advised capital investments in the past.  I recall when myself and Joe Durcan, a fellow economist, did a lecture series in the Institute of Public Administration for local authority members.  The view was that, in terms of appraisal of expenditure, anything would get through if it was called &quot;capital&quot;.  Capital will leave one with large debts and if there are no assets, one's debts gets larger and larger.  Therefore, we must assess the entire public capital programme.  I believe the Comptroller and Auditor General should be involved, as I said to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, earlier, because he knows the mistakes we have made previously.  It is his job to research them and he should be involved in this.  I will propose, in page 29 of the Bill, to involve him in giving guidance on how we spend the money.<\/p><p>I must apologise to the Minister.  The deadline for tabling amendments was before we heard him speak, so if he finds that some of the amendments relate to items he has already dealt with in his contribution, it was due to the timetable and is not a reflection on what he said to us.  On Committee Stage we will do our best to assist him in what is a very important exercise, and we will support him in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500037#QQ00200","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405443900,"counter":310,"content":"<p>It does not seem long ago since the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, and I started the European election campaign in the mart in Carnew.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him the best of luck in his term of office.  It is perhaps the most important junior Ministry in the State.<\/p><p>The Bill is hugely important.  As Senator Hayden said, we must acknowledge the success of the NTMA.  It is, perhaps, one of the better State agencies, being better administered and the most professional in the public service.  It is, to some extent, a victim of its own success.  It has experienced add-ons, bolt-ons and extensions which have made the structure unwieldy.  I also enjoy listening to Senator Barrett.  That unwieldy structure and, perhaps, lesser governance than what should be in place can sometimes lead to a deficiency.  To some extent, that is what this Bill is about, to have what is effectively a board of directors for the debt management, the ISIF fund, the National Development Finance Agency and the State Claims Agency.  I accept that the State Claims Agency does not fit awfully well there, to a degree, but the expertise of the people in that agency is probably better than anywhere else.<\/p><p>The really important aspect of this Bill for the public is the establishment of the ISI fund.<\/p> <p>That fund should operate in areas where a market deficiency exists.  I am not referring to taking risks in respect of certain projects, rather I am talking about situations where the lending institutions are not prepared to fund projects that will give rise to additional benefits which may not be obvious.  We must get people back to work.  It is as simple as that.  All of the efforts of the Oireachtas, local authorities and every other sector of society revolve around getting people back into employment.  We are concerned with removing them from the live register, where they are a cost, and getting them into employment, where they can pay taxes.  There is a dual benefit in this regard and if we are successful, the country will return to a financial position that will allow it to trade successfully.  I have not even mentioned the impact on the dignity of those who are obliged to go to their local post offices or to the 200 social welfare offices throughout the country in order to claim benefits.  Getting people back into employment leads to better social cohesion and better relationships.  It would put the country in the position in which we want it to be, namely, that which it occupied in the late 1990s and early 2000s before people went nuts as a result of their exposure to the opium of property.  If people return to work, the State will benefit.<\/p><p>I reiterate that the market deficiency is the really important aspect of this matter.  The investment should not be made in competition with other funding agencies, namely, the retail banks.  The latter are supposed to possess the relevant expertise but some of us have our doubts about that.  The structures the banks have put in place have created their own difficulties.  If there is a project that is jobs-laden, that is not an obvious risk and that has been scrutinised and analysed by people with ability who can see the wood for the trees, then it should proceed.  Senator Barrett has often referred to a lack of people in the Department of Finance who possess the necessary qualifications.  If a person is qualified in a certain discipline, he or she can sometimes be incapable of seeing the true benefit which may eventually be realised from a particular project outside his or her area of expertise.  We need to find a balance and I am not, under any circumstances, referring to taking risks.  However, we must take risks when it comes to getting people back to work.  Everything else is irrelevant.  There are 75,000 people in employment today who were not working this time last year.  I am always amazed why there is not more comment about this wonderful news story, particularly when people can discuss Garth Brooks incessantly for almost two weeks.  There has been no comment on the 75,000 people to whom I refer either entering or returning to the workplace because it does not sell newspapers.<\/p><p>I support section 22 but I would welcome more detail in respect of it.  The section states that the State will invest in energy, water, telecommunications, forestry and, on the basis of ministerial orders, other sectors.  That is somewhat vague.  ESB, Bord G&aacute;is and other entities are well capable of going out into their respective markets.  There will not be a deficit in the context of energy.  The latter is being funded by the EIB and other international entities.  That is not the deficit to which I am referring.  We must ensure that we know what are the other sectors referred to in section 22.  There is certainly a deficit within the hospitality sector.  There is a need for someone to step up in respect of this sector, particularly as we have witnessed the quantity of jobs created as a result of the reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9%.  However, there remains a deficit in this sector.<\/p><p>The final matter to which I wish to refer relates to the fact that the ISI fund should be examined in an analytical way.  On previous occasions I have highlighted the fact that there are certain urban areas throughout the country which contain certain sites that are crucial to their development.  I am not referring to a property tax break here.  I am concerned about brownfield sites and sites on which there are buildings which are close to dereliction in respect of which the market will not fund development projects because there would be no return to be obtained.  I am being cautious and cagey when I state that some of the fund should be made available in respect of the development of the sites.  If we do as I suggest, it will benefit the urban areas to which I refer.  There are 50 or 60 of these sites throughout the country, one of which is located in Courtown and of which the Minister of State is aware.  The site in question is the location of two boarded-up, derelict hotels which overlook a very small, quaint harbour.  It is not feasible to build a new hotel on the site because one could buy an existing one elsewhere for perhaps one half or one third of the cost of construction.  We cannot leave the site in question derelict in an area which has a population of 5,500 people.  The site is crucial to the urban setting of Courtown.  As already stated, there are 50 or 60 such sites throughout the country and the Minister of State may be familiar with some that are located in his constituency of Wicklow.<\/p><p>We must be proactive in respect of this matter.  We cannot sit and wait for the market to become involved.  If we do, the sites to which I refer will remain derelict for years.  Again, I am not talking about taking risks.  However, on occasions when the market is not prepared to become involved, the State should perhaps be prepared to step in.  There would be no need to commit the fund in its entirety to the projects in question, rather a percentage of it could be used.  We could be cautious in the beginning and set aside a certain amount in respect of a number of pilot projects which could be considered for investment either in the context of section 22 or the forthcoming budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500038#RR00200","speaker":"1160","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405444500,"counter":312,"content":"<p>It is an honour for Seanad &Eacute;ireann that the Minister of State made his maiden ministerial speech here.

A pension was a special kind of saving one made and certain rules applied in respect of it.  One could not touch one's pension.  If one experienced a very rainy day, one could not gain access to it.  One could only access one's pension on a particular date that had been determined many years previously.  In return, one received certain tax breaks and concessions.  One lost one's control over and discretion in respect of how one's money was spent in order to, as it were, make that deal.<\/p><p>I was troubled when I witnessed the scale of the catastrophe which struck our country in recent years, particularly in the context of the number of people who lost their businesses or whose homes were plunged into negative equity.  I had the idea - I could not act on it because we are not allowed to introduce money Bills in this House - that we should allow, on a discretionary basis, people who are in debt to access the lump sums in their pensions, pay a little more tax in respect of the money involved and use it to get themselves out of debt.  This would have had the effect of providing a degree of recapitalisation for the banks, of making loans perform better, of bringing more revenue into the Exchequer and of allowing people to, perhaps, save their businesses.  Ultimately, the latter might have resulted in the generation of much employment in the years to come.  Due to the fact that we are somewhat constitutionally limited in the context of what we can do in this House, I could not bring forward legislation.  When I discussed my proposal with some of the Minister of State's senior colleagues, they indicated that they thought it somewhat hare-brained.  However, I notice one or two of them have now adopted it and have put it forward in the Lower House.<\/p> <p>The conundrum we face is that while those in government tell me that I cannot use my pension fund to get myself out of debt, of which I would love to be free, they can use my pension fund to get themselves out of the debt that they have put me in.  That is reason I am a bit troubled by certain aspects of the specifics of this Bill.  I may not be great on the arithmetic - the points were a bit lower for medicine in my day although they were still pretty high.  The Minister of State referred to a portion of the fund being used to recapitalise the banks during the financial crisis - a portion sounds like something small and modest, but if I am doing the arithmetic correctly, the portion is two thirds of the fund.  The Minister of State is saying that bit is worth &euro;13 billion and what is left is somewhere shy of &euro;7 billion.  Possibly the &euro;13 billion has appreciated from a lower figure over the years when it was first invested but it seems that this was a relatively large proportion.<\/p><p>I also would have a little difficulty with the philosophical underpinning of the remark that bank capitalisation could indeed be resorted to again but only in exceptional circumstances and it is not envisaged that it would ever happen.  Who envisaged the original bank guarantee?  The nature of exceptional circumstances is that they tend to be the type of thing that one does not envisage but they happen.  The question is whether it was wise for us to use that money in this way at that time and whether it would be wise to allow a future Government to misbehave, overspend, under-tax and misinvest with the security blanket that it can still tap into the assiduously, carefully and prudently collected pension funds of its citizens through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, to say nothing of rating as has been done?  They are private pension funds, so people tend to be hit with a double whammy.  Perhaps things will be very different after the revolution but the coalition of people who gave us the bank guarantee - who as I recall were Sinn F&eacute;in, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and the rump of the PDs, with my honourable colleagues from the Labour Party across the House being the only dissenting voices at the time - are likely to still occupy some portion of a future coalition Government where the same decision could be made and the question is: do we want to give them that authority?  <\/p><p>On the question of who will work in it, how will their voices be heard, who will they represent and what conflicts of interest will they have, I am a little troubled by the idea that it appears that the board of the National Pensions Reserve Fund is being stood down and sucked into this whole thing.  Over the years we were always told that there should prudent pension managers and bank managers, people who follow the rules, who had fiduciary responsibilities in their dealings, who did not make crazy casino-like investments, who were careful and who looked after people's interests.  As we know, during the early years of this century, those rules became arbitrarily and unwisely rewritten and people started using those funds for all kinds of other speculative activities.  Bank managers stopped caring about a customer's ability to repay the loan and started caring more about their ability to get a bonus.  I am a little troubled that in all of this we appear to be losing the steadying hand of a cadre of people whose only job is to make sure there is money in the pension fund for a rapidly ageing society.  I was doing the arithmetic on those appointed to the new Cabinet.  I am 57 years old and if I was in the Cabinet I would be one of the younger third of the people in it.  The questions of the effective age are reaching all across the country but it seems we will have no one in the new dispensation at a high level whose only job is to look after the pensions at a time when we are going to need them more than ever.  <\/p><p>I do not want to paraphrase Einstein too much but I would refer to his famous quotation about the definition of lack of wisdom being to repeat the same mistakes.  We are institutionalising the position of the Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  With no personal disrespect to any of the recent incumbents, it is not immediately obvious that they have been extraordinary repositories of expertise in terms of the stewardship of the public finances over the past decade and I am not speaking of any in particular.  These seem to have been by and large with one exception appointed in accordance with traditional Civil Service career advancement policies even though a whole other group of people were being assiduously recruited through non-traditional, non-Civil Service pay grades, as the Minister of State told us in his opening contribution, presumably to attract the very best people with that particular skillset.  Were those people overruled by the people who were on the more traditional pay scales?  It seems that they probably were.  Do we have absolute clarity that there will be protection for whistleblowers in the new organisation because, as we have seen in recent years and we are to the point of this now being near folklore, we were told there was no one in the Department of Finance who had any financial expertise but in the case of Ms Mackle it now transpires there was but a decision was made not only to ignore her but to tell her to be quiet.  <\/p><p>Do we have guarantees that we will concentrate all of this diverse range of financial responsibilities into a unified bureaucracy and a unified board structure, with the protection that exists for dissenting voices because it was the failure of dissenting voices to be allowed exist, be articulated and be listened to that was a huge cause of the problem we faced?  As I said previously, and I am probably boring my Seanad colleagues when I say this, there were many folks who were responsible for the financial meltdown but the people who were most responsible were those in government.  The builders and the developers acted rationally in their own self-interest, not necessarily very wisely but they were in a system where there was a great deal money floating around and people had loans to buy houses they could not afford so the guys would build the houses.  The banks behaved rationally because there was credit flowing and they were getting bonuses for the more loans they gave.  The people who we paid and entrusted with the responsibility of acting not in their own rational self-interest but in the collective self-interest were Government Inc., both elected members and officialdom, and they were the ones who failed.  Will these new structures maximise the chance that this kind of systems failure will not occur again?<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister of State, it is very nice to have him here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

I am sure it is a great day for him and his family and I wish him the very best of luck.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill, as the purpose for which it is being introduced is an important one.  It goes without saying that in the past the National Treasury Management Agency showed that it could perform admirably with the responsibility put upon it, to which other Senators have alluded, even though at times very difficult tasks were given to it.  The NTMA was set up to cater for and manage State debt, to rearrange investment in such a way as to be of benefit to the economy.  It did so admirably and is to be lauded for what it has done.  Since then it has been expanded greatly.  For example, it now manages the National Pensions Reserve Fund, about which Senator Crown has just spoken at length, and acts as Ireland's agent for the purchase of carbon credits as well as handling the State's liabilities under the auspices of the State Claims Agency.  Its functions have increased greatly as has its scope and its personnel.  Its personnel has expanded to a larger degree than would be ideal.  I would not have the same exposure, on a professional basis, to the other areas in the NTMA as I have had to the State Claims Agency.  Even though, on the face of it, it does not seem appropriate for it be a part of the NTMA, the fact that it has real experts in the areas of litigation is to its credit.  It handles claims extremely well and in a very professional manner.  These liabilities to the State are a potential debt to it and I think it is fitting it is there.  It does more than handle costs, it handles claims in a very intricate and hands-on type of way.  That is something of huge benefit to the State.<\/p><p>As has been mentioned, this Bill will therefore work to streamline and simplify the structures of governance at the National Treasury Management Agency to enable a more integrated approach to the performance of its functions which have grown considerably since it was established in 1990.  When the agency began in 1990 it was not envisaged that it would have either the number of functions or personnel that it has today.  The agency will be reconstituted as a body with the chairperson and other members who will have overarching responsibility for the agency's existing debt management and State Claims Agency functions, the role in regard to infrastructure projects currently filled by the National Development Finance Agency, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and NewERA.  There will be no change in its role of providing business services and staff to the National Asset Management Agency which will continue to have its own separate board. <\/p> <p>This is important, as unsteadying NAMA's processes could be detrimental to its work.<br \/>The Bill also converts the NPRF into the Ireland strategic investment fund, ISIF, and gives it a statutory mandate to make commercial investments in Ireland that support economic activity and employment.  I agree with my colleague, Senator Michael D'Arcy, that it is the only show in town.  It must be encouraged by NAMA.  This provision is positive.  While I understand that some Members have reservations, it will allow us to unlock capital funding and enable businesses across the country through investment.<br \/>A concern was raised about the possibility of the ISIF being used for political pet projects and its board being stuffed.  As the then Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, pointed out in the D&aacute;il, this is a commercial fund; it will not invest in political pet projects and the public assets entrusted to it will not be frittered away.  The Secretaries General of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and the chief executive of NAMA will be <i>ex officio<\/i>members of the ISIF's board, thereby increasing transparency.  Board members would not be involved in political pet projects.  This is an important point, and the governance structure of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, is vital to its future success.<br \/>The agency's board will be appointed by the Minister, but the members of the investment committee, those who will discuss the investment processes, will not be appointed by the Minister.  Two must be members of the board, with the remainder appointed by the board of the NTMA with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  This secures the committee from direct political appointments.<br \/>I have every confidence that the ISIF's commercial mandate will be measured by its ability to attract private sector co-investors.  It seems the Bill will provide for the streamlining and simplification of the NTMA's governance structure, allowing it to continue performing as ably as it has to date and ensuring future successes.  I commend the Bill and thank the Minister of State for attending the House on his first day in office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500040#TT00200","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405445700,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.

However, it would be remiss of me not to mention some of our concerns with it, which were raised during its passage through the D&aacute;il.  Today, the Seanad discussed the strategic banking corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and how it might play a stimulus role.  Likewise, this Bill has the potential to move towards that model.  It is regrettable that the NTMA's mandate to invest in the real economy is so narrow.  The conditions attached to any investment are restrictive and undermine much of its potential.  It is disappointing that the social and environmental outcomes do not count for more in how the fund can be used.  Sinn F&eacute;in has always argued that the NPRF should be used to provoke stimulus in our stagnant economy.<\/p><p>I will address a number of negative points.  The Minister of State has probably anticipated that I will mention the legal promotion of NewERA.  The purpose of NewERA is to facilitate the sale of State assets, but we oppose the sale of profitable or strategically important assets.  It is noteworthy that the Bill does not compel the Minister to get the permission of the Oireachtas before selling assets.<\/p><p>I am trying to be brief, as much of what I want to discuss has already been debated.  We object to the narrow focus allowed to the investment committee when deciding where to invest.  As Senator Byrne and others mentioned, there should be a wider remit so that priorities such as housing programmes might be included.<\/p><p>It is also of concern that the one instance in which the Minister can give a straight direction to the fund is in the bailing out of banks and financial institutions.  This provision is contained in section 42 and was debated in the D&aacute;il, but a satisfactory reason was not given for its inclusion.<\/p><p>Although we have some concerns with the legislation, we want it to progress.  We all have the same goal - to stimulate the economy, help people return to work and encourage the creation of SMEs, which will employ people.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State in the coming period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500041#UU00400","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1405445700,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I thank the Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; for their warm welcome.  I accept the irony pointed out by Senator Crown and implied by Senator Byrne, but Senator Crown and I, as well as others, enjoyed robust debates and exchanges during the course of that referendum and I congratulated him on its democratic outcome, which I fully respect.  I look forward to engaging with Senators.  I respect them individually and the institution as a whole.  In my role with the OPW and procurement, if I can assist the House or Senators with issues, I will be more than happy to attend the House as often as required.  I look forward to that.<\/p><p>Senator Crown was also concerned - or, perhaps, impressed - with the speed at which I had equipped myself with knowledge of the Bill.  As he knows, the Lower House has already dealt with this legislation.  I was also a member of the Select Sub-Committee on Finance, which debated this Bill, so I was somewhat familiar with its provisions before my appointment today.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Reilly, who has left, and others for their kind comments.  While I am the youngest Member of the D&aacute;il, Senator Reilly has the honour of being the youngest Member of the Oireachtas.  That is nice to see in this House as well.<\/p><p>It is a terrible position to be in, but I must first apologise to the House for an error in my script.  My opening remarks referred to sections 54 and 55 as having been included on Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, but that was incorrect.  The correct sections are section 55, on ministerial guarantees in respect of public private partnerships, and section 56, on the use of PPS numbers by the NTMA.<\/p><p>I will respond to some of the issues that have been raised and look forward to a more robust and detailed exchange on them on Committee Stage, which I envisage will be later this week.  Senator Michael D'Arcy stated that the ISIF should be available for areas where there is a market deficiency and should not compete with banks in sectors that are already well serviced.  It is not intended that the ISIF displace areas that have adequate funding.  Quite the contrary, as the ISIF will have a commercial investment mandate.  As such, it can act as a catalyst to attract private sector co-investment in areas where financing is not readily available from traditional sources so that economic growth and employment might be fostered.  This addresses the issues referred to by Senators on all sides of the House.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett queried the section that allowed the NTMA to use a unique identifier for purchasers of its retail savings products.  I will outline the rationale for the House.  The agency needs to be able to distinguish between its clients, not just for the normal commercial purposes, but because it needs to monitor holdings where there are tax exemptions on interest up to certain limits.  There are also obligations under the EU savings directive.  In the Government's opinion, it would be an unwarranted waste of public money to require the NTMA to set up a parallel system of identification where there is already a ready-made State system.  This provision has been cleared by the Department of Social Protection and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p><p>Senators Byrne, Hayden and Reilly referred to social housing, a key priority for the Government that was reiterated in our recently published construction strategy and the statement of Government priorities that was published by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste on Friday.  I will focus on the Bill and the NTMA's functions in that regard.  The investment sectors in which NewERA will operate are those in which it already has expertise from its shareholder executive's activities.  Social housing is not one of those areas.  A role in that regard may be more suitable to other areas of the NTMA family.  For example, NAMA has co-operated actively with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, in seeking to match the residential stock controlled by its debtors and receivers with the requirements for social housing.  More needs to be done in that regard, and Senator Hayden has spoken on this point.  Investment in social housing will fall within the remit of the ISIF so long as it is commercial in nature.<\/p><p>I stress that one of the aims of the changes to the NTMA governance structures proposed in the Bill is to enable it to act in a more integrated manner in the performance of its functions.<\/p> <p>I might add, as Senator Aideen Hayden referred to it - this is important - that the NDFA already has statutory authority to enter into a PPP arrangement for the provision of social housing.  Perhaps this is something we might discuss further on Committee Stage and I look forward to engaging with Members on it.<\/p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett raised a number of issues, on which he proposes to table amendments on Committee Stage.  I very much appreciate his explanation and look forward to dealing with the amendments.  <\/p><p>The issue of the State Claims Agency was raised by Senators Aideen Hayden and Michael D'Arcy, among others.  I will outline the rationale for the change.  The State Claims Agency was set up in 2001 to manage claims for and against the State.  The setting up of the agency within the NTMA meant that it was possible to recruit the specialised staff needed to work in this area because it operated outside normal public sector structures.  The agency could offer market competitive salary levels to attract experienced people in mid-career from the private sector.  The Bill leaves the agency virtually untouched, apart from the dissolution of the policy committee.  It extends its remit to make it responsible for managing claims for costs arising from tribunals of inquiry.  I note the comments of Senator Thomas Byrne on how such tribunals are not fit for purpose and that there must surely be a better way to establish facts.<\/p><p>Senator John Crown raised the issue of whistleblowing and wondered whether there would be protection for whistleblowers in the reorganised agency.  I want to bring clarity to that issue.  Section 17 replaces section 14 of the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 which covers the disclosure of confidential information.  It updates the existing provision to take account of the new structures proposed for the NTMA and developments in the disclosure of confidential information since the NTMA was established.  The existing provision is strict.  It is an offence for a person to disclose information obtained in the course of carrying out duties on behalf of the agency.  The new section is more nuanced and, I hope, more progressive and welcome.  It will continue to be an offence to disclose, without the consent of the agency, information obtained while performing functions on its behalf.  This is essential, given that staff of the agency will have access to very sensitive commercial information.  However, it will not now be an offence to disclose confidential information in certain circumstances, including to the Minister for Finance or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where it may relate to the commission of an offence.  These qualifications means that there is now a route available for individuals who believe they should raise issues of concern outside the confines of the agency.  Just as it is essential, given the pivotal role of the agency in financing the State, that sensitive commercial information be protected, clearly it is also essential that individuals be able to bring justifiable concerns to an outside authority without the risk of committing an offence.  I welcome this provision in this Bill and the improvements made to it.<\/p><p>I am very grateful for the instructive engagement we have had on Second Stage and look forward to further engagement with Senators on Committee Stage.  I thank the Acting Chairman for her good wishes and look forward to working with Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500041#UU00500","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405446300,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State on his first outing in the House and thank him for his detailed responses to the questions asked by Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500042#VV00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405446300,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405446300,"counter":325,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500042#VV00400","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1405446300,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500042#VV00500","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405446300,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Wednesday, 16 July 2014.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2014: Order for Second Stage","time":1405446300,"counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500042#VV00700"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405446300,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Bill entitled an Act to amend and extend the Civil Registration Act 2004; to amend the Immigration Act 2003; and to provide for matters connected therewith.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405446300,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I move: \"That Second Stage be taken now.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500042#VV00900","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405446300,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2014: Second Stage","time":1405446300,"counter":332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500042#VV01100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405446300,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405446300,"counter":334,"content":"<p>The Civil Registration Act, 2004 represented a significant development in the provisions governing civil registration of life events in Ireland and was a major overhaul of legislation dating back to 1844.  The ten years since its enactment have seen significant changes in Irish society.  The aim of the Bill is to allow for the further modernisation of the civil registration service so as to better reflect the needs of society today.  I propose to offer some general observations on the rationale and general principles informing the content of this amending legislation and will then proceed to summarise the provisions of the Bill.<\/p><p>While there are many amendments contained in the Bill, the four principal amendments that will be provided for in the Bill are as follows.  It provides for the compulsory registration of the father's name on the birth certificate.  According to the annual report of the General Register Office, there were 69,209 births registered in Ireland in 2013.  Of these, 2,675 were non-marital births when no father's name was registered.  The legislation does not require the mother or the father to provide the father's details when registering the birth where the parents of a child are not married to each other.  The amendment seeks to address the current position by making the provision of such information compulsory, other than in exceptional circumstances.  This will underpin the rights of the child under EU legislation to have access to the details of his or her identity.  It will be a step towards ensuring full and accurate particulars are registered at the time of birth which will be of significant benefit to the child and future generations.<\/p><p>The issue of marriages of convenience is complex.  EU citizens and their families have the right to move and reside freely within the territories of the member states.  These rights also apply to non-EU national spouses of EU nationals.  Marriage, as an institution, has particular protection under the Constitution.  However, these rules are being abused by individuals who are using marriage to gain an automatic right of residency.  Our duty under the Constitution is to protect the institution of marriage and we aim to do this by introducing legislation which makes it more difficult to broker a marriage of convenience in the State.  <\/p><p>The legislation will introduce records of the deaths of Irish persons normally resident in the State who die while on short-term absences abroad.  Many Senators have raised this issue with me from time to time.  The death of a loved one is always a tragic and difficult event.  The new legislation will allow families to record the deaths of their loved ones in Ireland and, I hope, bring some comfort and closure to them.<\/p> <p>I take this opportunity to thank Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, who has campaigned for this issue to be addressed in legislation and brought forward a motion in the Seanad in that regard.  I also thank Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne for his work on a Private Members' Bill on the domestic registration of death records, which helped in the drafting of section 13 of this Bill.<\/p><p>Irish society has been enriched by the choices made by people from other countries and cultures to live, work and raise families here.  In certain instances, couples got married or had a civil partnership in their country's embassy in Ireland.  Unfortunately, these marriages and civil partnerships are not valid.  This Bill will, on a once-off basis, validate those marriages and civil partnerships that have already taken place in Ireland and which are still in existence.  The Bill also provides for a significant number of amendments to the 2004 Act, which will streamline the procedures of the civil registration service to provide an improved modern service to the public.<\/p><p>I give notice to the House of my intention to bring forward two amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  The first relates to the issue of civil partnerships which took place prior to the enactment of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  The amendment will provide for the retrospective regularisation of those civil partnerships.  The second amendment relates to the solemnisation of marriages in a public place.  It has been clarified that under the current legislation, marriages can be performed outdoors where the venue is open to the public.  However, further clarification is required for solemnisers to ensure such venues are appropriate for marriages to take place.<\/p><p>I will now summarise the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 establishes the Short Title and collective citation of the Act.  It further stipulates that the Act may come into force on such day or days as the Minister for Social Protection, by commencement order, may determine.<\/p><p>Section 2 provides for the definition of the term &quot;Principal Act&quot; used throughout the Bill as the Civil Registration Act 2004.<\/p><p>Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 2 of the 2004 Act by inserting new definitions that are required for this amending legislation.  This section also amends section 2 of the principal Act to make a marriage of convenience and civil partnership of convenience an impediment to marriage and civil partnership, respectively.<\/p><p>Section 4 provides for the amendment of section 17 of the 2004 Act to include that a superintendent registrar may designate a registrar to perform his or her functions where an absence such as extended leave or long-term illness occurs.<\/p><p>Section 5 amends section 19 of the principal Act and provides that a person who is a qualified informant must produce to the registrar any evidence, including documentary evidence, relating to a birth, as requested by the registrar.  The section further provides that a superintendent registrar may complete the registration of a birth where, in exceptional circumstances, a qualified informant has not signed the register to allow completion of the registration.  In addition, the section provides that a child who has attained the age of 18 years may be considered as a qualified informant in regard to the registration or re-registration of his or her own birth entry.<\/p><p>Section 6 amends section 22 of the principal Act and contains a number of amendments relating to the registration of the father's name where the parents are not married.<\/p><p>Section 7 provides for the re-registration of a birth and contains a number of amendments to section 23 of the principal Act.<\/p><p>Section 8 provides for the amendment of the principal Act by insertion of a new section 23A, which will provide for the re-registration of a birth of a child, on foot of a court order, where the parents were not married on the date of the birth.  The section provides that a mother or father or the adult child may apply to re-register a birth on foot of a court order granted under section 35 or 45 of the Status of Children Act 1987.<\/p><p>Section 9 provides for the amendment of the principal Act by insertion of a new section 25A, which provides that where the parents of the child cannot agree on a surname, the registrar may complete the registration by leaving the surname blank or, in cases where a surname is already registered, the existing surname shall remain.<\/p><p>Section 10 provides for the amendment of section 28 of the principal Act to allow for a stillbirth to be registered later than 12 months after it occurs.<\/p><p>Section 11 provides that the definition of a qualified informant of a death is extended to include a cohabitant, next of kin, personal representative or religious superior of the deceased, so that such an individual may register the death within three months.<\/p><p>Section 12 provides for the amendment of the principal Act by the insertion of a new section 42A, which provides that early neonatal deaths are notified to the superintendent registrar of the area where the death occurred.<\/p><p>Section 13 provides for the amendment of the principal Act by the insertion of a new Part 5A, which provides for a record of deaths of Irish citizens who die abroad and who were ordinarily resident within the State within five years prior to their death.<\/p><p>Section 14 amends section 46 of the principal Act and provides that couples who produce a court order exempting them from giving three months' notice of intention to marry will be required to pay the marriage notification fee.  This section also provides that, where one or both of the people giving notice of intent to marry is a foreign national, he or she must provide to a registrar information and documentary evidence regarding his or her immigration status.<\/p><p>Section 15 amends section 46 of the principal Act and provides for new procedures regarding potential marriages of convenience.<\/p><p>Section 16 amends the principal Act by the insertion of a new section 58A, which provides for the validation of certain marriages carried out at foreign embassies in the State.<\/p><p>Section 17 amends section 59B of the principal Act and provides that couples who produce a court order exempting them from giving three months' notice of their intention to enter into a civil partnership will be required to pay the prescribed fee as set out in regulations.  Section 17 also provides that where one or both of the people making a notification of their intention to enter into a civil partnership is a foreign national, he or she must provide documents and information regarding his or her immigration status.<\/p><p>Section 18 provides for the amendment of section 59C of the principal Act by amending the validation period of a civil partnership registration form to six months from the date of the intended ceremony specified in the form.<\/p><p>Section 19 provides for the amendment of section 59D of the principal Act by providing that the registrar is no longer required to issue a copy of the civil partnership registration form.<\/p><p>Section 20 amends section 59F of the principal Act and provides for new procedures regarding potential civil partnerships of convenience.<\/p><p>Section 21 amends the principal Act by the insertion of a new section 59I which provides for the validation of certain civil partnerships carried out at foreign embassies in the State.<\/p><p>Section 22 amends section 61 of the principal Act and provides that where a person is required to provide proof of identity to a Government body in the form of a life event certificate, the Minister may prescribe a reduced-cost certificate for these purposes.  This section also provides that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, on application to him or her and on payment of any prescribed fee, shall allow a person to search certain historical registers online.<\/p><p>Section 23 amends section 64 of the principal Act and provides that where an entry in the register of births, stillbirths or deaths is based on false and misleading information, the registrar general may direct a registrar to cancel the entry and, if required, register the details under a new entry.  The section further provides that where a court order of nullity is provided for reasons other than an impediment, the entry may be cancelled in the register of marriages or civil partnerships, as required.<\/p><p>Section 24 amends section 66 of the principal Act and provides for sharing of information with Departments and agencies under the relevant Acts for specific purposes, so that the information may be used for policy and planning initiatives.<\/p> <p> Section 25 amends section 67 of the principal Act and provides that the Minister for Social Protection may set the fee for certificates at a lesser amount if the certificates are required to prove age, civil status or death to another Government Department or required for official purposes.  This section also provides that a fee, if any, shall be payable to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in respect of the performance by that Minister of his or her functions under the principal Act.  This is in regard to accessing information about births over 100 years ago, marriages over 75 years ago and deaths over 50 years ago.  It will be a significant opening up, allowing people to search the registers for genealogy and other purposes.<\/p><p>Section 26 amends section 68 of the principal Act and provides that where the Registrar General has directed that an entry be registered or re-registered without the register being signed by a qualified informant, the details of that entry shall be deemed to be valid.  Section 27 amends section 69 of the principal Act by the insertion of a new subsection 5(a), which provides that a person shall be guilty of an offence if they fail to furnish evidence, including documentary evidence, where it is in their power to do so, when requested by a registrar.<\/p><p>Section 28 amends section 70 of the principal Act and provides that the new subsection 69(5A), referred to in section 27, is added to the sections of the Act under which a person is guilty of an offence.  Section 29 amends the First Schedule to the principal Act and provides for the deletion of the &quot;age next birthday&quot; of a deceased person in the register of deaths so that more accurate statistical information can be gathered based on the deceased person's actual date of birth.<\/p><p>Section 30 amends the Immigration Act 2003 to include the Civil Registration Act 2004 in section 8 of that Act to allow the Minister for Social Protection to request information from certain information holders, as defined under that Act, for the purposes of the Civil Registration Act 2004.<\/p><p>This Bill provides for some significant changes to the Civil Registration Act 2004 and it puts the registration service more in tune with the Ireland of today.  It provides for having fathers' names on birth certificates and the ability to register the death of somebody who died abroad while ordinarily resident in Ireland, having perhaps gone on a holiday and met with a fatal accident.  Hopefully, this may be of some comfort.  There is also the further opening up of important historical records for genealogy purposes relating, as I said, to births over 100 years ago, marriages over 75 years ago and deaths over 50 years ago.  I look forward to an informed debate and to hearing the views of Senators on the measures contained in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500042#VV01300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405447500,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House in her new role.  I wish her well in her enhanced responsibilities and in regard to the great honour that has been bestowed on her.  I have no doubt she will carry out her responsibilities with her usual efficiency.<br \/>I welcome the legislation.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill, which provides for a number of positive changes to civil registration in Ireland, including the compulsory registration of the father's name on birth certificates.  The legislation will also make it more difficult to make a marriage or civil partnership of convenience within the State.  It will ensure that the death of an Irish person abroad is recorded and allow for the validation of foreign embassy marriages and civil partnerships that have already taken place in Ireland and that are still in existence.<br \/>In fact, in looking through the Bill, I have been struck by its human dimension.  There is a great deal of humanity in it and, while legislation generally can be dry and dull, and somewhat obtuse and abstract, the impact of some sections of this Bill on people's lives will be quite profound.  For example, section 8 provides for the re-registration of a birth of a child, where the parents were not married on the date of the birth, on foot of a court order.  While perhaps not important in the current situation or at the time the registration is made, in adult life subsequently it will be very important and relevant to the individual concerned.  Section 10, again looking at the human dimension, allows for a stillbirth to be registered later than 12 months after the occurrence of the stillbirth, because it is a very traumatic experience.<br \/>Section 14, interestingly, provides that couples who produce a court order exempting them from giving three months' notice of intention to marry will be required to pay a fee.  It also provides that, where one or both of the people giving notice of intent to marry is a foreign national, they must provide to a registrar information and documentary evidence regarding their immigration status.  The Minister might explain on what grounds a couple would go before a court looking for a three-month exemption, given that is it is not spelled out why that would happen.<br \/>I wholeheartedly endorse the sections of the Bill which provide for new procedures regarding potential marriages of convenience.  This was a blight on Ireland in the past.  The Government got caught on the hop in 1997 or 1998, when the Celtic tiger economy kicked in and Ireland began to have a pull factor for people.  Then, of course, in 2004, when we effectively opened the gates to ten new EU countries, the House may remember there was a great deal of controversy over alleged cases of heavily pregnant women coming into Ireland specifically for the purpose of having their children born here so they could automatically claim Irish citizenship and nationality.  Those loopholes are being closed off and this is the latest step in that regard.<br \/>Citizenship is a very precious gift.  For those who might feel that legislation of this sort is somehow bordering on being anti-foreign, it is protecting the integrity of our citizenship.  There is no question about this issue.  There have been television documentaries, not only in Ireland but also in Britain, demonstrating that quite frankly unscrupulous men and equally unscrupulous women who wanted to avail of the lax laws in this country came here and had marriages of convenience primarily or exclusively for the purpose of becoming Irish citizens.  I wholeheartedly welcome this change because not only is it ensuring the integrity of citizenship but, as the Minster said, it is protecting the sanctity of marriage, and marriage is very precious gift as well.<br \/>The same could be true of the succeeding sections.  Section 16 provides for the validation of certain marriages carried out at foreign embassies in the State.  Again, I remember there being some controversy about this some years ago.  It became an issue when people who had had their marriage validated in the embassy of their country in this or some other country found when they came to Ireland that the marriage was not recognised.  It is interesting that the Minister referred to the fact this was a once-off situation and that the Bill would validate marriages carried out in such a fashion that had already been registered.  Does this mean it does not apply from the time the Bill is enacted and is only retrospective?  Section 21, which provides for the validation of certain civil partnerships carried out at foreign embassies in the State, is welcome.<br \/>Section 24 provides for the sharing of information with Government Departments and agencies under the relevant Acts for specific purposes in order that the information may be used for policy and planning initiatives.  I was interested to note that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is included in this section, along with the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister might explain the background to this amendment of section 66 of the principal Act, which refers to:<blockquote>(i) &ldquo;the Road Safety Authority and any person, being a person with whom that Authority has an agreement ... to whom the Authority requests the Minister to give the information&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Minister for Transport&rdquo;, and<br \/>(ii) &ldquo;learner permits&rdquo; for &ldquo;provisional licences&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>The Minister for Health is involved where the Bill refers to: &ldquo;the Minister or the Executive, hospital or&rdquo;, and the Minister for Education and Skills is also involved.<\/p> <p>I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will have an opportunity to expand a little on section 24 as to what the purposes of providing this information will be.  I can appreciate that the Department of Education and Skills needs it for policy and planning initiatives.  I am sure there are valid reasons, but I am curious to know what they are.  <\/p><p>Section 29 provides for the deletion of the words &quot;age next birthday&quot; from the register of deaths.  I have always been fascinated by the request made on a lot of forms, particularly those used by insurance companies.  I could never understand the relevance of the question on one's age and I am sure the Minister will give the background information on why the provision has been included and will put the matter in context.  I welcome the provision and the section is a sensible one.  <\/p><p>Section 30 allows the Minister for Social Protection to request information from certain information holders, as defined under the Bill, but I could not find anything which expanded on the provision.  The amendment of the Immigration 2003 is provided for in Part 3 which contains section 30 and comprises two lines that read: &quot;amended ... by the insertion of &quot;or the Civil Registration Act 2004&quot; after &quot;Social Welfare Acts&quot;.&quot;  Perhaps the Minister might expand a little on the information she will request and identify the certain information holders from which she will request it.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it forward.  Some of the sections were delayed far too long by the previous Administration and it has taken three and half years to get to this stage.  For the vast majority of the population the Bill will not have much relevance.  Overall, it is humanely balanced legislation that will have a very positive and profound impact on certain sections of the population.  Inclusiveness is what society should be about; it is what the Government is about and what most politicians want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500044#XX00200","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405448100,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the T&aacute;naiste and congratulate her on her new appointment.  I wish her every success in the future.<br \/>I join the Children's Rights Alliance in describing the Bill as the most important reform in family law for generations and will concentrate on two changes made in it.  As Senators know, the name of the non-marital father of a newborn was not required to be registered.  Under the old system, if the mother of a child refused to register the father's name, a court order was required for the father to be granted guardianship rights, which was an injustice.  This legislation will address the issue by requiring the mother and the father of the child to provide information for the registrar of births, notwithstanding the fact that they are not married.  The right of a child to know both of his or her parents is a fundamental one and I am glad that the Government has recognised it in statute by making it compulsory for such information to be provided.  The exceptional circumstances where a mother may not give information have been defined as follows:<blockquote>(a) she does not know the identity of the father of the child;<br \/>(b) she does not know the whereabouts of the father of the child;<br \/>(c) she believes that providing the information is not in the best interests of the safety of the child and in that case the statutory declaration shall contain and, as necessary, exhibit information, particulars and evidence relating to that belief.<\/blockquote>I am given to understand the jurisprudence of the European Court and the courts here has moved towards the provision of much greater clarity in terms of children having the right to know the identities of their parents.  Even in a case in which someone is loath to include the birth father's name on the certificate - I am sure we can all think of such cases - it is understandable that it be done if only to provide, in these days of rapid medical advances, information to assist in the identification of genetic abnormalities, for example.  I note that the legislation contains quite properly and adequately avenues for a review and-or appeal of a registrar's decision to include the natural father's name on the certificate should the mother not give her consent.  I presume that, in the circumstances, the Minister is satisfied that where the mother believes providing the information is not in the best interests of the safety of the child that this wording provides the strongest safeguard that can be included.  Notwithstanding this, the amendment is progressive, warranted and welcome.<br \/>I welcome the arrangements to ensure marriages of convenience do not occur.  We still have a provision that allows for a truncated notice period to marry.  However, section 14 ensures the registrar will have adequate legislative provisions to investigate and prevent any marriage of convenience where one of the parties is a national of another state.  Additionally, section 15 provides further powers and criteria to assist the registrar in determining whether a proposed marriage would be a marriage of convenience.  There is a provision whereby the superintendent registrar is obliged to inform the immigration authorities when the conclusion has been reached that such a marriage is being planned.  <br \/>I very much welcome the legislation because it is commonsense, modern and takes into consideration the varied family forms in Ireland today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500045#YY00200","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1405448100,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste.  I also welcome Mr. Brian Sheehan from GLEN who is in the Visitors Gallery.<\/p><p>We received the Bill in the latter part of last week and it is exciting to see how it has been changed and cleaned up.  It now addresses quite a number of human issues.  On each reading of the Bill I found myself asking questions about how I would use my time today.  Some questions can be dealt with in the Bill, while others may have to be dealt in other legislation.  However, we need to be cognisant of them as we make changes to the Bill.<\/p><p>My first question relates to the proposed amendment on civil registration.  I am concerned to ascertain whether a civil partnership ceremony conducted, for example, in the British Embassy in 2008 will be covered by section 21.  I understand the amendment covers it.  <\/p><p>My colleagues will not be surprised to learn that I want to raise the substantive issues of compulsory joint registration of births and the registration of the father's name.  As a keen amateur genealogist, I am aware that the General Register Office comes under the auspices of the Department.  I also do not want anybody to believe this is purely a maintenance issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500045#YY00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1405448100,"counter":341,"content":"<p>It is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500045#YY00400","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1405448100,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I know, which is why I have identified the issue.  As a genealogist, I know that the office is under the auspice of the Minister's Department.  Some have tried to suggest this is what the Bill is about, but that was not my perception on reading it.<br \/>The starting point for me is Article 8 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the preservation of identity.  It states children have a right to an identity, an official record of who they are and that governments should respect their right to a name, a nationality and family ties.  M<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">ost days we must deal with competing rights and I find myself questioning some of the issues involved.  We all accept that the birth certificate of a child should provide all necessary available and accurate information on his or her origins.  Today, I have read a publication by Treoir that claims denying information on identify can cause pain, anguish and genealogical bewilderment, a claim with which I fully agree.  In an effort to better safeguard a child's right to an identity the Bill seeks to make the provision of such information compulsory, save in exceptional circumstances.  We need to explore some of the competing rights and strike the appropriate balance.  Section 6(1D) lists compelling reasons that exempt the mother from her legal obligation to provide details of the father.  They are as follows:<\/font><blockquote>(a) she does not know the identity of the father of the child; <br \/>(b) she does not know the whereabouts of the father of the child;<br \/>(c) she believes that providing the information is not in the best interests of the safety of the child...<\/blockquote>In circumstances where the mother of the child maintains that she does not know the identity of the father, will the Minister consider establishing a register of men who believe they are a father?  It would mean, for example, that if a mother opted to place her child for adoption, the issue of authentication of the potential father's claim could be addressed before the adoption could commence.  If a mother says she does not know the identity of the father of her child and the child is placed for adoption, how do we ensure the right of somebody who believes he is the father is upheld?  <br \/>Another way to deal with the issue is to give effect to the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in its 2010 report entitled, Legal Aspects of Family Relationships.  In section 2.17 it called for a &quot;system for a non-marital father to register his name on the birth certificate of a child in the absence of agreement with the mother&quot;.  That recommendation led me to be immediately concerned about how the best interests of the child would be defined in such an instance.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister explain why the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission of Ireland report in this regard were not brought forward in this Bill?  The Law Reform Commission report recommended that exemption should extend to circumstances in which the mother has reason to fear for her safety as well as that of her child.  I realise this is one of the competing rights.  I strongly believe in a child's right to identity but often we have to deal with familial abuse, domestic violence, rape and incest.  How does addressing these cases fit in with the right to identity?  How do we ensure we draw the balance in the right place each time?<\/p><p>In some not-so-rare and extremely unfortunate cases, the pregnancy of a child is the result of familial abuse and incest.  In circumstances where, for example, a 14-year-old girl registers the birth of a child, regardless of whether she is in the care of the State, known to State agencies or perhaps not known, is there a mechanism for the automatic involvement of the Child and Family Agency to ensure that all child protection and welfare considerations are examined?  Let us consider a case where a 14-year-old is asked to register the birth name of the father.  Unfortunately the period of pregnancy is not long enough for us to bring these cases to court.  How we handle these situations is a matter of concern.<\/p><p>A more peripheral issue is that of surrogacy.  I realise this will be dealt with in the Children and Family Relationships Bill but this point is more to do with registration.  I have heard of cases in which we do not check the identity of mothers.  For example, I could move to a different part of the country, register myself in another woman's name and have the baby.  Then, the intended mother could register the birth in her name.  In effect this amounts to a surrogacy arrangement without the knowledge of the State.  I may go somewhere else in the country because in most cases neither doctors nor hospitals check the identity of the birth mother.  This is an issue and I wonder whether we could examine it.  I am unsure what the solution is and I am not suggesting we give every woman a DNA test, but perhaps we should consider requiring identification at the time of registering with the doctor or hospital and not only at the time of registering the birth, because I have seen it as a way of getting around surrogacy issues.<\/p><p>The final issue I wish to raise is peer consent.  We all agree that the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration in determining the legislative framework to ensure joint registration of births.  However, to maximise compliance and thus safeguard the child's right to identity and to be aware of who her parents are, we need to revisit the uncomfortable issue of consensual peer sexual activity.  I will not go through the figures but it happens in Ireland.  Let us consider the current arrangements under the Children First guidelines relating to withholding information.  There is a real danger that women may refuse to name the fathers of their children on the birth register or involve them in the lives of their babies for fear of prosecution of the young father.  Young fathers will continue to be advised by solicitors not to enter their name in the register of births or apply to become the child's legal guardian as they have committed a criminal offence.  The rights of children to have the name of the father on the birth certificate and to have relationships with their fathers could be seriously affected where young fathers are inhibited from putting their names on birth certificates and applying for joint guardianship rights in respect of their children.  I understand the Garda and the DPP use their discretion and tend to overlook the circumstances of a relationship before deciding whether to prosecute.  I propose that the discretionary powers of the DPP in respect of such decisions should be placed on a statutory footing.  Perhaps we could consider whether no prosecution of a child under 17 years should proceed without the consent of the DPP.  This would recalibrate the arrangement.<\/p><p>I was going to bring up the motion we put forward in the House with Senator Bacik and the Labour Party Senators - I had the honour to second it - relating to marriage age and how certain exemptions may apply.  Perhaps we can explore that another time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500045#YY00500","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405448700,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House.  She was here last week with the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill but it seemed to end so quickly.  She disappeared and we did not have a chance to congratulate her on her new position.  I am pleased the T&aacute;naiste has chosen to stay on in the Department of Social Protection because she is a very good Minister for Social Protection.  Now she has a little help on board but that may mean we might not see her as often.<\/p><p>There are several amendments and welcome changes in the Bill.  Like others, I welcome the amendment that will make it the duty of the mother and father to provide information in respect of the birth of a child.  I welcome the fact that the father's name is to be registered on the birth certificate for two reasons.  In this country there are many single fathers fighting for the right to be involved in their child's life.  I know many who are regularly in court fighting for access and visitation rights.  When we speak or think of single parents, we immediately think of the mother.  However, more and more nowadays fathers are taking over the role and for those who continue to fight for their rights, this is a step in the right direction.<\/p><p>There are fathers who shirk their responsibilities, deny they are a child's father and refuse to pay maintenance.  As long as the mother provides the name of the father the registrar can make contact with the father and ask him to attend to register his details.  It is only right that the father be named.  However, I note that if the father does not bother to turn up at the registry office then the registrar can complete the registration with no details of the father.  I wonder whether this is an opt-out for people who simply do not bother turning up with the result that their name will not be on the birth certificate.<\/p><p>One concern I have about the process is that it will be lengthy in some cases and the registration of a birth may be delayed.  This can cause problems for child benefit and one-parent family applications given the lack of a birth certificate.  I welcome the fact that a provision is being made to omit the father's name.  I will not go through these points again because we all know them.  My colleagues have outlined the reasons for possible omission.  Such a case could arise if the mother does not know the whereabouts of the father.  I believe in this case she should still provide the name, even if she does not know the whereabouts.  Perhaps the registrar or the Department may be able to track him down.<\/p><p>Children, especially when they become adults, have every right to know who their biological father is.  Too often we watch programmes or we read about people trying to find their biological mother or father.  They feel incomplete until they know who they are and they cannot know this until such time as they know all about their biological parents, mother and father.  At least if the name of the mother and the father appeared on the birth certificate, such people have a starting place.  This will be a positive amendment.<\/p><p>I wish to highlight a matter relating to the registration of deaths.  I have spoken to the Minister about this previously.  The public do not realise or know the procedure for registering a death.  They have no idea that they must have photographic identification or a personal public service number when registering.  Many people do not even know that they have to register the death and believe that the doctor does it, as in the old days.  Then, when they seek a death certificate they find the death is not registered and they must take it upon themselves to do it.  Then they may find that they do not have a passport, photographic identification or a PPS number to hand and they have to go away again.  Perhaps the Department of Social Protection should prepare a pack to be distributed to undertakers, who could sensitively supply the information to the bereaved or next of kin.<\/p><p>I welcome in particular the setting up of a register to record the death of Irish citizens who die abroad.  I appreciate that it will not replace a death certificate issued by the country of death.  However, an Irish person who dies abroad either suddenly or who may have spent some of her retirement abroad may wish to have the death registered in her own country because it was her home.  I know of people whose relatives have died abroad.  They have found it unfinished, for the want of a better expression, that the death of their loved one is not recorded in their homeland.  Would this record of death suffice for pensions, insurance policies or legal matters or would the family still need to get a certificate from the country in which the person died?  I have met people from several families who were holidaying abroad when a member of the family died suddenly.  There is considerable red tape involved in trying to get the body home and then securing a death certificate afterwards especially if it is not an English-speaking country.<\/p><p>I welcome the amendment that necessitates the production of documents and information regarding immigration status if one of the persons giving intent to marry is a foreign national.  This will help to stamp out marriages of convenience.  I also welcome section 15, which will allow the registrar to notify the Department of Justice and Equality if he or she believes it to be a marriage of convenience.  This will allow immigration authorities to investigate the situation.<\/p><p>Other issues could have been dealt with under this Bill, including forced marriages and child marriages.  My colleagues, Senator Bacik and van Turnhout, recently moved a motion in the Seanad on these issues.  I believe a golden opportunity was missed by not dealing with these issues.<\/p> <p>I also wanted to mention the issue of birth certificates for people who have been adopted, which I know is close to the Minister's heart and mine as my father was adopted.  I understand that there are two birth certificates - one which is closed containing the person's original birth details such as the name of the birth mother and the birth name of the baby and one to which they have access and which contains the adoptive name.  Does the Minister propose to allow adoptees to have easy access to their original birth certificates?  People are entitled to what is rightfully theirs and also have a right to know their biological parents and their medical history.  I know that when my children were young and the doctors asked me about my family history, I had no idea about the medical history of my father's side.  We could not supply the information because we did not have it.  I knew my grandmother but we certainly did not know my grandfather.  Most adoptees' birth certificates contain the mother's name and rarely contain the father's name, which makes tracing them very difficult.  As Senator Mooney noted, it will be a great help to have fathers' names on birth certificates.  <\/p><p>I welcome this Bill.  It makes a change to be in here dealing with a social welfare Bill that is not controversial.  Again, as other Senators have said, it shows that there is a human side and that the Minister gave much thought and compassion to this Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500046#ZZ00200","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405449300,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an T&aacute;naiste.

Although we appreciate that there are some very welcome elements in this Bill, we have serious concerns about the way it has been brought forward.  I share many of the concerns raised by Senator van Turnhout.  This is a very complex Bill with 30 different elements and four general areas.  There are some very serious legal, social and ethical questions that should have been teased out more before the Bill even came to us here on Second Stage.  We had first sight of this Bill last Thursday and it is already commencing Second Stage.  There has been insufficient time to consider properly the Bill's contents in advance of this debate.  In its Bills Digest, the Oireachtas Library and Research Service noted that it was not possible to deal at all with 14 sections of the Bill due to the short time between publication and Second Stage.  There was no Oireachtas committee pre-legislative scrutiny stage despite the Government's many D&aacute;il reform promises.  This Bill requires a pre-legislative stage and today's debate should be adjourned until this has been done.<\/p><p>Proposals to introduce compulsory registration of fathers' names give rise to important ethical questions, some of which have been mentioned here.  These should be thoroughly deliberated upon before we even begin to consider the practical content of any associated legislation.  The proposed Children and Family Relationships Bill has been the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.  The heads of that Bill raise related matters and ethical questions.  The two Bills should be considered together.  The Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill should not be rushed through in this way.  <\/p><p>Section 6 provides for compulsory registration of all fathers on birth certificates.  Ethical questions include the child's right to their identity and information on medical history and genetics.  As we all know, Ireland is a very small place and there are many issues that could arise because of that.  Other issues include fathers' rights to involvement in their children's lives regardless of marital status and the safety and welfare of the child and its mother, as has been alluded to previously.  Practical questions include the suitability of a statutory declaration process which may heap further trauma on some already vulnerable women on the one hand or become an unworkable farce on the other.  These are all questions that require very thorough consideration.  The Minister's desire to further shrink the one parent family payment scheme cannot justify the rushing through of this legislation with these important ethical questions left insufficiently considered.  <\/p><p>Likewise, the proposal to divine and ban marriages of convenience gives rise to complex ethical questions of privacy and proportionality.  All we need to do is look at the recent scandal over racial profiling relating to Roma children to see how that can happen in a very practical way.  Despite having zero concrete knowledge of the scale of so-called marriages of convenience, this Bill proposes to introduce intrusive powers for registrars to examine intimate details of relationships involving a foreign national.  Perhaps the Minister could provide us with statistics around so-called marriages of convenience.  The registrar's opinion is to be based on a set of value judgments that have not been subjected to public debate or consideration.  The potential for racial profiling is very significant.  While we were speaking about foreign nationals who might be affected by this Bill, what struck me was the question of how people living in direct provision would be affected by this.  These are people who were seeking asylum; who had to flee persecution in their own lands; who were unable to bring documents with them; who might have been in the asylum process in this country for eight, nine, ten or 11 years; and who do not have access to base documents in the country they fled.  How would their situation be resolved if they want to enter into a civil partnership?  <\/p><p>A very legitimate point was raised about the best interests of the child.  While we are on this issue, I take this opportunity to raise the issue of children of asylum seekers who were born here.  We have issues with a number of those children whose nationality is stateless to some extent.  They were born here but, because of the legislation we have here, cannot claim Irish citizenship.  It did not strike me until Senator van Turnhout spoke.  There are teenagers who have come here, who are now coming to the age of maturity and who may wish to have children, etc.  How will their situation be affected if they cannot have an Irish birth certificate or if they are in a stateless position?  <\/p><p>This Government promised us openness, transparency, etc.  Making this Bill available to us on Thursday and debating it today when it involves some very complex ethical, social and legal issues is simply not good enough.  There should have been much more pre-legislative discussion and consultation on this Bill.  Although many of the principles the Minister is bringing forward are important and we would agree with many of them, we feel there should have been far more teasing out of these issues before the Bill was brought before the House tonight.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500047#AAA00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1405449300,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time with Senator Bacik.

I know there will be exceptions and I obviously share some of the concerns about how those exceptions will be made and the matters surround that.  While it is very clear that the father's name should be on the birth certificate in respect of the rights of the child, there are moments when that will cause great difficulty.

It is a Bill that will benefit from the detailed scrutiny we will give it in the Seanad on Committee Stage.  We always appreciate when Ministers initiate Bills in the Seanad.  The Bill is about modernising the civil registration service and updating the 2004 Act, which was the major codifying civil registration law.  Other Members spoke about significant amendments provided for in the Bill.  I thank the Minister for accepting my amending Bill to the Civil Registration Act, which has enabled the Humanist Association of Ireland to conduct legal wedding ceremonies.  It has made a huge difference to many couples.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister in her speech on Second Stage to introduce an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage to confirm the legality of conducting weddings out of doors once they conform to the rules on public places.  The Humanist Association of Ireland had issues about this and I made representations to the Minister on this point.  I am glad the matter has been resolved but it would be good to have an amendment that clarifies it and puts it beyond doubt.<\/p><p>Senators Moloney and van Turnhout referred to child marriage and the motion proposed by Labour Party Senators on 25 June, which was seconded by Senator van Turnhout in a cross-party initiative.  The Private Members' motion asked the Government to consider removing or amending the statutory provision allowing minors to marry on the basis of a court exemption.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, dealt with the matter but we are glad the Government committed, on foot of the motion, to setting up an interdepartmental working group with officials from the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice and Equality on how best to deal with the issue.  The issue concerns section 31 of the Family Law Act 1995, which provides the minimum legal age at which people can get married as 18 years, but section 33 of the Act allows a couple to apply to the court for an exemption to the rule where one or both are aged under 18 years.  Section 2(2) of the Civil Registration Act 2004 maintains the facility to apply for this exemption.  The new Bill is about amending the Civil Registration Act and it might be appropriate to examine changing the law on child marriage in an amendment to this Bill.  The Government has accepted the Labour Party motion and will be examining the matter.  We were very concerned about children being coerced into entering marriage and many of us were shocked at the figures produced by the Minister for Justice and Equality on the number of couples applying for exemptions and the number of people marrying who are under 18 years.  It deserves a review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500048#BBB00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1405449900,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House.  I congratulate her on her new position and particularly on being elected the first female leader of the Leader Party and on promotion to the position of T&aacute;naiste.  It is a considerable personal achievement to become the third female T&aacute;naiste of the country.  I wish her all the best in her role.<br \/>The Bill contains a number of provisions on issues such as marriages of convenience, recording the deaths of Irish people who passed away abroad and the validation of embassy marriages and civil partnerships.  Like others, I will focus on the compulsory joint registration of births.  Knowing the identity of both parents is an essential human right and one that is recognised under Irish law, the European Convention on the Rights of the Child and international instruments.  It is essential that, where at all possible, children should have the opportunity to know and have relationships with both parents.  Denying children and continuing to deny adopted adults information on their parents' identity deprives them of their identity.  It takes away a part of themselves that they will never know.  There is great cruelty in that.  We should go out of our way to ensure children have access to the basic information on the names and identities of their parents.<br \/>I welcome the fact that the legislation is moving towards ensuring joint registration.  Issues must be teased through, as mentioned by Senators, in respect of the best interest of the child.  Irish history has treated unmarried fathers dreadfully badly.  They have been denied what married fathers automatically have, a right to guardianship and to be involved in the decisions that affect their children.  Regardless of their relationship with the mother or the child, unmarried fathers have no automatic right.  If the mother is unwilling to sign a declaration adding the father's name to the birth certificate or agreeing to guardianship, a father must fight through the courts to get it.  It is incredibly unfair, particularly where the father has been involved and had a relationship with the mother or where he has been emotionally, physically and financially involved in the child's life.  He must still prove himself as a parent through the courts.  That is wrong and we are so far behind on this issue.<br \/>Separate issues include registration of births and guardianship.  Some countries provide that once the father's name is registered on the birth certificate, there is an automatic presumption of guardianship, which can then be rebutted if there is a good reason why the man is not fit to be a father.  We need to look at the guardianship issue.  It would be remiss of me not to raise the right of adopted people to their birth certificates, which I raised with several of the Minister's counterparts.  It relates specifically to the brief of the T&aacute;naiste.  Adopted people in the UK have had a right to their birth certificates since 1975 yet, 40 years later, Irish adoptees do not have that right.  As a result, they are robbed of their identity and basic medical information.  For 29 years of my life, when a doctor asked me if there was a genetic illness or whether anyone in the family had cancer or heart disease, I had to tell him I did not know.  That question did not involve my thinking of the medical aspects but also made me sad because it made me think about all the other things I did not know about my mother.  The T&aacute;naiste has spoken publicly about her experience in that regard and how she found information on her birth family.  Every adoptee should have that right.  The T&aacute;naiste and I have been fortunate in getting that information.  I was one of a handful of people who were matched through the adoption contact preference register, where the matching rate is dismal.  It is past time that the State was proactive in giving adoptees the right to their birth certificates, at a minimum, and putting in place a proactive information and tracing service that supports adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents in dealing with these issues.  We have pushed the issue under the carpet for far too long.<br \/>I implore the T&aacute;naiste to use her position as the Minister for Social Protection with responsibility for the General Registration Office and, as T&aacute;naiste and as someone who cares about this issue, to ensure this injustice is finally put behind us.  In the aftermath of the Tuam case the Taoiseach said a referendum might be needed, but many constitutional lawyers argue that that is not the case.  Dr. Conor O'Mahony, an expert based in the law department in UCC, pointed out that in the key case of IO'T <i>v.<\/i>B, the judge said that balancing the right of the adopted person to identity and the right of the birth mother to privacy is a matter for the Oireachtas.  He pointed out that legislation introduced, like any other legislation, would benefit from the presumption of constitutionality.  We can and should act and I hope the Minister is the one who pushes it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500048#BBB00300","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1405449900,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and commend her on her appointment.

Many fathers do not want to be registered because they do not want to own up to their responsibilities.  I believe it is appropriate that this registration be mandatory.  In regard to the provision of an opt-out in terms of registration of the name of the father, the mother is allowed to give as a reason for doing so that she does not know where the father is or that she does not know the identity of the father.  A third reason is that in doing so the child's safety could be compromised.  It is sometimes necessary for a third party to determine whether in fact it is a correct proposition to suggest that a child's safety would be compromised if the name of the father was registered.  Perhaps, there could be some firming up of this provision.  It may be that I am misreading the provision so I would welcome some clarification on the matter and on whether if it requires firming up the issue will be addressed by way of amendment on Committee or Report Stages.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that there is broad welcome for this important legislation.  I do not consider it to be tidying up legislation.  I believe it is appropriate, important and necessary.  While many people, in particular from outside this House, are not aware of it, very often, there is unanimous agreement in this House on issues, in particular when what is proposed is the right thing to do.  I look forward to this legislation progressing through the House and wish the T&aacute;naiste well in her endeavours in that regard.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500049#CCC00300","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1405450500,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House and congratulate her on her election as leader of the Labour Party.

I thank the T&aacute;naiste for acknowledging my work in relation to a particular section of this Bill, namely, that dealing with the registration in Ireland of the death abroad of Irish people.  This morning, I spoke to a family in Galway for whom this weekend marks the fifth anniversary of the death of a 22 year old son while on a student visa in the USA.  It was wonderful to hear the mother, who at a meeting of the committee on social protection during the last term called for this to be addressed, say that this will make his death easier on her.  This issue has also been raised by another mother from Galway and the wife of a man who died while abroad in the Middle East.  I am particularly close to one of the families affected.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for listening and for introducing me to the registrar.  When I first spoke to him, I thought I was knocking my head against a brick wall.  However, to be fair to the T&aacute;naiste she did assure me that a memorandum on the matter had been brought to Cabinet and that it was only a matter of time before this issue was addressed.  It is not easy to have to repeatedly tell a family something is going to happen when in fact nothing is happening.  However, it will now happen under this legislation.  This will be of help to many grieving families and will bring closure for them.  I am delighted about that. <\/p><p>A great deal of work has been put into the drafting of this Bill, which deals with the registration of important life events and human issues.  Much of what is proposed is overdue, in particular compulsory registration of the father's name on birth certificates.  I was struck by the fact that in 2013, 2,675 births registered included no father's name.  In this regard, the child is the one with no voice.  I support of the right of a child to know his or her identity.  This legislation provides for that.   Other speakers have spoken about how sometimes information in relation to a child's identity may be withheld for the safety of the child.  However, the underlying principle of what is proposed is correct.  It is time to provide in law that both parents names be listed on a birth certificate and to acknowledge that this is in the best interests of the child.  This will be welcomed by many fathers who have fought for their rights in this regard.  Equally, many fathers have run away from their responsibility in this regard.  Will further legislation be introduced in terms of follow-up of fathers to ensure they meet their duties and responsibilities as fathers?  I believe this is an issue that ties in with the T&aacute;naiste's brief in terms of social protection.  <\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and I have argued for a reversal of the cut in the one-parent allowance, be the parent a mother or father.  We would not have to be arguing about this cut if two parents were taking responsibility for their children.  I would welcome a response on that issue from the T&aacute;naiste as Minister for Social Protection, which I compliment her on retaining.  It is good to see Ministers, particularly when they become T&aacute;naiste, maintain continuity in Cabinet.  Taking over responsibility for a new portfolio can be difficult.<\/p><p>Another issue of concern for me is the right to birth certificates of adopted persons.  Perhaps when responding the T&aacute;naiste will clarify the situation highlighted by Senator Moloney in terms of the inclusion on the birth certificate of the father's name.  I have a vested interest in this issue in that I have two children who are adopted.  I hope that when they pass the age of 18 years they will have a right to their own records.  I believe this is a human rights issue.  As Senator Power said, it is crucial that a person would know his or her identity and, more important, have access to information such as medical records.  In my view - others may not agree with me on this - this information should not be made available to a child until such time as he or she is at least 18 years of age.  I say this because one's teenage years are tough.  During that time, a child goes through many challenges, including puberty and so on.  I am not so sure that making this information available to a child prior to his or her reaching 18 years of age would be a good idea.<\/p> <p>I will be very happy to hear the Minister's views on that.<\/p><p>I completely agree with Senators Conway and &Oacute; Clochartaigh on direct provision.  Having done work with refugees in a previous role, and knowing that many refugees in direct provision live with their families in the same room, I believe direct provision will be the scandal of the future.  We are very na&iuml;ve if we believe abuse does not happen in such circumstances.  It is worth putting this on record, and I am glad I have done so.  We should not move forward blindly in this area.

The Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2014 is the second of three that I intend to introduce to modernise the civil registration services.  In December 2012 in this House, we began a discussion on the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2012.  The legislation was commenced in January 2013 and it added secular bodies to the register of solemnisers.  I thank Senator Bacik for her comments on that.  A considerable amount of the work was done in this House.  The secular bodies were added to the register solemnisers, extending the scope of marriage solemnisers across the spectrum of belief systems.  I am aware that very many people have availed themselves of that facility since it came into existence.  I am glad to have advised the Senators of an amendment we will bring forward to deal with the issue of marriages being held in the open air.<br \/>On 17 June 2014, I published the general scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2014.  This Bill will provide transgender persons with legal recognition.  The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I hope to publish it later this year.<br \/>The Bill before the Senators today contains significant new policy provisions, such as the inclusion of the fathers' names on birth certificates for non-marital births and measures to combat marriages of convenience.<br \/>With regard to the compulsory registration of fathers' names, it is worth repeating that, according to figures from the General Register Office, 2,675 non-marital births were registered in 2013 without the father's name.  In the vast majority of cases, both parents want to register both the mother and the father but there is still a very significant number of cases in which this does not occur.  As Members have said, this matter could be extremely important to the child and the descendants of the child.  Current legislation does not require the mother or the father to provide the father's details when registering the birth where the parents of a child are not married to each other.  Where registration is facilitated very soon after birth, as it often is, those involved in helping at the birth or in another professional capacity and those involved in antenatal classes should be advised that this will be the expected norm.  As far as I am aware, it is the norm almost everywhere except in Ireland, save in some exceptional cases to which Senators made reference.<br \/>This amendment seeks to address the current position by making the provision of information such as the father's name compulsory other than in exceptional circumstances, such as where the mother does not know who the father is or the whereabouts of the father.<br \/>The key, as mentioned by quite a number of Senators, is the right of children to know who their parents are.  This amendment will underpin the rights of the child under EU legislation to have access to the details of their identity.  Registering the name of the father and the birth certificate actually does not confer any additional rights, <i>per se<\/i>, on the father of the child, but it may well lead to a cultural change over time such that it will become the expected practice, as it is in most European countries.  With regard to the registration of the father's name, the key point is to understand that the exceptions are in regard to the safety of the child and the child's best interests.  Obviously, there are issues that arise in this regard, some of which were alluded to, and they have to be taken into account.<br \/>Many Senators mentioned marriages of convenience.  This is a very complex issue.  The right to marry is a basic right.  EU citizens and their families had the right to reside and move freely within the territories of the member states.  These rights also apply to non-EU-national spouses of EU nationals.  Ireland, as a society, has greatly benefited from the free movement of EU citizens across Europe.  However, criminal elements are abusing our system by using marriage in Ireland to gain an automatic right of residency in Europe.<br \/>Let me outline what constitutes a marriage of convenience.  It is a very unusual set of circumstances.  Obviously, the vast majority of marriages are by consent and they occur in a public place, usually involving families and many witnesses.  A marriage of convenience, however, is defined under section 3 of the legislation as being where one of the parties enters into the marriage solely for the purpose of securing an immigration advantage.  This must be properly investigated and reported on by a registrar.  It must be determined by a superintendent registrar.  In forming his opinion, the registrar must take into account such matters as whether the parties speak a common language.  If the two parties have no language in common, I suggest it may not be the best basis for a marriage.  The question of how often the parties met before the marriage must also be considered.  We have heard stories of where parties apparently met a couple of minutes before getting married.  They do not share a language and have no apparent knowledge of or familiarity with each other.<br \/>Most important, it must be considered whether money has been paid in an inducement to marry.  Senator Bacik and Senator van Turnhout talked about young people marrying in this regard.  If significant amounts of money change hands, one must be wary.  A young woman, who might not be under age or a child, might be very persuaded to get married for the purpose of gaining a very large cash advantage.  Others might persuade her or have some control over her.  This is absolutely illegal.  Nothing very good transpires for the women who get involved in such arrangements.  It is of serious concern, not only to Ireland but also to countries that have embassies here that may believe this type of action is happening.  One should bear in mind that an experienced registrar must form an opinion on whether the couple does not appear to know each other or speak the same language.  It may appear that inducements have passed between the parties.<\/p> <p>I do not quite know what Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh was suggesting but the provision does not seek to curtail the free movement of individuals under EU law nor prevent valid marriages from taking place between people of whatever nationality.  That is not the purpose.  The purpose is to deal with situations where there is a marriage of convenience, in other words, it is a sham and entirely for the purpose of securing an immigration advantage.  It is a provision designed to put in place safeguards to stop people using the pretence of getting married solely to gain an immigration advantage and, in the process, make a mockery of the institution of marriage which is protected in our Constitution.<\/p><p>As in the case of other objections to marriage, the couple can appeal to the Circuit Court, the Family Court, if they do not agree with the decision made.  There is a remedy if people feel the marriage has been unfairly refused.  It is a matter which has been of grave concern over a number of years.  There is also a concern that this may be parallel or in some cases potentially connected with trafficking where women, particularly younger women, are coerced into taking part in this kind of marriage of convenience.<\/p><p>A number of Senators spoke about access to adoption records.  I am on the record on this issue and I thank people for sharing their personal and family histories.  This matter is being looked at by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, who is working on legislation in this area.  I compliment the former Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, and in particular, in recent times Deputy Flanagan who has done an enormous amount of work on this issue.  For those of us who have been involved and interested in this debate over a long number of years, there has been quite a change in public understanding, appreciation and attitudes.  That is a very welcome advance as this is a sensitive personal issue for all of the parties involved.<\/p><p>The key issue, which is at the heart of this legislation, is the right of the child to know his or her identity.  I look forward to Deputy Reilly following on the very positive work which has been done.  He has already commenced that work in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We in the Department of Social Protection are merely concerned with the regulation of registration.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik and other Senators raised the issue of forced marriages.  I thank the Seanad for raising this matter.  An interdepartmental group has been set up to look at this matter and the Department of Social Protection is involved.  That is a very important issue in the protection of children who could be subject to abuse.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of scrutiny.  As the rules regarding the Oireachtas scrutiny were introduced when the Bill was at an advanced stage of drafting it was not brought to the Oireachtas as this would have led to delays in enacting the legislation.

He has taken on a very challenging role.  As he is from rural Ireland, I have no doubt that he will ensure the interests of many of the activities in rural areas will be protected.  He will be very much aware of the great work being done by various voluntary organisations.<\/p><p>As I am sharing time with my colleague, Senator Susan O'Keeffe, I will be as brief as possible.  The facts are well known about the National Collective of Community-based Women's Networks, NCCWN, and the voluntarily managed and led national and local community development programme.  The NCCWN has 17 local women's projects, one of which is the north Leitrim women's resource which is the focus of this debate.  It has a current budget of &euro;1.3 million and employs staff who engage with almost 37,000 women.<\/p><p>As the Minister is aware, the local and community development programme, LCDP, is to be replaced by the 2015 social inclusion community activation programme, SICAP.  The new programme is out to e-tender.  However, not all the 17 women's networks have been enabled to participate in a local consortium for the SICAP.  Furthermore, disadvantaged women are not named as a target group.  Therefore, the work of the network with disadvantaged women is not recognised and does not fit under the programme, at least according to my information.  I hope the Minister will be able to reassure the 17 groups but particularly the north Leitrim women's resource.<\/p><p>North Leitrim is an area of very severe economic and social disadvantage.  It has a low density population, even within a county that has a low population of 31,000.  The bulk of the population is located south or east of Lough Allen, whereas the northern part is much more sparsely populated.  As a result, it lacks any type of industrial production and relies to a large extent on tourism, small farmers and the cheque from the European Union.  The challenges faced by the Manorhamilton-based group are immense.  I understand its severe anxiety in not knowing what will happen to it and its funding in the future.  I hope the Minister can provide some reassurance, in view of the very valuable work done by the Manorhamilton group and its sister organisations across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500052#FFF00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1405452000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome.  I congratulate him on his appointment.  I appreciate that he has inherited this matter.  There has been a great deal of confusion as the new programme is rolled out and perhaps this is an area where confusion was not intended.  The women's network of 17 projects around the country employs a number of people and assists approximately 36,000 women.  These are women who need quiet, low key, careful support in all types of areas such as child care, employment, training, counselling, political education and mental health and in dealing with domestic violence.  The projects' remit is broad but very low key and well placed.  I commend the work the projects do, particularly the project in Manorhamilton which I know very well.<\/p><p>The new social inclusion community activation programme does not have women as one of its target groups.  The target groups include lone parents, children and families from disadvantaged areas and people with disabilities.  I am reading the answer provided by the Department which the Minister might well give us.  I would be extremely grateful if he gave a commitment to carry out a review of the programme, for which a sum of &euro;47 million is earmarked, which is a substantial sum of money which will be well spent across all types of project throughout the country, which is welcome.  The projects being discussed cost &euro;1 million and affect 36,500 women.  They are in danger of being swept away by something in which they have no foothold and it appears they will not have a foothold because of the way they operate.  I do not believe the Minister would like to see this happen.<\/p><p>Sometimes women have to be singled out and supported in their own right and these projects have done this very successfully.  That should continue, particularly as we know that every day in Ireland 500 women seek support in dealing with domestic violence alone.  These women are in a very high risk category.  The women involved in these projects are not in that high risk category, but they need our support.  It is being provided in a very focused way for a very small amount of money.  The projects have provided the Department with their value for money details.  I urge the Minister to look at them and, rather than give the answer provided by the Department, perhaps promise to see whether there is a role for them within the SICAP.  We accept and understand there will be a great deal of activity and many good projects within the SICAP across the country.

As part of the programme of reform of local government, local community development committees are being established in all local authority areas.  These committees, comprising public-private socio-economic interests, will have responsibility for local and community development programmes on an area basis, including the social inclusion and community activation programme.  They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than heretofore, with the aim of reducing duplication and overlap and optimising the use of available resources for the benefit of citizens and communities.<\/p><p>The SICAP is a key priority of the Government and its budget for next year will be decided in the 2015 Estimates process.  In accordance with the public spending code, good practice internationally, legal advice and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, the programme will be subject to a public procurement process, which is under way.  The closing date for receipt of expressions of interest in stage 1 of the process was noon last Friday, 11 July.<\/p><p>The public procurement process is a competitive one open to local development companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations such as the NCCWN that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new programme.  Joint applications are encouraged and organisations of varying sizes, for example, smaller organisations such as North Leitrim Women's Centre, working in consortia with larger organisations, were invited to submit joint applications.  Partner candidates have a role in the delivery and implementation of the programme.  All such partner candidates must be identified in the qualification questionnaire and a contracting arrangement may be required between the lead candidate and any partner candidate.  Candidates may rely on the resources of other entities in order to satisfy the suitability requirements on condition that they can prove to the satisfaction of Pobal that they will have these resources at their disposal, when necessary.<\/p><p>Applicants in stage 1 of the tendering process must demonstrate that they meet the criteria for the delivery of services in the lots applied for.  A total of 31 lots are being offered for tender, based on local authority areas.  In some cases, these may be divided into smaller units in stage 2 of the process which will get under way in early September.<\/p><p>In summary, it was possible for the NCCWN to apply to deliver the service in a county or counties and the North Leitrim Women's Centre had the option of partnering with another body to deliver the service in County Leitrim.  I am satisfied that the procurement process under way is in line with good practice and that the procurement documentation on e-Tenders contains all of the relevant information on the process.<\/p> <p>I look forward to the outcome of the procurement process towards the end of the year and the roll-out of the SICAP in January 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500052#FFF00400","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405452600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Interestingly enough, when it was originally established by the LCDP, the then Government made specific arrangements for the National Collective of Community-based Women's Networks because it was recognised that the position of disadvantaged women would be diluted in a mix of this nature.

The North Leitrim Women's Centre and the National Collective of Community-based Women's Networks state they have explored the relevant avenue and that the networks, etc., are not all in a position to become part of local consortia in their areas.

I know he will have a good grasp of the health portfolio.<\/p><p>Many years ago I was actively involved in a campaign to have the BreastCheck service rolled out to the southern region, particularly counties Cork and Kerry.  I spent many a wet Saturday on the streets of towns and villages in County Kerry getting both men and women to sign petitions.  They were very eager to sign because they were anxious to have the BreastCheck service extended to the region.  As the Minister knows, it was eventually rolled out to it.  Many of my friends are indebted to BreastCheck as a result of their breast cancer being detected early.  Some of them have informed me that their tumours were only about the size of the head of a pin when detected, which meant that they were only obliged to undergo lumpectomies because the cancer had not spread to the lymph glands.  As a result, they did not require chemotherapy and all have recovered.  I hope hey will all remain in remission.<\/p><p>The Irish Cancer Society has indicated that for every 500 women screened, at least one life will be saved.  I argue that the figure is even higher than this, particularly in view of the number of women I meet in whom breast cancer has been detected by BreastCheck.  However, the Irish Cancer Society is the expert in this area and the figure to which I refer is the one it has supplied.  One woman in ten will contract cancer during her lifetime.  As the Minister is well aware, BreastCheck screens women in the 50 to 64 year age group every two years.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to extend the BreastCheck service to women aged 65 to 69 years.  I ask the Minister to not allow this to be perceived as a broken promise, as a failure to extend the service will cost us more in the long term.  The sooner breast cancer can be detected, the less treatment women will require.  If it is not detected early, the women involved will need long-term care plans which can be quite costly.<\/p><p>I ask that the extension of the BreastCheck service to women aged between 65 and 69 years be approved without further delay.  As stated, the Minister should not allow this to become a broken promise and oblige us to organise another campaign.  As we promised the extension, let us deliver it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500053#GGG00800","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1405452600,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her kind words and welcome the opportunity to speak about the proposed extension of the BreastCheck programme to include women aged 65 to 69 years.  BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, offers free mammograms every two years to women aged 50 to 64 years.  It is now in its 15th year of screening and has provided almost 1 million mammograms for just over 400,000 women.  Approximately 6,350 cancers have been detected through the service.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to extend the BreastCheck programme to 65 to 69 year old women in line with EU guidelines.  I can confirm that I intend to extend the upper age range to include women in the 65 to 69 year age cohort as soon as the requisite resources can be procured.<\/p><p>A priority of BreastCheck is to maximise the national uptake in the 50 to 64 year age group.  As outlined in the recently published BreastCheck report for the period 2012 to 2013, 71.4% of eligible women invited for screening accepted their invitations.  As the target in this regard is 70%, it has been exceeded.  However, acceptance rates among those invited for the first time have fallen to 66.4%, which is a source of some concern.  In the light of these figures, I welcome the current BreastCheck advertising campaign which aims to boost uptake rates and urges all women to take the time to do something very important for themselves by availing of the invitation to have mammograms.  At a minimum, this will give some peace of mind, but it might also just be crucial in identifying cancers at an early and more easily treatable stage.<\/p><p>The HSE's national screening service operates three other population-based screening programmes, in addition to BreastCheck.  These are CervicalCheck, the national cervical screening programme which provides free smear tests for women between the ages of 25 and 60 years; BowelScreen, the national bowel screening programme which commenced nationwide in late 2012 for men and women aged 60 to 69 years and for which an additional &euro;2 million was provided for its continued development in the HSE's national service plan for 2014; and Diabetic RetinaScreen which commenced in February 2013 and will be offered to people aged 12 years and over with diagnosed diabetes who are registered with the programme.  An additional &euro;4.5 million has been allocated for the continued implementation of Diabetic RetinaScreen in the HSE's national service plan for 2014.<\/p><p>Breast screening is one element of the comprehensive cancer care programme.  As part of its work across the full range of cancers, the HSE's national cancer control programme provides symptomatic breast clinics at each of the eight cancer centres and a further satellite clinic in Letterkenny.  Breast cancer survival rates in Ireland have improved significantly in recent years owing to a combined approach of screening, symptomatic detection and improved treatment.<\/p> <p>The five-year survival rate for breast cancer is now estimated at 84.9% for people diagnosed between 2005 and 2009.  This is a most encouraging figure and shows a significant improvement from the figure of 75.1% for those diagnosed between 1994 and 1999.  I welcome the progress being made, not just to the benefit of the people directly concerned but also to their families, friends and wider communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500053#GGG00900","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405453200,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The diabetic retinal screening programme that was launched last year is another welcome development.  I acknowledge the difficult reality of limited resources, but the bottom line is that these schemes save money in the long run.  Will the extension of BreastCheck be rolled out this year, as promised, or does the Minister have expectations for next year?

While there may be long-term savings deriving from an extension of the screening programme, the money needed to implement that extension must be found upfront.  To take the funding from existing resources would most likely require its diversion from patients who are currently diagnosed.  Taking resources away from those already receiving treatment for an illness in order to extend screening to those who might have an illness is not something I could stand over.<\/p><p>Having said that, we have costed the extension of the scheme, and the figure for 2015, at some &euro;200,000, is actually not that high.  However, because we would need to expand the units, build new centres and so on, that cost would rise in 2016 to almost &euro;6 million, which is a much more significant figure.  It is an issue of which I am very aware and I am pleased the Senator has brought it to the forefront of my attention in my first week in office.  I absolutely see the logic behind her proposal for an extension and it is something I absolutely want to implement.

I recently visited Taiwan as part of an Oireachtas delegation and was hugely impressed by the country's economic progress, respect for human rights and high-quality health service.<\/p><p>Economically, Taiwan is doing extremely well.  Indeed, from 1952 to 2012, it achieved an average annual economic growth rate of 7.3%, one of the fastest growth rates in the world.  While that rate has slowed in recent years in the context of the wider economic environment and the impact of the global financial downturn, the international economic crisis has had a much lighter impact on Taiwan than on other developed economies, including our own.  The country's unemployment rate is below 4% and the proportion of people living below the poverty line is 1.5%.<\/p><p>Taiwan also has a world-class health service, with a national insurance system far superior to the Dutch model the Government seems intent on emulating.  This is an issue I intend to raise with the new Minister for Health, who has just left the Chamber.  It is an excellent system based on compulsory health insurance, with everybody paying into the system through the taxation regime.  There are no private providers competing for insurance premia, as is expected in our system.  Instead, competition is at the point of delivery, with providers competing to provide services and thereby helping to ensure costs are kept as low as possible.  The Taiwanese authorities have managed to eliminate waiting lists in the system and provide a top-class service.  There is much we can learn from their experience.<\/p><p>In recent years, Taiwan has become one of Asia's main providers of foreign direct investment, ranking only behind Japan, mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore.  The opportunities for Irish export companies are immense.  Food companies, in particular, could find a huge market there.  During our visit to Taiwan we discovered that although it currently imports much of its beef from the United States, there is an awareness of the superiority of Irish beef as a result of the conditions in which cattle are reared and the rules in regard to feed and so on.  The Taiwanese would like to import Irish beef but it requires a broader trade agreement to facilitate that.  More generally, there is scope for a range of Irish enterprises to build business partnerships with local companies which would help them to succeed not only in Taiwan but also in mainland China and Asia.  In other words, Taiwan could potentially be a significant gateway for Irish companies into Asia.<\/p><p>There is also great potential to encourage more tourism from Taiwan.  The last Government introduced in a 90-day visa waiver for Taiwanese tourists, which allows them to visit Ireland without having to go through the administrative rigmarole of obtaining a visa.  However, the number of tourists coming here is still very small.  The reason may well be that there is very little on-the-ground promotion of Ireland as a tourist destination.  There is no office there selling Ireland as a place Taiwanese people should visit.<\/p><p>There is also considerable potential to attract more Taiwanese students to our third level colleges and English language schools.  The potential is there, too, for greater cultural links between the two countries.  As part of our visit, we attended the very successful Irish dancing school in Taipei.  It was interesting to see Taiwanese men and women enjoying Irish dancing, including competitively.<\/p><p>As I have outlined, there are opportunities for closer co-operation on many different levels, but Ireland is not realising those opportunities.  One of the main inhibiting factors is the impact of the closure of the former representative office some years ago as part of the broader reduction in the number of embassies.  Earlier this year the Government reopened the Vatican Embassy and opened new embassies in other countries.  It is time now to examine the case for reopening the Taiwanese office.  Eighteen other EU countries have representative offices there, in addition to the EU office.  One of the main benefits of this presence is the monthly meeting between the representatives of the various offices and the EU office to discuss trade opportunities.  We are missing out on that by having no representation.  I urge the Minister of State to use any influence he has with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure the office in Taipei is reopened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500054#HHH00500","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1405453200,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for his kind words.  I was in the Gallery of this Chamber only last week thinking I would not mind being in here some day.  I did not expect it to happen so soon and in this capacity.  It is funny how things turn out.  I also thank Senator Power for her warm words.  I have enjoyed our time working together on the education committee.  No doubt we will still be making trips out to Uncle Vincent; I am sure I will not escape that particular task in my new role.  Those engagements help to keep all of us on our toes, which is no harm.<\/p><p>Turning to the issue before us, I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, both of whom are sorry they cannot be here.  I will convey the Senator's points to them.  It is an issue in which I have an interest.  In fact, I had initially intended to be part of the Oireachtas delegation to Taiwan and was sorry I missed it.  It sounds like a very interesting place and a very positive experience.<\/p><p>Ireland, along with all EU trade partners, adheres to the One-China policy and, as a result, cannot have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.  This, however, does not preclude the development of economic and trade relations.  There was an Irish trade office in Taipei from 1989 until 2011, opened originally under the auspices of IBEC and with funding primarily provided by IDA Ireland.  The decision to close it in 2011 was taken by IDA Ireland on a purely commercial basis.  The State agencies keep their allocation of resources under review in order to promote Ireland's economic interests as effectively as possible.<\/p> <p>Reopening a trade office in Taiwan may be considered by the State agencies if a commercial case could be made for it.  The Senator has made a strong case and I will ask that it be considered.<\/p><p>The Government has made extensive efforts to boost trade with China, including the official visit by now President Xi Jinping to Ireland in 2012, followed by the return visits to China by the Taoiseach and then the T&aacute;naiste in 2012 and 2013.  Vice Premier Ma Kai visited Ireland in November 2013 and last month saw another high-level visit by Liu Yunshan, a leading member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China.  Total trade in goods and services between Ireland and China amounted to approximately &euro;8 billion in 2012.<\/p><p>Ireland's trade with Taiwan is substantial, particularly with regard to services.  In 2013, merchandise trade amounted to &euro;344 million.  Of that, exports amounted to &euro;130 million and imports to &euro;214 million.  Trade in services in 2012 was &euro;585 million, with &euro;504 million in exports and &euro;81 million in imports.  The Government is keen to continue building such trade relations and promoting other commercial links.  For example, the possibility of concluding a double taxation agreement between Ireland and Taiwan is being examined.<\/p><p>Regarding other ongoing engagements, Taiwan has been included in Ireland's working holiday programme since 2012.  Ireland and EU partners have also supported, where appropriate, Taiwan's observerships at the multilateral level and there are regular exchanges at working groups and other forums.  Ireland contributes to the regular and comprehensive EU dialogue with Taiwan.<\/p><p>Relations between China and Taiwan have improved markedly of late, with the first official talks between the two sides since 1949 taking place in February 2014 in Nanjing, China, and return talks in Taipei in June.  The Government welcomes this development.<\/p><p>Ireland is opening three new missions in Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong this year, demonstrating its commitment to building relations with Asia.  Trade with Asia is worth &euro;23 billion annually and the region will continue to be the driver of the global economy in the years ahead.  I thank the Senator for her comments and interest and I will brief the two Ministers accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500054#HHH00600","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405453800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and his assurance that he will raise the matter with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He stated that the decision to close the IDA office was made on commercial grounds, but there are strong commercial reasons to reopen it.  The 2013 trade figures represent a drop in the ocean compared with what we could be achieving in Taiwan.  It is a shame.<\/p><p>I also noted the Minister of State's reference to Ireland's one-China policy, which seems to be making us reticent about developing closer links with Taiwan.  That is also a shame.  The policy has not stopped 18 other European countries from having representative offices in Taiwan.  We should embrace Taiwan.  As the Minister of State noted, relations between China and Taiwan are improving.  We should not be reticent about stepping up, supporting the Taiwanese people and developing closer links.<\/p><p>While there, I was most struck by Taiwan's respect for human rights.  It is strong on freedom of expression and belief and protects its people's human rights in ways that, unfortunately, have not yet reached mainland China.  As a country that has always promoted human rights in its foreign policy, we should support Taiwan in every way possible in that respect.<\/p><p>I urge the Minister of State to bring my points to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I also urge the Government to send a trade delegation to examine the commercial arguments for reopening an office.  It would be significant if a Minister or Minister of State was sent with representatives from the IDA or Enterprise Ireland to examine the environment and opportunities before making an informed decision on how to proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500055#JJJ00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1405453800,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and will bring her comments to the Minister's attention.

I do not doubt that he will prove himself as capable a Minister of State as he is a Deputy.  I welcome him to the House for this debate.<\/p><p>The Minister of State might be aware of the briefing given last week in the Houses that was led by students from the National Learning Network who were participating in SOLAS-funded training courses.  As a result of budget 2014, they have suffered a &euro;20 reduction in their weekly training allowance since 1 July.  The participants at the briefing outlined the negative impact of the reduction and what &euro;20 meant to them.  When a person is living on just &euro;188 per week, &euro;20 is a significant amount.  They brought their message home to us.  For one, &euro;20 meant the difference between a healthy diet and an unhealthy diet.  Reversing the cut would improve her lifestyle and reduce the cost to the State in health care.<\/p><p>Another student spoke emotionally about how any reduction in the training allowance would have a negative impact on his mental health.  He valued work and the positive effect of SOLAS on his life.  His appeal to have his dignity respected was heartfelt.<\/p><p>Some 6,300 people are affected by the reduction, amounting to &euro;6.5 million per year.  While I understand the Government's need to reduce the debt burden, it is difficult to appreciate this reduction, which affects the well-being of vulnerable people in an unequal way.  The modest nominal cost savings of &euro;6.5 million can be achieved elsewhere in the budget.  As has been proven in many countries, if we invest in our young and their education, we would save money in health care and mental health care in the long run.  The Minister of State is barely in the hot seat.  When he catches his breath, will he revisit this reduction?  We need to encourage, support and invest in the professional futures of SOLAS students.<\/p><p>Despite SOLAS having a high success rate, with 90% of students continuing on to further education, if they can afford it, or employment, I was concerned when some of the students last week mentioned the dropout rate, which was mainly due to financial issues.  I appeal to the Minister of State to support SOLAS students and to help those struggling to afford training courses by examining the level of investment in SOLAS-funded programmes.  Investment in SOLAS is an investment in our people and economy.  It was evident from the trainees' stories that the courses were invaluable in allowing people to return to work, giving them confidence, ensuring better mental health and providing a community of support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500055#JJJ00500","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1405453800,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her kind words and look forward to working with her.  As she is a colleague from the north east, it is a pleasure to engage with her on this issue during my first official appearance.  I hope to be able to work with her on it in future.  We must cover many issues.  I am sorry, but I missed last week's briefing due to a clash with a meeting of my former committee.  I would be interested in meeting a select group of those participants to discuss this matter.  The Senator and I will have a chat about it.  I would be keen to discuss the dropout rate.<\/p><p>The payment of an additional training allowance of &euro;31.80 per week for the long-term unemployed was introduced during a period of high employment as an incentive for them to participate in F&Aacute;S training courses.  This allowance was later extended to those persons in receipt of social welfare disability payments to introduce equality of treatment for all people in training.  The payment was reduced from &euro;31.80 per week to &euro;20 per week as part of budget 2011.  In the present economic situation this incentive is no longer considered appropriate and, as part of budget 2014, it was decided to cease it for all SOLAS participants commencing courses after 1 January 2014.  This change does not apply to persons who commenced a course prior to January 2014 and they will continue to receive the long-term unemployed bonus payment for the duration of their courses.<\/p> <p>Various allowances and additional payments were generated during the Celtic tiger years when we had a great deal of money.  These allowances were introduced at that time, and rightly so, but the tax stream to back them up was not put in place.  Now that the tax receipts are much lower, there is less tax to go round and changes must be made.  However, travel supports continue to be available to SOLAS participants, including people with a disability.  The additional training allowance was never intended to address the cost of participation in training.  The nature of the payment as an incentive rather than as a measure intended to meet the cost of participation is demonstrated by the fact that it was not available to all people in receipt of payments from the Department of Social Protection, which would have been the case if it were intended to meet meal and travel costs.<\/p><p>This reflects the entirely different employment situation that now pertains, as well as the very difficult budgetary position the Government is in while we endeavour to protect the overall level of provision of education and training.  It is hoped that participants see the value in education and training as a gateway to employment and will continue to participate in high-quality, relevant and well-designed programmes.  I accept that people are under immense pressure at all times to survive on the social welfare payment, whether they attend a course or not.  I can understand it would have been a major help to have that additional allowance, but the problem is to try to balance the books overall.  As I have said, I am happy to meet them to discuss the issue with them.  There is no scope to revisit this decision against a very difficult budgetary background in which continued savings are required in education and training while we protect the overall level of service that the sector provides.<\/p><p>The further education and training sector is undergoing major structural reform.  In reforming the structures in further education and training, FET, we undertook a critical examination of the overall further education and training sector.  Following consultation with stakeholders and the development of a strategy for a co-ordinated FET sector, the second half of last year saw the establishment of 16 education and training boards to replace 33 VECs, and the establishment of SOLAS to bring strategic direction to the sector.  I am glad to say that at this stage all former F&Aacute;S training provision has been transferred to the education and training boards.  The education and training boards will play a key role in ensuring the provision of 21st-century high-quality further education and training programmes.  Any future policy development and legislation in the further education and training sector will be guided by the principles outlined in the five-year strategy document recently published by SOLAS.<\/p><p>The overall funding allocation for the Department of Education and Skills is determined as part of the annual budgetary process and the funding allocation is subsequently decided upon in that context, having considered priorities and requirements across the wider education sector.  SOLAS will be responsible for allocating funding to the respective education and training boards in that regard.  It will then be a matter for each education and training board to manage its resources annually.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Moran for raising this issue with me.  As she said, I just inherited the brief a few hours ago.  I am just reading into it and I want to assure her that I will work on these issues and will meet some of these people to discuss the issues with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071500055#JJJ00600","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405454400,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.
