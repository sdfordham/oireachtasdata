This is the first general rate increase for pensioners since 2009.<\/p><p>It should be noted that carers aged 66 and over will benefit from the &euro;3 weekly rate increase.  This rate increase will also benefit carers in receipt of the half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance aged 66 and over, who will gain by &euro;1.50 per week.<\/p><p>The Respite Care Grant, to be renamed the Carer's Support Grant to better reflect the usage of the grant, will also be increased by &euro;325, from &euro;1,375 to &euro;1,700 per annum.

This measure recognises the important role of fathers in bringing up their children.<\/p><p>- An additional &euro;18 million to increase the Family Income Supplement (FIS) thresholds - by &euro;5 for a family with one child and by &euro;10 for a family with two children or more.  The measure will benefit nearly 60,000 families and over 131,000 children.<\/p><p>Finally, I am also introducing a PRSI Credit which will benefit over 88,000 lower earners with weekly income between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424, by reducing the amount of PRSI they pay in a week.  This complements the increase in the minimum wage by ensuring that those on low earnings brought within the PRSI net will pay a significantly lower amount of PRSI per week, than would currently apply.<\/p><p>Because through the perseverance of our people, we now have a very strong recovery.  This Budget will help in that process of spreading that recovery more widely.  Maintaining a strong economy and sensibly managing the public finances is the priority while raising living standards across the board and investing in the services that a decent society requires.<\/p><p>We have not got to our destination yet but it is within sight and within reach.

The employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.<\/p><p>Currently, in line with the commitment in Pathways to Work, a range of services are available to unemployed persons who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment.  For example, employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Further, unemployed persons not in receipt of qualifying payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB (formerly F&Aacute;S) training for unemployed people, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.  Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme.  Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer over the previous 18 months are entitled to participate on Momentum courses through Solas, provided that they have been actively seeking work, however they will not receive any payment.  Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on ETB-run VTOS courses subject to availability.  In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances.

These include advisory services provided through the EmployAbility companies, supported\/subsidised employment, special training provision, and workplace adaptation grants.

In this regard, for example, the DSP Employer Engagement Unit has conducted a number of career and job fairs in 2014 and 2015 at which information on activation options such as JobBridge, Experience your Europe, and JobPlus is made available.  <\/p><p>An updated <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>2016-2020 strategy is under development within the Department of Social Protection and it is intended to bring this strategy to Government for approval by the end of this year.  While the new strategy is still being formulated I expect that it will reflect labour market changes in our economy.  In particular whereas the existing strategy was formulated during a period of very high unemployment and focused on supporting people who are unemployed the new strategy is likely, given the reduction in unemployment and ongoing growth in employment, to augment this focus by, in addition, seeking to support an increased level of labour market participation in order to ensure that economic growth can be sustained.  The strategy will therefore focus on consolidating previous reforms and on continued prioritisation of key cohorts, as well as considering the expansion of activation services to other cohorts. <\/p><p>With respect to eligibility of qualified adults for the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), both partners can simultaneously qualify for a BTEA payment and can be supported to undertake courses of study.

In order to try to ensure that the scheme provides a good basis for successful outcomes, the Department applies a number of conditions.  These include the requirement on a Host Organisation to agree to adhere to the basic Terms and Conditions of the scheme before an application can be validated and for both parties to sign a Standard Agreement clearly stating the terms of the internship at the outset.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that a Host Organisation complies with these conditions and is abiding by the spirit of the scheme, the Department has a very robust monitoring regime.  This involves the regular review of mandatory monthly compliance reports, random on-site inspections and the thorough investigation of all complaints received.    <\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of Host Organisations are fully compliant with all aspects of the scheme.  In a small number of cases, however, the Department took the view that non-compliance by certain organisations warranted a decision to suspend them from access to the scheme for a period of time.  These represent less than 0.5% of the total number of organisations that have participated in the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  In that regard, it should be noted that when the scheme was introduced in 2011 it was initially envisaged to last for a two-year period.  Accordingly, the practice when the scheme started was to debar offending host organisations for the remainder of the anticipated duration of the scheme - in other words, indefinitely.  Subsequently the scheme, has been extended year-on-year and as a consequence, and on foot of a query from the office of the information commissioner, it was necessary to review the cases where an 'indefinite' bar was applied.  It was as a result of this review that the decision was taken to lift the bar on 54 organisations.  In addition a more sophisticated approach is now taken to restricting access to the scheme for non-compliant organisations.  Unlike the previous regime, defined and proportionate periods of suspension are now applied, having regard to the nature and severity of the breach.  This approach also reflects the fact that participation on the scheme is voluntary &ndash; both for the jobseeker and the host organisation.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is fully aware of and committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act, but does not consider it appropriate to release of the details of the organisations concerned.  Indeed, the Department is concerned that, pursuant to section 27(1)(b) of the Act, the identity of the organisations concerned is information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to result in a material financial loss or prejudice the competitive position of the companies in the conduct of their business.  This is a mandatory exemption. <\/p>  <p>  Moreover, given the voluntary nature of participation, both on the part of the Host Organisation and the ease with which a participant can end the internship, the Department is of the view that the suspension of an organisation for an appropriate period is an adequate and proportionate sanction for non-compliance with the provisions of the scheme.  Disclosure of their names would amount to an additional sanction which the Department considers to be disproportionate and unjustly punitive, given the nature of the breach.  In this regard the Department is also cognisant of threats that have been made against employers and host organisations that offer internships.<\/p>  <p>  The success of the scheme is wholly dependent upon the voluntary participation of Host Organisations offering internships that appeal to unemployed people.  Organisations are acutely aware of the potentially serious impact of any kind of reputational damage and there is evidence to suggest that some have not participated in JobBridge because of negative publicity surrounding the scheme.  While the Department acknowledges the public interest in identifying any organisation that wilfully breaches the provisions of the scheme, and its value as a deterrent to those who might contemplate doing so, it is also concerned at the potential negative impact that such disclosure might have on the willingness of organisations to participate in the scheme, and, on balance, feels that the public interest is best served by not disclosing their details.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware that the Information Commissioner affirmed the Department's refusal of access to the names of the companies concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700053#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobsPlus Scheme","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700053#WRA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[40102\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700053#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of progress of the JobsPlus scheme; the number of positions, companies participating, by county; and the total numbers who have availed of the scheme to date.

The position of women who were homemakers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700054#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Measures","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700054#WRB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[40126\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700054#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which she and her Department continue to address the issue of youth unemployment, with particular reference to utilising all available resources, including funding from Europe; the extent to which such efforts have been successful to date; the future expectations in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.   <\/p>  <p>  However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs. For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training. Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. <\/p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan provided for over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014 and the same in 2015.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships. These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee. The Plan also details how the Youth Guarantee is to be funded through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and European Social Fund (ESF)<\/p>  <p>  The YEI is being managed as part of Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the ESF under the Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020, for which the Irish Managing Authority is the Department of Education and Skills. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that he total amount of YEI funding for which Ireland is applying in relation to the years 2014-2018 is &euro;68,145,419 in respect of overall relevant programme expenditure of &euro;204,436,537.  It is anticipated that the YEI funding will be matched by a similar amount of ESF funding, with the balance coming from matching domestic expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  In the normal course of events, this amount of YEI funding will be drawn down as final claims are made in respect of these years. However, I understand that an advance payment of &euro;21,465,806.99 was made to Ireland under the YEI earlier this year.<\/p>  <p>  YEI funding has been applied for in relation to only some of the programmes that go to make up Ireland&rsquo;s response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee. The overall range of such programmes is set out in the government&rsquo;s Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan, which estimated annual expenditure on the core programmes involved of approximately &euro;336 million, with a further expenditure on other relevant programmes (Apprenticeship and PLC courses) of &euro;192 million. Actual expenditure on participation by young people on this range of programmes in 2015 will depend on the take-up of places, and can be estimated only after the end of the financial year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700054#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700054#WRB02550"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[40149\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700054#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she is satisfied that current rent supplement limits are realistic in order to meet the needs of recipients in today's rental market; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting approximately 63,000 people at a cost of over &euro;298 million in 2015.

Flexibility is provided under the National Framework for Tenancy Sustainment for both existing customers of the scheme and new applicants.  Under this measure, the circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits as appropriate.  This flexible approach has already assisted approximately 4,700 households throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.

The evaluation of PLC courses by SOLAS is also a priority, as a significant component of the courses undertaken by BTEA recipients.<\/td><td>The Department has developed a detailed evaluation plan in association with the LMC. Evaluations of the Intreo activation process and the JobBridge scheme are about to commence. These will be followed with evaluations of the BTWEA, CE and T&Uacute;S.An evaluation of PLC courses by the ESRI is currently underway under commission to SOLAS.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2.Research should be undertaken as a priority to establish the drivers behind the poor employment outcomes of BTEA when account is taken of potential factors such as &lsquo;the lock in effect&rsquo; of the programme. Towards this end the DES\/DSP should undertake complementary qualitative evaluation(s) to help inform why the BTEA is failing to meet its employment objective and provide guidance on the future of the scheme. In this regard, course completion rates, the quality of the qualifications received, the earnings of those who do progress to employment and the employment outcomes over a longer duration (e.g. at 2016) are all factors that warrant assessment in a more comprehensive analysis.<\/td><td>1.The Department will commission a qualitative evaluation of the BTEA scheme as recommended. It expects to issue an RFT for such an evaluation before the end of this year. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3.The DSP should consider using existing models and databases to update the BTEA evaluation to establish if there are any changes in reported impacts since the evidence was compiled and whether recent changes to the scheme have led to improved outcomes or not.<\/td><td>This work is currently underway.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4.Data sharing should be implemented between DSP and DES to support improved oversight and monitoring of BTEA participants. In particular this should be done to establish if the course completion rates and the level of educational attainment achieved by participants had an impact on the post-completion employment rates. <\/td><td>Both DSP and SOLAS are in the process of developing new systems which will share data and which will, when completed (end 2016), facilitate tracking of participation and completion.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5.Increased supportive interaction should take place between DSP and participants on BTEA so that participants are clear on what is expected of them; and that the operational guidelines, for example, continued participation dependent on educational achievements, are clearly understood by both sides. At least one mid-term meeting with each participants on BTEA programmes of more than 6 months should be undertaken by case officers to advise participants on the appropriateness for them of continuing with the programme.<\/td><td>Since 2014 DSP case officers review and assess all BTEA applications for labour market relevance.

If a young person does not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.  The measure aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160. <\/p>  <p>  The reduced rates do not apply to persons aged under 25 who were in the care of the State during the year prior to their 18th birthday. The Department actively engages with Tusla and non-Government organisations in providing the necessary support to vulnerable young people leaving care who are experiencing homelessness or are in insecure situations.

Contractors are paid a fee, in arrears, for each thirteen week period of employment up to a maximum of four payments or one year&rsquo;s work.

Rather than increasing limits at this time, rent supplement policy will continue to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of current limits.  Under this measure, the circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate.

This is in the best interests of our bilateral relationship, and of the Union as a whole. As shown by a number of independent studies, a British departure from the EU would have serious implications for Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  In his letter to the President of the European Council on 10 November, Prime Minister Cameron outlined the areas in which he is seeking to negotiate change in the EU\/UK relationship. However, no specific textual proposals are yet on the table. Bilateral consultations between EU Member States and the EU institutions will commence shortly, with a view to clarifying the detail of the proposals and examining the possible technical and legal implications. <\/p>  <p>  While the European Council is due to return to the issue at its meeting on 17\/18 December, it is not yet clear when and how collective negotiation will be organised.  Nor is it clear when the negotiations might conclude.<\/p>  <p>  While the Departments concerned are, with my Department, of course analysing the UK proposals, it is too early therefore to be definitive on particular issues.  However, given our overall starting point, although we might not fully agree in all areas, we will be as helpful and constructive in the negotiations as possible. <\/p>  <p>  In the area of competitiveness we would in general very much agree with the UK.  We would wish to see their concerns on the other broad areas, including the relationship between members and non-members of the euro area and questions of subsidiarity and sovereignty, appropriately accommodated.  Initial reactions from partners would seem to confirm that some, though not all, aspects of what they are proposing on addressing abuses of free movement and welfare reform could be very difficult for others, but the Prime Minister has indicated an openness to alternative approaches.   <\/p>  <p>  I outlined our general approach again in my speech to the CBI conference in London on 9 November and also discussed the issue with Prime Minister Cameron at our meeting the same day. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700055#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":121,"content":"<p>Question No. 108 answered with Question No. 103.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation","counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700055#WRC00700"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[40040\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700055#WRC00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the costs to date of the Commission of Investigation into Irish Bank Resolution Corporation; and the overall anticipated budget and cost to complete its work and to report.","asker":"959","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":124,"content":"<p>Expenditure in respect of the IBRC Commission from the time of its establishment until the end of October was &euro;244,769.  <\/p><p>It is not possible to provide an estimated cost for completion of the Commission's work until decisions have been made on a range of issues arising from the Interim Report which has now been received from the Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700055#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Employment","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700055#WRC01000"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[39736\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700055#WRC01100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the extent to which the number of jobs in the tourism sector has improved in each of the past four years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":127,"content":"<p>The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available.

Properties are being secured under the scheme with over 17,200 rent supplement tenancies in payment awarded this year. <\/p><p>Rent supplement policy continues to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the scheme. Under this approach each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents are being increased above prescribed limits as appropriate. Community Welfare Service staff have a statutory discretionary power to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy or in danger of homelessness.  In addition the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where the supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this protocol to Galway City. <\/p><p>I would encourage people in difficulties with their rent to make contact with the Community Welfare Service administering their claim or the Tenancy Protection Service provided by Threshold in Dublin\/Cork city on 1800 454 454.<\/p><p>This flexible approach has already assisted approximately 4,700 rent supplement households throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation. A county breakdown of this information and current rent supplement recipients is provided in the attached tabular statements, however a breakdown by local authority or postal area is not maintained. Statistics are not maintained on the number of applications requested and refused rent supplement increases. However, I can assure the Deputies that where Departmental staff are notified of a threat of tenancy loss these preventative measures are implemented as appropriate.  <\/p><p>I believe that these measures - and the reforms to the private rental sector announced last week - will continue to provide adequate rent support to rent supplement customers and will provide increased certainty for both tenants and landlords in the current market. <\/p><p><b>Tabular Statements:<\/b><\/p><p><b>Rent Supplement Recipients by County, End October

The total expenditure on carers in 2015 is estimated at &euro;822 million.  <\/p>  <p>  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department - among the highest rates of income support in Europe. The weekly payment rate for a person aged under 66, caring for 1 person is &euro;204, while the rate for a person aged over 66 is &euro;239. An increase of 50% is paid where a carer is caring for more than one person (&euro;306 and &euro;358.50 for carers under and over 66 respectively). <\/p>  <p>  The income disregard and means test for carers is the most generous within the social welfare system and the amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple. A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for maximum payment carer&rsquo;s allowance while such a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate. <\/p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their main social welfare payment and get the half-rate carer's allowance as well. They can also receive an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person. <\/p>  <p>  Carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual carer&rsquo;s support grant in respect of each person for whom they care - there is no means test attaching to payment of the carer&rsquo;s support grant and there is no equivalent payment anywhere else in Europe. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Department provides a comprehensive range of income supports for carers as outlined above and I have no plans to make any changes in this regard &ndash; indeed in the recent Budget, I introduced further improvements in the income supports available to carers - by doubling the period in respect of which a carer can continue to receive weekly payments after the death of the person being cared for, to 12 weeks, and also by increasing the carer&rsquo;s support grant by &euro;325 to &euro;1,700.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to splitting the latter into two payments, there is a compelling argument that to do so would dilute the impact of the payment and I have no plans to change the current arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700055#WRC06200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobPath Implementation","counter":178,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700055#WRC06300"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[40208\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700055#WRC06400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if persons who believe that they have been unfairly and-or unprofessionally treated by\u00a0employees of companies, such as\u00a0Seetac\u00a0and Turas Nua, which companies are\u00a0tasked with the privatisation of the job placement role of her Department, can request to deal solely with their local Intreo office or their local employment\u00a0service rather than with a private for profit company.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":180,"content":"<p>JobPath is a new approach to employment activation that will support people who are long-term unemployed and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed to secure and sustain paid employment.

This measure recognises the important role of fathers in bringing up their children.<\/p><p>- An additional &euro;18 million to increase the Family Income Supplement (FIS) thresholds - by &euro;5 for a family with one child and by &euro;10 for a family with two children or more.  The measure will benefit nearly 60,000 families and over 131,000 children.<\/p><p>Finally, I am also introducing a PRSI Credit which will benefit over 88,000 lower earners with weekly income between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424, by reducing the amount of PRSI they pay in a week.

The Group did, however, find that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted, in cases related to long term sickness or injuries, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard the Group recommended that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  Based on the 2010 report on the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund an increase in the region of 17% would be required for the core contributory State pension plus invalidity pension for the self-employed.  This takes account of the 15% needed to provide the core full-rate State pension.<\/p>  <p>  While I am anxious to expand the level of social insurance entitlements for the self-employed, any such change would have to be funded by an appropriate level of contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700056#WRD03200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Death Certificates","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700056#WRD03250"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[40310\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700056#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason for a delay in the procedures to issue death certificates for those Irish citizens who have died abroad, following the signing by the President in December 2014 of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014; when the issuing of certificates will begin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>The Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 was enacted on 4 December 2014.

In 2016, &euro;6.976 billion will be spent on pensions, which represents 35% of the Department&rsquo;s total current expenditure.  While expenditure on pensions is increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every five years because of demographic pressures, this is being successfully managed within the overall welfare budget.<\/p><p>A number of significant reforms to State pensions have recently been introduced and more are planned:<\/p><p>1. In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, the Government decided to increase State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66. This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. This process saw the abolition of the State Pension Transition payment from 2014. <\/p><p><b>Savings: <\/b>At the time this measure was introduced, the exchequer savings arising were estimated to be in the region of just over &euro;30m in 2014 with a full year savings in 2015 of approximately just over &euro;60m.<\/p><p>2. With effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State Pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.<b><i><\/i><\/b><\/p><p><b>Savings: <\/b>At the time this measure was introduced, the exchequer annual savings were expected to be in the region of &euro;6m per annum in the short term, with this figure expected to rise to &euro;71m in the long term.<\/p><p>3. From September 2012, new rate bands for State Pension were introduced. These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.<\/p><p><b>Savings: <\/b>At the time this measure was introduced, the exchequer savings arising were estimated to be in the region of &euro;2.8 million in 2013, &euro;5m in 2014 and &euro;8m in 2015. <\/p><p>Spending estimates for 2021, with or without these reforms, would not be available to my Department, nor will be for some years, and the net savings they will generate in that year will depend on a number of factors, including the rate of pension which will apply at that point, the rate of working age payments for those without work, and the employment rate for older workers at the stage. It is not, therefore, possible to provide the estimates the Deputy requests regarding 2021 and subsequent years without being highly speculative.  <\/p><p>It would be hoped, however, that savings similar in magnitude to those realised by raising the State pension by one year in 2014 will also be achieved by a similar increase in 2021, relative to the overall pensions budget that will be in place at that time.  While the duration of the average pension will still increase due to increased life expectancy, it is hoped that this reform will keep the associated increase in spending at a manageable level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700057#WRE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700057#WRE01250"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[40461\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700057#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of a mortgage interest supplement for a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

CE is considered to be at the high support end on the continuum of provision for long-term unemployed and other vulnerable groups who are very distant from the labour market. However, there is limited provision for vulnerable groups (e.g. persons with a disability, Travellers, refugees, referred drug misusers, ex-offenders) who can access CE at 18 years of age.<\/p><p>(ii) <i>Persons Signing for Credits<\/i><\/p><p>Persons signing for credits are not eligible for CE as one of the main qualifying conditions is that a person must be in receipt of an actual welfare payment e.g. Jobseeker's Allowance.  There are no plans to relax this requirement.<\/p><p>(iii) <i>Duration of participation on CE<\/i><\/p><p>Under the CE Part-Time Integration Option, persons aged between 25 and 35 years and one year unemployed, qualify for 1 year participation on CE with an option for extension for 10% of participants on a scheme.<\/p><p>However, it should be noted that in the past 2 years, the Department has introduced a special programme for participants entering CE to work on schemes providing early childhood services.  A similar programme is being introduced for participants entering social care services.  The conditions of participation for these groups have been adjusted to accommodate participants engaging in FETAC Major Awards at Level 5 which is the basic entry requirement to employment in these sectors. CE participants on these schemes are permitted to remain for up to a maximum of 3 years continuous participation, on annually renewable contracts and subject to satisfactory engagement in the completion of training and work practice. These conditions apply to all CE participants in these streams. <\/p><p>(iv)  <i>Participation of persons 55 years of age on CE<\/i><\/p><p>The current criteria for participants aged 55 and over allows for a maximum cumulative duration on CE of 6 years (7 years if they were in receipt of a disability payment, inclusive of any time spent on CE while aged under 55). If persons were allowed to remain on CE from 55 years to retirement age, this would mean a participation rate of 10 years which would be very much at odds with the recommendations from OECD and others which highlight that shorter duration schemes (1-2 years) are more beneficial for getting people back into mainstream employment.  This is particularly relevant in the Irish context where unemployment has fallen substantially from a peak of over 15% to 10% and continues to fall as employment grows.  The further extension of duration on CE for persons 55 years and over is not seen as tenable and can lead to a &lsquo;locked-in&rsquo;effect for these participants. I am, however, keeping this issue under review.<\/p><p>(v) <i>Progression rates for CE participants<\/i><\/p><p>The 40% combined progression target for those exiting a CE scheme into employment or  further education\/training is based on the aggregated average progression figure for CE overall.  In a time of a growing economy this target, while challenging for some schemes, is considered achievable for the programme overall.  While the progression rate will vary according to a variety of factors e.g. geographic location, participant profile, these factors are taken into account by the Department.  Given the level of investment by the Exchequer in CE (budget of &euro;373m in 2015), the Deputy will appreciate that it is very important that value for money is achieved and I believe that the best return is the placement of unemployed persons in jobs.<\/p><p>(vi) <i>Funding of training on CE<\/i><\/p><p>The provision of training is a key factor in the preparation for employment for CE participants.  For many, this provides a real opportunity to pursue a qualification that may lead to employment.  The annual budget for training on CE for 2015 is &euro;6.1m which is an increase on the previous year of approximately &euro;1m. In addition to this, significant training and education is provided by the Education and Training Boards at no charge to the Department.There is a procurement system in place for schemes for the procuring of training and the costs vary depending on the type of training and duration.  If schemes are experiencing pressure on the training budget, they should discuss this with their local DSP Intreo Centre.<\/p><p>(vii) <i>Increase in CE participant allowance<\/i><\/p><p>The weekly CE participant top-up is increasing from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 in January 2016, bringing the CE minimum weekly payment to &euro;210.50.<\/p><p>(viii) <i>Completion of CE - benefit payment<\/i><\/p><p>An individual who completes a CE Scheme may qualify for an insurance-based social welfare payment such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit (JB) provided they satisfy the eligibility conditions. To qualify for JB, an individual must have at least 104 weeks PRSI paid since they first started work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year or 26 weeks PRSI paid in the relevant tax year and 26 weeks PRSI paid in the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year. The current relevant tax year is 2013. This means that an individual who has completed a CE scheme, provided they satisfy these eligibility criteria, may qualify for JB. If a person is only entitled to a reduced rate of JB, they may instead claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, which is a means-tested payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700057#WRE01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Appeals","counter":276,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700057#WRE01850"},{"type":"question","counter":277,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[40532\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700057#WRE01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will facilitate an increase in rent allowance for a person (details supplied) in County Kildare who will be homeless unless her Department provides further assistance, with particular reference to documentation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

within the overall social welfare system and provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants. The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. The Government has provided over &euro;70 million for basic SWA in 2015. The SWA scheme is demand led and Government continues to ensure that the necessary funding for the scheme is available. <\/p><p>There has been a substantial reduction in the number of claims and expenditure on SWA schemes since 2010, including weekly basic SWA as set out in the tabular statement.  The reduction in the number of recipients can be attributed to improved processing times in determining entitlement to weekly social welfare schemes, the overall reduction in the Live Register and the general improvement in the economy. <\/p><p>The Department continues to examine the operation of all its services, including the administration of the Community Welfare Service (CWS), in the context of the efficient delivery of services nationally.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. This strategy has been succeeding; in the year up to Q2 2015 the annual increase in employment was 57,100 (+3.0%).<\/p><p>The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 5.5% in Q2 2015. At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 56.2% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012. <\/p><p>Despite these improvements, the level of long-term unemployment, and in particular the situation of those who are very long-term unemployed (more than two years), continue to be of concern. The <i>Pathways to Work <\/i>Strategy therefore provides for enhanced engagement services and additional activation measures to jobseekers while the recovery takes hold. In addition to ongoing reforms, the 2015 iteration of the strategy prioritises additional measures to enhance engagement with the long-term unemployed. This includes a structured process of engagement with long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact). Second, a new employment services model for the long-term unemployed, JobPath began in the second half of 2015. It is a payment by results contract model with third party providers of employment services that will provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers.  <\/p><p>In support of these enhanced engagement processes, 57,000 FET places will continue to be reserved for the long-term unemployed in 2015. A minimum of 16,000 places for the long-term unemployed will also be provided through key public employment programmes. This includes an expansion of the JobsPlus initiative, an employment subsidy that incentivises employers to recruit the long-term unemployed. <\/p><p>The next <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>strategy is being drafted for the period 2016-2020. Although not yet finalised, a core focus of this strategy will be continued prioritisation of those long-term unemployed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700058#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Measures","counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700058#WRF01450"},{"type":"question","counter":323,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[40594\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700058#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which she continues to be in the position to avail of European Union support to alleviate youth unemployment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":324,"content":"<p>The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan for Ireland, submitted to the EU, provided for over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014 and the same in 2015.

As such, maintaining Central Bank funding to support the wind-down of IBRC was the most prudent approach to protect the taxpayer.  Various alternative sources of long term funding were explored but did not prove possible.  It was only when a long-term viable solution for the promissory notes was found and the system more generally had stabilised, that we decided to liquidate the bank.<\/p>  <p>  In line with Government policy the\u00a0issue of burden sharing with IBRC was considered after we took office in March 2011.  There was &euro;3.7 billion of unsecured unguaranteed senior debt in Anglo and INBC in early 2011.  As IBRC was different from the other banks, the Government pushed for burden sharing for these bondholders, conditional on the support of the ECB. <\/p>  <p>  At\u00a0the Government meeting of 29 March 2011, the Government agreed to proposals I presented in relation to bank restructuring.  I\u00a0was\u00a0given the authority to consult with the European authorities, and particularly with the ECB to see if I could get their consent\u00a0for the\u00a0restructuring plan\u00a0and\u00a0for\u00a0burden sharing in particular.  This decision has already been read into the record of the Inquiry, and included as point 4 and point 5 the following:<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0\"(4) agree that measures should be taken in agreement with the EU-IMF-ECB to mitigate the costs of further recapitalisation of the banks and this should be announced.  Such measures would include burden sharing, private investment and asset sales and would have regard to the particular position of each institution and, therefore, the mix and measures available will vary between institutions.<\/p>  <p>  \"(5) agree that discussions will be required at a senior level with the external authorities, with a view to securing agreement to this approach, and in particular that the timing of any recapitalisation would allow for arrangements to be made in this regard. Indicatively at least, some recapitalisation measures may be required to be delayed until June\".<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0announced the measures taken on foot of this Government decision in an address to the D&aacute;il on the 31st of March 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The calls that your question\u00a0refers to\u00a0took place\u00a0earlier on the day of that announcement, and were triggered by ECB concerns.  My recollection is that there were two calls from Mr. Trichet, then president of the ECB, on this date. On one of these calls, the second to my recollection, Mr. Trichet made the statement referred to in your question, that if the proposed burden sharing was implemented that a bomb would go off, not here (Frankfurt), but in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0informed Mr Trichet at that time,\u00a0that it was indeed our intention to burden share with the\u00a0\u00a0senior unguaranteed bondholders of Anglo Irish Bank and INBS.  Mr Trichet expressed his concern at the proposal to burden share,\u00a0pointing out that this would in effect be treated as a default by the markets.  As I outlined to the Inquiry, I was concerned\u00a0 because ELA can't be given to a bank that defaults and this would have resulting implications for access to Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA)\u00a0by the Irish banks, particularly Anglo Irish Bank which was underpinned by approximately &euro;41 billion of ELA at the time (ELA cannot be given to banks in default).<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Trichet also suggested that the burning of the senior unguaranteed bondholders would have a negative impact on the financial services industry in Ireland and\u00a0 that it could cause difficulty for financial services companies to finance themselves on the market if they were located in a country in default.  These were significant issues.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Weighing up the potential savings of &euro;3.7 billion that would accrue to IBRC against the immediate and devastating impact of withdrawal of ECB support on Ireland, and the potential negative impact on the\u00a0financial services sector I decided not to proceed with announcement of\u00a0burden sharing with senior bondholders as\u00a0 the risk was too high for the amount of gain that was involved.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is not true to say that bondholders weren t discounted in the bail-in.  We brought burden-sharing in for subordinate bondholders\u00a0(junior bondholders) and we took over &euro;5 billion out of that.  The late Brian Lenihan had also previously bailed-in some junior debt.  The\u00a0total discounting from junior bondholders over the period was about &euro;15 billion.\u00a0 Junior bondholders were very heavily discounted. Senior bondholders weren t, for the reasons I have already set out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700059#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corporation Tax","counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700059#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":386,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[35263\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700059#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on Ireland's corporation tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":387,"content":"<p>At 12.5%, Ireland has one of the most competitive headline corporate tax rates in the OECD.\u00a0 This rate is applied to a broad base a policy which is endorsed by the likes of the OECD as it is good for growth in our economy.<\/p>  <p>  Our competitive rate of corporation tax has been an important part of our industrial policy since the 1950s, and has attracted real and substantive operations to Ireland since then.<\/p>  <p>  Last year the Department of Finance published the Economic Impact Assessment of Ireland's Corporation Tax Policy.\u00a0 This contained the results of extensive research which was carried out and commissioned by the Department of Finance in 2014 which sought to quantify the effect of corporation tax policy on the Irish economy.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this project, an independent organisation, the ESRI, were commissioned to carry out a study into the impact that the corporation tax rate has on the decision of firms to invest in Ireland.\u00a0 This independent research found if the rate had been higher over the period of their sample then the number of new foreign investments into Ireland would have been lower.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a leader in the areas of tax transparency and administrative cooperation, which are key to tackling the global problems of tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning.\u00a0 The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes has rated Ireland as fully compliant with international best practice for the exchange of information, one of only 21 jurisdictions to get this top rating.\u00a0 Most recently, we fully supported the European Commission's proposals to require the automatic exchange of information about tax rulings among Member States.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has not been and will never will be a brass-plate location.\u00a0 We only have and want real substantive FDI, the kind that brings real jobs and investment into Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In early October the OECD published the final reports on their project regarding Base Erosion and Profit Shifiting or BEPS.\u00a0\u00a0I welcomed the publication of the final BEPS reports.\u00a0 From the beginning, the key aim of the BEPS project has been to better align the right to tax with real economic substance and activity and, as such, the BEPS project is one which aligns with Ireland's own tax strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the\u00a0BEPS project and I believe it is the best approach for dealing with aggressive tax planning.

These amounts are not final and are based on projections for the GDP deflators, reference rates and convergence margins for each of the relevant years as set out in Budget 2016 (see Table A.8).  The actual GDP deflators, reference rates and convergence margins values used by the Commission to assess compliance with the rules each year beyond 2016 will be based on Commission estimates compiled in their Spring forecast, and in relation to the GDP deflator, the Autumn forecasts as well, each year.<\/p><p>A further source of variance arises from the fact that the various factors are applied to the general government expenditure outturn, excluding some items such as interest and the level of cyclical unemployment expenditure.  With regard to cyclical unemployment, the Commission's estimates are based on their own data.  Therefore, outturn variances from the levels forecast in Budget 2016, which is likely in the course of implementation and due to the allocation of fiscal space to expenditure, is another source of uncertainty, albeit with a relatively limited impact.<\/p><p>In the year after a Member State reaches its Medium Term Objective (MTO) set under the balanced budget fiscal rule, the convergence margin requirement under the expenditure benchmark ceases.\u00a0 As outlined in Table 11 on page C.23 of the Budget 2016 book, my Department forecasts that Ireland will reach its MTO in 2019 and, as a result, the convergence margin would\u00a0not be applied\u00a0to the expenditure benchmark calculation from 2020 on.  This leads to a significant increase in the projected fiscal space from 2020 onwards.\u00a0 If the MTO is reached in 2018, then the convergence margin would cease to apply in 2019.<\/p><p>The net fiscal space is the additional room available beyond spending assumptions included in the Budget's baseline spending projections whilst still complying with the upper limit posed by the Expenditure Benchmark.  Net fiscal space takes account of baseline expenditure projections as set out in Table 10 on page C.22 of the Budget book. These assumptions, which are set out in Table A9,\u00a0include the annual cost of providing for demographic spending pressures together with a number of other anticipated elements such as the Public Capital Plan, the cost of the Lansdowne Road Agreement and a number of other calls on the Central Fund.\u00a0 The annual cost of indexing the tax system at an annual full year cost of c. &euro;400m per annum is included in the baseline tax revenue figures in Table 10.  For illustrative purposes, the additional revenue generated from a political decision to not to proceed with indexation is included in the discretionary revenue measures set out in Table A9.

This is a statutory function under the various National Monuments Acts 1930 - 2004.  Additionally, the OPW is tasked to present Kilmainham to the public through a dedicated onsite Guide Service, interpreting its 220 year history including its role in some of the key events in the formation of the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Kilmainham site opens to the public on a fulltime basis 362 days per year.  It attracts significant  numbers of visitors both domestic and foreign, and has a strong profile as a prime site bookending the Dubline, the Failte Ireland-led tourism project aligned to the east\/west city axis.  This is the principal integrated \"avenue\" for tourism in Dublin and is the focus for significant Government investment aimed at developing tourism traffic along the Liffey artery towards a number of key iconic visitor sites (Trinity College, Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, Guinness Storehouse, Collins Barracks\/National Museum, Royal Hospital\/IMMA, etc).<\/p>  <p>  At current levels and with its current model of visitor management, the Gaol building is at capacity and cannot sustain further large scale increases in visitors.   All visitors enter through the historic Gaol entrance and, while this offers an authentic experience, it is very constrained and does not lend itself to dealing well with the volumes of people.  There can be significant delays at the entrance on busy days and the site experiences congestion particularly during peak summer months.  This is leading to a less than satisfactory visitor experience at some times.  There are however significant limits to what can be changed in building terms within a National Monument.  Usually it is not feasible to adapt the spaces to better accommodate visitors.  In the case of Kilmainham it is clearly evident that a modern system of visitor management is needed externally in order to streamline the visitor flow, allow greater numbers to visit the site and offer better standards of comfort and convenience to members of the public.<\/p>  <p>  The Government therefore decided that the former Kilmainham Sessions house, which  occupies a site immediately next to the Gaol to the East, presents a unique opportunity to create additional capacity to deal with visitors to the Gaol in a modern purpose-adapted environment and to, as a consequence, allow for better management of more visitors to the site.  This project is currently underway and will be opened to the public in March 2016 as one of the Government's key 2016 Commemorations projects.<\/p>  <p>  Together with the new development, a number of additional measures will be introduced by the OPW to better manage visitor flows.  Online booking will be introduced which will allow visitors to plan their trip in advance and avoid the uncertainty of queuing at the entrance, as happens currently.  The Gaol will also open for extended hours, particularly during the busy summer months, thus creating more capacity for visitors at the site.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that, due to overcrowding, a number of groups have been disappointed in their efforts to visit the Gaol, including some school groups.   The OPW operates a scheme whereby educational visits to its sites are offered free to schools and Kilmainham Gaol is one of the most popular destinations in this category.   These groups are, - unlike the general individual visitors, - booked in advance and unfortunately, as a direct consequence of the huge popularity of the site, it can occur that all the available slots on a particular desired day are simply booked out.   The OPW regrets such inconvenience.  Unfortunately, School Tours seek to book at particular times of the year and, due to the excess demand, a number of applications may not be successful as the site can be full on the day in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700059#WRG06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Expenditure","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700060#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[40297\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700060#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount of budget funding in the 2015 for flood relief works; the amount spent to date; the budget for such works in 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":442,"content":"<p>The total funding allocation, current and capital, for the Office of Public Works (OPW) overall Flood Risk Management Programme in 2015 is &euro;87.815m.

In line with the 5-yearly cycle prescribed by section 53(6) of the 2001\u00a0Act, the Commissioner has recently completed the 2015 valuations for these seven utilities. The changes reflected in the 2015 valuations arise from changes in the value of each of the respective undertakings since last valued in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the global valuation process relates solely to the network occupied by the particular public utility undertaking and used by it for its principal objects or purposes such as the supply of electricity or gas or the provision of telecommunications or public transport.

The amount of rates paid by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), decided annually by the elected members of the rating authority. In effect, the rating authority determines the total amount of rates liable to be collected from ratepayers in a particular year.<\/p>  <p>  It is too early to forecast the impact of the 2015 round of global valuations on the rates income of rating authorities generally as the 2016 rates have yet to be determined nationwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700060#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":458,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700060#WRH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":459,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[40449\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700060#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the measures he will take to address the emerging two-tier public service, where recent new entrants are being paid substantially less than colleagues fulfilling similar roles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":460,"content":"<p>I refer to my reply to Parliamentary Question No.\u00a036415\/15 of\u00a020 October 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700060#WRH02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Funding","counter":461,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700060#WRH02300"},{"type":"question","counter":462,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[40451\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700060#WRH02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to provide funding in respect of a submission by Galway County Council to the Office of Public Works in respect of flood relief works required to a road (details supplied) in County Galway; if this funding be made available as a matter of urgency, given the road's susceptibility to flooding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":463,"content":"<p>I am advised that this appears to be a matter related to the flooding of a road, and therefore may not be appropriate for the Office of Public Works (OPW).

The funding for any such FIs would have to draw on Ireland&rsquo;s existing RDP allocation of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development funding as well as National Exchequer funding.  So far 7 Programmes from 5 Member States have implemented a FI for the current programme period. In order to include a FI as a measure in a RDP an Ex ante Evaluation is required by EU regulation. This evaluation can take between 3 months to a year to complete. It includes a range of steps and must assess:<\/p><p>1.  Market analysis &ndash; need to prove that FIs are required due to investment gap. This gap must be quantified.<\/p><p>2.  Estimation of value added of FI<\/p><p>3.  Estimation of public and private resources to be raised<\/p><p>4.  Reflection on lessons from other instruments <\/p><p>5.

Revision and updating of the ex-ante assessment in the case of changing market conditions. <\/p><p>Once this is done, an agreement must be reached between my Department and any other potential stakeholders\/financial institutions on a clear investment strategy that is developed from the gaps, if any, identified in the ex ante evaluation.  Following this, a new measure description would have to be drafted and inserted into the RDP by way of an amendment.  FIs can only be introduced to the RDP this way and only one amendment is allowed per year.  Taking account of the timeframe needed to conduct the steps outlined, it is difficult to envisage that a FI would be implemented in time for the next amendment of Ireland&rsquo;s RDP in 2016. <\/p><p>In the interim my Department has been exploring new and more competitive sources of funding for Irish Agriculture and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements.

This credit is available at favourable terms for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products.

We submitted a number of proposals to the Commission, with the focus on stability, certainty and subsidiarity in the implementation of CAP regulations. We also called for a sensible and simplified approach to the interpretation of legislative provisions, for example on equivalent greening measures, on the definition of catch crops and on the adjacency of landscape features and buffer strips to land parcels. We also identified a number of elements in the Commission delegated and implementing acts that needed to be simplified. These related largely to greening requirements and controls. In particular, we have drawn attention to the disproportionate impact on smaller farmers of the formula for deductions and sanctions in respect of over-declarations, and to the complicated formula for reductions and penalties in respect of breaches of greening requirements. We have also drawn attention to the need to streamline and simplify the approval process for rural development programmes.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700063#WRL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Sector","counter":668,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700063#WRL02150"},{"type":"question","counter":669,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[40701\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700063#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the latest reports that the payment of the European Union dairy aid package to farmers could be delayed until the end of March 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":670,"content":"<p>The relevant EU legislative provisions providing for this direct aid payment came into force in mid-October and provide that Member States have the flexibility to distribute this aid through the most effective channels at their disposal.

Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.

The education welfare services of Tusla, comprising the statutory Education Welfare Officers, the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme are key supports for children at risk of early school leaving and educational disadvantage. <\/p>  <p>  Children who do not attend school regularly or who leave school early before age 16 or without completing 3 years of second level education are a priority concern for  the Educational Welfare Service.  Where school attendance problems arise for a child, Tusla&rsquo;s approach is to concentrates on finding solutions, within a collaborative intervention framework involving children, families, schools and other relevant agencies.  The work of the Educational Welfare Officer falls into two key categories. It can involve a brief intervention, at an early stage if the problem is identified and capable of being resolved, or, where the problem is more complex, it can involve the Educational Welfare Officer providing more intensive and ongoing support for the child and family.  I am advised that more than 17,000 children were provided with brief interventions in 2013, while more than 2,400 children were assisted with intensive interventions.<\/p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme and the Home School Liaison Scheme are preventative programmes.  The School Completion Programme provides targeted supports to approximately 37,000 children throughout the country.  The aim is to enhance children's engagement in education and school life.  Typically, projects offer homework clubs; breakfast clubs; mentoring programmes; learning support; social and personal development programmes; out of school supports including music, art and sports and a range of activities during holiday periods.

This will reduce childcare costs by an additional &euro;1,500 and will increase the current 38 weeks of free pre-school provision by an average of 23 weeks, and up to 61 weeks depending on the child's date of birth and the age at which they subsequently start primary school.  The extension to this programme, which will be introduced from September 2016, will cost an additional &euro;47 million in 2016. The full year additional costs of this extended programme will be in the region of &euro;112 million.<\/p>  <p>- A suite of supports to help children with a disability to participate fully in the ECCE programme.  This delivers on my commitment to address these children&rsquo;s particular needs in mainstream pre-school settings.

Funding of &euro;3.5 million is provided for these quality measures in 2016 and will be built upon over coming years.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2016 also resources a dedicated Project Team to develop a single Affordable Childcare programme to provide working families with good quality childcare at a cost they can afford.  Work on this programme will begin immediately, so that it can be in place by 2017.  This programme will replace existing targeted programme - Community Childcare Subvention (CCS), along with the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes, comprising After-School Childcare (ASCC), Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS), and Community Employment Childcare (CEC), providing a new simplified subsidy programme, through both community\/not-for-profit and private childcare providers.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;3 million is also being provided to support both community\/not-for-profit and private childcare providers who need minor funding to develop after-school services using existing school and other accessible community facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700065#WRN02500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care Education","counter":803,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700065#WRN02600"},{"type":"question","counter":804,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[40562\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700065#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans to include children in the free school child care second year (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":805,"content":"<p>At present, children qualify for the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme when they are within the qualifying age range which is 3 years and 2 months to 4 years and 7 months in the September of the relevant year.  This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 qualified for free pre-school from September 2015.  Children who turn 3 from 1 July  2012 are below the age range for eligibility for ECCE in the 2015\/2016 programme year but will qualify for the 2016\/17 programme year. <\/p>  <p>  The recent Budget decisions, which introduced an extended provision under the ECCE programme that allows children to access the free pre-school programme from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school, come into effect from September 2016.  This extended provision, when fully rolled out, will mean that children will have access to free education - either in pre-school or primary school - from the age of three.  The start up date for the introduction of this new measure was decided so as to allow pre-school providers an adequate timeframe to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional numbers benefiting from the programme, which is estimated to increase from 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that, depending on their date of birth, some children enrolling in the ECCE programme in September 2016 will not benefit from this extended free pre-school provision.  I am also aware that, when the programme is fully in place (i.e. from 2017), there will be some children will benefit for a shorter extra period of free pre-school than others.  Again, this will depend on the child's date of birth and the age at which they make the transition to primary school.  Ultimately however, when this extended programme is fully in place, all children will be better off than in the present programme. Indeed, the net effect of the improvements for children overall will be an increase of an average of 23 weeks over the current programme.

The legislation obliges the HSE, when making a decision on a person&rsquo;s eligibility, to take account of the person&rsquo;s financial situation.  This requires the provision of information including the income and reasonable expenditure, of the applicant and his\/her partner and dependants and allows the HSE to assess each application in an equitable and consistent manner.  In the case of a child, the parents' income and reasonable expenditure is assessed.<\/p>  <p>  Where an applicant's means are above the financial thresholds as set out in the national guidelines, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish additional supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 at the beginning of November this year.  This followed the measures announced by Minister Varadkar and I last year to improve the performance of the medical card system when the \"Keane\" Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility was published.  The Deputy may be aware that a key recommendation of that report was that a person's means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the measures, the HSE is ensuring a more integrated and sensitive processing of medical card applications, involving greater exchange of information between the central assessment office and the local health offices in relation to people&rsquo;s medical circumstances and needs.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs and appliances under the Long Term Illness scheme, where the qualification criteria are met.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE accepted an interim recommendation of the Group to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, effective from 1 July 2015.  The CAG is continuing its work on developing a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme and to consider and advise in relation to a more compassionate and supportive approach to include an assessment of the burden of a medical condition(s) in decisions on medical cards. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700066#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":861,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700066#WRO00750"},{"type":"question","counter":862,"qnumday":371,"qnumall":"[40106\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700066#WRO00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a hospital appointment for a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":863,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The HPRA have been seeking to find an alternative supply of BCG that meets safety, quality and effectiveness standards and that could be used in Ireland.  To date no appropriate alternative manufacturer of BCG vaccine has been found.<\/p>  <p>  In early 2015 the HSE asked the HPRA to look at extending the shelf life of BCG vaccine from 12 months to 18 months.

Additional funding of &euro;12 million, was allocated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to meet the needs of almost 1,400 young people who required continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative training (RT) this year, of which &euro;6 million was made available to provide services from September.<\/p>  <p>  Finding the resources and the physical capacity to meet the needs of a growing number of new service users every year is a challenging task.  When this year&rsquo;s support requirements were identified, the cost of meeting those needs in full exceeded the amount available and an additional &euro;1.5 million was added by the HSE to the overall allocation, making a total of &euro;13.5 million full-year costs available to meet those needs.  A further &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding was also allocated by the HSE for the provision of suitable buildings, premises and accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from the HSE that by early July, 97% of all school-leavers in Community Healthcare Area 9 had been offered a placement from September which met their needs in full.  In relation to the individuals that had applied for a service from Gheel Autism Services, the HSE indicated that there would be an allocation of &euro;708,000 made available to Gheel to provide the model of day service that they had developed and once off capital funding of &euro;80,000.  However, following extensive negotiations with Gheel, it was established that services for these individuals could not be delivered by Gheel within this allocation.  <\/p>  <p>  Following these negotiations, the HSE initiated discussions with two alternative service providers, Praxis Care and Autism Initiatives, who already provide quality day services to young people with autism.  These providers have agreed to develop appropriate service responses for 21 young people.  Of these 21, two individuals have recently commenced with Praxis.  Home support services are being made available to the remaining 19 individuals as an interim arrangement and I understand from the HSE, that their new service will be in place by the end of March 2016 at the latest.<\/p>  <p>  A meeting of the HSE's National Project Group to plan for next years school-leavers and RT graduates will take place during November.  At this meeting, the process for 2016 will be drafted for discussion with the HSE&rsquo;s Head of Operations and Service Improvement.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the other operational aspects of the Deputy's questions, I have arranged for the questions to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. However, in light of legal advice following a ruling of the High Court, children born after 1 June 2002 are being treated by the Health Service executive as eligible to apply for an assessment under the Act.  Part 2 of the 2005 Act provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process, given the number and complexity of cases, and has taken a number of measures to address the issue.  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, it should be noted that the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of a National Disability Authority report commissioned by the Department of Health and the HSE, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring children&rsquo;s disability services into integrated multi-disciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams under the HSE&rsquo;s Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme. The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities, including autism, and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to, or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  In 2014 an additional &euro;4 million was specifically allocated to drive implementation of the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  A further additional &euro;4m (equating to &euro;6m in a full year) has been allocated to the Programme this year to support its ongoing implementation.  <\/p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Within this context, funding is being provided  in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy in primary care and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the Progressing Disability Services Programme. Full implementation of the Programme is expected before the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to extend the entitlement to an assessment of need under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 along the lines proposed by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700067#WRP02900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":947,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700067#WRP03000"},{"type":"question","counter":948,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[40333\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700067#WRP03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the funding he provided and the Health Service Executive provided to the Order of St. John of God for the running of St. Raphael's in Celbridge in County Kildare, for each of the years since 2008, in tabular form.

","asker":"999","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":958,"content":"<p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland. There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>).  Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme.  The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p><p>Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>is a fully tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2006.  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.  The introduction of new vaccines is based on the expert advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  Decisions on the supply of vaccines into the market are undertaken by specific expert agencies rather than being the responsibility of the Minister of the day.  <\/p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recently completed a review of the HPV vaccine. The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  <\/p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting. All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  <\/p><p>As of the 10 November, the HPRA has received 932 reports of suspected adverse reactions or events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines.  Of the 932 reports received, 929 were associated with use of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and three were associated with Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>. The vast majority have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions. Parents of any child with a suspected adverse reaction following administration of a vaccine are advised to contact the HSE vaccination teams or their general practitioner for advice and are referred for further management if required.<\/p><p>All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet. The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age. <\/p><p>Prior to all school immunisation parents receive an information pack in a sealed package which contains an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter.  Information packs for all immunisation are standardised nationally. The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination. Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions. <\/p><p>Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website () where further information is available. The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices. The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information. These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.<\/p><p>The EMA has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines. Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700067#WRP04100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":959,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700067#WRP04200"},{"type":"question","counter":960,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[40364\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700067#WRP04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the development of a sound-proof audiology room in Roscommon town; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It proposed a competitive, multi-payer model of universal health insurance (UHI) as the means to achieve universal healthcare.  Following publication of the White Paper, the Department of Health initiated a major costing project, involving the ESRI, the Health Insurance Authority and others, to examine the cost implications of a change to a multi-payer model, as proposed in the White Paper.<\/p>  <p>  This initial costing project has now been completed and the underlying reports are about to be published.  The results of the project are informing deliberation on next steps, including the need for further research and cost modelling.  The next phases in the costing exercise are likely to include deeper analysis of the key issue of unmet need and a more detailed comparative analysis of the relative costs and benefits of alternative funding models to support universal healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  When I assumed the Office of Minister for Health, I concluded that, whilst progress had and was being made in relation to the programme of health reform, the original timeline for implementation of UHI was too ambitious.  However, I also emphasised my commitment to progressing health reform. I am determined to push ahead as quickly as possible with key reforms such as the phased extension of GP care without fees, the establishment of Hospital Groups, the implementation of activity-based funding and the improved management of chronic diseases.  These are all major milestones on the road to universal healthcare and are also important initiatives in their own right with the potential to drive performance improvement and deliver significant benefits in terms of timely access to high quality care. <\/p>  <p>  The recent extension of GP care without charge to children under 6 years of age and to adults aged 70 and over represents the first concrete step on the path to universal healthcare enabling over 300,000 more people to access GP care without having to pay fees. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700069#WRR00400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Neuro-Rehabilitation Policy","counter":1048,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700069#WRR00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1049,"qnumday":438,"qnumall":"[40493\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700069#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason no plan is in place to develop services across the pathway four years after the publication of the national neuro-rehabilitation strategy, given the lack of suitable rehabilitation services from the hospital and back to the community for persons (details supplied) living with an acquired brain injury; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1050,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[40494\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700069#WRR00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there will be an investment programme in rehabilitation services at every stage, including the development of regional in-patient rehabilitation units, intensive rehabilitation after the hospital stay, and long-term community-based supports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1051,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 and 439 together.<\/p>  <p>A Steering Group led by the Health Service Executive (HSE) Social Care Division, with representation from the National Clinical Programmes for Rehabilitation Medicine and Neurology, Department of Health, Primary Care, Therapy Professions and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland has been assigned the task of developing an implementation framework for the National Policy &amp;amp; Strategy for Neuro-Rehabilitation Services.

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable.  It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need (IOTN).  Patients with the greatest level of need i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE.  The number of patients on the orthodontic treatment waiting list at the end of Q2 of 2015 was 18,206 nationally.  There are currently 2,663 patients awaiting commencement of treatment in Galway University Hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  A national procurement process is currently underway to provide treatment for certain categories of misalignment by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE over the next three years, with consideration of an extension to four years.  This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for four years or longer.  Tenders are currently being evaluated and it is expected that contracts will be awarded by the end of 2015.  It is expected that this initiative will have a positive impact on waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  Under EU Directive 201\/24\/EU, now commonly referred to as the Cross Border Directive (CBD), it is open to persons entitled to public patient healthcare in Ireland to choose to avail of that healthcare in another EU or EEA country or Switzerland.

Ethiopia is currently experiencing one of the worst droughts in almost 30 years, as highlighted by the report from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). It is estimated that up to 15 million people will need support in early 2016, when the worst impact of the drought will be felt. 40,000 people have already abandoned their land and 200,000 livestock have perished. The cost of food has increased by as much as 73% in some areas and severe water shortages are resulting in women and girls travelling up to 30 km per day to reach the nearest water source. <\/p>  <p>  Droughts are unfortunately not new to Ethiopia.  The Government of Ethiopia has demonstrated leadership in putting in place long term programmes which help farmers and rural families cope with the short term consequences of sudden climate shocks.  Ireland has been an important supporter of this approach, providing &euro;10.4 million this year to the Productive Safety Nets Programme, which will support up to 8 million of those affected by the drought. <\/p>  <p>  The Government of Ethiopia is responding to the current severe crisis with an additional allocation of US$192 million this year for food aid, water, transport, animal feed and other assistance.

At the same time, as I have said before, we will not support anything that might fundamentally undermine the Union or our own country&rsquo;s position within it.

We are experiencing an ongoing increase in school enrolments and in that context the overarching priority has to be to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place.  At the same time, it is a priority for the Government to move to a more pluralist system of patronage for our schools.  In this regard the patronage divesting process is underway.  In addition, the establishment arrangements for all new schools place a strong emphasis on parental choice.<\/p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an enrolment policy and this must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under the Equal Status Act, 2000 schools are not permitted to discriminate against an applicant for admission on any of the grounds set out in the Act. However, the Act makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The legislation provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.  Schools that comply with the requirements of the Equal Status Act do not therefore discriminate on religious grounds.<\/p>  <p>  As you are aware, I published the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill earlier this year. This Bill provides an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700071#WRT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":1230,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700071#WRT04050"},{"type":"question","counter":1231,"qnumday":504,"qnumall":"[40084\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700071#WRT04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on correspondence regarding resources for a school (details supplied) in Dublin 18; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1030","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1232,"content":"<p>The correspondence referred to by the Deputy covered many areas and I have set out below the position in relation to each of them.<\/p><p>In relation to teaching posts, the criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts, including GAM\/EAL (learning\/language support) is published annually on the Department website. The staffing arrangements for the 2015\/16 school year are set out in Circular 0005\/2015.<\/p><p>Under these arrangements a school's GAM\/EAL allocation for the 2015\/16 school year is based on its mainstream classroom posts for the 2014\/15 school year. Appendix C of Circular 0005\/2015 lists the GAM\/EAL allocation for all schools. <\/p><p>  Schools have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has recommended the introduction of a new resource allocation model for schools, which will allow schools to allocate resources to pupils taking into account their individual learning needs, as opposed to being based primarily on a diagnosis of a particular disability. It is also designed to factor in the educational profile of the student cohort in the school.  A pilot of this new resource allocation model is currently taking place in a number of schools.<\/p><p>  In relation to school buildings, I want to assure you that funding is being made available as part of the Government's continued commitment to fund improvement and upgrading works in existing school buildings throughout the country. In this regard, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, earlier this month, I was able to announce that a minor works grant will be paid to primary schools later this year.<\/p><p>  I also announced that a multi-annual Summer Works Scheme will be run in 2016 and 2017. The Summer Works Scheme for 2016 is now open for applications on the Esinet portal with full details of the Scheme itself on the Department's website www.education.ie.The school in question can apply for funding under the 2016 Scheme for any high priority works needed to the building. <\/p><p>In relation to funding, my Department provides capitation funding to all recognised primary schools. <\/p><p>  The amount of grant paid to an individual primary school for capitation and ancillary services is determined by the school's enrolment, subject to a minimum grant for both capitation and ancillary services in respect of schools with enrolments up to 60, and a maximum ancillary services grant in the case of schools with enrolments of 500 or more. I have no plans to change these arrangements.<\/p><p>  In 2015 the capitation grant is &euro;170 per pupil, and the Ancillary Services Grant is &euro;147 per pupil. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Circular 40\/2009 clarifies issues relating to the allocation of funding for primary schools.

Qualifying works include the provision of stair lifts, level access showers, access ramps, grab rails and some minor adaptation works.<\/p><p>I am aware of the social benefit accruing from the Housing Adaptation grant schemes in terms of facilitating the continued independent occupancy of their own homes by older people and people with a disability.  For that reason, I increased the funding available in 2015 to &euro;50.5 million, an increase of some 10% on last year, enabling local authorities to deliver increased services to their citizens.  I expect that some 8,000 households will benefit under the schemes this year.<\/p><p>My Department also oversees the housing needs analysis undertaken by local authorities to capture the social housing requirements of older citizens.  Current housing legislation requires local authorities to classify any specific accommodation requirements of a qualified household where one or more household member is aged 65 years or more.  This information is collated as part of the statutory summary of social housing assessments. <\/p><p>My Department is also responsible for the Seniors Alert Scheme which encourages community support for vulnerable older people in our communities.  The Scheme provides funding for the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms to enable older persons, of limited means, to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.  The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of Pobal.<\/p><p>Part M of the Building Regulations<b><\/b>aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  The requirements of Part M (M1 - M4) aim to ensure that regardless of age, size or disability:<\/p><p>(a) new buildings other than dwellings are accessible and usable;<\/p><p>(b) extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are where practicable, accessible and useable;<\/p><p>(c) material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings where practicable;<\/p><p>(d) certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings where practicable; and<\/p><p>(e) new dwellings are visitable.<\/p><p>These requirements underpin the principle of Universal Design, which is defined in the Disability Act 2005 as &ldquo;the design and composition of an environment so that it may be accessed, understood and used to the greatest practicable extent, in the most independent and natural manner possible, in the widest possible range of situations and without the need for adaptation, modification, assistive devices or specialised solutions, by persons of any age or size or having any particular physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual ability or disability&rdquo;. <\/p><p>My Department has ongoing contact with other Departments and State bodies in regard to the areas outlined above, including with the Department of Health as lead Department in respect of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  Contact with local authorities in relation to the implementation of these actions is also a continuous feature of my Department's work, in particular in relation to the provision of new sheltered housing for older people and the carrying out of improvement works to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their homes by older people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700073#WRV06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1369,"content":"<p>Question No. 552 answered with Question No. 549.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Administration","counter":1370,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700074#WRW00250"},{"type":"question","counter":1371,"qnumday":553,"qnumall":"[40114\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700074#WRW00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the costs and the timeframe for the proposed re-branding of Irish Water; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1372,"content":"<p>The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (changed to Ervia in accordance with SI 287 of 2014), conforming to the conditions contained in the Act and registered under the Companies Acts.

In the context of social housing delivery, NAMA has had ongoing engagement, since December 2011, with my Department and the Housing Agency in identifying properties that might potentially be suitable for social housing purposes.  To the end of September 2015, a total of 1,600 NAMA residential properties have been delivered for social housing use, comprising 1,241 completed properties and a further 359 that have been contracted and where completion work is on-going.\u00a0  A special purpose vehicle (SPV), known as National Asset Residential Property Services Limited (NARPS), has been established by NAMA as a social housing delivery mechanism. The purpose of the SPV is to acquire properties from developers or receivers in NAMA&rsquo;s portfolio of loans and to make these available to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) by way of a long term lease.  In this way, a number of legal complexities around the securing of properties can be addressed and the process can move more quickly.

The ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital, with research indicating that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths.  The ban was subsequently extended to other large urban areas.   <\/p>  <p>  In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels.  The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones.   <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, air quality monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality can be poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply.  As there is evidence that smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective, the further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas.  In addition, having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal as it can result in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.   <\/p>  <p>I have therefore commenced a process that aims to extend the benefits of the smoky coal ban nationwide.  This process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including with the European Commission, relevant Departments and agencies of Government, the residential fuel industry as well as the general public.  Preliminary discussions on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed ban have already taken place with many of these stakeholders, including with the Commission.  I will be launching a public consultation on Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national Clean Air Strategy early in 2016, and I expect that the precise legal mechanism for bringing in a national ban will be informed by this process.     <\/p>  <p>  Taking account of these consultations and the anticipated completion of the North South Study on residential solid fuel use, it is my intention that a nationwide smoky coal ban will be in place for the heating season 2017\/2018.  This is an ambitious target but I am confident that it is achievable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700074#WRW03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Maintenance","counter":1415,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700074#WRW03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1416,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[40416\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700074#WRW03400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amounts he has allocated to Sligo County Council for adaptations and extensions to social housing, for each of the years 2013 to 2015 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1193","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1417,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[40417\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700074#WRW03500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amounts Sligo County Council  has drawn down for adaptations and extensions to social housing from his Department, for each of the years 2013 to 2015 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1193","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1418,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 567 and 568 together.<\/p><p>My Department provides funding to local authorities for various social housing supports, including for adaptations and extensions to the social housing stock to meet the needs of local authority tenants with a disability or to address serious overcrowding.

The &euro;4 billion Strategy sets out a multi-annual investment programme to prioritise the provision of social housing by local authorities and other key delivery agents such as approved housing bodies.  It contains clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list with flexibility to meet future demand. <\/p><p>The Strategy has been backed up by successive budgets, including this year, where social housing has been an absolute priority, and it targets the delivery of 35,000 units through buying, building and leasing, with the balance of 75,000 to be delivered through the Housing Assistance Payment and the Rental Accommodation Scheme. Budget 2015 included a provision of almost &euro;800 million to support a significant expansion in social housing provision, with some 15,900 new units to be provided this year.  Budget 2016 builds on this investment with an exchequer provision of almost &euro;811 million.

In addition, preparatory work will continue in 2016 on further new innovative projects, such as advancing the provision of 500 new social housing units through a PPP programme and an affordable housing pilot scheme.

Additional resources accruing from sales under the new scheme will, therefore, allow local authorities to invest in the improvement and maintenance of existing housing and for the provision of additional social housing, while allowing tenants to purchase their homes, if they wish to do so.  Therefore, the net effect of the Scheme on local authority housing stock will take some time to become fully apparent. <\/p><p>The net effect of the tenant purchase scheme also needs to be examined in the context of the supply of social housing more generally. <i>The Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>,<i><\/i>sets<i><\/i>out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing by 110,000 to meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list with flexibility to meet future demand.

These projections are based on economic forecasts published by the ESRI, namely the Quarterly Economic Commentary, published in October 2014 and the Medium Term Review, published in July 2013.  The Statement confirms the necessity of the North-South transmission line based on its demand forecasts.  The All Island Generation Capacity Statement is published on the EirGrid website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700076#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hydraulic Fracturing","counter":1512,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700076#WRY01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1513,"qnumday":604,"qnumall":"[40691\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111700076#WRY01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the reason Queen's University in Belfast has withdrawn from the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s study into hydraulic fracturing; if he is aware of the fact that the lack of engagement by independent researchers in providing oversight undermines the credibility of the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1514,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, staff from Queens University Belfast were intended to contribute to the Unconventional Gas Exploration and Extraction (UGEE) Joint Research Programme (JRP) Project A1 (Groundwater, Surface Water &amp;amp; Associated Ecosystems).

There are two options available to motorists who wish to have their vehicles tested before their NCT due date.  They may\u00a0either have their vehicle tested up to 90 days in advance of their test due date without affecting the validity period of the\u00a0test certificate issued or the next test due date.  Alternatively,\u00a0a vehicle may be submitted\u00a0for voluntary early\u00a0testing\u00a0more than\u00a090 days\u00a0in advance of the test due date.  Under this voluntary early testing\u00a0option,\u00a0depending on the age of the vehicle, that is whether the vehicle is subject to biennial or annual testing, the certificate issued will be valid for either two years\u00a0or one year\u00a0from the date of a successful\u00a0test.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The RSA informs me that the\u00a0National Car Testing Service (NCTS)\u00a0makes every effort to ensure that customers understand the implications involved in taking a voluntary early test.  When such a test is booked online, the NCTS website clearly displays a message to this effect.\u00a0NCTS call centre agents also\u00a0provide this information to customers.  Additionally, the Voluntary Early Test letters issued by the\u00a0NCTS to customers clearly states that availing of the option to test early is completely voluntary and asks customers to note that their test due date for future years will be reset to the date their vehicle passes.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With the vast majority of vehicles registered in the first half of the year, traditionally this has proved to be a particularly\u00a0busy period for the NCTS.
