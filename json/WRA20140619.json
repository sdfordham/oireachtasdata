The most significant changes being introduced is the single rate of premium which will make forestry more attractive to non-farmers.  The new &ldquo;Forestry for Fibre&rdquo; measure will allow participants to fell at between 10 and 15 years thereby significantly reducing the length of time before the financial benefits of the plantation can be recovered.   The Agro forestry measure, which is being introduced for the first time as an afforestation scheme, will provide further options for farmers who wish to continue grazing livestock while at the same time grow trees.  This scheme is being introduced on a small scale pilot basis which will then be reviewed.   One of the benefits of agro forestry is that it could act as an introduction to forestry for farmers who may subsequently decide to plant a more traditional forest crop. <\/p><p>Other support measures such as support for knowledge transfer groups, targeted training and producer groups aim to incentivise forest holders to manage their plantations more effectively and to co-operate with neighbouring forest holders when it comes to harvesting and road building.  <\/p><p>Further details regarding the new forestry Programme 2015-2020 are due to be submitted for public consultation in July 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900052#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900053#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[26128\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900053#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plan to introduce of a maximum lobster landing limit of 127 mm; if this will include a mandatory v-notching programme for lobster; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>On 14 May I launched a package of measures aimed at supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s inshore fisheries.  As part of the package of measures, I announced the introduction a maximum landing size for lobster of 127mm due to the importance of very large lobsters to the reproductive potential of the stock.  The decision to introduce this new conservation measure followed on from consideration of over 250 submissions received during public consultation and of expert advice from the marine agencies.  During the first 2 years of operation of this new measure, in order to provide support for potential financial losses throughout the transitional period, fishermen will be paid up to 75% of the market price for v-notching &lsquo;oversize&rsquo; lobsters and returning them live to the sea.<\/p><p>  The voluntary v-notching conservation programme has been an important contributor to the sustainability of Irish lobster stocks.  It was with this in mind that I also announced an increase in grant aid for voluntary v-notching of lobsters from the existing maximum of 55% to a new maximum of 75% as part of the new Sustainable Inshore Fisheries Scheme to be delivered by BIM.<\/p><p>  During the public consultation on the proposals for the lobster fishery, many fishermen, particularly inshore fishermen who depend heavily on lobster for their income, put forward a variety of alternative proposals to safeguard lobster stocks into the future.  These alternatives included but were not limited to strengthening participation in the v-notching programme by a variety of means.  I would like to see inshore fishermen themselves explore and develop such proposals to ensure the long-term sustainability of lobster and other important fisheries they rely upon.  It is for this reason that I also announced the establishment of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) to provide inshore fishermen with their own space for convening and bringing common initiatives forward.  A network of Regional Inshore Forums (RIF&rsquo;s), based on and linked to the community-led Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) around the Irish coast, will nominate delegates to bring forward regional proposals to the NIFF for wider industry discussion.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the Forums will primarily be to develop and facilitate implementation of policies and initiatives relating to the sustainable management of the inshore fisheries within six nautical miles.

My approach to building on the significant achievements of the strategy up until now is to drive the development of the industry at home and increase Ireland`s market share of the world market.  This will ensure that producers and processors can plan for the future, increasing the value of the industry for the benefit of all.<\/p><p>In terms of the performance of the sector in 2013, I am pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew,<i><\/i>reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 8%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m. The market outlook for Irish sheepmeat in 2014 looks reasonably stable as a result of ongoing tight EU sheep supplies and a reduced presence of New Zealand lamb.  Average prices to date this year are almost 6% ahead of 2013.<\/p><p>At producer level I continue to put in place incentives to ensure that producers see a viable future in the sector. Earlier this year the I announced the extension of the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) for a further year. In committing funding of &euro;3m to the programme in 2014 I am acknowledging the success of the 2013 scheme in which 4,000 producers participated. Support for the sheep sector also comes from the sheep grassland Scheme for which I have prioritised funding over the last four years. This scheme delivered &euro;68 million directly to the incomes of Irish sheep farmers and I am very pleased that the scheme will operate again in 2014, with an increased budget of &euro;15 million.<\/p><p>In addition to the budget for the 2014 Scheme being increased from &euro;14 million to &euro;15 million, there is the additional benefit to participating farmers in that payments under the Scheme will not be liable to Modulation, which previously applied at varying rates up to a maximum of 10%. The Modulation deductions made in respect of payments under the 2013 Scheme represent 7.5%. While it is envisaged that the payment rates will be increased under the 2014 Scheme, allowance must be taken of increased sheep numbers but overall I expect that an additional &euro;2 million will be paid to sheep farmers in 2014 under the scheme.<\/p><p>As you are aware I am proposing under the new CAP that payments received under the 2014 Grassland Sheep Scheme will be incorporated into the calculation of the entitlement value in each year of the new regime for those farmers who participated in that Scheme. This will have the effect of increasing their entitlement value and ensure that such farmers do not lose through the cessation of the scheme at the end of 2014. This will include the additional &euro;2 million payable in 2014 and will mean that enhanced funding will be available to sheep farmers under the new regime.<\/p><p>Under the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) I have made provision for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under the knowledge transfer measure and the lessons learned from STAP will inform the development of this measure. The RDP programme will provide support to farmers by means of a range of measures across a number of priorities, including environmental objectives. The new agri-environment scheme, GLAS (Green Low-carbon Agri-environment Scheme) will support, among others, extensive and hill farmers, who have shown themselves to be careful custodians of the countryside in previous agri-environment schemes. GLAS intends giving priority to those commonage farmers who reach a collective agreement on the management of these valuable landscapes.  It also includes a menu of environmental actions, many of which will be suitable for all sheep farmers.<\/p><p>On the export front I intend to drive further the search for new markets.  My Department in consultation with the meat industry and in cooperation with Bord Bia and the Irish Embassies abroad is constantly pushing for new markets and opportunities. The usefulness of alternative markets as a buffer against market volatility was obvious in the sheep export statistics for 2013.  Because of the economic downturn in the UK and France our exports to those markets dipped but we were able to offset this loss with increased exports to Belgium, Germany and Sweden thereby showing a positive net result for the sector at the end of the year.<\/p><p>This week I met with Mr. Liu Yunshan the 5<sup>th<\/sup>ranking member of the Chinese Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee and First Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the CPC.

This funding is more than double the amount that was available to Ireland during the last Common Fisheries Policy and will ensure a strong seafood industry in Ireland that can grow and expand to meet its potential up to 2020.  Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF allocation is to be provided through 5 discrete funding envelopes, namely &euro;71 million for investment in the seafood industry, &euro;32 million for data collection, &euro;37 million for control and enforcement, &euro;5 million for implementation of the Integrated Maritime Policy, and &euro;1.3 million for storage aid.<\/p><p>  The new CFP is a major overhaul of the way which fishing is carried out in EU waters, the purpose of which is to provide a framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks and the whole industry.

In fact, in 2013, Ireland&rsquo;s horticultural industry, excluding potatoes, had a farm-gate output value of &euro;314m.  This represented a 6% increase on the value of output for the sector in 2012.<\/p><p>  Mushrooms represent over one third of the value of output for the sector and a significant proportion of our crop is exported to the UK.  The value of output from the mushroom sector has grown significantly in recent years on the strength of an Industry\/EU co-funded mushroom promotion campaign operating on the UK market since autumn 2010.  Given the success of the original 3-year mushroom promotion campaign on the UK market, Bord Bia, with support from the Industry, submitted an application for a further 3-year mushroom promotion campaign which commenced in Autumn 2013 and covers both the Irish and UK markets and will see a spend of &euro;2.7 million over the period.<\/p><p>  The mushroom sector has also benefited strongly from participation in the EU&rsquo;s Producer Organisation Scheme which is administered by my Department.  Ireland&rsquo;s largest Producer Organisation, Commercial Mushroom Producers (CMP) consists of 54 mushroom growers who, through their Producer Organisations, receive substantial aid through the scheme each year.<\/p><p>  Through the National Development Plan, a total of &euro;13.6m was paid to applicants under the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector over the period 2009-2013.  This competitive grant aid scheme supports capital investments in specialised horticultural equipment and buildings that contribute to at least one of the scheme&rsquo;s four objectives namely: to improve the quality of output, to facilitate environmentally friendly practices, to improve working conditions and to promote diversification of production.<\/p><p>  A further &euro;5 million in funding has been awarded to 163 successful projects under the 2014 Round of the Scheme.  This will support investments by growers of approximately &euro;13 million before the end of this year.<\/p><p>  In support of the sector my Department implements the EU Marketing Standards for fresh fruit and vegetables by conducting inspections to verify these products meet quality and labelling requirements.  One of the key points in these inspections is verification of country of origin labelling.<\/p><p>  On the research front Teagasc is researching the benefits of creating new horticulture energy hubs that will allow new horticultural enterprises to reduce their energy costs while at the same time allowing the energy generator benefit from meeting their targets regarding utilisation of excess heat.  Utilisation of such excess heat has the potential to reduce heating costs for some horticultural growers by up to one third.  For a crop like tomatoes this could translate into a 20% reduction in overall production costs.<\/p><p>  Teagasc is responsible for providing education and training as well as an advisory service for Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food sector and has recently invested &euro;2m in developing its horticultural training facilities at the Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin.  In addition following consultation with employers in the horticultural sector Teagasc are currently re-focussing their horticultural courses to meet industry demand for skilled commercial horticulture focussed graduates.<\/p><p>  Teagasc also plan to develop a horticulture technology hub at Ashtown which will cover horticulture education, research and advisory services all under one single management structure.  This should lead to strong efficiencies and synergies especially between the horticultural food production side and food research team based at Ashtown. This &euro;5m investment will involve construction of new mushroom tunnels, glass and protected structures as well as new classrooms and seminar rooms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900053#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900054#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[26117\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900054#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the decrease in employment in agriculture, forestry and fishing in Quarter 1 2014; the reason for this decrease; the steps he has taken to arrest this downward slide in employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>The CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) shows that there was an annual increase in employment of 2.3% or 42,700 in the year to the first quarter of 2014, bringing total employment to 1,888,200.

As of 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307\/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. <\/p><p>  In developing the shape of the new system of Direct Payments in Ireland, I have been very conscious of the needs of sheep farmers, in particular those who farm on hill and commonage land. In general, sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. <\/p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307\/2013 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  <\/p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned. The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme. If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. <\/p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have an immediate financial benefit in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900054#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900054#WRC00975"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[26142\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900054#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will consider an amnesty for farmers being penalised retrospectively due to unintentional over-claiming of payments due to changes in EU land eligibility technology.

Under the EU Regulations, the Commission has to right to impose a flat-rate correction of 2%, 5%, 10% or greater, depending of its assessment of the risk to the EU Fund involved. <\/p><p>  On the other hand, the level of the correction can be based on the assessed risk, if the Member State can establish the risk and the Commission is satisfied with the calculations.

My Department will continue to work closely with other Departments and agencies in developing the technical capacity necessary to underpin evolution of national climate policy and the development of a definition for carbon neutrality in the agricultural sector.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900054#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Eligibility","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900054#WRC01750"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[26130\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900054#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline the process of the reassessment of areas covered by the areas of natural constraint scheme; the details of the new biophysical criteria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>There is an ongoing review at EU level of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme (DAS) &ndash; this Scheme, to be known as Areas of Natural Constraint,  is to be delineated by Member States using soil and climatic criteria, as proposed by the Commission, as follows:<\/p><p>- Climate, including Low Temperature and Heat Stress;<\/p><p>- Soil, including Drainage, Texture &amp;amp; Stoniness, Rooting Depth and Chemical Properties;<\/p><p>- Soil &amp;amp; Climate, including Soil Moisture Balance;<\/p><p>- Terrain, including Slope.<\/p><p>An area (administrative unit) would be delineated as an Area of Natural Constraint, when it meets the proposed threshold set for one of the above criteria only.

In particular, it is my clear objective that any disruption to our current levels of production arising from the Reform should be minimised. There was a distinct danger for Ireland that the Commission proposal to move to a &lsquo;flat-rate&rsquo; would redistribute funds away from our most productive farmers and land, to the less fertile areas of the country. While recognising that it is no longer possible to justify variations in the level of support on the basis of out-dated historical references, my guiding principle was that the redistribution of funds should take place in a gradual, phased manner over the five years of the new scheme thereby allowing farmers to adjust to the new level of income support. <\/p><p>  For this reason, the redistribution of funds in Ireland will be managed solely through the mechanism of the Internal Convergence Model as originally proposed by Ireland. This model provides a clear methodology for the redistribution of funds from those who currently hold high value entitlements to those who hold low value entitlements. It is predictable and easily tracked and will make it possible to provide very clear information to farmers regarding the level of support they can expect to receive for the period 2015 to 2019. In addition it achieves the stated objectives of a gradual phased redistribution of funds in a fair and objective manner. <\/p><p>  Any farmer with an Initial Unit Value below 90% of the national average entitlements value will see the value of their entitlements increase. The &lsquo;minimum entitlement value&rsquo; by 2019 has been set at 60% of the national average while I have also applied a &lsquo;maximum value&rsquo; whereby no farmer will receive a payment per hectare of over &euro;700 by 2019. <\/p><p>  I have also applied significant priority to young farmers under the Direct Payment Regulation and this priority is supported in our implementation. In common with many other EU Member States, Ireland has experienced a significant aging of our farming community and I have looked to the category of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; as a means of encouraging generational renewal. In this context I have decided to apply the maximum amounts permissible of 3% of our Basic Payment ceiling to the National Reserve and 2% of our National ceiling to the Young Farmers Scheme for 2015. To ensure that the benefits of the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; category are targeted at those who have a genuine interest in agriculture as a career, I am also applying a requirement for a high level of education in agriculture. <\/p><p>  In determining eligibility under the new Scheme, I also decided to implement the so call Scottish Derogation measure which allows my Department to allocate entitlements to those who never held entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme but who were actively farming in 2013.

If the Deputy has concerns in particular cases that individuals are not genuinely self employed, the Revenue Commissioners would be happy to examine any such cases. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is a national audit project (known as the &quot;contractors project&quot;) underway since July 2013, concerned with service professionals who provide services through a company under contract to third-party clients, including clients in the pharmaceutical industry referred to by the Deputy. <\/p><p>  In 2011, through normal audit activity, Revenue identified a potential issue in situations where professionals providing engineering\u00a0 services formed companies (of which they were both directors and employees) which then contracted with client companies, often multinationals, for the provision of the services of the individual.\u00a0 A characteristic of these companies was that they typically had no other business, and no non-director employees.\u00a0 In a number of such cases examined, the level of expenses reimbursed tax free to the director\/contractor was found to be excessive and in several cases included expenses which either had not been incurred at all, or were personal rather than business-related.<\/p><p>  A pilot project operated in Revenue's South West Region in 2012 and 2013 which\u00a0 audited 119 companies with additional liability in 107 cases, and a further 24 directors of contractor companies have also agreed settlements.\u00a0 The total additional tax liability was &euro;2,801,977.\u00a0 Penalties of &euro;906,433 (32%) and interest of &euro;857,216 were imposed.\u00a0 By this time it was clear that there was a pattern of behaviour which warranted a national audit project.\u00a0 A list of companies was compiled from the business sectors identified in previous audits, where there were few or no employees apart from the directors, and which exhibited one of the following characteristics: (a) travel and subsistence expenses amounting to more than 20% of turnover; (b) other expenses amounting to more than 20% of turnover, or (c) the combination of both amounting to more than 25% of turnover.\u00a0 The cases fell into the categories of professional, scientific and technical services (60%), information and communication services (38%) and certain administrative and support services (2%).\u00a0 In addition to cases from this list, audits which remained open in the South West Region at 1 July 2013 were subsumed into the national project.<\/p><p>  Since 1 July 2013, a total of 385 company audit cases have been closed, with additional liability in 299 cases, and a further 49 directors of contractor companies have also agreed settlements.\u00a0 Additional tax of &euro;5,969,630 has been identified, with penalties of &euro;1,765,995 (30%), and interest of &euro;1,639,623.\u00a0 At the moment 368 companies remain under audit, and Revenue is now moving to bring these cases to finality.\u00a0 Most of the audits now open indicated their intention to make a disclosure to Revenue some months ago and availed of a concession whereby Revenue agreed to allow additional time and to provide guidance in compiling disclosures.\u00a0 Revenue has now written to those taxpayers advising that the process of preparing disclosures must be completed urgently if the benefits of voluntary disclosure (which encompass lesser penalty and non-publication provided certain specific conditions are met) are to be preserved. <\/p><p>  In the course of the contractors project it has become clear that the provision of services under contract is a large and growing practice with many thousands of contractors involved in a range of professional services sectors.\u00a0 Many of these professional contractors operate companies in a traditional mode, where they employ staff, operate from an established place of business, and provide a range of specialised services on the open market.\u00a0 For such companies, Revenue's project has generally found little or no additional tax liability arising from travel expenses.\u00a0 Another, quite different type of contracting also exists in considerable numbers, where an individual's services are obtained, often through the facilitation of a recruitment agency, and a contract is concluded with the individual's company.\u00a0 In some cases, a company may be provided to the individual for this purpose.\u00a0 Typically, the work is done at the client's premises and the contractor's company has no other business.\u00a0 Between these two types of contractor there are a huge number of individual variations.<\/p><p>  Revenue published two tax briefing articles in 2013 which made it clear that, where the services of an individual are being provided through an intermediary, as opposed to the traditional provision of goods or services to the market generally, the expenses which may be claimed against tax liability are similar to those that may be claimed by an employee.\u00a0 Thus for example an individual going to work abroad under a contract must bear the cost of doing so him\/herself regardless of whether the contract is with the person or with his\/her company.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  As the current phase of the contractors project comes to a conclusion, Revenue will review the outcomes in detail and decide how best to reflect them in future audit activity.\u00a0 At the same time, Revenue will examine the impact of emerging practices in other areas, for example in the use of contractors operating abroad, to ensure that they pose no risks of loss to the exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900056#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Priory Hall Development","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900056#WRE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[26393\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900056#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the owners of apartments in Priory Hall have had their credit ratings amended in respect of the mortgage loans on those properties as per the resolution framework for Priory Hall agreed in October 2013;

Therefore the assessment of the euro area was based on the 13 Member States that submitted DBPs.  In the case of Austria, Germany and Luxembourg, DBPs were submitted by outgoing governments and on a no-policy change basis.

This decision has been taken to give schools the flexibility to develop their Junior Cycle programme mindful of the educational needs of their own students and mindful of the principles, statements of learning and key skills as set out in the Framework.  In fact, the new Framework  includes a strong focus on education for active citizenship and the promotion of human rights and responsibilities.<\/p><p>  Education about active citizenship and human rights issues are an integral component of the Framework for Junior Cycle.  For example, one of the 24 'Statements of Learning', that encompass the key knowledge and skills that students will develop during their junior cycle, requires that students will &quot; value what it means to be an active citizen with rights and responsibilities in local and wider context&quot;.  In addition, the 8 key skills which underpin the new Framework for Junior Cycle, include &quot;working with others&quot; whereby students should realise and experience how they can &quot;contribute to making the world a better place&quot;.  As students will be expected to experience these principles, statements of learning and key skills, it is anticipated that education for active citizenship and education about human rights and responsibilities will continue to be an important part of the new Junior Cycle.<\/p><p>  I recently approved a new short course in CSPE that has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  This short course will be available to schools to implement from this September, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme.  This programme is in fact designed for 100 hours of teaching compared to less than 70 hours for the existing CSPE syllabus.  The new short course aims to inform, inspire, empower and enable young people to participate as active citizens in contemporary society at local, national and global levels based on an understanding of human rights and social responsibilities.  One of the three strands in the short course focusses on 'rights and responsibilities'.  The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR), the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), are key documents which underpin the course. Informed by these documents, CSPE students will be expected to participate in activities which include designing a campaign to highlight a human rights issue.<\/p><p>  As with Junior Cycle, education about active citizenship and human rights issues are also reflected at Senior Cycle.  As part of transition year, students are afforded the opportunity to further interrogate some of the themes encountered in CSPE at Junior Cycle.  This is facilitated by the availability of resources and materials that have been developed by as number of NGOs, including Amnesty International, for use by transition year pupils.<\/p><p>  I have also indicated my intention to introduce 'Politics and Society' as a new optional Leaving Certificate subject.  One of the objectives of the draft syllabus, which has been developed by the NCCA, is to develop 'a sense of care for others and a respect for and a valuing of diversity in all areas of human life within the parameters of human rights principles'.  In addition, the draft syllabus is structured around four key areas. One of these areas is 'Active Citizenship'.  The Politics and Society subject will be made available to schools once the NCCA has advised my Department on a number of outstanding issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900057#WRF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Eligibility","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900057#WRF01150"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[26375\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900057#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the supports that are in place for parents of multiple birth children in respect of the transition from second to third level education (details supplied).

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, organisational size, etc. and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. <\/p><p>  The Government acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.\u00a0<\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the Office of Government Procurement has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.\u00a0 This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'Meet the Buyer' events hosted nationwide.\u00a0 These 'Meet the Buyer' events are run in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and Inter-Trade Ireland. To date the OGP has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide.\u00a0 These events afforded suppliers an opportunity to meet and discuss the issues with public service buyers and provide networking opportunities for suppliers and encourage consortia-building.<\/p><p>  My Department has also recently finished reviewing and updating existing guidelines and procedures aimed at promoting SME participation in public procurement.\u00a0 Circular 10\/14, launched on 17 April, sets out new initiatives aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses that want to tender for public contracts and also to ensure that engaging with government procurement is easy and low cost.\u00a0 The main thrust of the circular is as follows:<\/p><p>- buyers are advised to undertake market analysis prior to tendering in order to better understand the range of goods and services on offer, the competitive landscape, including the specific capabilities of SMEs etc.<\/p><p>- the circular promotes transparency in procurement by requiring supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 be advertised on the Government's electronic tendering portal, e-Tenders,;<\/p><p>- it encourages suppliers including SMEs to fully use e-Tenders and avail of its facilities in relation to registration, e-tendering and automatic alerts in relation to future tendering opportunities.<\/p><p>- buyers are encouraged not to set turnover thresholds at more than twice the estimated contract value and puts limits on insurance levels for suppliers where possible<\/p><p>- promotes greater use of &quot;open&quot; tendering and less use of &quot;restrictive&quot; tendering<\/p><p>- it\u00a0 encourages SMEs to consider using consortia where they are not of sufficient scale to tender in their own right or where they may lack certain capabilities necessary to provide a compelling proposition<\/p><p>- it encourages Contracting Authorities to break large contracts down into lots where reasonable to do so. This enables smaller businesses to compete for these smaller elements of a larger contract. This has to be done in a way however that does not expose the State to undue risk or significant management overheads.<\/p><p>  The SME Working Group, established under the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, was consulted on the new Guidelines.\u00a0 \u00a0The new Circular has been broadly welcomed by industry representative associations.<\/p><p>  The SME Working Group is chaired by the Office of Government Procurement and includes representatives from ISME, IBEC, Inter Trade Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Competition Authority, the Small Firms Association, Chambers Ireland and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Ireland. \u00a0The focus of this group is to develop and monitor strategies for SME access to public procurement.\u00a0 The group also has regard to actions aimed at maximising procurement opportunities for SME in the public sector.\u00a0<\/p><p>  At EU level there is a growing recognition of the need to promote and facilitate SME participation in public procurement. The New EU Directives on Procurement are currently being transposed into Irish law by the Office of Government Procurement. They are intended to make it easier for businesses and SMEs to tender for public sector procurement contracts.\u00a0 They are designed to simplify the rules and provide more flexibility for public purchasers.\u00a0\u00a0 The directives contain measures specifically designed to improve access for SMEs and start-ups. These include:<\/p><p>- A limitation on requirements for participation, to avoid unjustified barriers to SME participation.\u00a0 In particular, except in justified cases, turnover requirements are explicitly limited to two times the estimated contract value.<\/p><p>- Acceptance of self-declarations will have to be accepted for evaluating the capacity and capability necessary to select them as tenderers until the award stage and the promotion of e-procurement with mandatory electronic availability of procurement documents;<\/p><p>- Contracting Authorities will now have to comply or explain in relation to the division of contracts into lots;<\/p><p>- Member states will be required to provide the Commission with detail on SME participation. Such monitoring can support consistent application across all Member States and ensure that the objective of greater SME involvement is being delivered.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to advise that my Department has accelerated some of the key measures contained within these new Directives and included them in the recent Circular 10\/14 as set out above. <\/p><p>  The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.\u00a0 The Office of Government Procurement will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900059#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Projects","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900059#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[26453\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900059#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when the next meeting will take place between officials from the Office of Public Works and the Lough Mask Heritage Committee; the reason for the delay with this meeting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that they have not received a request for a meeting with the Lough Mask Heritage Group.

No. 140 Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations 2014).\u00a0 Irish Water will continue to be subject to FOI under the new legislation.\u00a0 Records dating back to July 2013, the date of the establishment of Irish Water, are available under FOI.\u00a0 Furthermore where a commercial state body provides a service under a contract to a public body subject to FOI, the records relating to that service will now be subject to FOI, following enactment of the new FOI legislation.\u00a0 The case for extending the application of this principle to other commercial state bodies in a monopoly position\u00a0will be considered in the context of Report Stage for the Bill. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note the following features of the new legislation:<\/p><p>- Extension of FOI to all public bodies as a default with limited exceptions as set out in the Bill bringing long-established high profile exclusions from FOI within remit; and to significantly funded bodies to enhance accountability of such bodies;<\/p><p>- Reversal of\u00a0restrictions to Government records including the very wide definition of Government introduced in 2003, restoration of the strict definition of what constitutes a Cabinet record, communications between members of Government will no longer be exempt from FOI and restoration to the original five years of the ten-year prohibition on the release of Cabinet records;<\/p><p>- provision for some liberalisation of the mandatory 'class' exemption put in place in 2003 in relation to diplomatic communications and defence matters;<\/p><p>- Requirement by public bodies to prepare and furnish publication schemes to promote the proactive publication of information outside of FOI with the publication schemes encompassing at a minimum the requirements of the current \u00a0sections 15 and 16 of the 1997 Act;<\/p><p>- Provision of\u00a0a number of key principles to guide public bodies in the performance of their functions under the Act to achieve greater openness and strengthen accountability;<\/p><p>- Extensions of the functions\/powers of the Information Commissioner, provisions to ensure that FOI requests relating to information held electronically are dealt with effectively; <\/p><p>- Confirmation that there is a general right of access to records held by public bodies and in applying exemptions, the right of access should only be set aside where the exemptions very clearly support a refusal of access.<\/p><p>  The FOI Bill will, therefore, once it is enacted by the Oireachtas very significantly strengthen the legal framework for FOI in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900059#WRH02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Assets","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900059#WRH02300"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[26514\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900059#WRH02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if an exercise is carried out by his Department on a yearly basis to record the value of saleable State assets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Schemes for other types of lone parent families began to be introduced in 1970 when the first scheme for deserted wives was announced, followed by provision for unmarried mothers in 1973 and provision for prisoners' wives in 1974.  Following the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare (1986), a unified social assistance scheme for lone parents was introduced in 1990, known as the lone parent's allowance (LPA) to provide support for all lone parents, whether a man or a woman, and regardless of the circumstances which originally gave rise to their lone parenthood.  The one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme, which was introduced in 1997, builds on the LPA scheme.<\/p><p>  The number of OFP recipients stood at 77,400 in April, 2014.  The cost of the OFP scheme was &euro;935 million in 2013 and is estimated to be &euro;863 million in 2014.  Both the OFP maximum personal rate for the parent (&euro;188 per week) and the increase for each additional qualified child (&euro;29.80) remain untouched since 2011.  An OFP recipient can also earn up to an average of &euro;425 per week and still receive the OFP payment.  <\/p><p>  The OFP scheme has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents since its introduction.  However, in the past, this income support was passive in nature, with little systematic engagement being made by the State with recipients.  This engendered long-term social welfare dependency and associated poverty among one-parent families.<\/p><p>  Despite significant levels of State spending on OFP the results have been poor in terms of tackling poverty and social exclusion rates among lone parent families who continue to experience higher rates of 'consistent poverty' in comparison to the population generally.<\/p><p>  The reforms to the OFP scheme that were introduced in Budgets 2011, 2012, and 2013, aim to address these issues.  They aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to escape poverty and joblessness, to participate in education and training and by entering the workforce to attain financial independence for both themselves and their families.<\/p><p>  The reforms to the OFP scheme also aim to bring Ireland's support for lone parents in line with international provisions &ndash; where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, introduced changes to the OFP scheme, including the phased reduction of the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which a recipient's payment ceases to 7 years from 2014 for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients.  <\/p><p>  Special Provisions exist for customers who are in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) and, also, for those who are recently bereaved.  These savers can extend payment of the OFP beyond the maximum age limit threshold for these customers.<\/p><p>  OFP recipients affected by these changes are supported to transition to other social welfare income support payments as appropriate, including family income supplement (FIS), carer's allowance (CA) and jobseeker's allowance (JA) including the JA transitional arrangement.  <\/p><p>  Previous OFP recipients who avail of a jobseeker's payment are required to engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation service, where they are provided with access to a range of educational and employment supports to increase their skills and assist them in securing employment.  This is a significant reform for lone parents as it is the first time that this cohort has access to the Department's full activation process.  Lone parents, in receipt of a jobseeker's payment, who do not engage in the activation process, will be subjected to the same penalty rates and disallowances as every other jobseeker.<\/p><p>  The income disregard of the OFP scheme is also being reduced on a phased basis for new and existing recipients of the payment.  It is currently &euro;90 per week and will reduce to &euro;60 per week by 2016.  The OFP earnings disregard does seem to have played a role in facilitating lone parents to enter the workforce but it may also have had the effect of trapping lone parents in low-paid part-time employment in order to keep their earnings below the disregard.  The result is that, despite the fact that 36% of OFP recipients are in employment, relatively small numbers are moving off the OFP scheme because their earnings exceed the upper limit.<\/p><p>  The reforms to the OFP scheme aim to provide affected lone parents with access to a wide range of supports and services.  These supports are designed to enable lone parents' secure improved outcomes for themselves and their families by enhancing their prospects of securing long term financial independence.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900061#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":228,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 89 and 90 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code Reform","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900061#WRK01150"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[26504\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900061#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to lobby for change in social welfare rules in order that company directors whose businesses fail receive social welfare payments before a wait of 18 months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.

To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  <\/p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  <\/p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900061#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Cases","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900062#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[26516\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900062#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the full impact on the State of the Waterford Crystal court case; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1182","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":242,"content":"<p>Reforms have been introduced in recent years to ensure the sustainability of pensions into the future.  These decisions were taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  For example,\tthere are currently 5.3 people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  The over 65 year old population is also projected to increase from 11% of the total population in 2010 to 15% in 2020 and to 24% in 2060.<\/p><p>  There are approximately 17,000 additional pensioners coming into receipt of State pension each year.  In the absence of reform, it is estimated that State expenditure on pensions (including public sector occupational pensions) would increase from approximately 7.5% of GDP in 2010 to 11.7 % in 2060.  In 2013, the overall Departmental expenditure figure was &euro;20.2 billion and expenditure on pensions accounted for 32% of this.  <\/p><p>  Whilst the increase in life expectancy is a very welcome development, this also has obvious and significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision. The fundamental principle involved here is that longevity in the workforce needs to be supported if people are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement. <\/p><p>  A number of policy reports on pensions have been completed including a Green Paper on Pensions (2007) and a National Pensions Framework in 2010.  I commissioned the OECD Review of the Irish Pensions System which was completed in 2013.  <\/p><p>  Arising from the changing demographics described, these policy reports and the need to provide for sustainable pensions and longer working lives, a range of reforms have been introduced recently to the pension system as follows -<\/p><p> In January 2014, State pension age was standardised at age 66 with the cessation of State pension transition. The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.<\/p><p> With effect from April 2012, and as provided for in legislation in 1997, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.<\/p><p> As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced. These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.<\/p><p> As announced in Budget 2012, the period for which a claim for State pension can be backdated is six months. This change came into effect in April 2012.<\/p><p>From December 2013, the number of paid contributions required for Widow&rsquo;s\/Widower&rsquo;s\/ Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s pension increased from 156 contributions to 260 contributions.<\/p><p>  It is also planned to introduce a &ldquo;total contributions approach&rdquo; to determine eligibility for a State pension. The level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life. The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change. <\/p><p>  It is Government policy through the provision of generous tax reliefs to support private supplementary pension saving to allow individuals cater for an adequate income in retirement.  The Deputy will be aware the Government has previously highlighted its concern at the currently low supplementary pension coverage rate of approximately 50% of workers.  This is why the Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming Ireland&rsquo;s pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers. <\/p><p>  The OECD Review of the Irish Pensions System provides an international perspective on Ireland&rsquo;s retirement-income provision. Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report also makes a number of recommendations for future reform. The OECD&rsquo;s key recommendation is to improve the adequacy and sustainability of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment based pension system. <\/p><p>  The OECD has indicated in its report that its first preference is a mandatory scheme, with its second preference being automatic enrolment, whereby people would be automatically enrolled but could opt out.  I have previously stated that a soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, has been proven a successful and proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage.  However, it is recognised that introduction of any such initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case.  The recommendations contained within the OECD report are currently being considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900062#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900062#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[26544\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900062#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the maximum rent support available in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>The maximum rent limit for an eligible family unit as outlined in the specified area is &euro;850.00 per month. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900062#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Benefit Applications","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900062#WRL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[26547\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900062#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent, if any, to which arrears in respect of child benefit are due in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and   <\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are under way and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. <\/p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched.  While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.  Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of the Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users.  The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is under way in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention.  I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This list is available on my Department's website, .  Currently, a total of 40 areas in County Meath have been identified as requiring an intervention.  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise.  Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention.  I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. <\/p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 36 fibre-based broadband networks in County Meath by July 2016.<\/p><p>I would emphasise to the Deputy that in line with EU State Aid Guidelines the State will set timelines for investment commitments to be met by commercial operators.  If such investments have not happened within the timelines, the State will have to intervene so as to ensure nationwide access to high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention.  It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy.  EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised.  This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900063#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900063#WRM01350"},{"type":"question","counter":281,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[27080\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900063#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the cumulative total of unapproved salary top-ups currently being paid under the remit of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":282,"content":"<p>The information sought regarding payments to staff by Semi-State Companies is an operational matter for each Company.

These measures enhance the possibility of achieving Ireland&rsquo;s ambitious growth strategy for the agri food sector, as envisaged in Food Harvest 2020.<\/p><p>  In particular the CAP Reform package established agreement on the basic share of the direct payment and on rural development reforms, which secures the production base of the Irish meat and livestock sectors.  This in turn leaves farmers and other operators at the production base of the agri food sectors better positioned to both meet the competitive challenges and exploit the export opportunities of the international marketplace.<\/p><p>  The agri-food industry is Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous manufacturing industry.  Collectively the industry is responsible for some 140,000 jobs and has an annual output of more than &euro;20 billion, with a huge reliance on exports. <\/p><p>  Given this importance of exports, I have consistently placed great emphasis on developing relationships in new and expanding markets for all Irish meats and dairy products in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future. I am continuing to work with industry to raise the profile of the Irish agri-food sector generally.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding current difficulties, there is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus continues to be to enable Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise. My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues. These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement to import from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran which allow the import of Irish beef. To date in 2014, the Lebanon has agreed to re-open its market to Irish beef, sheepmeat and cooked meats. A certificate has also been agreed with Hong Kong allowing for the export of Irish sheepmeat and agreement has been reached with Namibia on a certificate for the export of beef, sheepmeat and goatmeat.<\/p><p>  On the dairy side my Department strongly supported the decision to abolish milk quotas on the basis that quotas were widely regarded, by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts, as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  All indications are that the abolition of quotas next April will bring about an expansion in the sector as the industry begins, in earnest, the quest to achieve the 50% increase in production target it set for itself in Food Harvest 2020. For my part I have been working on a number of fronts to prepare the industry for the move to a quota free environment and equip it to respond to the market opportunities arising.<\/p><p>  There is no doubt that the realisation of this increased production target will be dependent on the achievement of maximum efficiency at production and processing levels.  It will require particular focus on the changes needed in milk processing, in on-farm competitiveness and in the transfer of technology and knowledge to dairy farmers.  It will also require investment in R&amp;amp;D and in marketing.  The Irish dairy sector is well placed to deliver on those objectives. Significant progress has already been made in gearing the industry up to meet the challenge of a liberalised market.  At farm level my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has been providing support to milk producers through various measures:  The Dairy Efficiency Programme has provided assistance to help improve skill sets and increase on-farm efficiency, so that they can achieve better economic returns.  More enhanced Knowledge Exchange measures are being proposed under the new Rural Development Programme. The Dairy Equipment Scheme encouraged capital investment to ensure farmers are equipped to gear up for expansion and a follow on Scheme is also proposed under the new Rural Development Programme.  Support for AHI and ICBF programmes to improve animal health and genetics are helping to position the milk production sector to capitalize on the market opportunities afforded by an increasing global population and expanding demand for dairy products. At processor level, the major players in the sector are currently engaged in significant capital investment and expansion to prepare themselves for the increased production.  The promoters of these expansion plans are confident that the demand from emerging markets will ensure strong returns for their dairy products.  Over 85% of Irish dairy production is exported and growth in global population is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900066#WRP01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900066#WRP01550"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[26527\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900066#WRP01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that trade deals negotiable by the EU, in the aftermath of Common Agricultural Policy reform, do not undermine the Irish or European food industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":365,"content":"<p>As a small open economy dependent on trade, Ireland favours ambitious and balanced trade agreements.

I have sought to ensure that beef farmers have the necessary supports to enhance the profitability and sustainability of their livestock enterprises.  The broad outline for developing the beef industry in Ireland was set out in my Department&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 (FH2020) strategy.  The Beef Activation Group was established in February 2011 to consider the steps necessary to achieve the targets for the beef sector contained in the FH 2020 strategy.  FH 2020 initiatives have had a positive impact on the beef sector since 2010 include: the launch by Bord Bia of the Origin Green Programme; the retention in 2012 of the Suckler Cow Welfare Programme; an increase in the number of advisors dedicated to beef in Teagasc; a trebling of the number of farmers in the ICBF Herdplus Programme; the launch of the Beef Technology Adoption Programme in 2012, worth &euro;5m per year; the extension of the Teagasc \/ IFJ BETTER Farm Beef Programme to cover every county in Ireland.<\/p><p>  This year, I announced details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014, aimed at sustaining a critical mass in the suckler cow herd, the seedbed for our beef industry.  This package includes: &euro;23m for the Beef Genomics Scheme; &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme; &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme; &amp;amp; &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme.  I also announced details in relation to the financial allocations for the new Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 (RDP) as well as outlines of the proposed measures for inclusion.  The development of a new RDP will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.<\/p><p>  Under the new RDP, beef suckler farmers will be eligible for participation under a range of measures, including: a substantial new agri-environment\/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS.  This will provide for a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers and a further payment of up to &euro;2,000 for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions; continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint) to the tune of about &euro;195 million per year; incentives for on-farm capital investment, including support for the expansion of the dairy sector following the abolition of milk quotas in 2015; knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions; a new beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year aimed at improving the genetic quality of the beef herd; a separate strand of the support for on-farm capital investment will be ring-fenced for young farmers at a higher rate of aid intensity of 60%; &amp;amp; other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers, organic farming etc.<\/p><p>  The Government is confident that this range of measures will, when taken together with other Pillar I direct payments, assist suckler farmers to improve their on farm viability. <\/p><p>  Another aspect of my strategy for the continued development of the beef sector is to constantly develop relationships with existing and in new and expanding international markets, raising the profile of Ireland and increasing international confidence in Irish production and control systems. Since taking office I have led trade missions to China, the US, Algeria and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. The US has lifted its ban on the importation of beef from the European Union and my Department is currently working with the meat industry to advance the various technical requirements to ensure commencement of trade at the earliest possible date. <\/p><p>  There is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus is aimed at enabling Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise. My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel, on market access issues. These initiatives have led to a number of notable recent successes in securing market access from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran.  This year to date we have agreed access terms with the Lebanon and Namibia. In 2013 the value of beef exports is estimated to have increased by 10%, driven by a 5% rise in output and a similar jump in average prices. As a result, exports were valued at &euro;2.1 billion. I expect that our export performance will continue to improve.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s investment this year in the beef sector is a strong vote of confidence in the sector. It exemplifies the smart, green growth initiatives envisioned in the FH2020 strategy and, coupled with additional support measures under the new Rural Development Programme, will underpin the development of a sustainable beef sector with long-term growth potential.<\/p><p>  I recently launched a beef roundtable to bring together the various stakeholders to discuss current issues. There have already been a number of initiatives in the wake of this forum. These include: The Beef Roundtable discussions will reconvene quarterly to exchange intelligence on market developments and forecasts particularly in relation to supply, demand, prices, product specifications, retail changes etc; I have committed to launching a &lsquo;Beef Pricewatch&rsquo; online tool to make price information more accessible and free of charge to farmers.  Work has commenced and already as an initial step the department has improved  its website in order to make price information more user friendly for farmers.<\/p><p>  My Department is examining the possibility of legislating for the recognition of producer organisations in the beef sector, and will shortly be launching a consultation with key stakeholder groups in this regard.  This initiative could provide a vehicle for collective action by farmers in a way that can give them the advantages of scale and market presence, as well as a useful vehicle for transferring technology and expertise to improve profitability at farm level.

Levels of discards in the EU vary depending on the size and nature of the fishery.  Ireland has been to the forefront in the drive to reduce and eliminate discards for many years and I was delighted to launch an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas in 2011, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet targeting whitefish on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  This was the first publication of its kind and placed Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards and assisted in advancing the case for a phased elimination of discards as part of the CFP reform package.<\/p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish was a major component of the negotiations for the reform of Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which were concluded under the Irish Presidency in 2013.  To this end I was pleased that agreement was finally reached whereby a practical and phased discards policy or landing obligation will be introduced, beginning in 2015.  The phasing in period means that fishermen will have time to adjust and implement changes that will allow for the avoidance of non target species where there are particular problems with the relevant by-catch (such as that the stock is overfished and needs to be allowed to rebuild).<\/p><p>  In that context, I have established a national Discards Implementation Group, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Noel Cawley, to advise on the issues arising in the effective implementation of the new policy and to recommend practical solutions and arrangements that take into account the situation of the Irish industry.  The primary aim of the group is ensure that the Irish fishing industry are fully prepared for, and engaged in, the implementation of the discards ban.<\/p><p>  The work of Dr. Cawley&rsquo;s group also contributes directly to the work of the regional group of Member States (Ireland, Belgium, France, UK, Netherlands and Spain) who have the primary responsibility in the development of specific &lsquo;Discard Plans&rsquo; for fisheries in north western waters.  The first of these, for pelagic fisheries, will come into effect on 1 January 2015.  From the outset of the Common Fisheries Policy revision process, Ireland&rsquo;s overarching goal was to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations.

The view of the Expert Body is that the overall design of the studies is poor and they do not provide evidence of any effect on children's IQ from either high or low fluoride levels.

The report is a review, which contains no new data.

Preparations are now in train for the implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy and the arrangements for this implementation will be finalised as soon as possible. The needs of our older people are, and will remain, a very high priority for  the Government, and the resources that are available will always be applied to provide the best possible mix of supports and services. <\/p><p>  Residential care in Ireland is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private nursing home facilities. Most of the residents receive significant financial support towards the cost of their care under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. While there will always be a need for long-term residential care, older people have consistently said that they want to be facilitated and supported to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.   Accordingly the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which is currently being undertaken is considering how residential and other supports and services should be balanced in the future to  support older people in ways that best  meet their wishes and that make the best possible use of available resources. As a first step, in 2014 an additional &euro;23m has been provided to strengthen community and home-based services and to develop more flexible and responsive approaches to care.   This is in addition to the budget of &euro;315m already provided for home help and home care package services which are delivered to some 56,000 people at any one time.<\/p><p>  With the above said, the Government is acutely aware of the implications for service requirements of the projected demographic trends, and all relevant information will be taken account of in future decisions.<\/p><p>A   key priority identified in the HSE's National Service Plan for 2014 is the implementation of a Single Assessment Tool (SAT) for older people. This standardised framework will uniformly assess dependency levels, allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible. The first phase of implementation of the SAT will commence in 2014 with a minimum of 50% of all new entries to the NHSS, Home Care Package and Home Help Schemes assessed by the SAT in the last quarter of 2014, with full implementation of SAT by the end of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900073#WRW00900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Expenditure","counter":544,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900073#WRW00950"},{"type":"question","counter":545,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[26519\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900073#WRW01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the expected cost of the health service over the next 20 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":546,"content":"<p>It is very difficult to estimate the cost of funding the health service over the next 20 years.  However, it is generally accepted internationally that healthcare costs are rising and will continue to do so into the future.  <\/p><p>  There a number of factors which are driving health costs upwards year on year including an ageing population, an increase in chronic diseases, the development of new cost-intensive medical technologies and a rise in public expectations.  <\/p><p>  Ireland is not immune from these trends.  We are now in the midst of relatively rapid population ageing, and this is a trend which will continue over a number of decades.  Over the next few years, the population aged 65 and over will increase by approximately 20,000 per year. By 2021, the population over the age of 65 will have increased by close to 40% since 2011, representing an additional 200,000 people. Chronic diseases and their risk factors are also major drivers of healthcare costs - 80% of health spending relates to chronic conditions &ndash; as well as associated economic losses.  By 2020 the number of adults with chronic conditions (such as overweight and obesity, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cancer and dementia) will have increased by around 40% with relatively more of the conditions affecting those in the older age groups. An additional factor in driving health costs upwards is the advances in the development of highly cost-intensive medical technologies and treatments.  <\/p><p>  I believe that managing the impact of these significant financial, resource and demographic pressures on the health system in Ireland in the years ahead, while delivering safe and high quality health and social care services, will only be possible by way of a reformed health system.  That is why the Government is committed to ending the present unfair, unequal and inefficient two-tier health system and to introducing a single-tier system, supported by universal health insurance.  This reformed system will provide access according to need rather than ability to pay. It will deliver best outcomes for available resources and will treat patients at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, effective and efficient and as close to home as possible.<\/p><p>  In addition, I am also keen to shift the emphasis towards health prevention, promotion and improvement in the years ahead.  This has already begun through the Healthy Ireland policy framework which represents a whole-of-Government and cross-sectoral approach to addressing the growing demands on health services due the increase in the incidence of chronic illnesses and an ageing population. Protecting health and putting in place targeted, cross-sectoral and cost-effective prevention programmes and policies will assist in reducing the prospect of unaffordable future health costs which will certainly arise if current health trends are not addressed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900073#WRW01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[26520\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061900073#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the action he is taking to contain costs in the health service, for example, by keeping people out of accident and emergency departments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>It is generally accepted internationally that healthcare costs are rising and will continue to do so into the future.  It is therefore important to make the most efficient use of resources in healthcare delivery.  This requires, inter alia, increasing emphasis on models of care that treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide safe quality services at the least possible cost.  This is particularly important in the light of increased demand for services arising from population growth, increased levels of chronic disease, increased demand for drugs and new costly medical technologies and treatments.  <\/p><p>  That is why the Government is committed to ending the present unfair, unequal and inefficient two-tier health system and to introducing a single-tier system, supported by universal health insurance which will provide access according to need rather than ability to pay. The reformed system will deliver best outcomes for available resources and will treat patients at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, effective and efficient and as close to home as possible.<\/p><p>  Primary Care is widely recognised as a cost effective way to deliver essential health care services and the implementation of the Primary Care Strategy is a priority for this Government.  The Strategy involves a move away from the older hospital centred model to focusing on the delivery of care in the community and home.  In a developed primary care system, 90 to 95 per cent of people&rsquo;s day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting, providing &lsquo;the right care, in the right place, at the right time&rsquo;, where people have direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of GPs, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other health care disciplines thus avoiding more expensive acute treatment.  Since this Government came into power in March 2011, 37 primary care centres have opened and infrastructure development is underway or at an advanced planning stage at a further 43 locations where delivery is expected over the period 2014 to 2016\/early 2017. The HSE also plans to enhance the services of existing Community Intervention Teams during 2014 with an increased emphasis on helping people avoid hospital admission or return home earlier.  <\/p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE are also focussed on implementing the Government&rsquo;s reform programme for acute hospitals including establishment of acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, to provide an optimum configuration for hospital services for the delivery of high quality, safe patient care in a cost effective manner. <\/p><p>  The Special Delivery Unit works intensively with management and staff in acute hospitals to embed process\/system improvements at hospital level, to monitor and audit these improvements, to validate waiting lists and to capitalise on additional productivity arising from the Haddington Road Agreement.  Hospitals, in conjunction with the HSE National Clinical Programmes, seek to ensure that patients' average length of stay is within the national targets established by the Clinical Programmes, and monitor such activity regularly.  <\/p><p>  A key part of this is proactive management of discharge planning, with patients moving to lower acuity beds at other facilities, such as smaller hospitals or nursing homes, for rehabilitation and convalescence if appropriate.  Other measures which positively affect cost containment include ongoing improvement in the management of clinical pathways for patients, and optimisation of the use of Medical Assessment Units \/ Minor Injury Units \/ Urgent Care Centres, as alternatives to over-reliance on Emergency Departments. <\/p><p>  In addition, I am also keen to shift the emphasis towards health prevention, promotion and improvement in the years ahead.
