It is committed to removing any barriers that remain which prevent persons with disabilities from participating in activation programmes and employment.  To this end, the Department provides a wide range of work related supports for people with disabilities.  The principal support is the EmployAbility service, which provides job coach support to people with disabilities in accessing jobs in the open labour market, and the service currently supports over 3,000 people.  Funding is also provided to AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) for the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme, an employment placement programme for graduates with disabilities.  Other supports include the provision of employment subsidies, workplace adaptation grants and specialist training courses that are specially designed for people with disabilities.  These supports, which cost an estimated &euro;37 million in 2015, play an important role in supporting increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities.  In addition people with disabilities have access to nearly all of the standard supports available to other jobseekers.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitments to facilitating increased participation in employment for people with disabilities are reflected in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy.  A key part of this strategy will be the setting up an interdepartmental group, under an independent chair, to review and make recommendations on making work pay for people with disabilities through the examination of the complex interactions between the benefit system, the additional costs associated with work for people with disabilities and net income earnings from employment.<\/p>  <p>  A young person with a disability is free to avail of the Intreo service, where a range of supports are available.

The rate of consistent poverty in 2014 was 8%, a slight though not statistically significant decrease on 2013.<\/p>  <p>  This survey found that the 29% of the population were affected by basic deprivation. This is a reduction of 1.5 percentage points on the 2013 rate, which in turn is the first reduction since 2007. A significant finding is that the vast majority of those experiencing basic deprivation are not at-risk-of-poverty, but are in low to middle income households.<\/p>  <p>  As noted, the basic deprivation data relate to 2014, and therefore do not reflect the full impact of the recovery underway in economic growth and employment.

These ensure that people have an adequate income in old age.  This range of supports has resulted in very similar outcomes for male and female pensioners in Ireland.  Consistent poverty rates for women and men over 65 have effectively been at parity over a number of years, despite many women having lifetime lower earnings than men.<\/p>  <p>  The State pension contributory is one of the State pension schemes, and its rate of payment is related to contributions made over the years into the Social Insurance Fund.  As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under that scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Entitlement to the contributory pension is determined by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at the 85% rate. <\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Work has commenced on changing this to a total contributions approach where the number of contributions recorded over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation. <\/p>  <p>  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.  I believe that it is important that the changes be announced well in advance of introduction, to enable those workers affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.  This new method will provide greater benefit for some, but not all, future pensioners than they would have had under the current system.  It is not anticipated that the changes will apply to existing pensioners.  Any reforms are required to contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the pensions system and not increase costs.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300062#WRA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Conservation Grant Administration","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300063#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[1204\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300063#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the administration costs for the implementation of the water conservation grant.","asker":"1195","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>The Department of Social Protection is administering the Water Conservation Grant on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community, and Local Government.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for SPC also being satisfied.<\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>  <p>  The most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  It further confirms that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund due to the distributive nature of the Fund. <\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  The position of women who were homemakers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300063#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Income Supplement Data","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300063#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[1162\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300063#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons in receipt of family income supplement for each of the years 2011 to 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>The family income supplement (FIS) provides support for employees, with families, who have low earnings in relation to their family size.

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as flooding.<\/p><p>In early December 2015, the Department of Social Protection activated its humanitarian assistance scheme, administered by the local Community Welfare Service (CWS), to assist householders affected by the severe weather conditions. The situation in all affected areas is being monitored and CWS staff are engaging with the local authorities and other agencies to ensure supports are being provided to those affected as swiftly as possible. Emergency clinics have been opened in towns where required including Ballinasloe, Crossmolina, Athlone, Gort, Carrick on Suir and a number of towns in Kilkenny and staff are assessing and meeting the demand for assistance by the public as the needs arise and are visiting the homes of persons affected.<\/p><p>In dealing with emergency events of this nature, the Department generally adopts a three stage approach as follows: <\/p><p>- Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments (food, clothing and personal items) in the immediate aftermath of the event.  A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially with payments around the country ranging from &euro;100 to &euro;500 depending on family size. <\/p><p>- Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items. It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known. <\/p><p>- Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required. It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental\/Agency response. Works carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting.<\/p><p>There has been over &euro;3.9m spent under this scheme since 2009. Since 4 December 2015 emergency payments have been made to 270 households with expenditure of over &euro;235,000 with further claims being processed. These are mainly payments covering essential clothing, food, toiletries, meals for families relocated to alternative accommodation and fuel costs. Support has been provided to 28 households in County Mayo to date under the scheme with expenditure of &euro;40,000.  A breakdown of payments by county is provided in the tabular statement below. <i><\/i>Statistics are not maintained for individual towns.<\/p><p>The scheme is demand led and there is a time lag between the flooding event and actual claims for financial support. It is expected that the number of claims will increase in the coming weeks as we move into stage 2 and stage 3 supports which cover the replacement of furniture and white goods and longer term financial supports.  I can assure the Deputies that CWS staff are working hard to ensure that supports are provided to people as quickly as possible. Statistics are not maintained on the number of applications received or their outcome.  <\/p><p>Assistance is not provided for losses which are covered by insurance or for commercial and business losses, or generally any loss or damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation. However, the Department&rsquo;s focus at this time is on ensuring that persons, including tenants, immediate needs are met and emergency stage 1 payments are being made to tenants to ensure that basic requirements are provided.<\/p><p>Emergency payments under the Department&rsquo;s urgent needs payment (UNP) scheme may be considered in exceptional circumstances for landlords to cover essential items that have been damaged by flooding.  The normal conditions that apply to the UNP scheme would apply including that any subsequent insurance recovery may be used to reimburse the Department. Consideration will also be given to the ability of the landlord to meet these immediate costs.  Details on the UNP scheme is at  <\/p><p>The Department has been advised that the residents in the area referred to by Deputy Kelleher were affected on 29th\/30th December when the river Glashaboy burst its banks.  The flooding appears to have been fluvial which is within the remit of the OPW.  The local authority is the principal response agency and Cork County Council responded to the flooding event by providing pumping equipment, where appropriate, and sandbags.  The purpose of the Department&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance scheme is to provide assistance to households who have been affected by flooding and other severe weather events, this can include hire of pumps for private houses in conjunction with the local authority as required, however, would not generally include the purchase of preventative equipment. <\/p><p>People seeking assistance under the scheme should contact their local DSP Intreo Centre or CWS office who will be able to offer assistance.

It also belies the assertion that fiscal consolidation has disproportionately impacted on the most vulnerable in society. Central to this significant social policy outcome has been the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintain the value of the core welfare rates, while at the same time providing additional welfare funding to cater for increases in the number of welfare recipients including, in particular, the ongoing rise in the number of pensioners. <\/p><p>The impact of social transfers (that is all welfare payments excluding pensions) on poverty and income inequality for the period 2008-2014 is set out in the tables appended to this reply using official EU indicators and data from Eurostat. <\/p><p>In 2014, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 37.2% to 15.3%; thereby lifting over a fifth of the population out of income poverty. This is equivalent to a poverty reduction effect of 58.9%. Ireland is the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers, higher even than the Scandinavian countries such as Denmark, Finland and Sweden. <\/p><p>Furthermore, Irish social transfers are almost twice as effective in preventing poverty as the EU average and up to four times more effective than the member states worst affected by the economic crisis.<\/p><p>With regard to income inequality, in 2014, Irish social transfers reduced the Gini coefficient from 45.6 to 30.7, an inequality reduction effect of 32.7% and the highest in the EU.  <\/p><p>The data in the tables shows the impact of social transfers and income inequality excluding pensions. Equivalent Eurostat data including the impact of pensions (social security and occupational) show equally strong impacts for Ireland and can be viewed at <\/p><p>The key achievement of this Government has been to stabilise the nation&rsquo;s finances, to increase employment and to achieve economic growth.  This endeavour is well underway and we are already reaping the benefits of these policies, including, the ability to invest in the improvements I have announced over the last two years in welfare supports.  <\/p><p>The recent Budget was designed to improve the lives and living standards of every person and every family in the country.  The 2016 Budget package I introduced had four key aims, as follows:<\/p><p>- To increase supports for pensioners aged 66 and over;<\/p><p>- To strengthen supports for families with children;<\/p><p>- To increase the momentum to date in helping jobseekers back to work; and<\/p><p>- To provide targeted assistance for vulnerable groups.<\/p><p>In Budget 2015, I reintroduced a Christmas Bonus payable at 25% of the weekly rate. The Bonus had been abolished by the previous Government in 2009. In Budget 2016, I was pleased to be in a position to provide a 75% Christmas Bonus payment for all welfare recipients. <\/p><p>Weekly personal rates of payment for all those aged 66 and over increase by &euro;3 per week from January with proportionate increases on qualified adult rates. In addition, all of those eligible for the Fuel Allowance, including jobseekers and lone parents, gain from the increase in January of &euro;2.50 per week, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week over the fuel season.<\/p><p>Funding for the Free Travel scheme, which benefits a large number of persons with disabilities, carers and pensioners, is being increased by &euro;3m, from &euro;77m to &euro;80m, to meet increased numbers eligible for the scheme and therefore fully protect entitlements under the scheme. <\/p><p>Families with children will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the monthly rate of Child Benefit while lower income working families will also benefit from increases in the Family Income Supplement thresholds. &euro;3 million extra is also being provided for the School Means scheme.<\/p><p>The Respite Care Grant, now renamed the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant to better reflect the usage of the grant, is being increased by &euro;325, from &euro;1,375 to &euro;1,700 per annum.  Furthermore, payment of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be extended by 6 weeks, from 6 weeks to 12 weeks, after the death of the care recipient. <\/p><p>These improvements show that we are on the right path. Our goal is an Ireland visibly better for all including those less well off. The last Budget was our fifth Budget. The first three were immensely difficult but they were necessary to restore our public finances to health, help sustain and create employment, and chart a course towards strong economic growth. And at all times, we sought to protect the most vulnerable in society to the greatest extent possible. <\/p><p>Last year &ndash; much quicker than most economists had expected in 2011 &ndash; we were able to introduce a Budget that began the process of raising living standards and reinvesting in our communities. We have kick-started the social recovery.

These arrangements have been continued and I have no plans to revisit the bonus arrangements for 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The key achievement of this Government has been to stabilise the nation&rsquo;s finances, to increase employment and to achieve economic growth.  This endeavour is well underway and we are already reaping the benefits of these policies, including, the ability to invest in the improvements I have announced over the last two years in welfare supports. These improvements have included the re-introduction of the bonus as well as a wide range of other Budget measures such as increases for pensioners, families and carers in Budget 2016 which cost an additional &euro;264 million. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300063#WRB06400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Payments","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[46462\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when arrears under the disability allowance scheme will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>The person in question has been awarded disability allowance (DA) with effect from 5 August 2015.

Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years. This began in January 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition. The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the specific compulsory retirement age and minimum pension age provisions which affect an individual public servant will reflect his or her particular employment sector and time of original recruitment. Public servants who must retire at age 65 can draw their public service pension at age 65. The State pension changes have no impact on such persons where they are in the modified social insurance category. <\/p>  <p>  Where alternatively they are in the full social insurance category, their public service pensions (and contributions) are, as with many occupational schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits. This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State pension. The State pension (contributory) entitlement is calculated with reference to the complete PRSI record, including contributions made while working in the public and private sectors. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of retirements of fully insured public servants at age 65, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the rules of the public service scheme to bridge the gap until State Pension commencement at age 66 years. This supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of his own or her own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate. It is therefore necessary to claim the available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension. This situation is not new and already applies to public servants with a retirement age below 65 years.<\/p>  <p>  The current provisions, which apply to someone claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from a date after their 65th birthday, is that they may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  While this is currently up to their 66 birthday, this approach will continue to extend their jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit entitlement continuing for another year when the pension age rises to 67, and indeed a further year when it rises to 68 in 2028.  This eligibility is of course still subject to satisfying conditions such as the &lsquo;genuinely seeking work&rsquo; condition. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code Reform","counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC03300"},{"type":"question","counter":147,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[46542\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will change the retirement age of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1206","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":148,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010 and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU\/ECB\/IMF. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  More people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  In this context, the duration for which an average pension will be paid will continue to increase.  The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of this demographic change.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years. <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  It was estimated at the time that the net saving resulting from its abolition, when taking into account that many people were instead in receipt of other payments at the lower rates applicable to those under 66, would amount to &euro;33.5m in 2014 and would amount to approximately &euro;65 million in 2015. <\/p>  <p>  There is no legal retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment.  Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  <\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce legislation to change from the current position. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC03600"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[46552\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC03700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will issue a decision on an application under the carer's allowance scheme by a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) from the person concerned on 17 August 2015. <\/p><p>The application has been referred by a deciding officer (DO) to a local social welfare inspector (SWI) to assess whether they are habitually resident, assess means and confirm that all the conditions for receipt of CA are satisfied. <\/p><p>Once the SWI has reported, a DO will make a decision and the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC03800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Data","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC03900"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[46560\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC04000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of new claims she has approved and the percentages for the number of refusals based on financial grounds under the disability allowance scheme in each year since 2011 to date.","asker":"1080","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>The department does not maintain statistics, broken down by reason(s), in relation to disallowances of disability allowance (DA) applications. <\/p><p>The following table relates to the total number of disability allowance decisions that were awarded and disallowed for each year from 2011 to 2015.  <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Awarded *<\/th><th>Disallowed<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>9246<\/td><td>14116<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>10400<\/td><td>14519<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>12497<\/td><td>14691<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>13876<\/td><td>12621<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>15814<\/td><td>14800<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>(*)Please note that the statistics in relation to awarded cases include cases also recorded in the disallowed category which were initially disallowed but subsequently awarded following a review by a deciding officer or a successful appeal.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Applications","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC04200"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[46575\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300064#WRC04300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry under the invalidity pension scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":157,"content":"<p>Invalidity pension (IP) is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and who satisfy the pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions.  <\/p>  <p>  A claim for IP was received from the person concerned on the 10 September 2015.

The Bonus had been abolished by the previous Government in 2009. In Budget 2016, I was pleased to be in a position to provide a 75% Christmas Bonus payment for all welfare recipients, including recipients of both Disability Allowance and Invalidity Pension.  A single person in receipt of Disability Allowance received a bonus payment of &euro;141 and a couple, with a qualified adult and no children received a bonus of &euro;234.60.

These measures will benefit the carers of  those Disability Allowance and Invalidity Pension recipients who are relying on another person to provide full time care. <\/p><p>It should also be noted that as a result of Budget 2015, recipients of Disability Allowance and Invalidity Pension who live alone gained from the &euro;1.30 increase in the weekly rate of the Living Alone Allowance. <\/p><p>The key achievement of this Government has been to stabilise the nation&rsquo;s finances, to increase employment and to achieve economic growth.

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided an annual saving of &euro;22 million. This allowed the Department to protect other more fundamental social welfare payments such as the State pension.  Accordingly, I have no plans to reinstate the bereavement grant. <\/p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include a weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pension based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension continue in payment for six weeks following a death, and in Budget 2016 I increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone is looking after an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease. <\/p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses.  The assistance is toward the costs of the necessary basic requirements for a dignified funeral.

The community services programme (CSP) provides financial support in the form a contribution to the cost of wages to community companies that provide revenue generating services of a social inclusion nature not otherwise provided.  These community companies operate on a community business or social enterprise model. Companies supported by the CSP are funded on the basis that they are allowed to generate and use income from the services they provide to pay staff, meet overhead costs and to contribute to their future development.  The CSP provides a contribution to the wage cost on the basis that the services are not fully self-financing or the cost of provision would be prohibitive on users. The Department does not set the wage rate but requires the payment of appropriate wage rates consistent with local norms.<\/p>  <p>  Companies employing some 2,800 employees are directly supported by the programme.  At the end of 2015, the Department estimates that some 60% of these employees are paid above the level of the minimum wage, in keeping with the social inclusion and social benefit objectives of the programme.  The Department is committed to working with the remaining companies to achieve the objective of paying a reasonable wage. <\/p>  <p>  Contracts of up to three year duration are provided for under the CSP.  Arrangements whereby individual companies will be able access additional financial resources to compensate for the welcome increased in the minimum wage are being put in place.  Submissions will be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the annual funding commitment being adjusted accordingly where it is found to be warranted.  An advance of 25% of the contract commitments for 2016 has or is in the course of being paid to companies currently in contract under the programme. <\/p>  <p>   I am satisfied that the level of resources available to the CSP in 2016 at just over &euro;45 million will be adequate to meet the ongoing funding needs of the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300065#WRD06200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Registration Legislation","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300066#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[46850\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300066#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 54 of 9 December 2015, when in 2016 she expects that marriages such as the one referred to in the question will be permitted to be held; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Expenditure on FIS for 2015 is estimated to be of the order of &euro;349.2 million and it is currently paid to some 55,000 families in respect of almost 121,000 children. <\/p>  <p>  An integral part of FIS is that the payment continues at the same rate for a period of 52 weeks, assuming the eligibility requirements continue to be met, except in the following circumstances:<\/p>  <p>- If a claimant starts to care for an additional child in the course of the 52 weeks. <\/p>  <p>- If a claimant was getting a one-parent family payment and this payment was stopped because their youngest child reached the relevant age limit.<\/p>  <p>The rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in earnings.  The advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides an incentive to claimants to maximise their earnings from employment (e.g. more hours, higher wages).  For those who experience a reduction in earnings, the rate of payment will be reassessed at renewal of their FIS claim.    <\/p>  <p>  This aspect of the FIS scheme is important in minimising the administrative effort associated with the scheme and in speeding up processing times for claims, which could otherwise be subject to delays due to periodic reviews.<\/p>  <p>  A legislative review of the 52 week rule was carried out in 2013\/14 and an amendment was included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014 to reflect this policy.

","asker":"986","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":252,"content":"<p>The social welfare system is primarily a contingency-based system, with entitlement based on a number of defined contingencies such as sickness, unemployment, old age or widowhood.  There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system.  Firstly there is the contributory principle which links the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and their entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid, subject to legislative provisions, where a particular contingency arises, and without a means test.  Secondly there is the solidarity principle where the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more likely to have an income need as a result of circumstances that have arisen in their lives.  In this regard, it should be noted that most PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.  It should also be noted that access to Widow&rsquo;s\/Widower&rsquo;s\/Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension is available to those who have been married or in a civil partnership only, and that scheme will not benefit someone who has been single all their life. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the benefits and pension system is to provide a person with an adequate income.  The rate of payment is set with this objective in mind, and the fact that there are a number of ways one can qualify for a pension does not mean someone may qualify for multiple PRSI-funded pensions.  There is a principle of one person, one payment, which generally applies across the social welfare system.  It can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time.  For example, an unemployed person may also become sick and incapable of work.  The PRSI paid by the person and their employers only provides coverage for one payment at such times.  Under the legislation for the schemes, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, generally he or she can receive only one payment.  Similar legislative provisions apply in the case of PRSI funded pensions, and a person cannot be in receipt of both a State pension contributory and a Widow&rsquo;s\/Widower&rsquo;s contributory pension at the same time.  It should be noted, however, that the maximum personal rate of a Widow\/Widower&rsquo;s contributory pension is significantly higher for those aged 66 or over than it is for a widow or widower of working age, as it is aligned with the maximum personal rate for the State pension contributory.  This principle of no more than one main payment per person is common to social security systems across the world.<\/p>  <p>  Arrangements in relation to private pensions vary across the wide range of schemes and investment products available, each of which may have different benefits depending on a scheme&rsquo;s rules or product type.  Private occupational pensions generally require additional contributions to provide survivor&rsquo;s benefits.  In nature they differ significantly from State pensions.  Private pensions do not generally have the broad social solidarity based provisions common to social welfare pensions, nor the high level of direct State subsidy which exists for State pension schemes financed from the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p>  <p>  Amending the State pensions system, to allow for two pensions be paid to one person, would be a significant change to the system, providing certain people with the pension income considered necessary for two people, and would greatly increase the cost of the pensions system.  This extra cost would have to be financed from either an increase in the rate of PRSI contributions, an increase in the Exchequer subvention to the scheme, or a reduction in the rate of payments. I have no plans to introduce such a change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300066#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Debt Collection","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300066#WRE00950"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[46908\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300066#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason for the deduction in the case of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>The Department is obliged to recover debt owed to it as quickly as possible, having due regard to the circumstances of the debtor.  <\/p>  <p>  The person concerned has an outstanding carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) debt of &euro;22,224.42 which the Department is recovering by way of &euro;50.00 weekly deductions from her CA payment. <\/p>  <p>  The person concerned was refunding the debt by weekly deductions of &euro;30 commencing 13 November 2014.

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.974 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approx. 35.5% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  The Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;84 million in 2016 for the increasing number of pensioners.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. <\/p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million, and with the year-on-year increase in the number of people qualifying for the household benefits package, this yearly saving will increase.  These savings meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  The Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 416,000 customers. <\/p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and I have sought to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, I was able to announce the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years, by &euro;3 per week.  This will increase the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  I was also pleased to announce a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  I believe that, taken together with other changes, such as increasing the Christmas Bonus to 75% of weekly rate, the impact of this Budget will be very positive for older people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300067#WRF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Eligibility","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300068#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[1224\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300068#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if medical evidence identifies that a child with severe disabilities is in need of two full-time carers, why both carers are not entitled to a full carer's allowance, as that is what the child needs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>Carer&rsquo;s allowance is an income support payable where a person requires full-time care and attention.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied. <\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>  <p>  The combination of measures under the Social Protection code have resulted in very low levels of consistent poverty, both for men and women, aged over 65.  The most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money due to the distributive nature of the Fund. <\/p>  <p>  There are no statistics available to my Department detailing the numbers who spent period(s) outside the Irish labour market to care for their families, and who, as a direct result of those periods, would not qualify for a State pension.  Such statistics would comprise largely of people who have not paid PRSI for many decades, and who in many cases would not have made a claim under the State pension system.  There are a great number of reasons why someone might cease paying PRSI contributions from a certain date, and the data sought by the Deputy is not, therefore, available to my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300071#WRK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":466,"content":"<p>Question No. 166 answered with Question No. 130.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments Waiting Times","counter":468,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300072#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[1532\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300072#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which the time taken to process applications for various social protection payments has improved; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":470,"content":"<p>A breakdown of the average time, where available, to award claims at the end of December in each of the years 2006 to 2014 and at the end of November 2015 is detailed in the tabular statement below.<\/p><p>It should be noted that processing times vary by scheme reflecting the differing requirements to satisfy conditions such as income\/means limits and medical eligibility.

This obligation also stems from the Fiscal Compact, to which Ireland acceded following the referendum in 2012, and has also been enshrined in domestic legislation through the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.<\/p><p>As Ireland is not yet at its MTO, it must improve its structural balance by more than 0.5% of GDP per annum until the MTO is reached. In the Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) adopted by the Council on 14<sup>th<\/sup>July 2015 an improvement of 0.6% was stipulated for 2016. The forecasts in the Budget for subsequent years were based on a minimum annual structural improvement consistent with the table below.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The required adjustment for 2017 will be\u00a0set in the CSRs to be adopted by the Council next July on the basis of a European Commission recommendation. The Commission has clarified over the last year the basis on which it will make its recommendation for an appropriate improvement in the structural balance\u00a0for each\u00a0Member State. Its analysis takes account of the debt-to-GDP ratio, the size and sign of the output gap and whether the economy is growing faster than potential.\u00a0 The matrix describing the required\u00a0structural adjustment\u00a0based on these criteria has been published by the Commission and is outlined below.

The payment of the levies is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levies.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levies should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. <\/p>  <p>  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levies. <\/p>  <p>  If it is the case that the trustees of the scheme in question have chosen to pass on the cost of the levies then, to the extent to which they have done so, any deficit which the scheme was carrying will not have been increased as a result of the levies. <\/p>  <p>  It is not the case, as suggested in the details supplied, that any part of the levies will be\u00a0due for payment\u00a0in 2016.  The payment date for the final part of the 0.15% levy was the 25th of September 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In the details supplied it is suggested to return money collected through the levies \"in line with the return of money to retired public servants\".  While public service pensions are not fund-based and so have not been subject to the pension fund levies, serving and retired public servants have been subject to the Pension Related Deduction (PRD) and Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) as appropriate, reducing, respectively, salaries and pension payments.  While changes to the PRD and PSPR are proposed to start from this year which will result in reductions in the PRD and the PSPR, particularly affecting public servants on low and middle incomes and retired public servants in receipt of low pensions, there is no provision for the repayment of PRD or PSPR deductions which have already been made.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy tax collected as suggested in the details supplied.  The value of the funds raised by way of the levies have been used on reduced tax and increased expenditure measures as part of the Jobs Initiative\u00a0to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levies may have been passed on by the chargeable persons for the levies will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and continued in Budget 2016 to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is not necessary, as suggested, to rescind the legislation which enabled the levies as it\u00a0was explicitly time-bound and no longer applies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300075#WRO01550","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Requests","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300075#WRO01575"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[46894\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300075#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when, following the Information Commissioner's decision to vary the decision of his Department in freedom of information request 177\/2013, he will release the additional documents to this Deputy.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":603,"content":"<p>I should inform the Deputy that Freedom of Information requests are dealt with by officials in my Department.

However, significant regional differences exist particularly as between the Dublin region and the rest of the country.

The strong economic recovery and in particular the increase in employment has brought about a strong increase in the demand for housing. However, owing to a number of constraining factors, the supply response has been sluggish to date, in turn contributing to recent price developments. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government has taken an active role in addressing the ongoing issues in the housing and rental market. Most recently, Minister Kelly and I announced the Rent Certainty and Housing Supply package, agreed by Government, which is designed to stabilise the rental market in the short run and support the sustainable growth in the housing market over the long term. In terms of specific measures intended to increase housing supply, the package includes changes to planning guidelines and standards, support for housing-enabling infrastructure and a targeted rebate of development contributions for housing supplied below certain price levels in Dublin and Cork where supply constraints are most binding.<\/p>  <p>  This package builds upon Construction 2020 Strategy: A Strategy for A Renewed Construction Sector which sets out the Government's overall strategic approach to increasing housing supply.

As in the previous two budgets, in which the benefits of USC and income tax cuts have been capped at &euro;70,000 in earnings, it is my intentionshould I be given the opportunity to present further budgetsto claw back some of the benefits of USC abolition for the highest earners.

I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or in relation to the mortgage interest rates charged.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.\u00a0 This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding. <\/p>  <p>  The current interest rates in Ireland are also determined by nationally specific features such as increased credit risk resulting from high levels of non-performing loans and lengthy and uncertain processes of collateral recovery, weak competition, and the constraints on bank profitability arising from legacy issues of the financial crisis, such as an increased regulatory requirement for capital.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I have taken steps to ensure that the banks provide\u00a0options for mortgage holders to reduce their monthly repayments.\u00a0Last May, I requested a\u00a0report from the Central Bank on the topic which was subsequently published. I also met with the six main mortgage lenders in May and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to Irish customers was too high.\u00a0The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In September\u00a0I concluded a series of\u00a0follow up meetings with these banks and the reality is that\u00a0the majority have put options in place to allow many borrowers reduce their repayments. These options\u00a0range from lower variable rates to new suites of variable rates based on loan-to-value and reductions in fixed rates. I therefore encourage borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them in their circumstances or consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory. In this regard, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) website www.consumerhelp.ie is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions. In addition, the CCPC are currently running a mortgage switching campaign and have a mortgage switching tool on their website which should allow borrowers compare rates charged across institutions.\u00a0 I also note that some lenders offer repayment of legal fees or cash incentives to borrowers switching mortgage provider.<\/p>  <p>  I asked the banks to provide options by which borrowers could reduce their monthly repayments and I believe options have been put in place. Furthermore, I am pleased to see that new initiatives and reductions continue to take place. As recently as last week one bank introduced a 0.5% reduction on managed variable rates for new or switcher mortgages with a loan to value of 80% or less. Another bank reduced its SVR\u00a0in December.\u00a0These initiatives illustrate the increasing competitive dynamics in the market. <\/p>  <p>  I note that the Central Bank's statistical release of 11th December 2015 stated that\u00a0mortgage interest rates generally declined during the third quarter of 2015. Variable Principal Dwelling House (PDH) rates declined by 17 basis points over the second quarter\u00a0with corresponding Buy-to-Let (BTL) rates falling by 14 basis points during the same period. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that mortgage interest relief has been abolished for homes purchased since 1 January 2013. Up until 2018 however, tax relief continues to be available for interest paid on all qualifying home loans taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2012, regardless of whether the individuals concerned are first-time buyers or non-first-time buyers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300077#WRQ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":674,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300077#WRQ01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":673,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300077#WRQ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":674,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[46499\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300077#WRQ01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"why properties (details supplied) in County Limerick are vested in him under the State Property Act 1954; his plans for these properties; the property management actions he has taken in relation to these properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":675,"content":"<p>You will be aware that I have recently replied to Deputy Dan Neville T.D. on this matter also (PQ <b>45842\/15 refers).<\/b><\/p><p>Section 28(2) of the State Property Act, 1954 provides for the personal property and land vested in or held in trust by a body corporate immediately prior to its dissolution (<i>other than personal property or land held by such body upon trust for another person<\/i>) to become the property of the State, until such time as the company is restored to the Register or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform waives the interest vested in him.

I understand that PeopleTalk seeks to rebuild trust in public life and give citizens a say in public sector reform and I welcome any proposals that strengthen the voice of citizens, particularly at local level.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, rebuilding public trust in government and state institutions has been a major priority of the Government since we took office in 2011. In this context, we have demonstrated our commitment to improving how we encourage and facilitate the participation of citizens in decisions that affect their daily lives.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We recognise that effective engagement with citizens, be that\u00a0in the design and delivery of services or in the development of legislative proposals, for example, is hugely important for achieving\u00a0improved outcomes.\u00a0 A number of reforms have recently been implemented to better listen to citizens and businesses and to foster participatory decision making.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland became a full member of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) in July 2014 on publication of its first OGP National Action Plan (NAP).\u00a0 Prior to this, an intensive process of consultation was undertaken in the development of the Plan. This culminated in a two day OGP Europe Regional Conference which was held in Dublin in May 2014, which brought officials and civil society together to discuss many topical issues and policies. A draft version of the OGP plan was published for public comment during the event.\u00a0A number of open events have subsequently been held under the OGP banner to allow citizens, civil society, business and researchers to engage, give their views, inform and seek information.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Constitutional Convention is an example of effective engagement with citizens in public policy. The convention\u00a0ran from December 2012 to March 2014. Its membership comprised 66 randomly-selected citizens, 33 politicians from both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly and an independent chair. The Convention made 38 recommendations including holding a referendum on marriage equality which took place on 22 May, 2015. The referendum was passed by a decisive majority and was\u00a0the first time that a proposal for constitutional change put forward by a Constitutional Convention has resulted in actual Constitutional change.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the actions in the OGP Plan was to review existing public consultation guidance nationally and internationally and develop new proposals. A draft principles-based set of guidelines have been approved by the Government and were put out for public consultation.\u00a0 A total of 50 submissions have been received on foot of that consultation process and these raise a lot of important issues, which my Department is currently considering. I will arrange to add PeopleTalk to the list of those who contacted the Department in this regard, so that they can be updated as this process is advanced.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Separately, public consultations have taken place on a range of services and advisory groups are established where it is considered appropriate to assist in policy development.\u00a0 Some examples in my own Department include consultations on Open Data Initiatives, Data Sharing, Accountability proposals and Corporate Governance arrangements for the Civil Service and just last month I launched a public consultation on Commissioning Human, Social and Community Services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  More generally, we have implemented a significant programme of reforms aimed at making the Public Service more open, transparent and accountable.\u00a0Examples\u00a0include\u00a0changes to how appointments are made to State Boards, reforming legislation in areas such as Freedom of Information, Protection of Whistleblowers, the scope and powers of Parliamentary Inquiries, the role of the Ombudsman, the regulation of Lobbying, and revision of the legislative framework for the management of conflicts of interest and standards of conduct of public officials.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is worth noting that there was extensive consultation at all of the key stages in the development of the above\u00a0legislative reforms and they were among the \u00a0Bills that have been subjected to the pre-legislative scrutiny process by Oireachtas Committees.\u00a0 Under this process, Oireachtas Committees seek written submissions on the Heads of the Bill or on the general subject matter from individual experts, stakeholder groups or interested parties; consult with the general public; and hold public hearings inviting individuals or groups to make presentations to the Committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300079#WRS02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Funding","counter":749,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300079#WRS02300"},{"type":"question","counter":750,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[1048\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300079#WRS02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount of funding budgeted in 2015 for the Office of Public Works overall flood risk management programme; the amount of this that was budgeted for expenditure on capital flood relief works; the amount of the overall budget spent to 31 December 2015; the amount of this that was spent on expenditure on capital flood relief works; the budget for the OPW's overall flood risk management programme for 2016 and, separately, the budget for expenditure on capital flood relief works in 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":751,"content":"<p>The information requested is shown in the table following:<table><tr><th>Expenditure Heading<\/th><th>2015 Budget<br \/><br \/>(Revised Estimates Volume)<br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><th>2015 <br \/><br \/>Provisional Outturn<br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><th>2016 Budget <br \/><br \/>Estimate<br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Overall Flood Risk Management Programme (Note 1)<br \/><br \/>of which:<br \/><br \/>Capital Flood Relief Works (Note 2)<\/td><td>87.815<br \/><br \/>61.284<\/td><td>75.049<br \/><br \/>48.368<\/td><td>80.746<br \/><br \/>52.561<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><i><i>Note 1<\/i><\/i><i>.

This same scheme seeks to underpin Ireland&rsquo;s sustainability credentials in the area of dairy production and represents a key distinguishing factor for our export focussed dairy products.  Sustainability considerations are becoming an ever increasing factor in purchasing decisions among international buyers of dairy products.    <\/p>  <p>  The Bord Bia SDAS is a voluntary scheme and was developed in co-operation with milk producers, farm organisations, processors and regulatory authorities.  It has been designed to assist in securing new and existing markets for Irish dairy produce as farmers look to increase milk production in a post quota era.  It can therefore provide the necessary proof to customers of dairy products that milk has been produced under both Sustainability and Quality Assurance criteria.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is open to all milk producers with a valid herd registration, supplying milk processors in the Republic of Ireland.\u00a0 To apply for membership the producer will complete an application form which can be returned to Bord Bia via their milk purchaser or directly to Bord Bia. The application will then be evaluated and, as appropriate, a full independent audit of the milk producer may be carried out to evaluate the capability of the applicant to meet all the requirements of the Standard.  When the producer is deemed to have complied with the requirements of the Standard, the herd will be considered for certification under the Scheme.  When certified, the producer will be issued with a certificate for the herd which will be listed on the Bord Bia register\/database. <\/p>  <p>  In 2015 Ireland exported over &euro;3.2 billion in dairy products to 130 different countries.  The SDAS, as part of an overall approach to demonstrating our sustainability credentials which includes the Origin Green programme at industry level, assists in the process of giving Irish dairy products a competitive advantage in third country markets. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300082#WRV01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Payments","counter":869,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300082#WRV01550"},{"type":"question","counter":870,"qnumday":309,"qnumall":"[46469\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300082#WRV01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a farmer (details supplied) in County Clare will receive payment under the basic payment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department established a new Farm Partnership Register that contains those MPPs who wished to remain in a farm partnership, as well as new farm partnerships - including those in enterprises other than dairying.<\/p><p>The new Register came in to effect on April 1 2015 and currently has over 1,000 farm partnerships registered on it &ndash; c.550 of which are former MPPs.  While the vast majority of the new farm partnerships continue to be dairying, about 15% are of enterprises other than dairying such as beef and tillage.  One of the inducements to encourage the maintenance and development of farm partnerships is the granting of an enhanced 50% stock relief to members of registered farm partnerships.  I am satisfied that this process of registration is operating efficiently and effectively.<\/p><p>This Government has introduced a number of incentives for the creation of farm partnerships.  For example members of farm partnerships can avail of enhanced 50% stock relief under the tax code.  In addition my Department has introduced a Support for Collaborative Farming Grant Scheme under the new Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.<b><\/b>The grant is aimed at covering part of the legal, advisory and financial services costs incurred in the drawing up of the Farm Partnership Agreement, a prerequisite for any partnership adopting best practice.  The first tranche of payments issued in late December. <\/p><p>A major new initiative on &lsquo;Family Transfer Partnerships&rsquo; to assist succession in agriculture was announced in Budget 2016.  It is a structure in which family members enter into a partnership, and appropriate profit-sharing agreement, with the provision for the transfer of the family farm to the younger farmer at the end of a specified period (not exceeding ten years).  To support this transfer a tax credit of up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per annum for five years can be allocated to the partnership, thereby incentivising the transfer and mitigating some of the financial issues involved.  The partnership model enables a gradual transfer of control and also facilitates knowledge transfer from one generation to another.  The commencement of the Scheme is subject to State Aid approval by the EU Commission and the Scheme&rsquo;s administrative procedures, including the application process, will not be finalised until that approval is received.  As the Finance Act 2015 (the legislation providing for the Scheme) has just been enacted, the formal application to the Commission for State Aid approval is expected to be submitted shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300083#WRW01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Payments","counter":922,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300083#WRW01650"},{"type":"question","counter":923,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[46579\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300083#WRW01700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of entitlements from the national reserve for a person (details supplied) in County Mayo.

The National Inshore Fisheries Forum has invited the Department of Social Protection to its forthcoming meeting on 21 January to discuss social protection policies relevant to the inshore sector. It is important that the fishing industr y   take every precaution to avoid risk of injury or worse during this period and have full regard to local weather warnings before venturing to sea. <\/p>  <p>  The new Seafood Development Operational Programme under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund was adopted by the European Commission in December 2015. That Programme provides a comprehensive range of supports for the seafood sector, including a dedicated scheme of supports for the inshore sector to address the various economic and sustainability challenges facing the sector. In relation to specific measures to support inshore fishermen affected by significant losses arising from adverse weather events, the EMFF and the Operational Programme provide for the establishment by fishermen of a Mutual Fund for Adverse Climatic events and Environmental Incidents, which when established can provide aid to fishermen affiliated to the Fund in line with pre-defined rules. The Operational Programme will co-fund the Mutual Fund, together with subscriptions from member fishermen. In that sense, the viability of such a Mutual Fund is dependent on the extent to which fishermen commit to membership of that Fund.<\/p>  <p>  Following the December adoption of the Programme, I am now rolling out new schemes and will be launching the first schemes later this month, with others to follow during 2016. I will be discussing with fishing representatives how they may establish this Mutual Fund over the course of 2016.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300084#WRX02600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Data","counter":969,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300084#WRX02650"},{"type":"question","counter":970,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[46824\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300084#WRX02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of farmers who applied under tranche 1 of the new green low-carbon agri-environment scheme will qualify for the top-up payments for farmers who are able to avail of two or more priority measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":971,"content":"<p>The full details of the number of GLAS Tranche 1 applications which qualify for GLAS+ payments, as a result of their applications including two or more priority environmental measures, will only be available when the full year GLAS payment calculations are finalised .

This second tranche has resulted in a further 14,000 applications to GLAS and my Department will be assessing these applications in line with the requirements set out in the scheme Terms and Conditions over the coming weeks to ascertain which applications can be approved for GLAS.<\/p>  <p>  This level of applications, which has exceeded expectations, underlines the success of GLAS in supporting Irish farmers&rsquo; commitment to further enhancing the environmental sustainability of their farm enterprises. <\/p>  <p>The level of applications to GLAS under both tranches in 2015 will result in the funding committed to the Scheme for 2016 be ing fully utilised. The full details of the funding required for GLAS in 2016 will be not fully finalised until the Tranche 2 approval process has been completed at the end of January.<\/p>  <p>  However the value of the average contract submitted under both Tranches is over &euro;4,000, not including GLAS Plus cases. Current indications are that some 1,400 applications from the first tranche will qualify for GLAS Plus, increasing their annual payment to around &euro;6,500 on average.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300084#WRX03000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Payments","counter":976,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300085#WRY00150"},{"type":"question","counter":977,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[46846\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300085#WRY00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when farm payments will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":978,"content":"<p>Applications under both the 2013 and 2014 Single Payment and Disadvantaged Areas Schemes were received in my Department from the e state of the person named.

A number of inspections of this parcel of land were carried out in 2010 and 2011 resulting in a reduction of the determined area of this commonage. There was one inspection, which the claimants are seeking to rely on, which resulted in a large area of the commonage being deemed eligible for the above schemes, however, a number of subsequent inspections have resulted in a much reduced area being deemed the determined eligible area for the purposes of both Schemes. The circumstances in which the first inspection was carried out are currently the subject of litigation and, therefore, I am precluded from commenting any further on this particular inspection.<\/p>  <p>  The findings with regard to Keelderry have been the subject of a number of legal actions and appeals. The appeal referred to concerns the 2012 SPS, DAS and other area based schemes of one of the claimants. The Decision of the independent official was to partially allow the appeal. However, the findings of the Appeals Officer in relation to that specific case are not a finding on the inspection criteria or that the inspectors&rsquo; interpretation or methodology cannot be relied upon. <\/p>  <p>  The relevant extract from the Appeals Office decision from August 2015 states: &ldquo;Both sides provided evidence at the oral hearing as to the nature of the growth that exists on parcel G30106047, and while there are obviously roadways, active turbary and quarry areas, I must rely on the inspection reports provided by the Department and those reports provide no quantification or description on which to rely for the deductions made within parcels G30106047, G30106046 and G30106057.&rdquo; Most importantly the decision adds &ldquo;In any event the question at appeal is whether or not these parcels met the 2012 eligibility requirement for you [sic - use] of agricultural activity as defined.&rdquo; Therefore the areas of the parcels were not to be determined by the Appeals Office but rather whether the applicant carried out an agricultural activity.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding documentation submitted by the applicant as part of his 2015 Basic Payment Scheme application, the Department maintains its position, as the competent authority on this matter, on the eligible area of this commonage.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300085#WRY01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Administration","counter":1003,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300085#WRY01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1004,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[46858\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300085#WRY02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 16 of 25 November 2015, and given that the competent authority is the only body which is lawfully authorised to carry out inspections of lands, upon what lawful basis and authority did he have to authorise the officers of the agricultural appeals office to enter these private lands prior to conducting a review on 24 January 2014;

To date Ireland remains the only EU MS to have secured this access. There are now six plants approved to export but as with any new market it takes time to build reputational brand and a customer base and the real time to assess its value is when these are bedded down.<\/p>  <p>  In volume terms, beef exports to the USA had reached approximately 330 tonnes by early September. This would have an approximate value of &euro;2.1 million. It must be remembered that only two plants were eligible to export up to mid-May and June respectively. <\/p>  <p>  As of the start of November 2015, an estimated 1,300 tonnes valued at &euro;8.5 million had already been exported. By the end of December this figure had risen to an estimated 1,800 tonnes which would have an approximate value of &euro;11.5 million. This is an exceptionally strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export as recently as September. Also trade   is confined to the market for intact cuts as we currently await approval to export beef intended for grinding. <\/p>  <p>  More importantly the relatively high prices available for beef in Europe in 2015 meant that US buyers may have been priced out of the market as Irish exporters chose to send product to more valuable markets in the UK and on the continent. By the end of October exports to the UK were up 7,200 tonnes compared with the same period in 2014 and this coincides with a reduced kill overall (back about 4% year on year) highlighting further the strength of Irish beef exports in the UK. In value terms this equates to &euro;137 million euro more of beef going to this market.\u00a0 This of course is helped by a strong sterling and weak euro.<\/p>  <p>  There has also been significant progress in facilitating trade in other international markets for Irish beef. For example in 2015 the Canadian beef market opened for Ireland and other Member States and on a bilateral basis the market in Iran was re-opened, while Oman and the Maldives opened to Irish beef exports. I also concluded an extension to our market access to the Philippines, where up to the end of quarter three there had been &euro;11 million   of beef exports from Ireland, making us the second largest exporter of beef into the Philippines. Furthermore we are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries including Korea, Vietnam and Mexico. It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global marketplace. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300087#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry","counter":1086,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300087#WRAA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1087,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[1042\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300087#WRAA00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the results of the recent beef forum meeting; the steps he will take to address the growing gulf between meat factories and farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1088,"content":"<p>The last meeting of the Beef Roundtable took place on the 16 of December 2015.

The Dutch calf market in particular has seen sharp growth, with almost 44,000 calves sent there in 2015 as opposed to 39,000 head in 2014.

Only the EU Commission may propose changes and any such proposal must be adopted under the co-decision process by the EU Parliament and EU Council.

Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the overall framework for fisheries control in the EU, in October 2009 a new regulation dealing with fisheries controls was adopted. Council Regulation 1224\/2009 establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy. Control and inspection is now focused where it is most effective through an approach based on systematic risk analysis.

The Committee also noted that where leases were approaching expiry, any legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation by the ground tenant.

However, as the Deputy will also be aware, the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, which was signed into law on 30th December 2015,  makes extensive provision in Part 10 for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged by legal practitioners, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. <\/p>  <p>  Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice, written in clear language, which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not known, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Act provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. In addition, the Act sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.<\/p>  <p>  An aggrieved client will also have the option of applying for the adjudication of disputed legal costs by the reformed and modernised Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators, which is currently known as the Taxing-Masters' Office.  The Act sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that shall be taken into account in the adjudication of disputed legal costs. The Act also provides for the establishment of a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will disclose the outcomes and reasons for decisions made by the Legal Costs Adjudicators. <\/p>  <p>  The Act, as part of a new independent public complaints regime to be run by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, will also introduce a system for processing complaints about excessive costs, which will be the subject  firstly of informal resolution attempts, but will then escalate to formal resolution where alternative dispute resolution means do not succeed. This will be the first time that complaints about all legal practitioners will be dealt with by an independent statutory public authority.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Act sets out a clear path to new Legal Partnerships business models involving barrister\/barrister partnerships and barrister\/solicitor partnerships, which will allow for such partnerships to open for business in competition with the more traditional lawyer structures. The new Legal Services Regulatory Authority will be tasked with carrying out public consultations and reporting to me as Minister with further legislative recommendations over its first four years in areas such as removing existing client money and direct access restrictions relating to barristers; examining entry and training requirements for the legal profession; unification of the two legal professions and the opening of the market to multi-disciplinary practices.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the Act seeks to achieve greater flexibility in the legal-services market, more competition and improved access to justice and will pave the way for the introduction of new business structures for legal practitioners. These combined measures will enable those availing of legal services, be they private consumers or enterprise, to identify costs more clearly, including in competition with other possible legal service providers. I might add also that both the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Consumers Association will have statutory nominees on the new 11 member Legal Services Regulatory Authority.<\/p>  <p>  The legal costs provisions of the Act are expected to be commenced in the coming weeks, with the complaints-handling and business models provisions following in the coming months when the Authority is fully established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300094#WRHH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Misconduct Allegations","counter":1349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300094#WRHH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1350,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[46637\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300094#WRHH01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will support a matter regarding the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1351,"content":"<p>The particular case to which the Deputy refers is amongst those considered under the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.

The Family Resource Centre Programme is a national programme with its own dedicated budget. Tusla provides core funding to Family Resource Centres to cover the employment of two to three members of staff and some overhead costs. In 2015, Tusla provided &euro;13.09m in funding for the Family Resource Centre Programme.<\/p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres (FRCs) are front-line services rooted in the communities they serve.   Acting as a focal point within their communities, Family Resource Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families in their communities. While Family Resource Centres operate an open-door policy and provide many services and development opportunities at a universal level, they also proactively target specific cohorts within their communities. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla fully appreciates the role that Family Resource Centres play in offering early intervention support to families in difficulty. The Agency also recognises the benefits that additional staffing resources can bring to a Family Resource Centre and this is an item under review as Tusla&rsquo;s budget allocations for 2016 are currently under consideration. <\/p>  <p>  The concerns of some service providers in regard to Tusla&rsquo;s plan to introduce commissioning, and the requirements of the new European Union Directive on Public Procurement (2014\/24\/EU) have recently been highlighted to me.  Tusla has advised that it does not envisage that the new European Union Directive on Public Procurement (2014\/24\/EU) will have any impact on the operational funding available to the National Family Resource Centre Programme. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to commissioning for Family Resource Services, the aim of Tusla&rsquo;s Commissioning Strategy is to target services not currently available in Family Resource Centre areas and to procure these services by way of a separate budget established for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla is currently developing plans for the introduction of its commissioning approach.  It will engage closely with stakeholders in this regard and will provide the necessary guidance and advice.  <\/p>  <p>  Tusla is committed to a partnership approach whereby it will engage with other statutory partners and respect the unique role of community and voluntary organisations, including small scale providers to ensure that there is full engagement with all stakeholders at each stage of the process.. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I announced a significant increase in the funding allocation to Tusla for this year. Tusla has available to it some &euro;676 million in funding, representing an increase of &euro;38 million over 2015.  This increase in funding will allow Tusla to address critical shortcomings such as the number of children and families awaiting services.<\/p>  <p>  The precise level of funding to be provided to Family Support Centres for this year has been considered by Tusla in developing its Business Plan for 2016, which has been submitted to me for consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, since its establishment, has attached particular priority to supporting vulnerable children and families and the significant increase in funding being made available to Tusla this year represents further evidence of our delivery on this ambition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300097#WRLL03900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Funding","counter":1494,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300098#WRMM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1495,"qnumday":519,"qnumall":"[46507\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300098#WRMM00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the additional funding to be provided to T&uacute;sla, the Child and Family Agency, following Ireland's signing of the Istanbul Convention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"951","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1496,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is the statutory body with responsibility for the provision of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.

Tusla has available to it some &euro;676 million in funding, representing an increase of &euro;38 million over 2015. The 2016 allocation includes specific funding of &euro;200,000 requested by Tusla to support the implementation of obligations under the Istanbul Convention on violence against women and domestic violence. Tusla has also identified the need for further funding in subsequent years to develop services in line with the provisions of the Convention. This will be the subject of consideration in the context of overall funding to be provided to Tusla in 2017 and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  Additional provision of outreach services and an increase in the number of emergency refuge spaces in the greater Dublin area are amongst specific developments planned for 2016 in order to enhance access to services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has also established a nationally managed structure, with a single line of accountability and a dedicated national team to support provision of accessible and high quality services.  Planning for domestic violence and sexual violence services will seek to address gaps, avoid duplication and support effective delivery of frontline services nationally. <\/p>  <p>  The increase in funding for 2016 significantly strengthens Tusla's base funding level and gives the Agency greater capacity to respond to current risk and anticipated demand in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The precise level of funding to be provided to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services this year has been considered by Tusla in developing its Business Plan for 2016, which has been submitted to me for consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300098#WRMM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Staff","counter":1497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300098#WRMM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1498,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[46530\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300098#WRMM00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) for a position on a panel with the Health Service Executive and T&uacute;sla, the Children and Family Agency, and wishes to change her preferred location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1499,"content":"<p>The Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) is responsible for the employment of its own staff.

The Framework centralises and coordinates key policy commitments for children and young people across Government, and commits to measuring progress against the national outcomes. It also establishes a robust implementation infrastructure. The ISPCC is included in this infrastructure<i><\/i>through an Advisory Council that brings together key members of the community and voluntary sector, as well as independent experts with experience in children and youth affairs.<\/p><p>The primary responsibility for policy in relation to the treatment and support for young people with mental health and addiction issues lies with the Department of Health. The Health Service Executive is responsible for the provision of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, works closely with a range of care providers in respect of access to mental health, primary care, disability and other services. The Office for Internet Safety is an Executive Office of the Department of Justice and Equality with lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children. The Department of Education and Skills also has an important role to play in educating young people in the responsible use of the Internet. The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government has primary policy and operational responsibility for homelessness affecting families, while the Direct Provision System is within the policy and operational remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>Tusla is funded by my Department and has a significant role in the areas of child protection, early intervention, family support and educational welfare. Central to its role is that of strengthening inter-agency cooperation to ensure the seamless provision of such services. Tusla commenced a new Emergency Out-of-Hours Social Work Service in November 2015 in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Tusla also provides funding to voluntary organisations offering a range of counselling and support services to children and families including child counselling, made available to those who could not otherwise afford it. <\/p><p>The Children First Act 2015 was signed into law by the President on 19 November 2015. The Act aims to ensure that the best interests of the child are paramount in the performance by Tusla of its statutory functions. The Act also provides that organisations providing services to children will have to consider the potential for risk to children availing of their services and produce child safeguarding statements which will be available to parents and the public generally. The Act will operate side-by-side with the <i>Children First <\/i>National Guidance<i>,<\/i>which will continue as the basis for all citizens to report concerns. <\/p><p>Much of the above is aimed at ensuring appropriate responses to a complex range of issues which, if allowed to remain unchecked, can have detrimental impacts on a child or young person. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300098#WRMM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Funding","counter":1503,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300098#WRMM01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1504,"qnumday":522,"qnumall":"[46618\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300098#WRMM01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the details of the capitation fee awarded to participating services in the early childhood capitation scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1505,"content":"<p>At present, capitation payments are provided to childcare providers participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and covers children who have reached the age of 3 years and 2 months by 1 September of the relevant year.

This extended provision, when fully rolled out, will mean that children will have access to free education - either in pre-school or primary school - from the age of three.  The start up date for the introduction of this new measure was decided so as to allow pre-school providers an adequate timeframe to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional numbers benefiting from the programme, which is estimated to increase from 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that, depending on their date of birth, some children enrolling in the ECCE programme in September 2016 will not benefit from this extended free pre-school provision. I am also aware that, when the programme is fully in place (i.e. from 2017), there will be some children will benefit for a shorter extra period of free pre-school than others. Again, this will depend on the child's date of birth and the age at which they make the transition to primary school. Ultimately however, when this extended programme is fully in place, all children will be better off than in the present programme. Indeed, the net effect of the improvements for children overall will be an increase of an average of 23 weeks over the current programme.

They must however, comply with the European Communities (General Product Safety) Regulations which specify the duties of producers and distributors placing products on the market.<\/p><p>While e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco, they do contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance which is the driver for cigarette smoking. Hence, there are legitimate concerns about the public health benefits of allowing such products to exist without regulation. Because they are a relatively recent product, there is limited scientific information available to balance the potential harms and benefits that might arise from more widespread public use.<\/p><p>The EU Tobacco Products Directive (2014\/40\/EU), <i>inter alia,<\/i>provides for the regulation of certain aspects of e-cigarettes across EU Member States. <\/p><p>The Directive will:<\/p><p>-  set mandatory safety and quality requirements e.g. on nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms etc., for e-cigarettes;<\/p><p>-  make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory;<\/p><p>-  introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes; and<\/p><p>-  impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.  <\/p><p>The Department recently undertook a public consultation seeking views on certain discretionary elements within the Directive.  The submissions from the consultation are being analysed and will inform policy decisions. The Department is working to transpose the Directive into national legislation by the May 2016 deadline.<\/p><p>In addition to the regulations under the Directive, e-cigarettes will be further regulated in Ireland through the introduction of a retail licensing system.  The legislation, approved by Government will also prohibit the sale of these products to, and by, persons under 18 years of age.  A public consultation process to obtain views on those measures was conducted early in 2015.  The drafting of the Regulatory Impact Assessment is underway.<\/p><p>Current evidence-based means of quitting include behavioural support and pharmacotherapies. The HSE provides and promotes these safe and evidence-based services, supports and aids to help people to quit.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.  This requires the provision of information by the applicant and the HSE cannot make a determination on eligibility unless all the required information is to hand.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, as set out in the HSE national assessment guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.<\/p><p>In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility<\/i>with a key recommendation that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.<\/p><p>It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 97,000 at the beginning of December 2015.This followed the measures I announced with Minister Varadkar following the publication of the Keane Report.<\/p><p>On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE, on accepting an interim recommendation of the Group, made a decision to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer from 1 July 2015, with the card to be held for a period of five years.  The Clinical Advisory Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.<\/p><p>We do not have a universal eligibility system for primary and community health services. Until we have universal health care and everyone is entitled to health care, one will always have anomalies and injustices.

It is responsible for the regulation of pharmacy services in Ireland and regulates the professional practice of approximately 5,615 pharmacists, 1,880 pharmacies and 424 pharmaceutical assistants, in the interest of the health, safety and welfare of patients and the public.<\/p>  <p>  The PSI&rsquo;s statutory functions and duties are specified in the Act and include:<\/p>  <p>  -  registering pharmacists, pharmaceutical assistants and pharmacies, and maintaining the registers;<\/p>  <p>  -  improving the profession of pharmacy including ensuring that all pharmacists are undertaking appropriate continuing professional development (CPD);<\/p>  <p>  -  setting of standards for pharmacy education and training;<\/p>  <p>  -  accreditation of educational programmes for the pharmacy profession at different levels;<\/p>  <p>  -  quality assurance of standards, and the development of pharmacy practice;<\/p>  <p>  -  inspection and enforcement, including the taking of prosecutions; and<\/p>  <p>  -  handling complaints and disciplinary matters, including the imposition of sanctions.<\/p>  <p>  The PSI is funded by registrant fees which are set out in Rules made by the PSI Council, following Ministerial consent.  Following an extensive review of the PSI functions and related costs, and consultation with national stakeholders, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Fees) Rules 2008 were made setting out the quantum of fees.  These were reduced by 10% in 2010 and most of them by a further 5% in 2014.  The Council of the PSI has processes in place to review the level of fees on an annual basis and has committed to doing so in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the regulatory functions delivered by other regulators in Ireland and by pharmacy regulators in other jurisdictions differ considerably in scope and range from those provided by the PSI.  For example, in Northern Ireland the investigative and enforcement activity is carried out by the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety rather than the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland.  In Great Britain, the General Pharmaceutical Council is responsible for regulatory functions including inspection and enforcement and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain is the professional body which provides professional guidance, networks and resources, with registration fees levied separately by both organisations.  The PSI performs significant inspection and enforcement activities in respect of pharmacies which are not replicated by regulators in other jurisdictions.  Therefore it is difficult to directly compare the regulatory registration fees applicable in differing jurisdictions and by other regulators in Ireland on a like-for-like basis. <\/p>  <p>   There is a particular cost associated with the delivery of a regulatory system and associated services.  Economies of scale apply when a larger proportion of registrants fund the model.  The principle of the PSI application of fees is to recover costs based on who causes the cost or who benefits and is subject to the activities undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300107#WRVV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":1846,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300107#WRVV00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1847,"qnumday":640,"qnumall":"[1088\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300107#WRVV00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the expected reduction in the number of medical cards over the coming years as a result of the reduction in the numbers on the live register and rising incomes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1848,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the medical card scheme is a demand-led scheme and the number of cards at any given time reflects those persons who have met the eligibility criteria governing the scheme.

Furthermore, existing medical cards, save where granted following discretionary consideration, are subject to a periodic review of eligibility which can result in renewal, change or removal of eligibility as particular to the cardholders&rsquo; circumstances, such as positive changes in income. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan for 2016 assumes that the number of medical cards will continue to decline such that the number of persons covered will fall by some 50,000 from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016.

The delay in responding to him is regretted.  However, the reply which issued took account of developments up and including the date of issue of the reply.  In this regard, the Deputy will note that the NMBI confirmed that the applicant's name was entered in the Psychiatric Division of the Register on 5 January 2016 and certificates issued on that day to the applicant's home address.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the other question the Deputy raised during January in relation to a specific application, the NMBI has advised that this applicant has applied for consideration of registration with the NMBI in the general nurse division of the Register on 29 October 2015 having undertaken her nurse training in the United Kingdom.  As part of the application process, the applicant was requested to furnish to the NMBI's office, a completed application form, identity documents and passport sized photographs.  The NMBI also requires a verification of registration completed by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in the United Kingdom prior to a review being undertaken on her application.  To date, this verification remains outstanding.  A total of 12 queries have been raised via the NMBI's overseas call centre regarding the progress of this file, the most recent query being raised on 8 January 2015 whereby the applicant was informed of the outstanding document.  Unfortunately, as this document is crucial to the final review on the applicant's application, the NMBI is not in a position to progress this application until same is received directly from the applicant or directly from the NMC in the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  The NMBI has noted that the Deputy has not provided any details relating to correspondence received from public representatives that were made to the NMBI during 2015.  The Acting  Director of Registry will immediately investigate same if the Deputy wishes to provide such details.<\/p>  <p>  The NMBI has put a number of contact channels in place for applicants following up on the progress of their applications.  One such measure, which was introduced in October 2015, is the opening of a dedicated call centre line for overseas applicants.  This call centre is open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.  The call centre can provide regular updates to overseas applicants on the current status of their application.  To date, this call centre has taken over 4,500 calls.  The NMBI is imminently launching a new website which will have additional features for overseas applicants to include a facility to &ldquo;Track their Application&rdquo; on-line.<\/p>  <p>  The NMBI is acutely aware of the severe pressures on employers throughout the HSE, the Nursing Home sector and other employers to progress applications through the system as efficiently  and as quickly as possible.  The NMBI continues to have monthly engagement with representatives from the above organisations and also holds weekly meetings with individual stakeholders as required.  This engagement has led to very positive working relationships with these Stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The central tenet of the NMBI is the protection of the public.  Therefore, we must be satisfied that all documentation required to progress an application to decision stage meets all the necessary requirements.  The NMBI has referred to its guide document for overseas applicants on its website, which provides a detailed breakdown of the overseas process if the Deputy needs to gain more specific information on the NMBI's processes and requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300107#WRVV02100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":1860,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300107#WRVV02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1861,"qnumday":644,"qnumall":"[1094\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300107#WRVV02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of new applications for home help that were approved but not allocated due to financial constraints in the south Lee area and in the north Lee area in County Cork, in each of the past six months, in tabular form.","asker":"984","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1862,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

In the vast majority of cases the witnessed consent of parents or legal guardians is given on the application form.  This record is sufficient to meet the consent requirements of the Act. However, there are cases where only one guardian provides his\/her witnessed consent on the application form.  The circumstances are not always clear from the details of a passport application.  The reasons generally relate to a breakup of the relationship of parents, the death of a parent\/guardian or the absence of the father&rsquo;s details on a child&rsquo;s birth certificate.  Timing can be important in terms of ensuring that the consent aspect of an application is fully compliant with the Act.    For instance in the case where a birth certificate is submitted without the father&rsquo;s details the conclusion might be that the mother is the child&rsquo;s sole guardian.  However, it could be the case for example that the father has acquired guardianship in the period between the registration of a child&rsquo;s birth and the date of a passport application.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the circumstances under which a previous passport was issued to a child on the basis of the sole consent of one parent\/guardian may have changed by the time that the passport is due to be renewed.  For instance a court order may have been obtained by another family member, such as a grandparent, that determines that this person is also a guardian of that child.<\/p>  <p>  In order to fulfill the legal obligations under the Act in the context of a wide range of family circumstances, the Department requires sole guardians to complete a pro-forma affidavit to accompany each passport application.  This is a legal declaration on the part of the sole parent\/guardian in which s\/he attests -<\/p>  <p>- to being the child&rsquo;s sole guardian;<\/p>  <p>- that there is no Court Order giving the other parent or another person guardianship of the child;<\/p>  <p>- to not entering an arrangement or agreement which has the effect of making or purporting to make the other parent or another person a guardian of the child;<\/p>  <p>- that no other person is a guardian by operation of law: and<\/p>  <p>- that no other circumstances exist whereby there is a guardian.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that some additional costs may be incurred by the witnessing parent\/guardian in having this affidavit completed and sworn.  However the submission of the affidavit with an application form ensures that the terms of the Act in relation to consent are complied with; that the right of each guardian is protected as far as possible and that the risk of child abduction is reduced.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to review this policy at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300113#WRBBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":2086,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300113#WRBBB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2087,"qnumday":723,"qnumall":"[46729\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300113#WRBBB00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of annual subscriptions to external membership bodies and groups his Department has including the cost and details.","asker":"1028","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":2088,"content":"<p>The information as requested by the Deputy on the number of annual subscriptions to external membership bodies and groups made by my Department, including the cost and details, is set out in the table below:<table><tr><th>Name of Organisation<\/th><th>Details<\/th><th>Annual subscription fee in 2015 <div><br \/><br \/>&euro;<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Institute of Public Administration Governance Forum<\/td><td>The Governance Forum is a network providing events and advice on governance issues from a public interest perspective.

More favourable ratios operate in DEIS Band 1 schools. Under an agreement reached with the Education Partners for the 2010\/11 school year my Department provided 50 additional posts to the primary sector and 100 additional posts to the post-primary sector. At primary level as these posts were additional to those required to cater for demographic growth, some improvements were made to the staffing schedule for the 2010\/11 school year. These improvements were targeted at medium-to-larger schools typically under the greatest pressure in relation to class sizes. At post-primary level, additional supports were targeted at co-educational schools in single post-primary catchment areas and at schools that join together with other local post primary schools to increase subject choice in a town.The application of these additional posts to the primary staffing schedule resulted in the schedule operating on the basis of 1 classroom teacher for an average of every 27 pupils between the bands of 8 classroom teachers and 16 classroom teachers. The 37 pupil difference arises only at the point between 16 and 17 classroom teachers. However given that the standard size of a school is 16 classrooms this issue does not typically arise.

These posts will provide for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhance the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, an improvement to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and additional resource posts to meet special education needs. The allocation of a whole time equivalent of an additional 300 teachers to second level schools brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the school year 2016\/17. This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota. The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the PTR allocation will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school.<\/p>  <p>  When the allocation for guidance was brought within quota DEIS schools were protected from the change by providing for a 18.25:1 allocation compared to the general 19:1 allocation.

The payment to PSI is a professional membership payment on behalf of 117 NEPS Psychologists. The single group payment enables the Department to avail of a 10% discount on the total cost of the individual memberships and significantly reduces the number of individual reimbursement payments issuing to staff from the unit.<br \/><br \/>3. Subscriptions are made to Legal Island which provides regular updates in relation to employment law for officials in Human Resources.<br \/><br \/>4. The payment to EBSCO allows staff access to an electronic database of specialist journals and articles for use by the professional staff of the Inspectorate (Education Research Complete) and NEPS (Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection) and is necessary for their work.

One aspect of this Agreement relates to supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and as both Unions that represent SNAs namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement, my Department has implemented supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs.<\/p><p>  The first part of the LRC proposals for supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs outlines that the supplementary assignment arrangements only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant. Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school\/ETB.<\/p><p>  The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for the 2015\/2016 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0041\/2015 which issued on 12  June 2015 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: .<\/p><p>Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (Service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his\/her employer that s\/he is to be made redundant then s\/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs.<\/p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0041\/2015 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed. It does not work on a list basis. Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a Redundancy payment. Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his\/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58\/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.<\/p><p>It is important to note that when an employer has a vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in paragraphs 15-22 of Circular 41\/2015.

","asker":"1049","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2265,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 782 and 821 together.<\/p>  <p>  The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, published in 2011, provides a framework for the development of the higher education sector to 2030. This Government has made considerable progress in implementing the recommendations set out in the Strategy, significantly advancing the goal of achieving a modernised, more flexible and responsive higher education system that is accountable for high quality performance across the full range of higher education activities. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives. In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities. <\/p>  <p>  The main purpose of the Technological Universities Bill, which was published in December 2015, is to give effect to the recommendations set out in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 with regard to the IoT sector.  In addition, the Bill provides for a number of important reforms to the governance and operation of the existing institutes of technology.<\/p>  <p>  The Technological Universities Bill 2015 sets out the process for the establishment of technological universities. These technological universities will be distinctly different from traditional universities and institutes of technology by virtue of their mission. This differentiated mission includes a systematic focus on the preparation of graduates for complex professional roles in a changing technological world; the advancement of knowledge through research and scholarship and the dissemination of this knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise; and, the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located. These institutions will be linked to industry, and will have an enormous impact on our capacity to create and retain jobs in regions such as the South-East and the North-West.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, and its Chair, Deputy Joanna Tuffy, undertook pre-legislative scrutiny on the General Scheme of the Bill in April of 2014. I am aware that the TUI participated in this process, and many of the Committee's recommendations have been taken into account during the drafting of the Technological Universities Bill. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Strategy, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) published a four-stage process and criteria for applicant groups of institutes of technology wishing to apply to become technological universities. That document set out a process whereby individual institutions could make a strategic choice to align, merge and apply to become designated as technological universities. The procedure for application for designation as a technological university, as set out in the Technological Universities Bill 2015, is a reiteration of the fourth and final stage of the earlier published 'process and criteria for designation as a technological university'. The proposed consolidations now emerging within the institute of technology sector, and the development of technological universities as a result, will protect and enhance the distinctive career and enterprise focused missions of institutions in the traditional institute of technology sector while also enhancing their strength and scale. This improvement in scale will be particularly important in relation to the challenge that applicants for technological university status must address in improving their competitive position nationally and internationally.<\/p>  <p>  Initially three consortiums of institutes of technology expressed an interest in merging and in applying to become technological universities as part of the Landscape Process undertaken by the HEA in 2012 and approved by the then Minister for Education and Skills. <\/p>  <p>  Two of those consortiums have successfully passed stage 3 of the four-stage process which involved the assessment of their project plans by an international panel of experts. These are the TU4Dublin consortium, made up of Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology, Tallaght and the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, and the Munster Technological University consortium, made up of Cork Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology Tralee. <\/p>  <p>  Both of these consortiums are working towards full mergers in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Technological University for the South-East, consisting of Institute of Technology, Carlow (ITC) and Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) a preliminary facilitation process has been underway since September 2015 and there has been strong engagement in the process by both parties. This facilitation process involves a series of meetings, and is an important building block in terms of building trust between the parties and in developing a strong working connection. Not all of the facilitative meetings have been scheduled yet so as to allow the participants time to reflect and to complete any tasks required to move the process on. <\/p>  <p>  In early 2015, the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, made up of Galway Mayo Institute of Technology, Sligo Institute of Technology, and Letterkenny Institute of Technology, also expressed an interest in merging and in applying to become a technological university. In October 2015 I approved this application to proceed to the next stage. In line with the process for designation as a TU, Stage 2 of this process involves the preparation of a plan by the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, to meet the criteria for designation as a Technological University.<\/p>  <p>  As these proposals have progressed through the four stage process I have reiterated to the consortiums the importance of, and the need for, a process of consultation and engagement such as referred to in the correspondence the Deputy has received. <\/p>  <p>  The mergers outlined above cannot proceed until the Technological Universities Bill has been enacted and the relevant provisions commenced. Therefore this Bill, in providing the legislative underpinning for those institutes of technology who have established partnerships and wish to merge, represents an essential milestone in the modernisation and reform agenda for higher education institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that institutes of technology which do not choose to follow the evolutionary path set out in the National Strategy for Higher Education, and in this Bill, will continue to make an important contribution to higher education and particularly to the development of their region.<\/p>  <p>  The National Strategy recommended that the governance structures of all higher education institutions should be reformed to ensure that they are fit for purpose and have the expertise relevant to the governance of a modern higher education institution. This Bill therefore provides for new and modernised governance structures in the institutes of technology and for other reforms which will allow them to become more flexible and responsive to their environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300117#WRFFF02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":2266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300117#WRFFF02400"},{"type":"question","counter":2267,"qnumday":783,"qnumall":"[46906\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300117#WRFFF02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the pupil capacity for the 2015-16 school year of two special needs schools (details supplied) in County Cork; if she will provide additional resources to expand the capacity of the schools for the 2016-17 school year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2268,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that Cara Junior School currently has capacity for 60 students and Scoil Aislinn has capacity for 36 students for the current school year, 2015\/16.<\/p><p>  The policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included where possible, and appropriate, in mainstream school placements with additional supports provided.

I have no proposals to amend the regulations which governed the 2015 Water Conservation Grant scheme. There is no direct relationship between payment of domestic water charges and eligibility for the Water Conservation Grant. The grant is funded by the Exchequer and is a payment to all eligible households, including non-Irish Water customers, to promote water conservation in the home.<\/p><p>If a customer does not pay their water charges, late payment provisions automatically apply, unless the customer enters into a payment plan. In the case of a One Adult Household (capped at &euro;160), &euro;30 will be added to any bill where outstanding payments equate to the total annual payment and remain unpaid for 3 months or more. An additional &euro;30 will be added on every anniversary of the original add on date while the bill remains unpaid or a payment plan has not been entered into with Irish Water. In the case of a Two Adult Household (capped at &euro;260), &euro;60 will be added and again at each anniversary.  The late payment charges will only apply where someone is in arrears for more than 12 months and has not entered into a payment plan with Irish Water.  Payment plans will be developed based on an ability to pay and it is important to note that the late payment charges are focused on those who &ldquo;will not pay&rdquo;, rather than those who cannot pay.<\/p><p>A range of flexible payment options are available. Irish Water will facilitate bill payment through direct debit, electronic funds transfer and payment by cash at any retail outlet with a Paypoint or Payzone sign, or at a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made. Irish Water is also participating in the Household Budget scheme.  This facility, operated by An Post on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, provides customers with a facility to have their household utility bills and social housing rents deducted directly from their weekly social welfare payment.<\/p><p>Any customers who have unpaid water charges can be pursued through the Courts by Irish Water for the sums due. The Civil Debt (Procedures) Act 2015, allows creditors to apply to the Court for an order enabling either attachment of earnings or deduction form social welfare payments, as appropriate, for the purposes of enforcing debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300121#WRKKK00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid Expenditure","counter":2406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300121#WRKKK00650"},{"type":"question","counter":2407,"qnumday":832,"qnumall":"[1552\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300121#WRKKK00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to set down the expenditure from the overseas development aid budget spent on the green climate fund in 2014 and in 2015; if any of the increased expenditure announced in budget 2016 will go towards the green climate fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2408,"content":"<p>As I announced on Budget Day, Ireland will make an initial contribution of &euro;2 million to the Green Climate Fund in 2016.

A licence, in this context, is a private contractual matter between the parties concerned.

It is not the case, for example, that owners of multi-unit developments are automatically exempt from PRTB regulations.  Where the owner of a dwelling in a multi-unit development enters into an agreement with a person for the occupation of that dwelling , it is a private contractual matter between the parties as to whether that agreement is a licence or a tenancy.  If the agreement entered into is a tenancy agreement, then the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 applies to that agreement, unless it falls into one of the exemptions set out in section 3 of the Act.

It also streamlines the process for the making of modifications to Strategic Development Zoneplanning schemes; and;<\/p><p>-The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, which provides for an increased rent review period from one to two years; increased notice periods for rent reviews and greater protections for both tenants and landlords.  These measures will bring much-needed stability to the rental sector pending the coming on-stream of the supply of new housing.<\/p><p>Cognisant of the difficulty faced by some households in accessing the housing market, an affordable rental pilot scheme was announced as part of Budget 2016 with &euro;10 million being made available to fund a pilot in 2016.  This will be an on-going annual commitment to secure a long- term increase in the supply of affordable properties to meet the needs of those households that would struggle to make rental payments under present market conditions.<\/p><p>The pilot Scheme is expected to work on the basis of tenants paying the majority of the rental cost from their own resources, with the State helping to meet the shortfall.

Demand for this scheme remains very strong, clearly demonstrating its potential to continue to deliver energy efficiency gains and related benefits, such as reduced energy costs and better health outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  The measures currently supported are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost to the greatest number of homes.  This is why cavity wall insulation is the measure typically offered under this scheme; in a very small number of exceptional circumstances other measures, such as internal dry lining or external cladding of the walls, are provided. <\/p>  <p>  There is clear evidence that delivering energy efficiency improvements remains the best method of combating energy poverty, which is a Government priority.  Therefore, I will continue to ensure that improving the energy efficiency of homes of those vulnerable to energy poverty remains central to Ireland&rsquo;s Better Energy Programme.  This will be set out in detail in a new strategy on energy poverty which I will be publishing in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300126#WRPPP00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":2581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300126#WRPPP00350"},{"type":"question","counter":2582,"qnumday":897,"qnumall":"[1119\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300126#WRPPP00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the status of providing broadband to all persons who is still waiting for basic broadband in their area further to correspondence received (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The commission of a second offence for driving without insurance leads to an automatic disqualification.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na believes that a mechanically propelled vehicle being used in a public place, which is registered in the State, is being driven without insurance, the vehicle may be impounded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300126#WRPPP02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":2611,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300126#WRPPP02350"},{"type":"question","counter":2612,"qnumday":907,"qnumall":"[1092\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011300126#WRPPP02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on the proposed construction of the Northern Distributor Road in the Clare County Council Development Plan, given the extensive recent flooding in the Shannon Catchment Area and especially around the Clonlara area in County Clare; the conclusions and recommendations of any flood risk assessments of the proposed road project that have been undertaken to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department itself operates a Structures at Risk Fund to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund, which had an allocation of &euro;624,000 in 2015, was administered through the local authorities and sought to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  A scheme for 2016, which will be delivered through the local authorities, is currently being finalised. <\/p>  <p>  I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.  This scheme will operate in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme for this year is effectively closed as local authorities were required to submit a provisional schedule of projects to my Department by 16 December 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.
