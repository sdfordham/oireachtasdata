They are community-led, local-development initiatives that focus on the sustainable development of fisheries areas.  Funding is through the European Fisheries Fund and the national development plan.  Following decisions made by FLAG boards, financial assistance, complementary to other Community instruments, is provided for the sustainable development and improvement of the quality of life in fisheries areas eligible as part of an overall strategy which seeks to support the implementation of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, in particular taking account of its socio-economic effects.<\/p><p>  BIM, as the State agency with primary responsibility for the implementation of the European Fisheries Fund and with a long history of working directly with the seafood sector as well as the wider fisheries community, is tasked by its parent Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with implementing the European Fisheries Fund, including priority Axis 4, the sustainable development of fisheries areas.<\/p><p>  The FLAGs are established pursuant to Article 43 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1198\/2006 which states:<blockquote>A fisheries area selected for assistance shall be limited in size and, as a general rule, shall be smaller than NUTS, nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, level 3.  However, the area should be sufficiently coherent from a geographical, economic and social point of view.  Assistance should target, as a priority, areas with (a) low population density, or (b) fishing in decline, or (c) small fisheries communities.<\/blockquote>Following discussions at the operational programme monitoring committee, and subsequently with the European Commission services and our managing authority, the Department, it was agreed Axis 4 would operate throughout the Irish coast with the exception of towns and cities with a population in excess of 15,000.  It was further decided that this approach would be best delivered by adopting a regional approach to the establishment of FLAGs.  On that basis, a total of six FLAGs were identified.<\/p><p>  I have enclosed maps of the FLAG networks in the UK and in France in my written submission.  I could have selected others but these, by way of example, illustrate my points on our network.  In England and Wales, north Cornwall and Devon have a FLAG designation but there is vast gap in designations along the southern coast all the way to Hastings, south of London, then further gaps from there along the east, all the way to Norfolk and then up to Yorkshire.  The UK has stipulated that the FLAGs will be small.  The downside of that approach, however, is that vast swathes of the coastline are left out.  In France, with a total of 11 FLAGs, the authorities there concentrated on small specific areas, covering only small fractions of the entire coastline.  Scotland, in contrast, might be said to have adopted a model closer to the Irish one.  It has attempted to create FLAGs at a NUTS level 3 that incorporate the entire coastline.<\/p><p>  During 2013, all six FLAG in Ireland were established.  In addition, it was agreed that in each region the FLAGs could, as part of their development strategy, identify several sub\u2010priority areas, generally not more than two, wherein up to 70% of its operational budget could be concentrated.  In the event that sub-priority areas are identified, the development strategy for these areas could form an integral part of the overall strategy of a FLAG.  The balance of the operational budget would be available to projects from the remainder of the region covered by the FLAG.<\/p><p>  The development strategies were produced in the past 12 months and cover each of the regions.  I will make copies available to the sub-committee but other copies can be downloaded from the BIM website.  While BIM, the implementing body, has facilitated their formation, the FLAGs in every case consist of an independent board made up of public and private partners from various local, relevant, socio-economic sectors, selected according to the principle of proportionality.  BIM will examine a project to ensure it is complaint with regulations but it never addresses whether the project should be funded.  BIM also completes all claims of the managing authority back to the European Commission, as well as undertaking all audit visits by the Commission.  BIM&rsquo;s role is one of assistance rather than one of direction.<\/p><p>  By way of oversight and horizontal integration, a national implementation body has been established, comprising representatives of each of the FLAGs and representatives of the major public service bodies.  The body meets twice annually to provide guidance to the operation of the FLAGs, its most recent meeting being in November 2013.  By doing this at a national level, we have attracted representatives from large national bodies such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland which might not be able to send representatives to local meetings.  The body has provided a useful forum for the FLAGs from all corners of the country to discuss common issues.<\/p><p>  During 2013, all six FLAGs developed and published their integrated local development strategies, based on a bottom-up approach in agreement with the managing authority.  These comprehensive documents are available on the BIM website.  A total of 61 projects were considered by the FLAGs, of which 45 were approved for funding.  To date, claims have been received from 36 applicants representing a total investment of &euro;172,631 with &euro;91,743 in grant aid, 50:50 between the State and the EU.  A further six projects provided funding of some &euro;90,000 towards the cost of producing integrated local development strategies.  These were community led not BIM led.  It was up to the communities as to how they prioritised their strategies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013121000003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386684600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I did a quick calculation for the six regions.  I could divide my region into eight sub-regions that I can clearly identify.  If I took the coast from Arklow to Youghal, I could find at least that number as well - west of Waterford Harbour, east of Waterford Harbour and so on.  There is a little more than &euro;400,000 for each of the six regions, and if we divide that by eight again we end up with &euro;50,000 for each sub-region.  We then set up all the superstructure for &euro;50,000.  I put the same argument up in the early days of the Leader programme.  It is an awful lot of money for such a little thing, because &euro;50,000 would not set up any kind of business.  I am not blaming Mr. Keatinge.  It is a pity they did not give this to the Leader companies and just let them get on with the job, as the structure is already there to administer the money to coastal communities.  As the money was so small, I think the French got it right by allowing in only those areas where there would be more socioeconomic benefits.  If a few hundred million euro was in question, it might be worth talking about, but &euro;2.5 million is a waste of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013121000004#C00900","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1386684600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>How long has this been in operation?  I got a briefing locally about this earlier in the year.

Can any of that money go towards local co-operatives?  It may buy an ice machine or something like that.  Could the money go towards creating some kind of storage facility whereby people could keep certain fish until such time as they can get the maximum benefit from the market?  In many coastal communities, people involved in fishing for lobster and crayfish can make &euro;22 or &euro;24 per kilo in the months of March, April or May, but then in July and August that will drop to &euro;8 or &euro;9 per kilo.<\/p><p>  Has there been much interest in the take-up?

As part of our consideration of the report the issue of FLAGs cropped up, and very few of us understood what they were about.  I thank Mr. Keatinge for giving us an insight into how and under what structure they are operating.  The funding is relatively small when we look at the entire coastline of the country.  I presume the structure of these would have been provided by the current CFP.   It is funded by the European Fisheries Fund, EFF.  Why is it only in the last two years of the CFP that the FLAGs are being established, when the CFP is expiring at the beginning of 2015?  We have an opportunity to get proper funding for these FLAGs with the incoming CFP in 2015, similar to the way the Leader funding is going.<\/p><p>  The model for Leader companies is changing and coming back under a local government framework.  The south-west FLAG has a very impressive membership.  There are fishing interests, aquaculture interests, environmental interests, food interests and a member from the existing Leader company, but no public representative to oversee what are in effect public funds.  In light of the move by the Leader companies to go back under the local government model - one of the arguments for this was that it would give public oversight or transparency to that funding - will the structure for the FLAGs will be examined?<\/p><p>  There are many ways in which BIM could enter into partnerships for the purpose of funding.  There are possibilities in the area of retraining, upskilling and diversifying the skills that are available in the sea fishing industry for use in the offshore exploration industry.  Even though BIM has a hands-off role in respect of projects, I think Mr. Keatinge is underselling the whole thing if BIM does not get involved in that area of retraining and upskilling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013121000004#C01200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1386684600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>On our visit to Scotland, the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, Richard Lochhead, spoke about inshore fisheries committees, and was aiming to improve the management of Scotland's fisheries out to the six-mile limit.

The facilitator will identify excellent projects and divide the funding areas between Leader, the FLAG and Bord F&aacute;ilte.  It is truly trying to integrate.  We are under written instructions that the FLAGs must be stand-alone entities.  We have truly sought to integrate with existing structures, including Leader, as Deputy Harrington has noted.  Leader is represented in all of our FLAGs.  We can have integrated projects.  The one thing we cannot do under Community legislation is to fund a project from two sources.  Instead we break the project into three parts, each funded from a different source.  The idea is to create this integration across Government services.  The budget is entirely outside my gift, but unfortunately the reality we live with is that fisheries budgets tend to be smaller.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Martin Ferris's point, the FLAGs have been set up from mid-2012.  I agree that there was a long lead-in time.  We lost a number of years getting the EFF implemented and a few years getting agreement on how the FLAGs should be rolled out in Ireland.  I do not have an answer or explanation on that loss of time.  We have worked very hard over the last 18 months to bring together operational FLAGs and, as evidenced by their strategies, which are available to the members, they have done much work.  We hope formally to launch the south west FLAG at the end of January.<\/p><p>  One could use funding to get a nice machine for the co-op.

We have approached communities and asked them to bring forward representatives.  If a community had an existing co-op or community structure they could look to those to nominate somebody.  The principle of the FLAG is a very open one.  If a group come forward and said it would like to participate, it would be the intention that they would be welcomed.  There is an attempt to avoid elections.  It is to give it a community basis and we have found that people have been willing.

There is a balance to be struck on the committee in regard to numbers, but it is a very open process.  <\/p><p>  Senator Denis Landy asked about the list of 36 applicants.  It will be available on the BIM website.  I will provide the details for the Senator.<\/p><p>  Deputy Noel Harrington asked about retraining.  This morning I took the opportunity to meet my colleagues from the Marine Survey Office to explore that issue.  We have been providing a large number of grants through the FLAGs to assist with retraining.  This has been geared towards moving into the merchant navy and there are also opportunities to move into offshore oil supply or wind farm work.  BIM has a role in training.  We have always interpreted our role strictly, as providing training solely for those involved in the fishing sector.  However, the point about Axis 4 is that it recognises fisheries can be in decline and that we need to look outwards.<\/p><p>  At a parochial level, I am from Dunmore East and see the industry there at a crossroads as to whether it will become a Killybegs or a Salthill.  It sees its future in the tourism industry.  Greencastle is another example where there is a spillover; visitors from Derry have become very important to the community.  These communities face change and part of Axis 4 is about facilitating that change.  It is not just about fishing but also about the maritime sector in a wider context.  It could be about marine tourism, including whale watching, sea angling, sailing, seafood and festivals.  It is about any area in a coastal community that can provide new opportunities to retain people in the area.<\/p><p>  It is important to stress this point.  Personally, there is a role for the BIM training facilities in Greencastle which are a long way from the facility in Cork to provide transition training for fishermen who might seek alternative employment.  As we know, inshore fishing is seasonal.  What are these inshore fishermen to do in the winter?  They could be gainfully employed working on offshore supply vessels, servicing wind farms or oil rigs.  This is something I will put to the board.  I also discussed putting it into effect with the Marine Survey Office this morning.  I will return to the Deputy in due course on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013121000006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge"},{"type":"speech","time":1386685800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>We all have an interest in that matter.

FLAGs are about socioeconomic development, not HR management.  I could have spoken about this issue at length if I had been asked to do so because in 1998 BIM produced the inshore fisheries management report.  In the period 1998 to approximately 2010 we were very active in trying to develop the national fisheries management arrangements.  That saw the evolution of four species groups, covering species such as lobster, crab, bivalve shellfish such as razor clams, scallops, shrimp and so forth.  The four species advisory groups were very much bottom up, driven by fishermen.  They also had complementary local committees.  We had a very active committee in Roaring Water Bay, Dunmore East and Kilmore Quay.  We had an active group in Dundalk Bay covering the cockle fishery, while in west Kerry there was an active crayfish group.  This work culminated in the production of the lobster management plan in 2008.  Sadly, however, that plan was never implemented and the groups have withered since.  It is a source of disappointment for me and the team on the coast that more has not been done in that regard.  These fisheries are ones that, by and large, fall outside management by the Commission; therefore, we are not talking about quota species in the normal context but about local national species such as lobster, shrimp, razor fish, cockles and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013121000006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge"},{"type":"speech","time":1386685800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>On the MSO, will Mr. Keatinge comment further on former fishing vessels that could be used for something else such as sea angling?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013121000006#E00500","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1386685800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>They could have multiple uses or a multiple licence, including for passenger use or so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013121000006#E00600","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386685800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I cannot speak for the MSO, but we have made inquiries in this regard and discussed the matter with the office.

He has touched on the inshore fleet which, by and large, has been neglected during the years.  There is a need to implement inshore fisheries management plans in local areas.  For example, there is an inshore fishery in south Donegal where large pelagic vessels come and scoop up fish, whether horse mackerel or scad.  They rip up lobster pots and everything in front of them, much to the frustration of the local fishermen.  The legislation governing this area dates back to the 1800s and the maximum fine is approximately five shillings.  Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, is working on legislation that will be brought before the Oireachtas shortly.  Not only do we need this legislation, we also need management plans to protect the inshore fisheries fleet.<\/p><p>  I am not sure whether the FLAGS are engaged in supporting the inshore fisheries sector or whether steps are being taken in that regard.  The funding issue is a big one.  There is massive unemployment in coastal areas.  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund has the objective of sustaining small local communities, but the funding available to Ireland is very small in the overall context.  It amounts to &euro;2.5 million over the lifetime of the CFP.  When we look at the average pay-out per project in respect of the 36 projects, it amounts to around &euro;4,700.  Grant aid amounts to &euro;2,500 per project, which is only peanuts in the overall scale of things.<\/p><p>  If I were to come forward with a project, I would not even approach the FLAG.  I would go directly to the Leader company, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta or the county enterprise board because I would be wasting my time in drawing down a grant that would disallow me in drawing down another grant.  There is a conflict of interest and we need some joined-up thinking.  The funding should either be streamlined through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the enterprise boards or the Leader programme.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about the Leader protocol.  I know Leader funding is not being brought under the local authorities, but is there anything to stop the Leader companies from establishing a sub-committee or sub-structure to administer this funding?

We have tried to avoid using the meagre funds available to pay for administration.  By doing the work through BIM administration is free.<\/p><p>  If it is clear a small part of an area deserves a substantial focus, up to 70% of the budget can be focused on two areas.  This is a difficult issue and as a public representative, I must try to balance what I believe are the aspirations along the entire coastline.  How does one create a structure which does not rule somebody out in terms of funding and at the same time have a focus which creates a critical mass?  What we are trying to do in allowing the 70% rule is to invest a lot of money in a particular area.  I could pick any area.  Every committee member is from a coastal area and all members know what I am speaking about.  If funding is given to someone in north Donegal, people in south Donegal will ask why they have been left out.  It is a difficult issue and we hope we are getting the balance right.  Our aspiration for the future is to have a bigger budget.<\/p><p>  This year no legitimate project which asked for funding was turned down.  A problem not only in Axis 4 but also in Axis 2 and Axis 3 is that if we are offering a 50% grant, the other 50% must be provided through private sector funding.  In the past two or three years, not unexpectedly, we have seen significant problems in obtaining private sector funding.  It is not as though the FLAGs had a bunch of projects this year which were turned down because of a lack of money.  We could have funded more projects this year if we had projects to fund.  There was money left over.  The level of funding, that is, the grant aid rate, is very important.  Access to private sector funding is definitely a sticking point.  The rules for what may be funded have become tighter and tighter.  Where in the past I might have given somebody a grant for structural work on a fishing boat, this is no longer allowed.  I cannot give a grant to fix the engine.  Many projects have been ruled out and more will be ruled out under the new regulation for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  To my mind, the grant aid rate, access to private sector funding and what may be granted aided present much bigger problems than the amount of the funds available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013121000007#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge"},{"type":"speech","time":1386686400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I disagree.

There are certain projects which we can fund 100%.  They would be fully public.  For example, this would apply to something like a festival or a public good project.

I have included the brochure that explains all of this in the package I gave to the committee.  The details are included in it.  To be clear, we allow for 100% funding, but that applies to public projects only.  The trouble is if a co-op wanted to build a lobster holding unit, as Deputy Martin Ferris suggested, it would be a semi-public project; in other words, it would be open to the members of the co-op and it might receive 60% funding.  If a private citizen wanted to do the same, it would not be made available to others and a grant rate of 40% would be applicable.

These projects are not underaken through Axis 4 which relates to smaller scale local projects.

Genealogy has, in recent years, become a fascination for Irish people, as indeed for people worldwide.  People want to know more about their forebears and their origins; where they come from and what was happening back then.  While many people engage in genealogical research as a personal hobby there is a very important role for the professional genealogist in conducting research for others and in providing information in both hard copy form and also on the world wide web.  The world wide web in particular has an important role to play in the study of genealogy, providing information, research facilities and databases to people across the globe.  Mr. or Ms Murphy in Tasmania can research their great-great grandparent in Cork without leaving their home in Hobart.  Genealogy has many different aspects to it catering for individuals and people with a common ancestry as, for example, the MacCarthy clan or people originating in a particular part of Ireland; for example a town, a townland or an offshore island community.  There are also family history societies that facilitate members by sharing knowledge, indexing records, publishing journals and sponsoring conference and site visits.  Given Ireland&rsquo;s worldwide diaspora these developments can make an important contribution to enhancing our tourism sector and as an industry with major potential growth can contribute to creating employment in Ireland both in genealogical research and in encouraging people like the Murphys in Hobart to visit Ireland.  I now call on Mr. Merrigan to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000003#D00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386684600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>As general secretary of the Genealogical Society of Ireland, I would like, on behalf of my board and on behalf of our members at home and overseas, to thank the Chairperson and the members of the Oireachtas joint committee for inviting the society to make a submission and to address this meeting.  I would like to introduce my colleagues - to my left Tom Conlon, director of Internet services and Aiden Feerick, a member of the society.<\/p><p>  For the information of the committee, while the society itself does not engage in commercial genealogical research assignments for individuals, Aiden Feerick is also a member of the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland, APGI, and a director of Ancestor Network Limited.  It may be useful, in the interests of openness and transparency, that any person appearing before the committee for and on behalf of a voluntary genealogical organisation, declares if they are personally also members of APGI or engage in commercial genealogical research.  The Irish genealogical community is relatively small and cross-membership among organisations is not uncommon.<\/p><p>  On page 4 of the society's submission, we have included information on the society and its unique approach to these matters as it operates quite differently to other voluntary genealogical organisations in Ireland.  The society has a long record stretching back over 23 years of campaigning on genealogical and heritage matters at local, national and international levels.  Further clarification on our position is on page 5 of the submission.  The society was established in 1990 to promote an awareness, appreciation and knowledge of our genealogical and heraldic heritage in Ireland and among her diaspora.  The society is an independent not-for-profit voluntary heritage organisation with an Irish and international membership and it is an incorporated body in Ireland with charitable status.  It is also a nominating body for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>  The society is devoted to the promotion of the study of genealogy and related subjects as educational leisure pursuits available to all in the community irrespective of age, prior learning, background, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation or socioeconomic circumstances and we do so by organising two open meetings each month throughout the year, holding lectures, workshops, publishing genealogical material, group projects, exhibiting at major events and the provision of an archive and research centre, An Daonchartlann, at the Carlisle Pier in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.<\/p><p>  The principle of public ownership and right of access to our genealogical heritage is the cornerstone of the society&rsquo;s policies on heritage, genealogy and archival matters.  The society is precluded from affiliating with any organisation or group failing to endorse this fundamental principle.  Over the past 23 years, the society has encouraged the tabling of parliamentary questions in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; raising matters on the Order of Business in Seanad &Eacute;ireann; advocating amendments to Bills in both Houses; it has drafted Bills for presentation to Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la and Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;; made numerous submissions to State agencies, Departments and local government; and formulated and published detailed proposals on many heritage issues.<\/p><p>  The society has always been to the fore in the development and promotion of genealogical and heraldic services in Ireland.  Legislative reform has been a core objective of this endeavour and therefore, amendments were sought and secured in many pieces of legislation as outlined in the written submission.  In addressing the issue, developing a plan to capture the full value of our genealogical heritage, it is easy to see the matter from a purely economic perspective relating specifically to tourism or as a straightforward archival access problem to be resolved by more State investment, increased staffing levels, improved technology and, of course, the hope of philanthropy.  Capturing the full value of our genealogical heritage is as much an intriguing objective as it is a complex, multifaceted and, in some respects, a very contentious and ambitious endeavour involving many different stakeholders across a number of sectors including the State, commercial interests, voluntary organisations, institutional and private custodians of records and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Merrigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386685200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Merrigan for his opening statement.

It acts as an accrediting and regulating body to maintain high standards among its members and to protect the interests of clients.  Our members are drawn from every part of Ireland and represent a wide variety of interests and expertise.  The ongoing involvement of individual members in lecturing, teaching and publishing maintains our position at the forefront of genealogical developments in Ireland.  For more than two decades the field of ancestral research in Ireland has benefited greatly from the APGI's influence and lobbying.  Beyond its functions as an accrediting and regulating body, it has made a very positive contribution to many areas of development, championing the cause of record users with State-run offices and the Irish Genealogical Project, subsequently Irish Genealogy Limited.<\/p><p>  In respect of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht's request for submissions, we wish to raise the following three pivotal issues as examples of how finding workable solutions would greatly assist in developing such a plan as outlined by the Committee.  The issues in question are: the website of the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht, www.irishgenealogy.ie; the 1926 census; and the General Register Office of Ireland.  To the fore in developing a plan to capture the full value of our genealogical heritage is for increased support to be given to the genealogy website &ndash; <i>www.irishgenealogy.ie<\/i> - of the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The website, which is a work in progress, gives access, free of charge, to, for example, original images of parish church records &ndash; a primary source &ndash; and this, in turn, gives the website credence and authority.  An annual dependable grant-in-aid would allow consistent forward planning with regard to content and facilitate the consistent monitoring of content and management of the website.  The APGI - the only accrediting body for genealogists in Ireland &ndash; commends the Department in adopting the ethos and vision of the majority of our national cultural institutions by making accessible, free of charge,  primary source material relating to our history and heritage.  However, the Department needs financial and personnel investment to ensure the reliability and the ongoing development of the website and its content, CIGO<\/p><p>  On the 1926 census, the APGI, particularly through its connection with the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations, the CIGO, lobbied for many years to convince those in authority that census returns could be opened before the 100-year embargo first introduced in the Statistics Act 1993.  Prior to the passing of the 1993 Act, the subsequently repealed Statistics Act 1926 provided no clear guidance regarding public access to census returns compiled post-Independence.  The returns for 1901 and 1911 had been released by a warrant, signed under the Public Records (Ireland) Act 1867, in 1961.  In the case of the 1911 census, this was only 50 years after the data was compiled.  The sky did not subsequently fall in.  When what became the Statistics Act 1993 was debated by the Houses in 1993, lobbying by the CIGO - spearheaded by its then general secretary, Mr. Michael Merrigan - succeeded in reducing the then proposed 100-year embargo to only 70 years.  However, the Central Statistics Office did not support this measure and the 100-year bar was reinstated.<\/p><p>  Numerous groups have continued to lobby since 1993 to allow early access to the 1926 census as a special case.  In the months before the most recent general election, approaches were made to the current Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, putting the case to him for inclusion of the proposal in the new programme for Government if, as seemed likely, Fine Gael and Labour were to form the next Administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;ire Mac Conghail","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386685800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mac Conghail for her presentation and call on Ms Kiely to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000005#F00200","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman (Deputy Marcela Corcoran Kennedy)"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386685800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to make a presentation.  I am the secretary of the Irish Family History Foundation and the genealogist for County Kildare.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Nora O&rsquo;Meara, North Tipperary Genealogy Service; Mr. Fintan Mullen, Ulster Historical Foundation, and Se&aacute;n &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in, Leitrim Genealogy Service.<\/p><p>  The Irish Family History Foundation has 33 county genealogy centres on the island of Ireland.  We began computerising parish records in each county in the late 1980s and have provided research services for over 25 years or more in some cases.  The majority of the county centres were formally set up <i>circa<\/i> 1991 under the direction of Mr. Paddy Teahon, Department of the Taoiseach, with the aim of computerising all of the genealogical records pertaining to each county, including church, civil, census, gravestone and land records, while providing local employment and training opportunities.  We operate with paid staff and volunteers.  Some 14 centres facilitate various training and employment schemes. <\/p><p>  The foundation is a not-for-profit company and completely self-financing, paying VAT and corporation tax.  The county centres provide local employment and financially support other local services such as heritage centres.  They are a focal point for tourists in the respective counties and, in many cases, are the only contact point for visitors in the off-season.  Local researchers can pinpoint the exact area from where someone&rsquo;s ancestors came and help him or her to locate relatives still living in the area.  The service is free of charge and only available in a county with a genealogy centre.<\/p><p>  We have provided extensive background details on the foundation and its member centres in the written submission.  I would like to address the main topic before the committee through the following questions: how can or should genealogical and related services be resourced and funded?  The network of local centres and the highly successful website would not be available if we did not charge a fee.  In turn, as a not-for-profit organisation, the vast majority of revenue goes straight back to the local centres.  We use the balance to add further records to the site and develop and promote services and for the administration and management of the website.  In over 25 years we have yet to encounter a credible suggestion for alternative funding.  There seems no reasonable alternative to develop and manage the website.  It is a statement of fact that charging for this information online is international best practice. <\/p><p>  The provision of the 1901 and 1911 Irish census returns online has proved successful.  That is not surprising, as the data are provided at no charge to the end user.  What may not be appreciated is that a small charge could generate millions in income for the National Archives of Ireland and the State, as it has done for the national archives in the United Kingdom and the USA.  Another State body, the General Register Office, has no plans to make the State&rsquo;s computerised records of births, marriages and deaths available free of charge to the public.  The argument in support of the free availability of records is that it will promote or encourage tourism.  However, there is no necessary connection between providing a free service and tourism promotion.  We request that further developments in this area be carefully examined.  A common approach between local centres and national institutions would benefit a country that sells the personal experience to tourists as being paramount.  The causal connection between free online access for family histories and tourism inflow has not been demonstrated.<\/p><p>  Let me pose a second question which is an interesting one.  Who derives value from our services?  We have over 1.2 million visitors a year to our website and over 560,000 registered users, the majority of whom are from outside the State.  The data are accessed by two groups: professional genealogists or researchers and amateur family historians.  In the case of the former, it is reasonable to charge fees in order to provide them with structured access to what is a key input to their professional revenues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karel Kiely","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386686400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>In addressing ourselves to the issue of capturing the full value of our genealogical heritage, we would make the point that an all-island approach is vital, and this has been the case with the Irish Family History Foundation.<\/p><p>  To give a bit of background, there are four centres in Northern Ireland.  They are embedded in the archives and institutions and the heritage sector there.  The Ulster Historical Foundation, UHF, grew out of the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland; Derry Genealogy is part of Derry City and Archives Service; Armagh Ancestry is linked directly with Armagh City Council; and Irish World has a broad reach not only within Northern Ireland but across the world.  We are embedded within the heritage scene.  All of the centres were centrally involved in the development of the Irish Family History Foundation and in the <i>rootsireland.ie<\/i> database.  The four centres were some of the first to join it.  The Ulster Historical Foundation pioneered the prototype system and Armagh Ancestry piloted the first phase of the development of the <i>rootsireland.ie<\/i> database, and it is fair to say that all-island co-operation was crucial in the development of what is now equivalent to a national service.<\/p><p>  Historically, the North has always been centrally involved.  For example, two of those involved, if I might name them, were Sir Robert Kidd, the ex-head of Northern Ireland's civil service, and Mr. Paddy Doherty of Derry Inner City Trust.  In terms of our ongoing co-operation with the bodies, archives, etc., in Northern Ireland which are vital to the success of the genealogical heritage enterprise, UHF works regularly with the Public Record Office, Derry City Archives and the Cardinal Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Fiaich Library and Archive, which are the three main archival institutions in Northern Ireland.  That is merely a small example of how the cross-Border co-operation is essential if we are to maximise the full value of our genealogical heritage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000006#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Mullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1386686400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for their opening statements.

I might seem to be a little lonely here on my own but, in fact, I am a member of the Association of Professional Genealogists, a member of the Genealogical Society of Ireland and a big source of profit for the Irish Family History Foundation, <i>rootsireland.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>  My focus will be on the researcher, the person who is trying to find his or her ancestors, particularly coming from abroad.  The relationship between Ireland and its diaspora is utterly unique and this is not appreciated nearly enough in Ireland itself.  If one thinks of worldwide figures, only Germany has more people of German origin outside the country than inside.  In the case of Germany, there are 150 million persons of German origin outside Germany but there are 90 million Germans.  Then one looks at Ireland where there are 80 million persons of Irish origin outside Ireland but there are only 6.5 million of us still here.  The disproportion is extraordinary and it does not exist anywhere else on the planet.  If one thinks of it, Ireland today has the population of Rio de Janeiro and the Irish outside Ireland would number those in New York, London, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai all rolled together and then some.  We have a unique relationship with the Irish outside Ireland and that uniqueness places an obligation on us, particularly in genealogy, to make it as easy as possible for these people to find their ancestors and to find their way back home.<\/p><p>  It is also the reason that genealogy in Ireland cannot be as simple a business as it might be elsewhere.  In other words, purely commercial imperatives cannot dictate how genealogy works in Ireland.  We have a duty to make it as simple, low-cost and widely available as possible.<\/p><p>  Of course, there are economic benefits and people will point them up readily.  In my experience, the two Holy Grails for people doing genealogical research are to find the place from which their ancestors left, to actually stand in the field up to their ankles in mud, and to meet any surviving extended family.<\/p><p>  The tourism benefits are self-evident.  It always has been big difficulty in dealing with public bodies to make a business case to state that if one spends &euro;1,000 on improving genealogical research services here, so many extra visitors will come.  There may be times when common sense is more important than a watertight business case.  It is common sense - it is as clear as the nose on one's face - that if one makes it easier for people to find out where they came from, more of them will come back.  It is as simple as that.<\/p><p>  Rather than talk about the great plethora of sources that I would love to see digitised and online, I will focus on the four main sources that everybody doing research on Irish records will have to go through at some point or other.  These are the two 19th century land tax surveys, Griffith's Valuation and the Tithe Applotment Books, the 1901 and 1911 census returns, the State records of births, marriages and deaths from 1864, and the church records.  The first two of those four - the land tax records and the 1901 and 1911 Census returns - are already online.  In particular, the census returns were a revelation to many not involved in genealogy of just how powerful digitisation could be.  The other two are more problematic.  The General Register Office records are, as my colleague, Ms M&aacute;ire Mac Conghail, pointed out, coming online in bits and pieces.  The standard in general register offices in Australia, Scotland and Northern Ireland is to have these records fully searchable - for births, up to 100 years old; for marriages; up to 70 years old; and for deaths, up to 50 years old.  The General Register Office of Northern Ireland is about to do this for the records under its control, which include many areas that are now in the Republic.  We will have a situation in which those in east Donegal or north Louth will be able to search for their family history on the website of the General Register Office of Northern Ireland but will have to come in person, sit in front of an index register and work their way through a Victorian indexing system to do research in the South.  It is not as if there is a great deal of money required to digitise these records.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000006#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Grenham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386687000,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000007#H00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1386687000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

I have shares and I must declare that as a conflict of interest so that we do not run into difficulties later.<\/p><p>  I probably must declare another interest because I have a passion about this subject.  I have nearly gone blind reading microfilm, microfiche and paper records.  I value the development of being able to research things online.  Having done it the hard way, one appreciates being able to do it through a more modern arrangement.  I have spent time in many of the repositories, including some of those in Northern Ireland.  I have not had a chance to spend much time in the new Public Record Office of Northern Ireland offices, but I did spend time in the old office on the Lisburn Road.  The idea of an all-Ireland facility should be a given.<\/p><p>  Mr. John Grenham made a point about the law.  Can he direct us to the law that was changed in respect of what was done in the UK so that we can get over this rule?  I presume he would say it was a game-changer to have the GRO records themselves, as opposed to the indexes.<\/p><p>  My next question is probably a very political one, and the witnesses are free to respond as they wish, but why is it that the Irish Family History Foundation and <i>irishgenealogy.ie<\/i> have fairly comprehensive church records, and why can the set of records not be complete?  It is fine if one knows where to find them, but there is a difficulty for somebody who does not realise how fragmented that set of records is.  Perhaps the witnesses would address that issue.  I would look at this from the same perspective as John Grenham - that is, as somebody who is trying to use the records.  That is the focus we should have on this.<\/p><p>  With regard to Mr. Michael Merrigan's presentation, the principle of records being in public ownership with a right to access is a good one.  In his view, does that preclude charging for records?  What is his view on that?  Karel Kiely made the point about not being able to run the service without the income, which obviously goes back into the service.  What is his response to that?  This will obviously be a pivotal issue.<\/p><p>  I totally agree with the point, which cannot be said loudly enough, about the move to Werburgh Street and the appalling building that has been provided.  The idea of a flagship building is something on which I hope this committee will comment.  If this is the first introduction for the visitor, it creates a very bad impression.  We are not simply discussing tourists from abroad.  I found the place where my family came from and I return to those places; I buy books and spend money there.  The opportunities do not just relate to tourists.  There are other things that one might not consider to be valuable in this whole area, but if we select the topic carefully, so that it is not put exclusively into an economic arena, there is a value beyond the economic as well which would be appreciated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000007#H00300","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386687000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I can certainly supply the committee with the reference to the UK Bill.

Some of what we do not have is due to churches not giving us access.  In my case, in Celbridge, County Kildare, I was never allowed to take the parish registers.  That was always a consideration for us.  Unless the parishes were willing we could not take the registers from them.  John Grenham said earlier that the Department and the Irish Family History Foundation were the main players.  The churches, too, have ownership over their records and what happens to those records.  They should be consulted and the records should be made available on their terms as well.  That has been a problem in some counties, where things were done against the wishes of the churches, especially the Catholic Church.

In libraries generally, one is aiming for free access as far as possible.  That has not really been possible in the case of genealogy services.  There is a huge cost to getting the records digitised and computerised, but fortunately, through the good use of F&Aacute;S schemes, we have got to where are.  Even at that, to continue to provide the service and to provide the centres will not be possible without some charge - a modest one, we hope.  Many of the centres are supported by the local authorities.  In Leitrim the county council gives us a substantial subvention every year, and it is the same in many other counties.  It is an accumulation of the money one takes in from charges, a subsidy from the county council and a lot of voluntary effort.  If it had to be paid for otherwise, it would cost a huge amount of money.  I think most people are prepared to pay a modest charge for it.<\/p><p>  The whole purpose of this is tourism.  It could be Irish tourists as well as Americans and those of other nationalities.  As Mr. Grenham said, the crucial thing for the tourist is to find the house and the place.  Some of the sources talked about today, while they are useful in their own right, will not necessarily do that.  We would all like to see the 1926 census, but it of marginal importance in terms of finding places.  When one knows where one is from, then one looks at the census.  <\/p><p>  The birth, marriage and death records - civil and church records - are the critical ones.   The whole thing will not be complete until all of the church and civil records are computerised and digitised for the whole country.  As it is at the moment, the most important source is <i>rootsireland.ie<\/i>, the Irish Family History Foundation, because it has about 80% of the church records.  A considerable number of civil records are already fully indexed in some counties.  As of now, it is the only show in town.<\/p><p>  If one is an American who wants to find the place of one's ancestors, <i>rootsireland.ie<\/i> is the primary site.  The other things are useful and important but it is the crucial one.  The most important thing is to get the rest of this done.  A lot of our centres are doing that with the benefit of the bit of money they are getting from being online.  When it is all done, we will need to have it all together.  Somebody mentioned that although most of the 32 counties are on our site, County Kerry, Dublin city and part of Cork are not.  There needs to be a means of getting that together.  As I said, 75% or 80% of it is on the Irish Family History Foundation site already.  There are the portions not done in those counties and then there are the counties not on it which are on the Department's site.  I would like to see more co-operation with the Department to get that together as well as with the other stakeholders to decide how that will be done.

One area where there could be many opportunities for young people would be research under the heading of genealogical information.  Perhaps some of that is already going on.  If so, could any of the witnesses who are aware of it elaborate on it?  Does anyone on the panel see opportunities there?  If some of the funding from the youth guarantee could be directed towards organisations in which they are involved or at local authority level, it would be a great opportunity for young people because it involves research, administration and finding out about our history and heritage.

His support down through the years with the Bills has been very much appreciated by our members.  We could say we are almost there.  A very good consultative process was begun in 1998.  It came out of a suggestion we made during the passing of the National Cultural Institutions Act through Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We were working very closely with Senator Paschal Mooney.  Having got nearly 28 amendments there, one suggestion we had was that we need to know what we are talking about regarding what our genealogical heritage is.  What is the scope of this?  The Minister at the time, Michael D. Higgins, agreed to this suggestion.  There was a change of Government following the election and his successor, S&iacute;le de Valera, initiated the study in 1998.  That produced a very interesting and comprehensive interim report.  That interim report could have formed the basis for a draft policy and plan for genealogy in Ireland.  Unfortunately, when the final report came, they chose one particular suggestion within the consultative process.  Unfortunately, that was not what the Minister had asked for so that consultative process ended.  What I am suggesting is that the basis for the interim document of 1998 could be looked at again.  If we want to capture the full value of our genealogical research, we must first understand what it is.  We proposed within our document a national inventory of genealogical records or records of genealogical potential.  These are records that may not be formed for a genealogical purpose but which have genealogical potential.  All genealogists are quite aware of that.  The maximum amount comes from archaeology.  A grave yield site next to a known archaeological site is one of archaeological potential.  That consultative process that took place in 1998 by the Heritage Council was very open and inclusive.  I suggest that the committee with the possible aid of the Heritage Council build on what was done in the interim report from 1998 and see where things have changed.<\/p><p>  What is our genealogical heritage and what is genealogy?  I will bring my colleague in on that in a moment.  That must be looked at because if we can get that clear, we can all work together and say this is what we are talking about.

We have found from our work with North-South bodies, such as Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency, that they see family histories as an easy win when they are otherwise dealing with contentious issues.  I recently joined the round table of the community relations council and the Heritage Lottery Foundation on the decade of commemorations.  This is an emotive and sensitive issue in the North and people are keen to take these easy opportunities.  Family history has proven to be an easy win because we can approach these historical subjects at the micro level of who, when and where.

The Guinness archive is based in the Guinness Storehouse, which is Ireland's premier visitor attraction.  It is part of Diageo's operation in Ireland.  It is an unusual archive service in the Irish cultural landscape.  It is a corporate archive which, as well as fulfilling a service to its parent organisation, is also open to the public.<\/p><p>  The Guinness company was founded in 1759 and there has always been a culture and philosophy within the organisation of both recognising the importance of the company's own heritage and its role within the culture of Ireland, and the need to preserve this heritage.

Many researchers will be familiar with the 1901 and 1911 census, military records and church records, as we heard earlier today, but records of private industry are often neglected sources of genealogical information.<\/p><p>  The Guinness company has been an integral part of Dublin's economic life for over two centuries.

It holds the non-statutory archives of the various railway companies which became part of CIE.  The statutory records - minutes, share registers, etc., - are held by the CIE group.  The society works closely with Irish Rail, the Rail Safety Commission, the rail accident investigation unit and the Railway Procurement Agency.  In addition to our archives, we have a publishing programme, a regular journal, and a library and meetings in Dublin, Cork and London.  If one goes to the 1911 census on the National Archives website, one will see a 1911 Dublin tram timetable which the library made available from its collection as part of the census digitisation project.<\/p><p>  The strength of our position is that we are widely known among railway staff some of whom are members and, therefore, when offices get cleared, we often get a telephone call.  As a specialist archive, we are probably best likened to military archives.  <\/p><p>  The focus of my presentation will be on staff records.  In the year of the Lock-out centenary, we have complete staff records from the Dublin United Tramway Company, although only from 1923 as its headquarters were burned down in the Civil War.  However, our main focus is on railway company archives.  The railways were the biggest employers collectively in Victorian and Edwardian Ireland and in addition to running trains, they ran hotels, docks and engineering workshops.  We hold staff records for all the big companies and some of the smaller ones.  <\/p><p>  In 1924 all the companies lying entirely within the Free State were formed into the Great Southern Railway.  This company was allowed to buy out competing bus and lorry operators and we have a comprehensive set of bus driver and conductor records from the 1930s.  The main body of our staff records are in ledgers from the main railway companies.  Some are grouped by stations, such as Cork or Limerick, while some companies had a simple chronological ledger.  These generally go back to the 1880s.  Some of the smaller companies, such as the Cavan and Leitrim ones, have all their staff in one ledger.  Cork had five railway companies and we have records for three of them.  <\/p><p>  The case of the Great Northern Railway is unique as we have a card index which, subject to some limitations, gives comprehensive coverage of all departments of what was until 1958 a cross-Border body.  We have records of the company's staff for all of Northern Ireland.  As an aside, it is worth noting that those who enlisted in the First World War were given a crimson card with the heading \"European war\".  The Great Northern Railway records are probably the most comprehensive as the engineering department records are patchy to say the least for CIE. <\/p><p>  We have through voluntary endeavour provided finding aides for some of these volumes and continue to do so.  Our latest project is to create a database of pensioners for the Great Southern and Western Railway in 1907.  Pensions then, as now, were a touchy subject.  When the old age pension was introduced in 1906, the Great Southern and Western Railway told all its existing pensioners to claim the old age pension.  They were then told their company pensions would be adjusted to compensate.  There is a voluminous file of correspondence on this matter and we are creating a database that will cover many hundreds of railway workers in the largesse of the Irish railway companies, some of whom were employed from the opening of the line in 1846.<\/p><p>  At the other end of the timescale, we have a full list of the thousands of Great Southern Railway staff who volunteered for service in the LDF during the Emergency.  We also have files covering enlistment in Northern Ireland showing the lengths to which the Great Northern Railway went to keep its staff from voluntarily enlisting by having them designated as essential workers.  We are carrying out this database project to help researchers but also to protect individual files from multiple handling.   <\/p><p>  We now come to our dilemma which is how to conserve the material and protect it from further deterioration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000013#O00200","nonspeaker":"Rev.

The first question is what is the face of genealogy in Ireland and worldwide today?  Second, given that genealogy has been transformed in the last 15 years, what can we learn from the State's role in this?  Finally, as a company at the forefront of these changes, what do we recommend to propel progress?<\/p><p>  Some committee members may already familiar with Eneclann but for the benefit of those who are not, Eneclann is a heritage company that develops digital resources for Irish family history as well as a range of complimentary services and products.  The company was established in 1998 as a campus company at Trinity College Dublin and has won awards for its innovative business model.  To date, Eneclann has published over 1,000 individual titles and over 70 million records online.  It played a key role in the creation of the web service <i><i>irishorigins.com, <\/i><\/i>in 2003 and is a joint-venture partner in<i><\/i><i><i>www.findmypast.ie<\/i><\/i>, launched in 2011.  The company is well known for its high-profile genealogical research.  This year, for example, we met Hollywood star Tom Cruise at Iveagh House to delivery his family history, stretching back over 1,000 years, a project we funded to support The Gathering initiative.  We have worked with the popular television series, &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot; as well as home-produced features and are currently the anchor Irish researcher for NBC's &quot;Faces of America&quot; in the United States. <\/p><p>  The company's highest-profile work was researching the ancestry of President Barack Obama.  The company worked with Tourism Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to maximise the value of his visit to Ireland in 2011 and introduced Obama to his closest-living cousin in Ireland, a man called Dick Benn from Tipperary.  This year, at the request of the White House, we gave Michelle Obama and her daughters a personal tour of their family history at Trinity College library.  <\/p><p>  Because of our expertise with historic records, Eneclann has been appointed by the State to tackle many landmark archival projects.  We worked with the Department of Defence on a massive data disaster recovery of over 130,000 files.  We worked on a project for the Department of Health involving a detailed listing of over 200,000 records relating to children in State care.  We also undertook work for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, where we scheduled over 100,000 Land Commission files.  Eneclann is also a trusted partner of many cultural institutions in Ireland and abroad including the National Archives of Ireland, Trinity College library, the UK National Archives, Family Search and many more.  <\/p><p>  What can we say about genealogy in the wider world in 2013?  In the past 15 years we have had a digital revolution in Irish family history.  There are now over 100 million Irish records online.  These records are much more accessible than they have ever been before and are much easier to search.  As a consequence, we have seen an exponential growth in the numbers of people tracing their Irish origins at home and abroad.  The two engines behind this change are the internet and popular entertainment.  Eneclann has been a technology pioneer in Irish genealogy, from publishing one of the first databases of material in 1999 to releasing the first complete edition of Griffith's Valuation online in 2003, a key resource, to our current position of having brought over 70 million Irish records to the public via the <i><i>findmypast.ie <\/i><\/i>website.  Popular entertainment and major television programmes have also played a role.  Genealogy is no longer perceived as a hobby for people with an aristocratic background.  There is an understanding that every family has a story and that it is possible to trace almost every family back to the 1830s.  <\/p><p>  Genealogy is now a major worldwide hobby.  What is the size of the global genealogy audience?  Marketing surveys in the United States over the past 20 years have shown a dramatic rise in interest in genealogy, with recent figures showing that 73% of the adult population are interested, which equates to 173 million people.  Of those interested, it is estimated that 17% or 40 million are very interested.  While surveys of this nature have not been carried out in Ireland and Britain, the continued success of family history television programmes as well as the strong commercial success of Irish and British online publishers like<i><i><\/i><\/i><i>findmypast.ie,<\/i> suggest that the underlying trend is the same.  <\/p><p>  I draw the committee's attention to the short roots tourism section of our submission.  An estimated 90,000 people visit Ireland each year to engage in family history research.  <i>findmypast.ie<\/i> now has more than 70,000 registered users from Ireland.  This is the face of twenty first century genealogy.  It is serviced almost entirely by online genealogy publishers, whether private or public.  Genealogy is a business, a growing industry that offers employment prospects and tax revenues.  The worldwide value of genealogy is approximately &euro;4 billion and is consistently growing at rates of over 20% per annum.  The scale of Irish emigration and the size of the Irish diaspora in general are important metrics in determining the potential value of Irish genealogy.  <\/p><p>  What can we learn from the last 15 years?  Our submission identifies those things the State did that worked and those that did not.  Let us look at the successes.  First we have the publication of the 1901 - 1911 census records online.  Even with budget cuts, the National Archives continues to release records online by working in partnership with the private sector, particularly <i>findmypast.ie<\/i>.  The National Library, despite cuts of 40% has managed to maintain a free genealogy advisory service which is actually unsustainable with such cuts.  In 2013 The Gathering was a great success but we need to develop roots tourism as a legacy project.  <\/p><p>  We can also learn from missed opportunities.  We regret the continuing inertia of many State agencies <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> engaging with digitisation and releasing their records online, although sometimes they have no option.  There is also a lack of understanding of the possibilities online publishers can bring to our heritage which is unfortunate.  The development of the genealogy business offers great opportunities for tourism, access to archives and employment.  <\/p><p>  In light of these changes, what do we at Eneclann recommend should happen?  In our submission we discuss many areas that should be addressed but in the time allowed, I will only bring some key points to the attention of the committee.  Members will be glad to know that only one area involves spending.  The Government must reverse the cuts to public archives and libraries.  These provide an essential service that underpins all other development.  There are hundreds of millions of genealogical records that must be made available and this will only happen with an adequately funded archival sector with the support of online publishers.  The Government needs to familiarise itself with the genealogy business and what it means for the Irish economy, as it has already done with the technology industry.  We have an excellent opportunity to turn this country into a European hub for genealogy but this requires the Government facilitating this development and enabling innovation.  Our submission gives a step-by-step guide to some of the key issues to be addressed here, including freeing up access to historic records, changing data protection guidelines, empowering the cultural sector to partner with publishers and other innovators as well as connecting to the diaspora.  We are incredibly lucky in Ireland, with tens of millions of people worldwide with an emotional connection to this island that other countries can only envy.  To maintain these connections with successive generations and to strengthen these links, we need to connect these people to their personal heritage.  Genealogy should be the key legacy from the year of The Gathering.  We should have a genealogy centre in Dublin, which could be self-financing.  <\/p><p>  In conclusion, there are great opportunities to develop genealogy here and the Government can have a significant impact, for better or worse, depending on the decisions it makes or fails to make.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000014#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Donovan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386691200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Donovan for his opening statement.

She told the committee she has given access free of charge to <i>Ancestry.co.uk.  <\/i>This is excellent.  What is the reason that she cannot use the Irish genealogy site sponsored by the State, is that not an option?  I am trying to understand how to put material together from an Irish side.  She mentioned the difference between the types of resources.<\/p><p>  I am a big supporter of online publishing both because of the access to those in Ireland and overseas.  I have been in the National Archives to seek access to a will and have been told it cannot be transferred because of the condition it is in.  I am sure every time these documents are opened up, that is impacting on their condition.  There is an issue also with the handling of documents and with digitisation.  There are issues for those heavily vested in this areas as well as for the general public.  Ms Roche mentioned how television programmes and other sources that bring people's attention to this subject.  We saw the impact of the digitisation of the 1911 and 1901 census in raising interest in genealogy among many new people.  I am a big supporter of digitising the 1926 census.  I was very happy to hear Ms M&aacute;ire Mac Conghail speak about the General Register Office of Ireland digitising its records.  The fact that an Irish citizen can go to family search or <i>Ancestry.co.uk <\/i>to get a digitisation of the GRO but one cannot do it from an Irish site is wrong.  We own this material and yet Ireland cannot put it online but I can access it from sources outside Ireland.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Donovan mentioned that Ireland is a European hub for genealogy.  Is that in respect of our heritage or the digital hub that we proudly profiled in Ireland?  I have seen that <i>Ancestry.co.uk<\/i> have brought 15 jobs to the digital hub and expect to expand to 50 jobs, mainly in the management and finance area.

We are working on such a small shoe-string that we do not even think about the financing.  That has some benefits.  We would be one of a number of very specialised archives and if the material was on a larger scale, one would lose the environment in which it is set.  People often come along and have an idea that somebody worked on the railways and were able to find out a lot but some of the terminology does not always match up with their expectation.  Engine driver for example does not necessarily mean a man who drove a railway engine, he could have stoked a mill.  We are able to read into the background.  I was just thinking when the hundreds of thousands were mentioned that we would probably see 400 to 500 people in a season from September to June and deal with the same number of e-mail or postal inquiries that come in.  It is a drop in the ocean, but we may need to prevent ourselves being carried away with a desire for technology.  We are a voluntary society with approximately 1,200 members scattered around the British Isles in the main.  We get donations from people who visit the archives but there is no source to which we can turn apart from the annual Heritage Council grant.  There is no finance from the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht or Education and Skills.  I think some aspects of what we are discussing are related to the education budget just as much as the heritage budget.  I know that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is a very sincere and committed person but he does not have the mega millions.  It is still low down in the priorities of Government.

The perfect example of this is Griffith's Valuation.  In 2003, in partnership with the National Library and National Archives, we started work on digitising the collection that is known as Griffith's Valuation.  This is not one source but a collection of more than 310 individual books.  When we approached the project the first thing we had to do was get to grips with how much information there was and where it was found.  The National Library, National Archives and Valuation Office did not have a single copy of all the different books that comprise Griffith's valuation.  It was, therefore, a matter of going from archive to archive and library to library.  Along with the national cultural institutions, we also approached King's Inns, some of the archives in the United Kingdom, a library in Salt Lake City and a private collector in North America whose ancestors came from a particular townland here.  The individual in question had gone to the trouble of finding the particular book, a once-off publication, and purchasing it at auction.  I understand there were only three land-holders in the entire townland of his ancestors.  We assembled all the relevant information, obtained the approval of all the relevant parties, digitised the information and created a searchable index.  Using this index, a person who finds the individual he or she is tracing can click through and see the visual image.  For the first time since Griffith's Valuation was published, we have a definitive version.  The only place the valuation is available nowadays is online because there is still not a single archive that has a complete collection.

We need to consider this if we wish to see beyond our discussions and identify what contribution we hope to make.

We are adding not to the complexity of the issue but to the multifaceted nature of the important topic we are addressing.  <\/p><p>  My questions are aimed at identifying where the committee's discussions will lead.  The mere fact that we are having this discussion underlines the importance of the issue, its potential and the important assets that exist.  In other areas of community activity, for example, sport, the diverse elements of the relevant activity have been successfully brought together in a single body.  This has been useful and has eliminated much of the fog and fudge.  One could say the same about the Arts Council, although it is a statutory body.  There are many similar examples.  Unfortunately, this is not the case in the area of genealogy.  We meet every so often and make an effort but do not work on structures, disciplines and so on.  The final plan must ensure that each player is able to identify itself within the plan and see evidence of its ownership and autonomy.

I have been involved in research not into genealogy, but into history and 40 to 50 years ago the state of the records retained by CIE was appalling.  However, to give them their due, we brought this to their attention in the 1970s, through one of my predecessors, Joe Leckey, who was a professional archivist.  CIE spent significant money on the records then - it had more money then than now - but there are certain items that I would love to have the money to work on as they need to be retained in their present form.  The nature of, for example, the Great Southern and Western Railway archives is one that does not lend itself to digitisation.<\/p><p>  The railways had an appalling way of keeping records.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000017#S00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Norman Gamble","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386693000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I would first like to reply to the question on digital records.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  Records created in the early stages of computerisation, when the first accounts packages were introduced in the late 1970s and the 1980s, have a huge range of associated problems.  However, since we started bringing in standards for keeping modern records in the 1990s, I am pleased to say that those problems do not really exist for the long-term preservation of the information.  We will be left with this problem for about 20 years and we will have to deal with that.   However, the digitalisation of historic records is a different issue altogether.  The standards that apply to the digitalisation of historic records are well known.  We follow open-source standards for the images that are captured.  We do not use proprietary software for this.  It is a very good way to keep a surrogate copy.  I say &quot;surrogate copy&quot; because the original record is more important.  By having a surrogate digital copy, people can look at that and the original can be put in a proper archival environment, with proper temperature humidity controls.  That is the ideal situation because like most archivists, we prefer not to look at the record at all because that damages it.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked what this hub would look like.  I am not talking about a hub as an institution.  I am talking about an environment where we have free engagement with the records that might result in innovative models, businesses, volunteer groups and so on.  There are certain basic things we need to do to facilitate that happening.  We must have free access to the records that are available.  We need to focus our attention on the limited Government funds to support the archives doing what they do, which is archival work.   Let the private companies and volunteer groups come together to seek to publish them, while the funds are low.  At the moment, what is happening is a misuse of funds because there are other ways of doing this.  The hub is not a building or institution, but a collection of organisations which happen to share a common space, and interact and engage with each other, and develop innovation as a consequence of being geographic location together.  That is not dissimilar to what happened with technology out in Silicon Valley.  I do not wish to exaggerate, as there is not a pot of gold.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of paying for indexes to public records.  If the indexes are digitised and made available for free by a public institution, then that is one thing, but it is a different thing altogether if indexes are not even in existence to start and are created privately.  I should say at this point that the GRO indexes are available on several sites online.  They are available for free at <i>familysearch.org<\/i>, or behind a paywall on <i>ancestry.com<\/i> or on <i>findmypast.ie<\/i>.  We have been told another version will be available from the GRO itself, and we look forward to that.  I think the question is whether the public sector is fulfilling its public access remits, but not suddenly to hobble private organisations from trying to do good things as well, which can help support them.  It is not an either\/or question.  It is not about paying for something or having it for free; it can be both.  For example, we have a series of agreements with the National Archives whereby we digitise their records, index them, put them online and they are available commercially for a duration of time, before they later go online for free to everybody.  That happens on the National Archives website and on our own.  We also do stuff immediately for free on both websites.  I want to open members' minds to a range of possibilities of how these things might look.  I dislike the fact that we might end up with a Government decision that we will do everything one way only.  That would preclude all the diversity and innovation that might take place among public organisations, voluntary groups and private companies.<\/p><p>  Another question was about the diversity of records that could be digitised.  We addressed this in the second point of our ideas on what should be done.  Perhaps Ms Fitzsimmons might discuss this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000018#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Donovan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386693000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I will do so, and I would also like to respond to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Deputy Murphy.  I was very interested to hear both of them talk about diversity.  First and foremost, digitisation of records can secure the assets of our cultural heritage.  Dr. Gamble referred to wear and tear.  Where there is wear and tear, digitisation is particularly relevant.  It is part of the modern conservation of records.  It means that we can digitise records and then create a searchable index.  People can actually find their ancestor in the index, click and then see the image.  In the meantime, the actual paper record can be conserved and put away, so that minimises the actual use and any further damage to the record.  There are also digital standards for preserving records and Mr. Donovan has touched on that.<\/p><p>  The digital revolution to which Mr. Donovan referred in his short presentation is very real.  It has led to over 100 million records being placed online in the last 15 years or so, but there is also a much greater understanding that genealogy is not just about births, marriages and deaths and parish records.  It is really about the records that have survived.  We have lost almost the entire 19th century census, so what can we use to track people down?  There is a diversity of records available and I would like to emphasise three huge collections that are available, to a greater or lesser degree, to researchers.  I have used all of them in the course of my career as a professional genealogist.   The first is the Registry of Deeds.  That registry is very often misunderstood as being simply legal records and the records of the ascendancy.  They are not.  The Registry of Deeds contain the records of the Irish middle class.  We always had a fairly sizeable middle class and the records cover the entire island of Ireland.  If those records were to be digitised, it would transform the record from being a big and unwieldy archive into something that can be searched and be used to trace ancestors.  If those records were digitised, we could go beyond simply looking at the townlands index.  We would be able to start looking below that level of middle class people who have assets that they are trying to protect, and find people who did not usually have assets and who do not appear in any other records from that time.  I am talking about school teachers, small shopkeepers, people who run businesses, the law clerks.  These are the approximately 30% of Irish people who were literate and who were then called on to act as witnesses when any of these deeds were being drawn up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000018#T00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Fitzsimmons","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386693600,"counter":148,"content":"<p>One of the phrases used in the earlier sessions was related to an  affinity with Ireland.  That picks up closely on Ms Fitzsimons's point.  One of my points relates to handling records.  As a professional archivist, digital preservation and creating digital copies is definitely the way to go.  As Mr. Donovan remarked, there are many standards for how to digitise records properly.  It is \"watch out\" when we have many voluntary groups with the best intentions wishing to start digitising material, perhaps local parish records or other local material, without having true sight of what constitutes proper standards.  When people are working with limited resources, they can sometimes be throwing bad money after good and someone may have to come along three or four years down the road and redigitise the records.<\/p><p>  There is work to be done.  Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; asked about the plan and what was next.  One of the next parts of the plan is putting together a set of standards that will be readily available for people who are not part of a larger institution or do not have access to a professional archivist.  These standards should outline what a digital preservation plan looks like, how people can go about digitising records and keep the context in which the records were created.  As archivists, we are always big fans of context.  A record is not created in isolation.  At a simple level, that is what we have done with the Guinness archive.  We have data about the individual and his date of birth.  However, we have introduced a contextual element which explains the department and where the person worked.  Adding this contextual information and keeping the context is interesting.<\/p><p>  A point made by one of the previous speakers earlier this afternoon resonated with me.  It was related to the overall plan and creating an inventory of the genealogical potential of the resources available.  That rings true in trying to create a first base.  We cannot decide what we are doing with the records unless we know what we have available.  The second part is to create a plan of what we do with them.  The idea is to try to identify an inventory or a resource in order that we all know exactly what records are available.  We should then centralise them in order that we do not have visitors who are completely new to Ireland having to go to three or four websites to try to find the same information.  It would be preferable to have the material centralised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000019#U00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eibhlin Roche"},{"type":"speech","time":1386693600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Deputy Joanna Tuffy asked a question about the youth guarantee scheme.

One of the best placed organisations to reply to it is the Irish Family History Foundation.  I noticed, however, that the deputation was somewhat reticent in its response.  Perhaps I can give the committee some ideas which are a little clearer.  It is very difficult to bring in untrained young inexperienced people and involve them in transcribing historical records.  It requires a certain degree of expertise to be able to do this.  I am not necessarily referring to university based expertise and have no wish to try to remove it and place it out of the reach of everyone.  A great deal of training is required.  Most heritage centres put a major effort into training people to do the work.  I am keen to ensure we do not end up making the mistake where, it could be argued, we could potentially turn heritage centres into training institutions.  In fact, what they are supposed to be doing is delivering a genealogical product.  Their purpose is to try to generate something.  However, if we were to turn them into training institutions, they would become derailed from what they were supposed to be doing.  If it would help them, that would be great, but they can make the decision themselves.  Where a local youth employment scheme could work really well is in doing the things on the ground which are difficult to do.  This includes identifying and transcribing gravestones, most of which are in a dreadful state of disrepair throughout the country.  Also, collecting oral history is valuable.  Something we have not had for a long time is an oral history project.  We could try to determine what survives locally from the folklore project in the 1930s.  These are projects in which they could play a role, but throwing them into historical record projects may not be the best use of their efforts.<\/p><p>  Another point raised by Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; was interesting and, if committee members do not mind, I will address it.  It relates to how engagement will work between all interested parties.  It is a complex issue because there are many vested interests and stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013121000019#U00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Donovan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386694200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank all of the representatives for assisting us in our deliberations.

I propose to deal with these subjects separately and suggest we begin by discussing next week's meeting of the General Affairs Council in Brussels.

As the Chairman has said, I will speak first about the General Affairs Council meeting that will take place next Tuesday, 17 December.  I have agreed with the Chairman that in the second half of the session I will run through the foreign policy and external relations review.<\/p><p>  As I indicated at our most recent encounter, the last meeting of the General Affairs Council, which took place on 19 November last, was quite straightforward.  We received presentations on the European Commission's work programme for 2014, the roadmap for European semester implementation in 2014 and the annual growth survey for 2014.  The Lithuanian Presidency put forward a report on implementation of the European Council conclusions.  We also had a very preliminary discussion on the agenda for the December European Council.  In general, the response to the Commission work programme was positive.  There was wide support for its prioritisation of the jobs and growth agenda and the need to complete banking union.  The annual growth survey and the roadmap were also generally well received.  The Chairman raised the Dutch subsidiarity review at our last meeting.<\/p><p>  As planned, there was a short discussion on the Dutch subsidiarity review, which the Chairman of this committee raised at our last meeting, under any other business.  The Dutch Foreign Minister, Frans Timmermans, set out some of the Dutch thinking on subsidiarity and drew attention to a conference on the subject in The Hague in January.  I confirmed our interest in this initiative and made it clear that we will continue to follow the evolving discussion.<\/p><p>  Since the last General Affairs Council, I participated in the Eastern Partnership summit in Vilnius on 29 November and attended the OSCE ministerial council in Kiev last week.  Although the meeting in Vilnius was somewhat overshadowed by events in Ukraine, we were pleased that the EU was able to initial association agreements with Moldova and Georgia on that occasion.  This was a historic step in deepening the EU's relations with both countries.  Members will have been following the subsequent developments in Ukraine.  Deputy Eric Byrne asked me specifically about this issue at our last meeting.  Naturally, it was disappointing that Ukraine was not in a position to sign its association agreement at the Eastern Partnership summit.  The door remains open to the Ukrainian authorities and the decision will be theirs.  During last week's OSCE ministerial council, I was in a position to personally observe the protests in Kiev.  When I spoke there, I called on all sides to show restraint, respect the rule of law and resolve their differences peacefully.  I would like to take this opportunity to call on them to continue to do so.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste and I will attend the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 17 December next.  Today's meeting is taking place a little earlier than usual.  Preparations for the meeting are well under way.  The last agenda was relatively straightforward, but next week's agenda is very full.  The Council will consider a review of the EU External Action Service.  It will have a detailed discussion on enlargement and the stabilisation and association process.  It is also expected to adopt a negotiating framework for Serbia which I welcome.  In addition, we will also be asked to prepare the agenda for the December European Council later next week.  This important European Council will also have a significant agenda including banking union, the economic and monetary union, the common foreign and security policy, migration and energy.  It is a lot to cover.<\/p><p>  The review of the EU External Action Service is expected to be the first item for discussion at the General Affairs Council.  The Council will adopt conclusions on the matter.  As members of the committee will be aware, the European Union's diplomatic service was established in 2010 following the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.  The service has been gradually evolving over the past three years.  It is timely to take stock of the progress achieved to date and to consider areas that might be further improved.  The External Action Service comprises some 3,400 staff drawn from the EU Commission, the General Secretariat of the Council and national diplomats from the EU member states.  It has 139 delegations around the world, which have taken on the task of local EU co-ordination and representation formerly carried out by the rotating Presidency.  Much has been achieved over the past three years, not least considering the difficult economic context in which the new service was born.  The EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, can point to a number of policy successes, including the historic breakthrough in the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue and the recent agreement brokered by the E3+3 with Iran in relation to its nuclear programme.<\/p><p>  The EU External Action Service has also contributed to the development of a more strategic and comprehensive approach to EU foreign policy.  It avails of all of the political, economic and developmental instruments and tools that are at the EU's disposal.  Ireland has joined other member states in welcoming the achievements of the new service.  I wish to comment on the recommendations contained in the review of the service.  We have expressed particular support for efforts to streamline the service, maximise efficiencies, and further develop the already good co-operation with the EU Commission.  It is important that the member states retain a sense of ownership of the EU External Action Service.  In this regard, we welcome the progress achieved in reaching the target of one third member state diplomats at the operational level.<\/p><p>  As is usual in December, the General Affairs Council and the European Council will consider the EU's enlargement strategy for the year ahead and adopt formal Council conclusions.  This is an area of reoccurring interest for this committee.  I have been asked about it every time I have appeared here.  I believe this reflects Ireland's commitment to enlargement.  This has been a year of good progress, including under the Irish Presidency.  Enlargement remains one of the EU's most successful policies.  The objective is to examine how we will move forward next year.  At our last meeting, Deputy Eric Byrne asked about developments regarding Turkey.  As he knows, our Presidency secured agreement on the opening of a new chapter in the accession negotiations for the first time in three years.  Our sense is that there is significant support among member states to build on this momentum by opening negotiations on the key issues of fundamental rights and the rule of law, but there is not yet consensus on whether we can open these discussions until other issues are first resolved.<\/p><p>  Progress is continuing in other important areas.  Talks will start shortly on the issue of visa-free travel between Turkey and the EU.  At the same time, accession negotiations with Montenegro are continuing.  We expect talks on the two key areas of rule of law and fundamental rights to be opened by the end of December.  This will open the way for progress to be made in other areas.  Following a decision by the Icelandic Government, accession negotiations with Iceland are currently suspended.  We will make clear that the door remains open to Iceland if it decides to re-engage.  A key issue for us to consider at the Council will be the adoption of the EU's negotiating framework ahead of the opening of accession talks with Serbia.  The Irish Presidency secured agreement in June to open negotiations with Serbia by January 2014 at the latest.  This was possible due to the significant progress in that country's relations with neighbouring Kosovo.  The further normalisation of relations between the two will be an important issue in Serbia's accession negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013121000003#B00100","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386685200,"counter":162,"content":"<p>We also share the Minister of State's disappointment with regard to the situation in Ukraine which it is hoped will be resolved satisfactorily.  The EEAS is a very important result of the Lisbon treaty.  I was concerned to read reports in the newspapers about the level of expenditure on the EEAS since its inception.  The figure is currently &euro;400 million a year for 139 embassies or about &euro;3 million per mission.  Ireland runs missions for one tenth of that sum.  I am glad to hear that we will be looking at a review of the efficiencies.  The average European citizen would expect no more.<\/p><p>  I refer to the Minister of State's comments on a review of the visa regime for Turkish citizens and that is welcome.  I have met some of our Turkish colleagues recently and I am aware that this matter is one of their concerns.  They hope to see some form of lifting of the visa restrictions so that they can become more integrated with the European Union.  <\/p><p>  We share the Minister of State's concerns about the lack of progress on Bosnia and Herzegovina.  I acknowledge the situation is complex.  The committee visited the region about 15 months ago and we would hope to see improvements in the situation in the near future.<\/p><p>  The committee completed its work on the social dimension of EMU at a recent meeting last Tuesday and has compiled a report which has been issued to the Commission as recently as last Thursday.

As always, he sets out issues clearly and concisely and often detailed questions are not required.  However, I have one or two questions.  I ask the Minister of State to expand on the banking union.  He rightly identified the heads of state and government Council decision of 29 June 2012 to break the link between banks and the sovereign.  Mr. Klaus Regling is very familiar with the situation in Ireland as he carried out a detailed report in 2010 on behalf of the then Government in an effort to understand the reasons for the banking collapse.  He is now chairman of the ESM.  In a recent statement he has indicated that the process of retrospective recapitalisation by the ESM is less likely.  I ask the Minister of State to comment although I accept he may not have all the details to hand and he may be prepared to provide those at a later stage.<\/p><p>  I refer to other reports that seem to emanate from the European Commission that it will retain some form of surveillance on the Irish economy up to the year 2031.  The media are making a certain amount of this statement.  The various agreements such as the six pack and the two pack have been agreed with all members of the European Monetary Union.  Is it not the case that the Commission is undertaking a level of shared co-operation and shared surveillance of various budgeting processes in particular?  I ask if the Minister of State has any further insight into this surveillance which will last until 2031.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013121000005#D00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1386685200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I will get the simple questions out of the way and then ask the more substantive questions.  I fully agree with the European Union that the new government in Albania has made huge strides in reforming the judiciary and the institutions of state.  I applaud the direction in which Albania is moving.<\/p><p>  I have previously raised the old chestnut of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  I had the opportunity to raise it with the United Nations military representative at the COSAC meeting in Dublin Castle where he spoke about Bosnia and Herzegovina.  He admitted in a public forum that the UN had failed the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that it was assumed over the years that the countries would move in tandem with Serbia and Kosovo and that beautiful country, Croatia - where it is planned to locate an embassy.  It was acknowledged that the UN had failed.  The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is now very dangerous and volatile and there needs to be constitutional reform.  Will this issue be recognised with an intensity that has been lacking to date?<\/p><p>  I refer to the 2,500 scientists and academics meeting in the National Conference Centre in Dublin to talk about an &euro;80 billion fund for science and research, of which it is hoped that &euro;1 billion will come to Ireland.  With that as the backdrop and applauding the European Union I wish to tease out with the Minister of State his personal views and those of the Department on our attitude towards the Ukraine.  I have formed the distinct impression in the past five years at least that the EU and the West sell the EU in a very improper way in the context of the divisions which are indigenous to Ukraine, the east-west divide, the Russian-western link, Tymoshenko and the party of the regions.  Is the Minister of State happy that the EU has sold the message of the benefits of EU alignment to the Ukraine, to the extent that the mission has been extended into the Russian-speaking, eastern region of Ukraine?  All I ever hear in Ireland - it is probably replicated in the international media - is the name of Tymoshenko  Ukraine is more than Tymoshenko it is a unitary state not a two-state nation.  Given the eastern partnership and that we were all sold the line that it is nearly sure that Ukraine is over the line, I noted the palpable sense of disappointment when the talks collapsed.  The Russian diplomatic corps at that stage had sent out warnings with regard to the reasons for Armenia pulling out.  Ukraine subsequently gave its reasons for pulling out.  The Russian form of diplomacy is extremely strong on the issue of energy resources.  Is the Minister of State focusing too much on that half of Ukraine which is pro-West, and neglecting the diplomatic programme that must be carried out in the eastern region?<\/p><p>  We have been rather dismissive of the role of Russia and we know its negative role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013121000005#D00400","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386685800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions.  I will take them in the order they were asked.<\/p><p>  Regarding the Chairman's question on the review of the European External Action Service, EEAS, it has achieved much despite the youth of the organisation and the difficult circumstances it confronted during its establishment.  I understand the Chairman's concern about the service's cost.  Like him, I am well familiar with the general concerns that people articulate regarding the cost of any public service.  For this reason, the review is a valuable process.  We must ensure that, for the amount of resources and number of people involved, it achieves its objectives.<\/p><p>  Two areas are important.  First, the EEAS supports through complementarity the effort of member states to deliver on the agreed objectives of the EU.  Second, it represents those interests that have been agreed by member states and are articulated through European institutions, for example, the Commission.  I am certain that the role of the EEAS, which has been good in many respects, can be enhanced once the review has been completed with a view to ensuring value for money.  We should all be concerned about the money spent in any public service, be it in Ireland or abroad.<\/p><p>  Regarding Turkey and visa liberalisation, Ireland is working hard to support Turkey in its journey through negotiating with the EU.  We will participate in those negotiations in a positive way.  Turkey and its Government recognise this, given the role that our Government was able to play in opening up the chapter for Turkey during our Presidency.<\/p><p>  A common theme raised by a number of members was that of Bosnia-Herzegovina, BiH.  The October European Commission report recognised that progress was at a standstill.  We need time to evaluate how to proceed, particularly in light of the fact that, as Deputy Byrne mentioned, many of its neighbours in the region have found a way of engaging with the EU in its processes and satisfactorily meeting the benchmarks laid down by the Union and their own governments.  Therefore, the issue about BiH is a visible and important one requiring our engagement.  However, I must emphasise that ultimate responsibility for the process sits with the home country.  A country must be willing to embrace it and take ownership of it.  A mantra used in respect of other challenges facing us is often used in this respect, namely, the EU cannot impose solutions on anyone.  Similarly, we cannot impose ownership of a process on anyone.  I hope that the opportunity to take cognisance of where we are will be grasped within BiH as it will be within Europe and its member states, including Ireland.<\/p><p>  I am delighted to hear that the report on the social dimensions of the economic and monetary union, EMU, has been finished.  I was a member of the committee during the report's early phases and look forward to reading it.  We strongly recommend the inclusion of social indicators within the scoreboard, as we cannot achieve an evaluation of the situation within the Union without considering the social consequences of decisions alongside the economic ones.  However, we will continue to emphasise the need for caution about treating such indicators like economic indicators.  In other countries, deficits and debt levels have clear spill-over effects on other EU member states, effects that are of a different nature to the spill-over effects picked up by social indicators.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputy Dooley for his two questions.  I am aware of the comments of Mr. Regling, whom the Deputy acknowledged did some valuable work in Ireland by conducting one of the inquiries into what happened within our banking sector.  The Government will continue to emphasise the statement made by the Eurogroup in June setting out the role of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, in direct bank recapitalisations and making it clear that this must be agreed by all member states on a case-by-case basis.  Our Government will continue to pursue such a mechanism as an option for ensuring that we can rebuild our banking system and, importantly, the health of the sovereign.<\/p><p>  The Deputy raised a topical point about the role of the Commission post bailout exit.  While Ireland remains inside the excessive deficit procedure, EDP, which members will be familiar with, we will continue to be subject to an additional layer of monitoring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013121000006#E00200","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386686400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I have a final question for the Minister of State in regard to Moldova.

To do this - I had this discussion with the foreign Minister - we need to ensure that the European Union puts in place methods of supports for those countries in the coming months, in particular throughout the winter.  I believe this will be done in two ways, namely, support for Moldova in moving beyond initialling of the agreement to signing of it in as prompt a manner as possible and address of its concerns in relation to visas in the context of its people being able to move around with greater ease.  This must be given careful consideration.

The purpose of the review, which was launched by the T&aacute;naiste on 8 October, is to provide an updated statement of Ireland's foreign policy and external relations, and to identify a series of recommendations for its conduct.  As the T&aacute;naiste said when launching the review, Ireland's foreign policy and external relations are fundamental aspects of Government.  They represent the means by which we promote our values and pursue our interests abroad.  Through them, we pursue Ireland's economic prosperity, and promote peace and security, both at home and in the wider world.  Our foreign policy is also a statement of who we are as a people and how we wish ourselves to be seen by the outside world.  Through my work as Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, I am aware on a daily basis of the central importance of these facts.<\/p><p>  Following our successful EU Presidency in the first half of this year, the chairmanship of the OSCE in 2012, and our election to the UN Human Rights Council, we have an opportunity to reflect on the future direction of our foreign policy, the values and interests we seeks to promote through it, and how it contributes to achieving Government objectives.  I wish to reflect on the trio of objectives I mentioned: the very successful European Union Presidency; chairmanship of the OSCE in 2012; and Ireland's election to the UN Human Rights Council.  With everything else that was going on in the public and Government sphere at the moment, it is a real tribute to everybody who works in our foreign policy sphere and representing our country.  I am happy to say that as somebody who only came into this role after all those achievements were in place, but it adds to the reason for saying it.  A gigantic amount of work was very well done by all of our colleagues, diplomats and officials, who represent our country on a daily basis, not to mention the work by our Ministers, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.  With that in mind this is a perfect point to take a step back and think where we want to go to from here.<\/p><p>  The vital work of restoring our international reputation and promoting our economic recovery are priorities for the Government.  The international leadership roles we have undertaken as a country have done much to achieve this goal, as has the building of political relationships with European and other partners, through regular participation by Ministers at Council meetings in Brussels, and through trade missions and visits abroad.<\/p><p>  In our last meeting, I emphasised the importance of taking every opportunity to ensure that Irish positions are understood at political level and of keeping up to date on the developing priorities and challenges for our partners.  Our foreign policy is central to both of those goals.  This has been particularly important during the EU Presidency and the important negotiations in Europe on banking and fiscal issues.  Political contact at the highest levels has been central to this.  Our embassies and other diplomatic and consular offices in Europe and around the world have also made a vital contribution.  They are working hard to realise our goals through presenting the best case for Ireland and influencing decisions that affect us.  Together with the State agencies, they work with Irish business, promoting our trade, tourism, education and investment.  In addition, they provide a full range of services to our citizens abroad, sometimes in difficult and tragic circumstances.<\/p><p>  As we look to the future, and as we exit the EU-IMF programme, it is timely to reflect on the future direction of our foreign policy.  The review will consider a broad range of issues, reflecting the breadth of our external engagement.  Issues to be considered will include: how we set our external priorities; how we engage as an EU member state; how we contribute to economic recovery and growth through promoting our trade, tourism and investment; the pursuit of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland; the services we provide to our citizens abroad and our relationship with the Irish diaspora; the contribution of our international development policy; and how we ensure Ireland is a respected international actor.  These are all important issues, as are other aspects of our foreign policy which the review will consider.<\/p><p>  Membership of the European Union is fundamental to our interests, both in foreign policy and domestic terms.  Indeed, our EU membership is inseparable from the pursuit of our foreign policy, as it is from so many aspects of domestic policy.  As our engagement with the European Union is wider than the foreign policy sphere, being at the core of the day-to-day business of all Departments, the review will not examine our EU policy in detail.  Instead, the focus will be on the contribution of our foreign policy and external relations, as well as the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade across Government, to the promotion of Ireland's interests within the EU, on the one hand, and to ensuring that Europe's voice is stronger at a global level, on the other.  The extent that we are able to promote a strong image of ourselves through our foreign policy outside the EU will contribute to our ability to pursue our objectives within it.<\/p><p>  Ireland's foreign policy has been greatly influenced by our engagement in the EU since joining in 1973.  Our EU membership influences our relations with third countries, for example, in shaping trade policies with key partners.  In turn, our relations with those countries also strengthen our voice at the EU table.<\/p><p>  Many of today's challenges, such as cyber security, climate change, and migration, are not defined by borders and regions, but require global solutions.  With 28 countries speaking as one, Europe's voice is stronger in the world and this allows the European Union to speak with authority at a global level.  The EU is uniquely placed to shape the way the international community addresses these and other global challenges, and Ireland is committed to playing its part in shaping how the EU engages on these issues.<\/p><p>  I will now outline how the review is being taken forward.  Given the wide-ranging nature of our foreign policy and external relations, it is important that we consult widely.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is facilitating a broad-based consultation process, involving all Departments, State agencies, academics and experts, business organisations, interested stakeholders, and civil society.  This is being complemented by a detailed process of consultation and analysis being undertaken within my Department, involving our network of embassies and other offices abroad.<\/p><p>  A public consultation exercise was launched on 4 December, in the form of an invitation to members of the public and interested stakeholders to contribute written views.  The deadline for submissions is 4 February 2014.  Information on how to make a submission is available on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013121000008#G00400","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386687600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his attendance and for outlining the nature of this review.  I perceive today's meeting to be a commencement of the process and I would like to think the joint committee will submit a statement to the review in advance of the deadline on 4 February.  Consequently, members probably will have a number of discussions in this regard in the new year and can feed back the outcomes of those discussions to the Minister of State in due course.  However, I will make a few points while the Minister of State is present.  I welcome the breadth of the review and it is excellent that the relationship with the Irish diaspora is being considered.  The Minister of State is aware of how important the diaspora has been to the country over the generations.  I did not hear the Minister of State indicate members of the diaspora would be consulted in some way but I assume that organisations such as, for instance, the Federation of Irish Societies in the United Kingdom or the American organisations will have some input into this process because it is important to maximise the use of the diaspora abroad.<\/p><p>  I note the Minister of State's reference to the need to examine how Ireland's embassies can contribute towards economic recovery and growth through the promotion of trade and tourism, which is an excellent point.  I am reminded of a visit I made to Ireland's consul in Hong Kong some time ago.  From recollection, Ireland's trade with Hong Kong alone - not with China - is approximately &euro;1 billion per year, yet we do not even have an office there.  While we have an excellent part-time consul, he can only spend a certain amount of time on issues regarding Ireland and promoting trade and tourism.  There are opportunities for Ireland that must be maximised but which are not being maximised at present.<\/p><p>  As for where Ireland's embassies should be located, there are some examples arise within the European Union.  For example, Croatia joined recently and while Ireland has no embassy there, it does so up the road in Slovenia, which is a country of half the size and with which Ireland has half the trade.  Consequently, there may be ways of rationalising or altering some local arrangements.  We have an excellent diplomatic corps, which on the whole is extremely cost-effective.  I will give some examples to the Minister of State.  The joint committee recently visited the Baltic states and our embassies in Tallinn and Vilnius are examples of what can be done efficiently and well on extremely tight budgets.  The review should consider this issue and should consider how Ireland's representation abroad can be maximised through the most cost-effective means possible.  I look forward to forming part of the review and the joint committee will return to the subject early in the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013121000009#H00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1386687600,"counter":176,"content":"<p>This is an excellent and timely measure.  While I acknowledge the Minister of State is not taking detailed comments at present, I will mention something that I have noticed a lot since the economy went into recession in 2008-09.  In the 1990s, for example, Ireland had quite strong relations with other peripheral European countries and had an informal alliance with, for the sake of argument, Spain, Portugal, southern Italy to extent and other countries that suffered from some of the same broad issues of peripherality as did Ireland in the 1990s.  This is a broad comment but given that Ireland still remains a small open economy that still suffers greatly from its peripheral location and given that Europe, as members discussed earlier, is expanding quite significantly more to the East, does the Minister of State envisage it might be wise for Ireland, in a much larger Europe, to build up again more bilateral contacts or to strengthen its bilateral arrangements with other countries that are more at one with Ireland in respect of the difficulties and challenges they face?  I refer in particular to their geographic location and the type of social policies they pursue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013121000009#H00300","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1386687600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I agree this is a timely and interesting discussion that is to be had.  If we are doing as well as we are, I am unsure how matters can be improved and I will be fascinated to find out about what routes and restructuring members will be discussing.  The Chairman has already referred to Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, which are three countries bordering each other with three embassies and three small populations.  Given that I also wear the hat of a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am always slightly embarrassed when dealing with ambassadors or visiting dignitaries from countries who remind me that while the population of their countries is vast, with 108 million or 96 million people, they complain of a lack of representation.  I do not refer specifically to Singapore or Malaysia - I do not have the detail of the top of my head - but there are countries whose embassies refer continually to the need for representation.  I am aware the Department and the Government are under pressure from certain sectors to reopen embassies and for some peculiar reason, it is obvious they want to reopen the embassy in the Vatican more than the one in Tehran.  If the Geneva peace talks and developments in Iran continue, I understand it has a regional catchment of interest of approximately 800 million people.

I travel extensively to what could be inelegantly described as multilateral gatherings, for example, European Union and OSCE gatherings, at which many countries are represented.  We should never assume such forums amount to the same thing as building a direct relationship with another country.  I am proud to note that in all the work I have observed, this mistake has not been made and we do all we can to develop good relations with EU member states and non-EU countries.<\/p><p>  This leads me to the point made by other speakers regarding embassies, which are at the core of bilateral work.

The first is for a draft directive on the terms on which medicinal products are covered by the public health insurance systems of member states.  This is generally referred to as the transparency directive.  The second and third proposals relate to general medical devices and <i>in vitro<\/i> diagnostic medical devices, respectively.<\/p><p>  I will begin with the transparency directive.  In March 2012 the European Commission adopted the proposal for a new transparency directive to replace Directive 89\/105\/EEC.  It deals with measures regulating the terms on which medicinal products are covered by the public health insurance systems of member states.  The Commission&rsquo;s view is that since 1989 reimbursement systems have become increasingly complex and that a new directive is required to address these complexities.  It is also intended to incorporate European Court of Justice case law which has developed and is relevant to the directive.  <\/p><p>  Member states had concerns about many of the proposed measures and the administrative burden which would be placed on member states arising from the proposal.  On 6 February 2013 the European Parliament introduced amendments in an attempt to address these concerns.  These amendments were largely adopted by the European Commission in its modified proposal adopted on 20 March.<\/p><p>  Under the Irish Presidency, the working party on pharmaceuticals and medical devices chaired by Ireland held four discussions on the modified proposal, about which many delegations continue to express various degrees of concern.  Further detailed discussions are required at the working party before the proposal will have support at the Council.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health had substantial concerns about the original Commission proposal.  However, the amendments proposed by the European Parliament which were largely adopted by the Commission went a long way towards resolving our main concerns.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with the medical devices proposals published by the Commission in September 2012.  There are two related proposals, one of which is to regulate general medical devices, while the second is to regulate <i>in<\/i><i>vitro<\/i> diagnostic medical devices.  The proposals are designed to provide a legislative framework for the manufacture and placing on the market of both medical devices and <i>in vitro<\/i> diagnostic medical devices in order to ensure a high level of protection for patients and health care professionals.<\/p><p>  Under existing legislation, medical devices, unlike medicines, are not subject to pre-market authorisation by a regulatory authority before being placed on the market.  Instead, medical devices undergo a conformity assessment to confirm that they meet specified safety and performance requirements.  Assessments are conducted by independent certification bodies, known as notified bodies, which are designated and regulated at national level.  One of the main criticisms of the current regulatory system is that notified bodies operate to different standards.  It has also been suggested it may be possible for notified bodies to undertake conformity assessments of categories of medical devices for which they may not have the requisite expertise.  Consequently, it is recognised that improved and harmonised regulatory oversight of notified bodies is needed.<\/p><p>  The Commission has proposed a scrutiny mechanism whereby new applications for conformity assessment of high risk devices, once the assessment of the notified body is complete, could be subject to a second look by the medical devices co-ordination group, a new expert committee composed of member state officials and chaired by the Commission.  It is intended that this mechanism will serve to increase the scrutiny of new high risk medical devices as they come on to the European market and allow for enhanced oversight of the performance of notified bodies.  The Council does not yet have a position on this issue.<\/p><p>  The Commission proposes a rigorous process for approving notified bodies, with strict standards to be met by notified bodies, strengthened criteria for determining the scope of competence of a notified body such as the types of device a notified body may assess, and a joint approach to assessment of notified bodies.  The European Parliament ENVI committee and member states both support improved oversight and regulation of notified bodies.<\/p><p>  To date, the Council working party on pharmaceuticals and medical devices has met on 16 occasions during the Cyprus, Irish and Lithuanian Presidencies.  The examination of the medical devices proposals constituted one of the four key priorities of the Irish Presidency health agenda.  During the Irish Presidency substantial progress was made in the examination of the two proposals.  In parallel, informal technical expert meetings were organised by the Irish Presidency to discuss technical aspects, submit wording suggestions and help in identifying key issues.<\/p><p>  In the European Parliament the proposals were examined by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, known as ENVI.  This committee has voted in favour of pre-market authorisation for high risk medical devices via a centralised EU structure of notified bodies approved by the European Medicines Agency.  The Council does not yet have a position on this issue.  The ENVI report has proposed many useful amendments.  On 22 October the European Parliament voted on the reports and amendments submitted to the plenary session.  The vote on the First Reading resolution was postponed; however, a mandate was given to the rapporteurs to commence negotiations with the Council.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health is actively engaged in the negotiations on the medical devices proposals, with the support of our colleagues in the Irish Medicines Board.  We support the development of a robust legislative framework for medical devices in Europe which will ensure all medical devices placed on the European market are safe for both patients and health care professionals and that European patients have access to new innovative treatments.  In our view, a proportionate balance must be achieved in the new regulatory system between ensuring appropriate pre-market oversight of the conformity assessment of high risk devices before being placed on the market and facilitating innovation in the sector and timely access by patients to new treatments.  <\/p><p>  We will be happy to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013121000003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Barron"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386695700,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I am accompanied by Dr. Niall MacAleenan who is clinical assessment manager at the Irish Medicines Board and also the medical devices lead person for the authority.  We are grateful for the opportunity to update the joint committee, as requested, on the PIP breast implant and the DePuy ASR hip recall issues.  In addition, we would like to take the opportunity to provide committee members with an overview of the implementation of the European Commission&rsquo;s joint plan for immediate action on medical devices which was put in place in response to these crises.  Members may recall that in September we provided an update on the PIP breast implant issue.  We advised that we anticipated imminent publication of the report from the European scientific committee on emerging and newly identified health risks - its second comprehensive review of these implants.  The SCHENIHR committee's report, published on 29 October, states:<blockquote><br \/><font color=\"#004080\"> T<\/font>here is currently no convincing medical, toxicological or other data to justify removal of intact PIP implants as a precautionary approach.  Implant removal in the absence of malfunction may be considered for women who are experiencing significant anxiety because they have a PIP breast implant.  However, the decision to remove an intact PIP implant for this reason should be based on an individual assessment of the woman's condition by her surgeon or other treating physician after consultation.<\/blockquote>The SCENIHR opinion correlates with the advice of the IMB and the Department of Health to the women affected that &quot;there is no current evidence of health risks associated with PIP implants and concerned women should seek clinical advice from their GP or surgeon&quot;.<\/p><p>  In 2012 and, more recently, September 2013 we outlined to the committee the details of the worldwide recall of DePuy ASR and ASR XL hip implants.  The recall of these products was based on data from the National Joint Registry of England and Wales which showed higher than expected implant revision rates at five years.  At the time of our update, approximately 3,500 ASR hips had been implanted in Ireland.  The IMB has since worked closely with the HSE and Irish orthopaedic surgeons on the recommendations for individual patient follow-up.  When we met the committee in July 2012, the HSE had outlined that at the time 96% of patients had attended review appointments and over 350 had had revision surgery, with another 166 scheduled for surgery.  We understand all patients have been reviewed and the HSE representatives will give details of updated figures for revision surgeries.<\/p><p>  The IMB continues to assess the reported incidents received and analyse data generated from revisions, joint registry data, as well as from clinical studies.  Independent analysis of explanted devices which have been returned for investigation is being conducted in the United Kingdom at the London Implant Retrieval Centre.  The ASR recall experience has been central to wider international discussions on metal on metal implants.  The research in this area suggests increased revision rates associated with large diameter-head metal on metal hip implants.  Mechanical wear of an implant is experienced with all types of hip replacement implant over time, as the femoral head and acetabular cup component surfaces rotate against each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013121000003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386696300,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.

I wish to briefly touch on one or two issues.  On the issue of the defective devices, a system know as RAPEX was set up under the toys directive, which provides that if a defective item is identified in a country, that country has an obligation to notify the other 27 member states.  The RAPEX system is a fast-track procedure for ensuring the market becomes aware of defective toys.  Is a similar procedure or structure available or in place in respect of medical devices?<\/p><p>  My second question relates to the Irish Medical Devices Association.  Following a meeting of 27 November 2012, more than 12 months ago, it wrote to the Irish permanent representative at the time and expressed concern that the product scrutiny as structured in the Commission proposal would not increase patient safety.  It expressed that concern in 2012.  What is its position on the Commission's proposal and what is being talked about among the member states?  Is the medical devices industry happy with the progress that is being made or does it still have some concerns that need to be dealt with?  We are taking those concerns on board as we have a large number of people employed in the medical devices industry.  The delegates may have touched on this but I would like further clarification.<\/p><p>  The third issue on which I wish to touch is that of insurance.  It comes back to the issue of breast implants.  I introduced a Private Members' Bill that provided for placing an obligation on all people involved in medicine to have adequate insurance.  The Department intends to move forward with that proposed legislation over the next six to nine months.  On the current structure in place covering medical devices, the people involved in plastic surgery in Ireland, in particular Peter Meagher, are concerned about the number of people coming from abroad, providing a service and not having adequate cover.  They are also concerned that we do not have the power to close the operations of those practitioners if they are not providing a structured service.  They carry out the procedure but provide no backup support in the event of anything going wrong and, as a result, our health service has to deal with those difficulties afterwards.  How far advanced are we in ensuring that in respect of everyone who provides medical care in this country - we are talking about the use of medical devices - there is a structure in place and adequate insurance cover and supervision in place?  I understand the legislation in place does not cover all that area.

First, I made it very clear the previous times I appeared before the committee that as the competent authority for patient safety we were very unhappy with the situation with regard to medical devices at that time and how pre-market approval was operating.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, it suffered a severe dent.  Two things happened in response to that: one is the proposal for the new legislation, and the other is what is happening, as I have described, under the joint plan.<\/p><p>  Mr. Barron has captured the issues on the legislation.  In essence, we rely on the policy lead from the Department and it is still early days for the proposals.  Much of what is required is captured in the legislation.  To respond to the question about the scrutiny mechanism, it was in the Commission's proposal, which was that a certain percentage of files that would be looked at by the notified bodies would also be examined by another committee as a separate pair of eyes.  The proposal as I understand it from the ENVI committee is that there is the scrutiny mechanism and a centralised committee looking at all high-risk devices.  We still do not know where that debate will end.<\/p><p>  From a competent authority perspective, whatever the outcome is along those lines that would increase protection for patients, that would be perfectly okay with us, and we will work within that system.  There will be resource implications, but we will work within it.  In the certain knowledge that legislation takes time, we are trying to make real progress on the joint plan in the meantime.  Since we last met, as I described, all this stuff has been going on around joint assessments of the notified bodies.  We identified before that the big weakness in the pre-market piece was the lack of consistency across notified bodies across Europe.  As I said in the note, up to 20 countries have now had visitations.  The joint visitation consists of the Commission, the national competent authority and experts from other competent authorities.  It is a very rigorous review of the approach of the national authority and the notified body.  They have targeted first of all the notified bodies involved with high-risk or class 3 devices.  That has worked very well and progress has been made during the second half of this year, and a legislative basis is being provided now by the Commission to make that mandatory, which is very helpful.<\/p><p>  With regard to unannounced inspections, the answer is that they are under way.  Our own notified body, the NSAI, is doing that, and it is happening across Europe.  With regard to the RAPEX system, we are also involved with cosmetics and others are involved with food in other areas, and the RAPEX system is in place for that.  The Commission has in place a similar system for medical devices, which it is currently suggesting will remain as the system.  It is similar to RAPEX but it has a different title and it operates in a different way, but it means that if an issue is notified in a country it will be disseminated throughout the rest of the competent authorities via this process.<\/p><p>  I will make a quick comment on insurance.  The new proposals make provision for a manufacturer's liability if the manufacturer goes bankrupt.  It would have applied, for example, in the PIP case.  There is also a requirement in the proposal for notified bodies to have specific insurance to cover their liabilities.  The issue of health professionals such as surgeons does not seem to be addressed in the current proposal.  The fundamental issues raised in the question about insurance are captured in the current Commission proposal.  They are the main questions to which I needed to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013121000006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1386697500,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Unannounced scrutiny has been set up, but where does that leave us in terms of imported products?
