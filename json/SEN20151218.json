That debate was most useful and interesting, even if somewhat prolonged.  We got through many of the issues the Minister faces in ensuring this vital part of the economy operates efficiently.  It is in that context that amendment No. 1 is proposed.  It deals with ministerial directives.  My concern is that the general powers of direction of the Minister should include a power to address the matters raised by the Competition Authority.  My fear is that this will not happen unless the Minister makes it happen in view of his overall responsibility for the efficient and economical operation of ports.  People who have protections and restrictive practices get settled in their ways and are unlikely to agree to give them up.  I have in mind the previous system in which airlines used to operate in Europe.  It was a nice cartel in which they charged the same fares and had no new entrants.  It took pressure from the outside to change that.<\/p><p>I took from the website the Minister's correspondence with the chair of the Competition Authority dated 11 August 2014 addressing the leasing and licensing of Dublin lo-lo terminals and the recommendation on stevedore licensing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sean D.

The purpose is to strengthen the Minister's hand in ensuring that we have a port sector that operates efficiently.  As the Minister knows, the Competition Authority found there was not much scope for inter-port competition between different ports, but it felt we had neglected the issue of competition within a port.

I am not accepting the amendment because I am confident that the Minister of the day already has sufficient powers to deal with the issues the Senators have referred to.  I anchor this in the report from the Competition Authority, which has broadly endorsed the policy being delivered through the Bill and through the overall national ports policy.<\/p> <p>Regarding the issuing of directions, I must recognise at all times that the boards of directors of the ports, and indeed the local authorities themselves, are autonomous units, particularly for those ports that are transitioned into the local authorities.  As companies they will still have boards of directors who will have commercial duties.  As Minister, it is not my role to issue directions to get involved in the commercial operation of a port.  That said, I believe I have sufficient power to deal with the matters that Senators Barrett and Craughwell have outlined.  My departmental officials may at any time require or request information from ports about the implementation of the recommendations of the Competition Authority's report.  In addition, section 40 of the Bill introduces a new statutory power requiring the port companies to be accountable to the Oireachtas joint committee with responsibility for transport policy.  The committee members will be able to play a role in investigating the implementation of the Competition Authority's policy.  For those two reasons, I believe there is sufficient power in place to deal with the implementation of the report.

I will not be pressing the amendment.<\/p> <p>It has to be referred somewhere - perhaps the Economic Management Council of the four senior Ministers.  I do not envisage these reforms being made unless there is pressure somewhere else.  I used to serve as a Government representative on the National Economic and Social Council; I wonder if it can do anything.  I am not satisfied about how Competition Authority recommendations are being set aside.  It is more than ten years since it recommended the abolition of the conveyancing monopoly, yet that is still there and it has survived the recent Legal Services Bill that was before the House.  The problem at those ports is that the insiders are quite happy and it needs an outsider to shake them up in some way.  I would be delighted to think that the Oireachtas committees could instruct Dublin Port and the other ports that have these restrictive practices to get their act together.  They were not allowed because of the Stock Exchange takeover rules, but they never properly discussed the IAG takeover of Aer Lingus, which results in a monopoly over the 1.6 million passengers on the Dublin to Heathrow route.  There was universal scepticism at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications about postcodes, and our view was endorsed by the Comptroller and Auditor General, given that &euro;38 million was spent on a postcode system that hardly anybody uses.  The committee was unanimous in its opposition, but we are not allowed to take votes.  I do not share the Minister's optimism.  There is no evidence that people take a blind bit of notice the views of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  On two important issues it proved to be toothless.  In one it was not allowed any say at all, and in the other it was right but the policy proceeded anyway and &euro;38 million was spent.<\/p> <p>I do not envisage operators of restrictive practices coming out with their hands up and saying, \"The Competition Authority report is quite right.  We must give up the hoary old restrictive practices.\"  It will be an agenda item for the next Government and the next Oireachtas.  How do we reform institutions?  This one was obviously dominated by getting the finances into order.  That has been a success and everybody commends the Government on that.  However, many of the institutions of the permanent government are not working and need prodding from the elected representatives.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

Amendment No. 3 proposes the deletion of paragraphs (b) and (c), which would no longer be required.<\/p><p>As the Minister did, I have taken the time to consult on this.  I have consulted a number of harbour masters around the country.  They are not happy that they are being excluded from the board.  Depending on the board, in some cases the word &quot;may&quot; has been interpreted as meaning that they can attend all board meetings, save those board meetings that discuss their terms and conditions of employment, pay, etc.  However, it is totally unacceptable to have a harbour board - or, as Senator Barrett put it, a group of landlubbers - meeting in a room while the mariner sits outside the door with his cap in his hand waiting to be called in.  In one case in Foynes, the harbour master could have saved the State &euro;2 million.  The Minister will recall that in Foynes the chief executive officer advised the port authority - his board - that he needed a vessel on standby as a pilot.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

This boat was leased to the authority, costing &euro;51,667.50 in the first year, and the payments went on and on.  It ended in the chief executive officer being suspended from office.  Ultimately, the case went to the courts and the State footed a bill of &euro;2 million, comprising severance for the chief executive, his legal costs and the State's legal costs.  Had the harbour master been at that meeting, he would have been able to tell the board the port already had a second pilot ship and did not need a third one.<\/p><p>We cannot have a situation where the harbour master, the person who is statutorily charged and has statutory duties similar only to those found in the Attorney General, firemen and other such important offices, is excluded from the decision-making process that takes place in every harbour around the country.  There are harbour masters watching this debate today and they are deeply concerned.  Some of the harbour masters we have in this country are strong personalities who would ensure they attended every single meeting of the board.  Others, who may not be so strong in the future or who are appointed by some chief executive officer, may in some way feel subservient and that they cannot exercise their right to attend.<\/p><p>If the Minister is not going to accept the amendment, will he place on the record of the House the same assurances placed on the record of the House by Deputy Eamon Gilmore when he brought the 1996 Act in?  They were that under this section of the Act, \"may\" means they can attend every board meeting, save those meetings that deal with their salary and conditions of employment.  It is unthinkable that a harbour board would meet without having the expert advice of the chief mariner of the location.  It is totally unacceptable not to have \"shall\" in the section but if the Minister is not going to accept that, will he at least give the assurance that the harbour master can attend all meetings, save those that deal with his terms and conditions of employment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121800002#B01100","speaker":"1196","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1450432800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I disagree with what Senator Craughwell stated.

It would be a very poor and ill-advised board that, if it were dealing with matters that would require the attendance of the harbour master, would not invite the harbour master to such a meeting.  There is no necessity to change the wording in this section to \"shall\".  The current wording of \"may\" should suffice.

This is redundant as far as the Leader is concerned but for the rest of us, I will quote from the website of the International Harbour Masters Association:<\/p><blockquote>Harbour Masters require a variety of skills as well as specialised knowledge and understanding.  Traditionally Harbour Masters have a marine background and have usually served in a senior capacity at sea.  Many have a STCW Master&rsquo;s certificate of competency and many have served as master of a ship.  Further, Harbour Masters may also develop skills around the management of personnel, environmental management, business development and others as part of their continuous professional development.<br \/><br \/>Harbour Masters will also be involved in monitoring the training and qualifications of their employees and other service providers in the port, and play a vital role in developing the next generation of port professionals including their deputies.<\/blockquote> <p>Another section of the website states:<\/p><blockquote>Today&rsquo;s Harbour Master is increasingly involved in the day to day management of port operations beyond the technical and statutory role of the Harbour Master.  Increased involvement and greater responsibility in the operational and commercial business of a port, beyond the pure maritime elements, is another area of activity for many Harbour Masters.<\/blockquote> <p>This is a valuable person to have around.  It is in the tradition of worker directors.  We are going to move ports under the control of county councils, which will, in many cases, know very little about running a port, which is a pretty specialised business, as we have seen.  We read into the record the last day the success of business in the four major ports, namely, Foynes, Cork, Dublin, the dominant one, and Rosslare.  The next layer of ports makes about &euro;0.5 million profit per year.  We are pretty good at these businesses.  Let us keep the expertise there in the new structure.

If the board, which is charged with running the harbour, needs the harbour master's expertise in the meeting, it may request the harbour master's presence, as the Leader pointed out.  An example of such a procedure was that Jos&eacute; Mourinho was until yesterday employed by the board of Chelsea Football Club.  If it needed him to come to discuss team matters, that was it - he came to the meeting.  The board has to make a decision.  There may be a conflict of interest if the harbour master is a sitting member of the board.  The Minister has got it right.  It is not like the harbour master would live in outer Mongolia.<\/p> <p>Also, Senator Barrett spoke, in relation to the CEO, about appointing landlubbers to run one.

Is it at the discretion of the chief executive of the local authority to bring them on board in the interim?  The board would revert to eight people when the new system is up and running.  We currently have very competent local authority councillors on the board in the likes of D&uacute;n Laoghaire and various other places.  What would be their position?  There are legal, accountancy and other qualifications and those competencies are available in the council chamber through councillors.  What is the position of councillors?  The councillors have brought in those competencies.  Senator O'Neill spoke about how local knowledge is so important and I agree with him.  When we are elected as public representatives, we do not grow horns.  We still have competencies in the chamber.<br\/><br\/>Local councillors are not barred from local enterprise offices, LEOs, which deal with every enterprise in the various counties.  The ports are an enterprise and we are missing the boat big time by barring local councillors from the boards of harbours.  We have seen good ideas coming from local councillors on the boards of the ports that they sat on previously.  Why are they being barred now?  Is there any way that the Minister can change this?  Perhaps he can allow them to apply in the public process, the same as everybody else.  There are competencies in councils, including legal and accountancy skills, as somebody wrote in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>last week, and it has seen major change as a result.

I would be very happy to get into it at the appropriate point again.  With respect to harbour masters, I will begin by outlining where I agree with the two Senators and, conversely, where I disagree with them.  I agree on the points regarding the expertise and knowledge that harbour masters have.  I have seen this when I visited many ports and in meeting the boards of ports.  I completely disagree with the Senators on the description offered, perhaps flippantly, in describing the boards of ports as &quot;landlubbers&quot;.  They are anything but that.  Engaging with the boards of port companies in the way that I have, I know it may be true to say that some members may not have the maritime experience that the chief executive or other directors might have.  The reason for that is the broader set of skills relating to financial or governance matters that boards of directors must have.  We must have a broad set of skills and experiences represented on the board.  I stated when I met the board of the Drogheda port last Monday that the collective experience on the board has a deep appreciation of all the maritime issues that a port might be facing and all the trading and operational matters that are relevant to the future of the port.<\/p><p>The Senators made the point about the importance of harbour masters and I have stated that I agree with that point.  The key point on the amendment is that there is nothing in the Bill changing the current status of harbour masters and their relationship with the board.  We are not changing that at all.  The role that harbour masters currently have <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the board of directors is unchanged in any way with the passage of this Bill.  Notably, section 37 of the 1996 Act, which requires every company to employ a harbour master, and section 17 of the Act, which allows for their attendance at board meetings, is unchanged by the passage of this Bill.<\/p><p>I would have been open to accepting the amendment if anything in the Bill changed the current relationship between harbour masters and boards.  If any change was proposed or could happen in this Bill, there would be a case for looking at the amendment.  I accept that the participation of harbour masters in board meetings is very valuable.  When I met boards of port companies, in many cases the harbour masters were there and took part in our discussions.  There is nothing in this Bill that changes the relationship about which the Senator is concerned, and that is the reason I am not in a position to accept the amendment.<\/p><p>The current relationship between harbour masters and boards works well and appears to be successful in allowing our ports to trade successfully.  As a result and because the relationship is underpinned by current law, which is in no way changed by the passage of this Bill, I accept the strong and positive intention behind the amendment but it would not improve the operation of our ports.  It is for these reasons that I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121800002#D00600","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1450432800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply but I ask him to clarify one or two points.  First and foremost, the role of the harbour master is unique in that they are an arm of the State.  They are charged with the protection of the State's assets and particularly with respect to the environment and the security of shipping lanes under their control.  In addition, I wonder if there is any impediment to appointing the harbour master as a worker director to the board.  The Minister pointed out the excellent example of the County Louth port where the harbour master attends all the board meetings.  One could also have mentioned the Limerick harbour board; as far as I recall, in the past the harbour master was specifically instructed not to attend board meetings.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

On the first, I accept they have a unique and important role to play in the operation of ports, particularly in respect of navigational safety and maintenance of the ports themselves.  Second, there is no impediment to their appointment as worker directors.<\/p> <p>On the third question about whether it would be preferable that the harbour master be present in the room for board meetings, I am not in a position to offer direction or guidance to the directors of ports companies regarding what they should do on this matter, although I fully respect where the Senator is coming from on this.  If I as Minister, or the local authority when it takes over my role in this regard, appoint directors to companies, we have to allow them to do their work.  We have to accept that they are independent directors of companies that are recognised in company law as independent.  While it makes sense that the harbour masters should be present for discussions on the operation and safety of the port, my experience is that they are present.  I cannot recall a discussion I have had with a port company about matters such as infrastructure or safety from which the harbour master was in any way excluded.  In many cases, he or she has participated as strongly in the discussion as the chief executive officer of the port company, because he or she has such appreciation of what goes on in the port.<\/p> <p>I accept how fundamental harbour masters are to the operation of ports but if I say a board of directors has to be in place because the company still exists, I have to respect their independence, which I do.  We all know the difficulty we get into when we begin to interfere with their work and, for those reasons, it is, therefore, difficult for me to issue a directive to them regarding what they should do on any operational matter.  I have the ability to issue directives to them on national ports policy and on any matter I am advised by my Department might jeopardise the ability of the port to deal with operational safety or navigational matters.  Those are the main powers open to me.  While it is important that the harbour master be present for discussions relevant to the operation of the harbour, I have to respect the independence of the board of directors and allow them to make judgments as they see fit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121800002#E00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1450432800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121800002#E00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1450432800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>It is, with some reservation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121800002#E00400","speaker":"1196"},{"type":"vote","time":1450432800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 4; N\u00edl, 13.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Sean D.

Obviously, we have had a lot of engagement on this and a number of other amendments I am accepting that will strengthen the Bill regarding the protection of children and ensure children's rights are well respected in what is very often a very difficult context for children and families.

However, I wish to speak to only two of them, one of which is amendment No. 23.  My concerns are also expressed by NGOs and groups such as the Irish Refugee Council, the Migrant Rights Centre and Nasc.  The proposed section 20(1)(e) states an immigration officer or member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may arrest an applicant without warrant if that officer or member suspects, with reasonable cause, that the applicant has acted or intends to act in a manner that would undermine the system for granting persons international protection in the State or any arrangement relating to the common travel area.<\/p> <p>The changes, especially the one relating to \"the system for granting persons international protection\", comprise a significant and unwarranted amendment to the powers of immigration officers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The phrase \"has acted or intends to act\", coupled with the phrase \"the system for granting persons international protection\", is exceptionally vague and incapable of any form of certainty such that it could leaves any person who applies for refugee status or subsidiary protection liable to arrest without a warrant.  It is unclear why this change has been made but it is assumed that, because of the phrase \"any arrangement relating to the Common Travel Area\", it is aimed at people coming from the United Kingdom through the North.  This has been effected because of the increase in the number of young Pakistani men coming from the United Kingdom and claiming asylum.  It is possible that, when considered with section 77, it is intended to be a catchall to give the authorities the power to prevent or interfere with a protection claim should the person gain entry to the State.  Whatever the intention behind the amendment, it should not be added to the reasons a person can be arrested without warrant.  It can undermine the very right to submit a protection application, even one that the authorities might deem to be without merit, and it has no place in an international protection system.  Importantly, it also represents an arbitrary ground for detention leading to a potential violation of ones right to liberty, which is a core human right.  The UNHCR guidelines on detention state clearly that detention must not be discriminatory or arbitrary.  Therefore, the right to asylum must be respected at all times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121800002#J00400","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1450432800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and her officials for their engagement and taking on board my comments in the Seanad.

Obviously, the world is not ideal and perfect but the Minister has certainly strengthened children's rights within this Bill.<\/p> <p>There are matters outside the remit of this Bill that were in the Government working group report on the protection process.  These include the proposal to increase the weekly payment for children.  There has been no change in 16 years.  While it is outside the scope of the legislation, it is a matter that I believe is wrong leading up to Christmas.  The remit of the Ombudsman for Children should be extended.  As the Minister knows, Ireland is to be before the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child on 14 January.  This will be a highlight issue for that committee if Ireland has not moved on it.

With regard to detention and the section about which Senator David Cullinane is concerned, let me review what is in the section.  An immigration officer or member of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may arrest an applicant without warrant if that officer or member suspects, with reasonable cause, that the applicant has acted in one of the ways listed.  The international circumstances have to be taken into account, both in terms of security and ensuring those who enter our country are genuine refugees.  This is a very stark issue at present.  Obviously, there is a considerable humanitarian crisis.  We have responded as a country by taking 4,000 individuals over two years.  These are mostly people who would clearly be deemed to be refugees because many of them are fleeing conflict in Syria.  The recognition rate of such refugees is approximately 80% to 85%.  That is the general position of the Government on the humanitarian crisis.  Obviously, this is an ongoing problem and it will be discussed at various European Council meetings over the coming months.<\/p> <p>The section is about people who would pose a threat to public security or order in the State, who have committed a serious non-political crime outside the State, who have not made reasonable efforts to establish their identity, or who have acted or intends to act in a manner that would undermine the system for granting persons international protection in the State.  These are very serious issues.  This is about the abuse of the system and people who would abuse it.  Not recognising this is doing a disservice to genuine refugees, who deserve to get the best possible service from the State.  Importantly, a person detained under the section \"shall, as soon as practicable, be brought before a judge of the District Court assigned to the District Court district in which the person is being detained\".  There is an automatic provision built into the Bill that a District Court judge has to hear the case in such circumstances.  That is a very substantial next stage.  The Senator's concern is about the abuse of the measure or its application to a particular category of persons.  We know there are people who will abuse the system &mdash; that is very clear &mdash; so the safeguard involving the District Court is important.  What we are including in the Bill is reasonable in terms of a state safeguarding its international protection system.  There are other safeguards also.  The legislation adds further appropriate reasons a person may be arrested if he is exploiting or abusing the common travel area.  We know of the debate that is occurring internationally on this.  This is a very appropriate measure.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator van Turnhout for recognising the way in which we have dealt with the protection of children in the Bill.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is an area which highlights very challenging issues and decisions.

The amendment also provides that the Minister shall prescribe the period following a decision of the tribunal for the purposes of the applicant submitting such new information in respect of the review.   This allows the Minister to take account of new information that may emerge and be brought to the Minister's attention.

Such a person can be refused leave to land, irrespective of whether or not the person intends to make an application for international protection.

It is assumed that approximately 85% of those in the relocation programme will be deemed to be refugees.  In terms of those who are not, a point also emphasised at European level, the safe countries of origin list is part of the intention to have a balanced migration policy to ensure we can deal effectively with it.<\/p> <p>The humanitarian issues are enormous regarding the movement of refugees from places of conflict.  We are complying fully with European and international law as to how we assess and deal with those seeking international protection.  The Government considers it extremely important that we do that and take full account of the humanitarian issues but also of the possibility of people being subject to persecution in other countries and who meet the criteria outlined for international protection.  It is important they will be dealt with in the most humane and effective way.  However, if people are exploiting this system, we need to be conscious of that too and deal with that in the right way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015121800002#L01900","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1450432800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>On amendment No. 104, our concerns are not about preventing exploitation or abuse of the system.  We all want to ensure there are proper protections in place.  We have to protect our borders, sovereignty and have an immigration system in place.  The point is that it has to be fair, robust, along with safeguards built into it for those seeking asylum.  Most importantly, we have to live up to our obligations under international, UN, EU, domestic law and, crucially, the Charter of Fundamental Rights.<\/p> <p>The Irish Refugee Council has called amendment No. 104 a shocking provision, which fundamentally undermines not only the right to asylum as guaranteed under the Charter of Fundamental Rights but the Dublin III regulation which also governs the allocation of member states&rsquo; responsibility for the examination of an application for international protection.  This a broad extension of the grounds for refusing leave to land which, in the Irish Refugee Council&rsquo;s opinion, raises serious concerns that people seeking protection are denied even entry into the State.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Cullinane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It also extends way beyond and is disproportionate to the objective to be achieved, which is, as I stated earlier, state sovereignty over one's borders, in light of the fact that the Bill already provides for inadmissibility provisions under section 21, and the Dublin III regulation referred to earlier would also be applicable in such circumstances.  Relevant rights that may be violated under this new provision include: the right to asylum; the right to an effective remedy; the right to equality before the law and non-discrimination; the prohibition on collective expulsions relating to Article 19 of the charter; and the prohibition on non-<i>refoulement<\/i>.  It may also violate the right to good administration, which is Article 41 of the charter, as there are no clear procedural safeguards allowing the opportunity, for example, for a person to be heard before being denied entry to the State.<br\/><br\/>These are concerns not just from us in Sinn F&eacute;in.  As I stated earlier, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, also share these concerns.  We raise these issues not because we do not want the Minister to put in place proper protection for the State or we want people to be able to abuse or exploit the system, as we must ensure that does not happen.  We must close any potential loopholes and the system must be robust.  Nevertheless, it must also be fair.  In circumstances where we do not see it being fair, we have a responsibility to call it as such, which is what we are doing with this amendment.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the issue and listen to the views of the NGOs that have lobbied all of us on this and a number of other amendments.<br\/><br\/>I only speak to two amendments as I felt these are the most contentious and warrant more scrutiny.

There is a debate trying to put in place a protection system that would be effective for the thousands of migrants moving into Europe now.  There is much discussion about that.  The countries in the Schengen area want to protect the integrity of their borders rather than seeing countries putting up walls and retreating on the issue of free movement.<\/p> <p>It is very important to recognise the point that every day, people probably come to our airports and ports who do not have a right to come to the country.  It is equally important to recognise that thousands of people come to the country every year with work visas and who are given the opportunity to work here.  Just last week, we had a citizenship ceremony for several thousand people who obeyed all the rules and reached all the criteria.  It is very important that we recognise diversity and we have many legal means to arrive in Ireland.  It is a key feature of asylum and dealing with the refugee crisis in Europe that we would increase the legal means for people to enter Europe, whether it is from Africa or other countries.  This is an area that needs more focus.<\/p> <p>Equally, if people are exploiting the system we must recognise that and be clear about it.  No person will be refused entry to the State where it is clear there is a genuine need for protection.  The amendment refers to the previous point, where we will take steps to protect the integrity of the common travel area.  Everybody in the country wants to protect the integrity of the common travel area as it is very important.  If it is being undermined or it is the case that people could have applied for asylum, for example, in the UK and it is appropriate that they do so, we have an obligation as a country to maintain the integrity of the common travel area.  That is what is intended by this provision.  Taking account of all the issues I mentioned, including the number of people who on a daily basis may try to gain entry illegally - it is a recorded fact that several thousand are doing so - we can contrast the numbers of people who may enter the country legally and who are welcomed.  We can see the diversity in our country, which adds to the State in a variety of ways.
