Sadly, it seems to be part of NAMA's pattern.  We can put that to them.  We certainly need time to study the statements, but I think the representatives from NAMA need to understand that as a consequence of their approach this will not be their final appearance before the committee.  There is no doubt in my mind that we will need them to come before us again.  Deputy Cullinane and I had many questions that we wished to put them.

They need to understand that that is absolutely not the case.  This examination will be finished when it is complete and when we have answers to all of the pertinent questions.

I do not say we should adjourn today but we are on the back foot because we have not had time to assimilate the information, go through it, make notes and make bullet points.

The problem for this committee is that it is not the first time that we have received opening statements very late, so if we cancel meetings every time that happens we will very rarely get business done because, as has been said, from their perspective, they took a decision not to furnish us with the information.  Perhaps they thought it would be leaked to the media, but that is no justification for it.  It is reasonable for us to have a recess, perhaps until after 10 a.m., but we need to meet them today.

We will put them on notice that due to the short notice if we do not get finished today it is not our responsibility.  We will move on then.  We will commence the main business shortly.<\/p> <p>  The first item of correspondence is 189B (i) to (iv), from Niamh O'Donoghue, Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection, providing follow-up information to the committee from our meeting in October.  Is that noted, agreed and published?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is 190B, correspondence from Mr. Mark Curran, in the Garda Commissioner's office responding to a query from the committee in relation to our hearings on NAMA's sale of Project Eagle.  I just wanted to have the letter.  Essentially, we wrote to the Garda Commissioner to find out if there was any issue in relation to inviting any particular witnesses.  He concluded by saying it was appreciated that the committee had very real concerns that an appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts may prejudice ongoing criminal investigations in other jurisdictions.  In that regard, any public questioning of an individual about matters which may form part of a criminal investigation in any jurisdiction has the potential to interfere with that investigation and subsequent due process.  I am just putting that on record.  We are noting the letter.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is 192B.  It is correspondence from Mr. Ronnie Hanna declining an invitation to attend, principally because of concerns regarding the ongoing investigation.  Essentially, he made two remarks - one is he has a duty of confidentiality still to NAMA which he has not been released from and, second, because of the investigation by the NCA-PSNI he believes, respectfully - he means no discourtesy to this committee, he is refusing to attend.  We will note that.<\/p> <p>  The next item is a letter from Mr. David Meissels, managing director at Fortress Investment group, declining an invitation to appear before the committee  Essentially, he said his company was the unsuccessful bidder and investigations are ongoing on Project Eagle.  He previously submitted written responses in detail and he, respectfully, declines the invitation to send a representative to the public meeting.  We will note that as well and publish it.<\/p> <p>  Then we have correspondence from Peter Robinson.  He said that he understands the constitutional reasons he is not answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts and it is complicated by the fact that the NCA inquiry in Northern Ireland is ongoing.  He gave evidence to the Northern Ireland committee.  He recognises there are some similarities between our remit and that of the committee in Northern Ireland and he attaches a copy of the statement he made to that committee.  He said that if we want his views on any specific issue we can write to the e-mail address given and he will be happy to provide a response.  I take that to mean in writing.<\/p> <p>  We will publish his statement, even though it is already published in Northern Ireland.  Much of the statement he made to the Northern Ireland committee flatly contradicts the evidence of Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, who said he was not in the loop.  We will adjudicate on that but we are not adjudicating on it now.  Martin McGuinness got the opportunity to give his point of view in public and the letter from Mr. Robinson flatly contradicts a number of the statements made by him.  We will have to consider those issues in drafting our report.  Neither individual is present now so we will not discuss it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#C01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>We will need to do that but could I just note at this point that Mr. Robinson has the opportunity to come before the committee to have his evidence tested.

On an ongoing basis we have been sending letters to NAMA with a series of questions.  We have got back a series of letters every week and one happened to arrive this morning.  There are lots of letters in the system.  They are not specific to today's meeting.  The reply is in response to questions we have submitted previously.  People might want an opportunity to raise some of these issues and follow them up.  NAMA has been sending us other correspondence on a weekly basis that is in our file.

As for Waterford Institute of Technology, a qualified report.  The institute has consolidated results of its campus companies for the first time in 2013 and 2014.  Attention is drawn to the fact that the group had an accumulated deficit of &euro;15.1 million on 31 August 2014.  The audit committee did not issue an annual report for 2013-14 to the institute's governing body until June 2015.  There was a situation where some companies in the institute were not consolidated into the overall accounts.

We have also met members of the NAMA board at the time; the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and his officials; Mr. Brian Rowntree, who is a former member of NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC; the deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland; the chief operating officer of Cerberus Capital Management, which is the investment firm that bought Project Eagle; and Mr. Patrick Long, who is the managing director of Lazard, which is the company that acted as adviser to NAMA in the loan sale.  We have received detailed correspondence from other individuals and that has been put on the record as well.<\/p><p>I welcome to today's meeting Mr. Frank Daly, who is the chairman of NAMA; Mr. Brendan McDonagh, who is its chief executive; Mr. John Coleman, who is its chief financial officer; Ms Aideen O&rsquo;Reilly, who is its head of legal affairs; Mr. Alan Stewart, who is its senior divisional solicitor; and Mr. John Collison, who is its head of asset recovery.  We are also joined by Mr. David Linehan, who is the NAMA liaison officer in the shareholding unit of the Department of Finance.  As I have mentioned, the Comptroller and Auditor General is also in attendance.  I thank Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh for their co-operation, despite this morning's suspension.  We have written to NAMA on behalf of the committee every week, sometimes with six questions and sometimes with 36 questions.  Extensive correspondence has come back to us on a staged basis.  I hope we will reach the end of that process in the next week or two.  I acknowledge that we have received a great deal of documentation.  A little part of it can be seen in the files beside me.  A great deal of work has been put into this process by NAMA.<\/p><p>I remind members and those in the public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.  I have to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such a policy.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh to make their opening statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#L00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I will begin by addressing an issue which, in my view, is at the core of the debate about whether the best price reasonably achievable for Project Eagle in the first quarter of 2014 was in fact achieved.  There no longer appears to be any dispute about the appropriate discount rate that should have been used for deriving the market value for a loan portfolio such as Project Eagle in late 2013 and early 2014.  There now appears to be general acceptance that the market would have discounted the cash flows in this portfolio at a rate in the range of 10% to 15%.  This has been our position all along and it has been supported by a number of market experts.  By that criterion, it is reasonable to contend that &pound;1.3 billion was in the ballpark of what a buyer would expect to pay for this portfolio.  The position of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as recently articulated to this committee, appears to be that he accepts that a discount rate of 10% to 15% was indeed appropriate for determining the market value of the Project Eagle portfolio in the context of a loan sale.  If I understand his position correctly, he is saying that this higher discount rate would have been appropriate for potential buyers of the portfolio but not for NAMA as the seller.  A 5.5% discount rate may indeed have been appropriate for estimating the accounting value of the portfolio, but it was not appropriate for estimating its fair value, which is the best proxy for market value, and it certainly was not appropriate for assessing the market value of Project Eagle.<\/p> <p>  The board made a strategic decision in 2014 to sell the Project Eagle portfolio once that option became available.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has said he has no view on this strategic decision.  Up to late 2013, in the absence of any alternative strategic option, the default option had been to dispose of the underlying collateral of the Northern Ireland debtors on a piecemeal basis up to 2020.  From NAMA's perspective, and indeed from the perspective of any commercial entity, the report's position on the discount rate does not make commercial sense for reasons I will set out.  First, there was a major restriction on commercial flexibility.  The report's position on the discount rate would rule out the sale of any loan portfolio comprised of granular, multi-debtor and lower value assets.  Quite frankly, the market would never buy these portfolios at a 5.5% discount rate.  There would always be an unbridgeable gap between the market&rsquo;s valuation of a granular loan portfolio and NAMA's valuation of it.  In effect, this would mean that NAMA could never sell these portfolios and therefore, the strategic option of locking in their market value upfront when the opportunity arose could never be utilised.  At the meeting of this committee on 29 September last, we drew attention to the fact that we were advised by UBS that a 10% discount rate was appropriate for Project Tower, a better portfolio than Project Eagle which was launched to the market at the same time in the first quarter of 2014.<\/p><p>In Project Arrow, a portfolio with similar characteristics to Project Eagle, Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield advised in mid-2015 that a 15% discount rate was appropriate.  If one accepts the report's position, the market's view of a portfolio's valuation is irrelevant if it does not match a valuation based on a 5.5% discount rate.  That, in effect, would rule out all but a handful of loan sales.<\/p><p> Reason No. 2 is based on our statutory commercial mandate.  Given that NAMA has been tasked by the Oireachtas to operate on a commercial and expeditious basis, the report's view that NAMA cannot apply a market discount rate to its loan portfolios is simply not commercially feasible for NAMA if it is to fulfil its statutory mandate under section 10 of the NAMA Act.  Had we adopted such an interpretation, it is difficult to see how we could have deleveraged our overall portfolio to the extent that we have done over the past three years.  Thus, instead of dealing with a residual senior debt burden of &euro;3.6 billion, or 12% of the original &euro;30.2 billion as of today, we would be dealing with a multiple of that residual amount and facing into the major uncertainties that have emerged, both for property markets and for the global economy over recent months.<\/p><p> NAMA's strategy was set out in 2010.  It was to be an orderly and phased disposal but we stated that we would be alert and ready to avail of market opportunities as they arose.  If we had not lived up to our promise I am satisfied that, instead of discussing the Project Eagle sale, we would now be appearing before this committee and having to explain why we had failed to take advantage of the favourable and unprecedented market opportunities and the influx of capital that became available over the past three years.  Irish taxpayers would rightly be concerned as to why they were still left with a major contingent liability exposure backed by property in Ireland and elsewhere.  This report takes no account whatsoever of these major and very real strategic considerations.<\/p><p> Matter No. 3 is the prospect of a long-term piecemeal workout.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has stated that he considers it beyond his remit to comment on the strategic and commercial rationale underpinning the decision to sell the loan portfolio.  It may not have been his intention to comment on strategic or commercial issues but the position he has adopted is, in effect, a position that favours one commercial strategy, namely, long-term hold to 2020, over another, namely, the portfolio sale in 2014.  If one accepts the position that he has adopted in relation to the discount rate, namely, that NAMA is not entitled to use the appropriate market discount rate to estimate the market value of granular portfolios of this type, then he is clearly proposing a position which favours a long-term piecemeal workout in preference to an upfront loan sale.  In that sense, without the support of any knowledge or experience of dealing with distressed assets, the report is implying that a long-term workout will always be superior to a loan sale regardless of the risks involved, given that a portfolio discounted at 5.5% will invariably have a higher valuation than a portfolio discounted at a market discount rate of between 10% and 15%.<\/p><p> If NAMA accepted this perspective, which given its statutory commercial remit it cannot do, it would never adopt a loan sale strategy in preference to a piecemeal workout.  In fact, we would be around much later than 2020.  It is worth bearing in mind, however, that NAMA was not established with a restricted mandate to work out assets on a piecemeal basis over the long term; it was set up with a mandate to act commercially and expeditiously and that meant taking advantage of any opportunities to sell loans and property, either in bulk or individually, subject to the requirement that the best achievable price is obtained.  This view of NAMA's mandate was also articulated by the Minister for Finance in his section 227 review of NAMA in 2014.<\/p><p> No. 4 is the reliance on the 5.5% rate.  I believe that the rationale for the report's position is not sustainable, particularly in its assumption that it would have been appropriate to use a 5.5% discount rate to estimate the long-term workout value of the Project Eagle loans. We have repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that a 5.5% discount rate was not a standard NAMA discount rate and it is inaccurate and unreasonable to characterise it in those terms.  It was a rate which the board, in its decision of June 2013, stated was appropriate for use for some, but not all, commercial evaluations.  The board decision of June 2013 could hardly have been clearer.  A 5.5% rate should not be used as an overarching discount rate to evaluate all potential transactions.  It was important that flexibility should be maintained.  In particular, care should be taken to ensure that both (a) alternative NPV scenarios are generated using alternative discount rates and (b) that qualitative information would be considered as part of the decision-making process.  The key qualitative information in the evaluation of this transaction was the relatively low quality and granular character of many of the assets in the Northern Ireland debtor portfolio, which was not typical of the NAMA portfolio as a whole.  A discount rate higher than 5.5% was commercially appropriate, given the risks associated with its asset quality and with underlying weak economic conditions in Northern Ireland and in parts of northern England and Scotland.<\/p><p> This Project Eagle portfolio was very granular.  The fact that the top 55 assets accounted for two thirds of its value left the remaining one third of the portfolio with about 870 assets with an average asset value of about &pound;600,000 each.  The cash flows attaching to these smaller-valued assets were much less certain, both in terms of projected disposal proceeds and projected income, than was the case with larger assets.  It is accepted market practice that the less attractive the assets and the income stream securing a loan portfolio and the less certain that the associated cash flows will actually be received, the higher the risk premium and therefore the discount rate that will be applied by buyers.  For that reason, it made perfect sense, through a loan sale, to bundle the large number of poorer quality assets with the better assets.<\/p><p> The discount rate would also have incorporated a risk premium arising from the high concentration of assets located in the small Northern Ireland economy.  As we have pointed out, the Northern Ireland property market did not have the capacity to absorb a large volume of asset sales over a short time period, as is evidenced by the fact that, in the four years from 2010 to the end of 2013, sales of NAMA-secured assets in Northern Ireland realised a total of only &pound;113 million.  The report's conclusion that there was \"a probable loss of &pound;190 million\" rests entirely on the view that NAMA applied, or should have applied, a standard discount of 5.5% to all evaluations.  This can only be deduced by comparing an estimate of workout value, &pound;1.49 billion, to 2020 with the minimum reserve price of &pound;1.3 billion from a 2014 sale.  As the report puts forward no external evidence in support of 5.5% being an appropriate market discount rate or indeed being an appropriate workout rate, everything rests then on the report's interpretation of the board decision of June 2013.  The key question then becomes whether one takes the board's June 2013 caveat about other factors, including risk assessment, into account or whether one arbitrarily decides to ignore it.  If you accept the objective evidence offered by the actual decision that the board took in June 2013, including the major caveat to which I have drawn your attention, you cannot reasonably contend that the board intended that 5.5% would become a standard, one-size-fits-all discount rate for all strategic commercial evaluations.  Therefore, by extension, the whole basis for the conclusion of a probable loss of &pound;190 million does not hold.<\/p><p> Section 3.81 of the report outlines the Comptroller and Auditor General's case for relying on a 5.5% discount rate, based on three statements which are all factually incorrect.  One, the report states that \"no reference was made in the papers presented to the Board in June 2013 or in December 2013 that a rate higher than NAMA's standard 5.5% rate would be appropriate\".  For reasons outlined above, NAMA does not accept the contention that 5.5% was a standard discount rate to be used for all evaluations as the June 2013 board paper clearly provided for exceptions if and when appropriate.<\/p><p> Two, the report states that NAMA's cost of funding was 1.2% in 2013, much lower than the funding costs that would arise for the purchasers of loan portfolios.  This statement, designed to illustrate that NAMA could have continued to carry the portfolio at a low cost for all future years, is misleading.  NAMA's average actual and projected cost of operations from 2014 to 2020, the period of time during which NAMA would have had to work out this difficult portfolio, was 4.95%, not 1.2%.  This is significantly higher than funding costs for banks and some other comparable institutions.  It also implies a risk premium of 0.55% if you regard a 5.5% discount rate as appropriate.  I cannot imagine that any informed analysis would regard such a low risk premium as appropriate for the Project Eagle portfolio.<\/p><p> Three, the report states that NAMA already took account of the poor quality of the underlying Project Eagle assets in its impairment review.  This is not the case.  As discussed further below, international accounting standards allow impairment reviews only to consider circumstances and known incurred losses at the time of the review, which would have been end-2013.  Losses due to future events or conditions from 2014 onwards, no matter how likely, were not permitted.  The fact that the accounting impairment review does not capture future losses means that a higher risk premium must be built into the discount rate.  Hence, the report's assertion that overlaying a high risk premium on the technical impairment calculation would represent double counting is factually incorrect.  In any event, the market ignores accounting carrying values and tends to value portfolios by reference to the price of risk.<\/p><p> We note that the Comptroller and Auditor General, in his evidence to the committee on 29 September 2016, stated that it was not possible to be absolute or definite regarding the alleged probable loss of &pound;190 million.  He indicated to Deputy Kelly that there was a margin around it but stated that it was impossible to estimate what that margin might be.  Based on the magnitude of possible margins put to him on that date, he did not rule out the possibility that the margin may have been plus or minus &pound;200 million or more.  Therefore, depending on the parameters of the margin, the probable loss could have been much higher than &pound;190 million or indeed, at the other extreme, that there may have been no probable loss at all.  Such a wide-ranging margin leaves us in the realm of speculation.  In our view, compelling and objective market evidence is required to support a finding that there was a probable loss that would not have been incurred if NAMA had held on to the portfolio to 2020 rather than selling it in 2014.  While the Comptroller and Auditor General's qualification at this committee of his original report conclusion is to be welcomed, it only goes to highlight the difficulty of positing and estimating a probable loss in the absence of any objective market evidence of a loss.  Objective market evidence would be evidence that a credible buyer was willing to offer &pound;1.49 billion, or some other sum greater than the &pound;1.322 billion achieved by NAMA, for this portfolio.<\/p><p>No such evidence has been produced because there can never be any such evidence.  It is pure speculation.  I cannot imagine that a court of law or any other judicial forum would regard the interpretation of the NAMA&rsquo;s board decision which ignores a crucial element of that decision as a fair or reasonable basis for concluding that there was a \"probable loss\" of any magnitude.<\/p><p> NAMA had taken a cumulative impairment &pound;478 million on the Project Eagle loans up to the end of 2013.  We were well aware that it was highly likely that additional impairment charges would have to be taken in the 2014 and in future years&rsquo; financial statements.  This emerged in the form of an accounting loss of &pound;162 million on the sale of the Project Eagle portfolio.  International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, accounting rules, specifically IAS 39, require NAMA to recognise an impairment provision against the book value of its loans where there is a reduction in the amount likely to be received or a change in the timing of future loan cashflows, commonly referred to as \"objective evidence of impairment\".<\/p><p> IAS 39 operates on an incurred loss basis as opposed to an expected loss basis.  Under IAS 39, NAMA could not have provided for expected future losses.  At the end of 2013, the board expected future losses but could not provide for them under IAS 39.  In setting the &pound;1.3 billion minimum price, the board was, in effect, recognising and bringing up front, losses of at least &pound;175 million.  The board was aware that the end of 2013 &pound;1.49 billion carrying value needed to be adjusted to take account of losses that it expected to take in future years but could not yet recognise in its end of 2013 accounts under IFRS.  The fact that there was an actual loss of &pound;162 million on the sale which was recognised in 2014 accounts is not in dispute.  The IAS board has redrafted IAS 39 and the new standard, IFRS 9, will, when implemented, change the impairment methodology to allow for future expected credit losses to be reported on a timely basis.<\/p><p> In 2014, however, we were operating by reference to the existing accounting IFRS rules.  If the timing of the Project Eagle sale had been six or 12 months later, additional impairment would have been recognised and I have little doubt that the cumulative impairment at that point would have been close to the &pound;640 million total impairment that we ultimately took on this portfolio.<\/p><p> I wish to reiterate NAMA&rsquo;s position.  The gross undiscounted cashflows arising from the Project Eagle loan portfolios amounted to &pound;1.68 billion.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report has discounted these cashflows at a discount rate of 5.5% and has produced a NPV of &pound;1.49 billion.  The minimum sales price set by the NAMA board was &pound;1.3 billion.  This falls within the mid-point range of sale values generated by the 10% to 15% range of discount rates.  This is the range that would have been applied to a portfolio such as Project Eagle during the first half of 2014.  A 10% discount rate produces a value of &pound;1.36 billion while a 15% discount rate produces a value of &pound;1.25 billion.  The &pound;1.322 billion achieved on the sale, which was above the minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion, was, therefore, well within the range of expected values.<\/p><p> It has been suggested that there is no support in NAMA&rsquo;s contemporaneous records for its use of a 10% discount rate.  This is not the case.  A 10% rate was used in preparing information required as part of the fair value note in the end of 2012 NAMA financial statements which was certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The fair value methodology for the 2012 accounts was based on a discount rate of 10% and, had this fair value discount rate been applied to the Project Eagle portfolio, the NPV would have been &pound;1.36 billion.  This was the prevailing fair value discount rate that applied at the time that the sale of the Project Eagle portfolio was being considered by the NAMA board in the fourth quarter of 2013 and, as such, it is a discount rate with which the board would have been familiar during its deliberations about a possible loan sale.<\/p><p> In any commercial transaction, there can only be one definitive market value, namely, the price on which a buyer and a seller agree after a competitive sales process.  In advance of a sale, a buyer and a seller will, in most instances, have different views on what a portfolio may be worth, but these views are notional unless, and until, a transaction price can be agreed.  NAMA does not accept the inference in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that the sales process restricted the field of credible potential bidders and thereby compromised the objective of obtaining best market price.  The nine potential bidders approached by Lazard were all credible entities which had the capacity to fund and execute a purchase on this scale.  Collectively, they purchased 88% of all large loan sales across Europe between 2013 and 2015.  There is no evidence that there were other potential bidders who could have participated in the process and who would have been likely to submit a competitive bid for the portfolio.<\/p><p> It is not plausible to suggest, as is done in the report, that NAMA set a reserve price for the Project Eagle portfolio which was too low.  By definition, any suggestion of a NAMA giveaway of &pound;190 million must have involved a gain of &pound;190 million for the successful bidder, and this is not plausible.  Are we being asked to believe that of the nine major international investors approached and the five major international investors which took a detailed look at the portfolio, only one identified the &pound;190 million that NAMA was allegedly giving away when it set the minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion?  Major astute international investors do not operate in that way.  We are being asked to believe that, uniquely on this occasion, they decided to leave easy money on the table.<\/p><p> The report suggests that the concerns that some potential investors may have had about the duration of the sales process or the level of detail available on the portfolio were so serious that they decided to forego the &pound;190 million of easy profit allegedly on offer.  Again, this is not a realistic view of the capacity of major international investors to surmount any obstacle in pursuit of substantial and easy profits.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General has acknowledged to the committee, the cost of capital of these purchasers would have been of the order of 10% or more.  There was no substantial profit available through alleged NAMA mispricing.  It would be more realistic and more credible to suggest that the &pound;1.3 billion minimum price set by NAMA was a commercially reasonable target in early 2014 and that only one of the five investors who looked at the portfolio in detail considered that it represented a potentially profitable opportunity for them.  The NAMA board made a decision to sell in excess of the &pound;1.3 billion minimum price and we stand over that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>A vote has been called in the D&aacute;il.

In his opening comments, the chief executive, Mr Brendan McDonagh, has addressed the major issue of the price achieved for the transaction.  In my comments, I will focus on a number of other key issues.<\/p> <p>  Let me put the whole transaction and the activities of NAMA in context.  There has been a lot of discussion of the detail of the sales process over the last few months but it is important not to lose sight of the overall context in which the Project Eagle sale took place.  In January 2014, when the board decided in principle to sell the Northern Ireland debtor portfolio, NAMA had almost &euro;23 billion in Government-guaranteed senior debt outstanding.  Ireland had just emerged from the troika programme and there was significant uncertainty about the sustainability of the emerging economic, financial and fiscal recovery as the National Treasury Management Agency sought to raise funding in the bond markets to finance the Exchequer.  As has been discussed here on a number of occasions, there was pressure to ensure that NAMA&rsquo;s senior debt was repaid as quickly as possible, not least to enhance the financial position of the major Irish banks and to reduce the contingent liability or position of the State. <\/p> <p>  Up to that point, NAMA had redeemed &euro;7.5 billion of its senior debt.  An opportunity emerged in autumn 2013 - in the form of an offer from PIMCO to buy the Northern Ireland debtor portfolio - which would have enabled NAMA not only to lock down the value of one of the less attractive elements of its overall loan portfolio but also to generate cash proceeds equivalent to one fifth of the total senior debt that had been redeemed over the previous four years.  It would have been extraordinary, in the circumstances, if NAMA had not given the offer the most serious consideration as it was obliged to do under sections 10 and 18 of the NAMA Act. <\/p> <p>  Three years later, that &euro;22.6 billion contingent liability has been reduced to &euro;3.6 billion and we hope to reduce this further before the end of the year.  It is important that the committee &ndash; and indeed the wider taxpaying community - should appreciate that the &euro;19 billion reduction in the State&rsquo;s contingent liability could not have been achieved if NAMA had been unwilling or incapable of operating on a commercial basis.  Operating on a commercial basis means that one takes advantage of a good opportunity now to sell assets unless one has reason to expect that a better opportunity will come along in two, three or five years&rsquo; time. <\/p> <p>  NAMA proceeds cautiously but a commercial mandate means that one can never allow caution to lapse into decision paralysis.  To achieve that scale of deleveraging has required thousands of commercial decisions, none of which could have been made with any degree of certainty as to how prices would evolve in the future.  Decisions can only be based on information available at a particular point in time.<\/p> <p>  Would NAMA have realised more if it had delayed all its sales by one year?  Perhaps.  Would it have realised more if it had delayed all its sales by two years?  Perhaps.  Would it have realised more if it had delayed all its sales by five years?  Perhaps.  One will never know and neither will anyone else. <\/p> <p>  What NAMA knows is that a combination of developments, including a recovering Irish property market and an influx of international investors into Ireland, provided it with an opportunity to deleverage its risk by selling loans and property collateral and to thereby accelerate the redemption of its senior debt.  As of now, 88% of the senior debt has been repaid and NAMA expects that all of the &euro;30.2 billion of guaranteed debt will be repaid by 2018. <\/p> <p>  If NAMA were operating to its original 2020 horizon to repay all the senior debt rather than to a 2018 horizon, would it have realised more cash from its loans?  One will never know and I am not sure that there is much point in speculating.  What NAMA sought to do, given the huge debt that it had to deal with, was to reduce that debt on an accelerated but phased basis as market opportunities allowed.<\/p><p>NAMA is now in the fortunate position of dealing with outstanding senior debt of just &euro;3.6 billion, rather than &euro;22.6 billion at the end of 2013.  Bearing in mind the significant uncertainties ahead, that is a good position for the State to be in.  <\/p><p> There is market speculation that the likely impact of the policies signalled by Mr. Trump is that interest rates will rise faster than expected up to now.  That is likely to reduce the attractiveness of property assets to international investors.  The flow of international investor funds into property in recent years has been partly due to the relatively high yields available compared to cash and bond yields.  A narrowing of the yield differential is likely to reduce investor interest in property.  In that context, the big question a commercially informed market analysis would ask is: &ldquo;Did NAMA get its timing broadly right in reducing the huge contingent exposure of Irish taxpayers to property and has Ireland&rsquo;s cost of funding benefited correspondingly in the bond markets?&rdquo;  I believe we did and that this has been reflected in the sovereign&rsquo;s funding costs.<\/p><p> I will now talk a little about Britain.  Contrary to suggestions made at earlier hearings, we did not claim that we had foreseen the outcome of the Brexit referendum.  What we did was take advantage of favourable market conditions in Britain to reduce our risk exposure to that market on a prudent and commercially sensible basis.  According to official statements, the UK economy, after the Brexit vote, appears to be heading for a period of lower growth and reduced investment.  News reports last week indicated that land values in central London had fallen by over 10% in the last year and that house prices were 11% below their 2014 peak.  Our own analysis suggests the fall in UK prices may be much higher than official estimates.  Analysts are forecasting that prices will fall further in the coming years, partly in response to a weakening economy and the likelihood that companies will move staff overseas in response to Brexit.  Nobody is suggesting we saw all of this coming; what we are entitled to claim is that our strategy since 2010 has been consistent in acting prudently and commercially and taking advantage of good market conditions when they have prevailed.  For that reason, we do not now have to deal with the consequences of a weakening market.  Our debtors have only about &pound;800 million in assets located in Britain.  At one stage in 2011 we had an exposure in excess of &pound;12 billion to the British and Northern Ireland markets.<\/p><p> I will turn to the issue of PIMCO&rsquo;s withdrawal from the sale process.  Before doing so I wish to address its recent letter to the committee which was read at one of the meetings.  It is dated 8 November 2016 and sets out a number of important facts, none of which was disclosed by PIMCO to NAMA in March 2014.  The first fact which was not disclosed is that PIMCO was approached by Brown Rudnick and introduced to Mr. Cushnahan in April 2013.   The second fact which was not disclosed is that Mr. Cushnahan was one of the organisers of a meeting in May 2013 at which PIMCO met the Northern Ireland First Minister and the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and Personnel.  The third fact which was not disclosed is that PIMCO was approached by Brown Rudnick in June 2013 about a success fee, one third of which was to be paid to Mr. Cushnahan.  The fourth fact which was not disclosed is that PIMCO sought confirmations from Brown Rudnick in 2013 as to whether NAMA had been informed of, and had approved, the involvement of Mr. Cushnahan in PIMCO&rsquo;s proposed transaction.   PIMCO&rsquo;s letter to the committee is materially inaccurate because it states it provided details of these matters for NAMA in a series of calls in March 2014.  It did not provide these details for NAMA in March 2014 or at the time of its indicative offers in September or December 2013.   At no stage during NAMA&rsquo;s extensive engagement with it from September 2013 until 10 March 2014 did PIMCO inform it that Mr. Cushnahan was a potential beneficiary of the success fee arrangement proposed to PIMCO by Brown Rudnick.  Only PIMCO can explain why it did not tell us about these details and we have written to it to ask why none of these details was disclosed to NAMA at the time.<\/p><p> I wish to outline again NAMA's state of knowledge at the time of the various calls to PIMCO in March 2014.  PIMCO first informed NAMA during the conference call on 10 March 2014 of a proposed fee arrangement involving Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Mr. Cushnahan.  It asked if NAMA was aware that Mr. Cushnahan was potentially a beneficiary of this arrangement.  NAMA confirmed that it was not so aware.  For the avoidance of doubt, NAMA only became aware on 14 October 2015, through evidence given by the Northern Ireland First Minister, that Mr. Cushnahan had been involved with PIMCO in the potential purchase of Northern Ireland debtor loans as early as May 2013.  The NAMA board, at a meeting on 11 March 2014, considered that the proposed fee arrangement, in so far as it included Mr. Cushnahan, represented a significant issue for it.  It requested that this message be conveyed to PIMCO and this was done in a conference call at 11 a.m. on that day.  PIMCO was asked to reflect on the matter in view of the board&rsquo;s view of the significance of the issue.  Later on 11 March 2014, during a conference call at 5 p.m., PIMCO indicated that, having reflected on the matter, it was willing to withdraw and, in a call on 12 March 2014, confirmed its withdrawal, stating it believed it did not have any choice other than to withdraw gracefully.  In my view, the board, once it was informed of the Cushnahan matter, knew that it was inevitable that PIMCO would have to leave the process and the board provided it with the space to reflect and withdraw.  I am in no doubt that had it had made an effort to remain in the process, we would have had to formally remove it, but that did not arise, as by the time of the board meeting on 13 March 2014, it had signalled its withdrawal from the process.  In the circumstances, we were pleased that it had.<\/p><p> I do not believe we have rnischaracterised PIMCO&rsquo;s exit from the process, but even if we have, in our view, nothing turns on it.  At its meetings on 11 and 13 March 2014 the board discussed PIMCO's disclosure of 10 March 2014 and whether it did, in fact, wish to remain in the process.  On 10 March 2014 PIMCO asked if NAMA was aware of the Mr. Cushnahan fee and indicated that, if it was an issue for NAMA, it would have concerns about continuing to deal with Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Mr. Cushnahan.  The only plausible reason for bringing this matter to NAMA&rsquo;s attention was that PIMCO wanted to receive confirmation from NAMA either that it knew about it or that it was not an issue for it.  Presumably, if NAMA had indicated that it had no difficulty with the proposed arrangement, it is likely that PIMCO would, at the very least, have pursued the matter further with the three potential beneficiaries.  The board&rsquo;s reaction to the proposed arrangement - the committee has heard it from various individual board members in recent weeks - was unequivocal.  It decided on 11 March 2014 that PIMCO would have to go.  I reiterate what I stated to the committee on 9 July 2015 that the board was of the view that if PIMCO did not withdraw, NAMA could not permit it to remain in the process.  In other words, if PIMCO had not withdrawn, the board was minded to remove it and would have made a formal decision to that effect.<\/p><p> When it was made clear to PIMCO that the proposed arrangement involving Mr. Cushnahan was a significant issue for NAMA, the only residual question for it was the choreography of its withdrawal from the process.  From the board&rsquo;s perspective, it was preferable that PIMCO leave the process voluntarily rather than we having to make a decision to remove it.  The manner of its exit suited both sides.  Subsequently, we informed Lazard of PIMCO&rsquo;s withdrawal, but we did not inform it of the reasons for it.  Our key concern at that point was whether PIMCO&rsquo;s withdrawal was likely to have a serious impact on the level of competitive tension in the process.  Lazard advised us that there was sufficient competitive tension in the process with the remaining two bidders.  In retrospect, I accept that it would have been better if Lazard had been aware of the real reason for PIMCO&rsquo;s exit, but we did not regard it as a major commercial issue at the time, given that Lazard considered the post-PIMCO level of competitive tension sufficient.  I do not believe the information would have materially changed its advice on the residual level of competitive tension in the process.<\/p><p>As we have repeatedly stated, our primary concern was to ensure that Mr. Cushnahan was not involved in a bid and PIMCO's withdrawal had the effect of achieving that outcome.<\/p><p> I now wish to refer to other options.  One issue which has received some attention is the reference in the note of the second call of 11 March at 5 p.m. to a query from the head of asset recovery about other options and his query in respect of whether the deal could be \"shaped differently for the arrangement fee to come out\".  Taking these references in isolation, there has been an attempt to suggest that the head of asset recovery was seeking to persuade PIMCO to remain in the process.  That was not at all the case.  In raising these queries, the head of asset recovery was following up on the question that PIMCO had raised during the call on 10 March 2014.  During that call, Tom Rice said that if it was an issue for NAMA, then PIMCO would have concerns with continuing to deal with the three counterparties and would have to consider whether the business could proceed without the counterparties involved.  In order to establish the outcome of PIMCO's consideration of whether the business could proceed without the involvement of the counterparties, the head of asset recovery asked about it in the second call on 11 March 2014.  In their letter to the committee of 8 November 2016, PIMCO representatives make reference to NAMA's question on 11 March 2014 but, for some reason, fail to mention that the other options were originally canvassed by them on 10 March 2014.  The question from the head of asset recovery was only to clarify, as a matter of fact, what PIMCO's decision was in respect of its consideration of whether the business could proceed as outlined by PIMCO on 10 March 2014.<\/p><p> I will now outline the position on NAMA's response to the report conclusions.  There have been comments by a number of committee members to the effect that NAMA has been overly robust in its response to the Comptroller and Auditor General report.  I admit that we have been robust and I think we have been subject to very robust questioning at this committee.  The reason for our robustness is that we believe there is unfair commentary in the Comptroller and Auditor General report, that the report has questioned our competence and has implied that we failed in our obligations to taxpayers under section 10 of the NAMA Act.  Its key finding implies that members of the board and the executive who have extensive commercial experience and expertise set a minimum price for this portfolio which had the effect of locking in a probable loss of &pound;190 million on its sale.  According to the Comptroller and Auditor General report, this loss could have been avoided if NAMA had held on to the loans and worked them out over the period to 2020.  The NAMA chief executive has pointed out the numerous flaws in the hypothesis grounding the report's conclusion of probable loss.  He draws attention again to the fact that the report's reliance on a 5.5% discount rate appears to be based on an incorrect interpretation of a NAMA board decision of June 2013.<\/p><p> The report also concluded that we authorised a sales process which may have failed to identify a market investor with the willingness and capacity to pay more than &pound;1.322 billion for this portfolio.  In reaching this conclusion, the report disregards the compelling evidence that the nine firms which were admitted to the sales process accounted for 88% by par value of all European commercial real estate loan sales of large portfolios in excess of &euro;1 billion transacted over the period from 2013 to 2015.  The report took no account of Lazard's opinion that there was no evidence that any other investors existed at that time, in quarter 1, 2014, who were as credible and as well qualified such that it appeared that they were in a position to pay a higher price to NAMA than that secured from Cerberus.  The report took no account of Lazard's opinion that the process was open to the most qualified and credible potential counterparties.  Lazard's view was that there were fewer participants in this process than in some other transactions because there were fewer investors that were sufficiently qualified and credible.  I would suggest that the views of NAMA, Lazard and the Department of Finance, all of which have loan sales experience and expertise, should be treated as having strong evidential value in any review of a major loan transaction, especially if no market-based counter-evidence is offered.<\/p><p> We had serious concerns with the key contentions of the report and indeed our response has been robust, but appropriately so in my view.  In the circumstances, how else could we have been expected to respond?  We are entitled to defend our position.  I hope it is not being suggested that NAMA is obliged to accept the conclusions of the report regardless of the agency's views, not to mention the evidence submitted by us and Lazard, which, we believe, casts serious doubt over those conclusions.<\/p><p> We have always tried to run our business to the highest professional and commercial standards over the past seven years and I do not accept the implication of this report that, on this one occasion, the board and executive suffered a major collective lapse in managing our responsibilities which resulted in a probable loss of &pound;190 million of taxpayers' money.  My view then and now is that the Project Eagle deal was the best available at the time and no one has come forward with any credible evidence to suggest that a better deal might have been available then or since.  I note that Mr. Patrick Long of Lazard stated unequivocally to this committee on Tuesday that Cerberus paid the best price that was available in the market.  Our view in 2014 was that the sale of Project Eagle was a good deal for Irish taxpayers and events since then have only reinforced that view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Mr. Daly, I am sorry to interrupt.

We have listened carefully to all the evidence presented to this committee over the past two months.  If there is one message above all others that has come home to me based on that evidence, it is the fact that we did not document in greater detail and with greater clarity the rationale for key board decisions, especially those taken in December 2013 and January 2014.  Those decisions were taken after prolonged debate and discussion by the board.<\/p> <p>  Given that board members were experienced in financial, property, banking and accounting matters, much of the discussion revolved around the very topics that are now the focus of the committee's attention.  These included the issue of the appropriate discount rate that the market would apply to a portfolio such as this, our acceptance of the fact that our carrying value was in excess of the market's valuation of the portfolio and the probability that we would have to take substantial additional impairment on the portfolio in 2014, and possibly later, regardless of whichever strategy was adopted.<\/p> <p>  As with all board minutes, the minutes of those particular board meetings record the decisions ultimately taken by the board and do not provide a detailed account of the various considerations that were reviewed and discussed as part of the decision-making process.  If, at that stage in December 2013 and January 2014, we had any reason to expect that the board papers and the board minutes relating to Project Eagle were going to be subjected to the intensive review that is taking place, I have no doubt that the board would have been more than willing to set out a comprehensive and detailed rationale for its decisions.  If we had done so, I have little doubt that many of the issues which have attracted scrutiny from committee members since September would have been much clearer to them and that, as a result, we would all have spent less time now discussing them.  That is a lesson that we have learned from this experience.  Nowadays, board decisions and the rationale for them are recorded in much greater detail than was the case three years ago.<\/p> <p>  I will now discuss the position on management of conflicts of interest.  The report concludes that Mr. Cushnahan's potential conflicts of interest could not be managed by withholding of debtor-specific information and that NAMA should formally have considered whether his engagement in discussion of its Northern Ireland strategy was consistent with his involvement as a financial adviser to various Northern Ireland debtors.  Mr. Cushnahan was a political appointee intended to represent the views of Northern Ireland.  I believe that we managed the potential conflicts of interest appropriately within the statutory framework.<\/p> <p>  The key question to ask in a conflict of interest situation relates to the function of the designated director.  It is only if the interest is material to the performance of a function that an actual conflict will arise.  In the case of Mr. Cushnahan, his function was to sit on a committee which offered advice to NAMA about Northern Ireland.  He had no function in the formulation of NAMA strategy on the sale of Project Eagle or any other loan portfolio and he had no function relating to the management of any debtors or loans or assets.<\/p><p>Should he have disclosed his involvement to PIMCO in 2013?  Yes, I think he should have.  That alone does not justify the conclusion in the report that the potential conflicts were not appropriately managed by NAMA.<\/p><p> In conclusion, this is the fourth occasion that the CEO, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, and I have appeared before this committee to answer questions on Project Eagle and the second occasion since the Comptroller and Auditor General published his report.  In addition, current board members, former board members, members of the executive and the former CFO have also appeared before this committee since the Comptroller and Auditor General published his report.  At every one of these appearances, my colleagues and I have answered the committee's questions truthfully and honestly.  We have no difficulty with the committee scrutinising our work and questioning our commercial decisions.  It is right and proper that the committee does so.  We are accountable to this committee and we deliver our testimony to it in good faith.  I again wish to thank the committee for agreeing to hear at first hand the perspective of individual board members, current and former, an opportunity which was not afforded to them during the section 9 review.  I trust that the committee&rsquo;s review will take into account the totality of the evidence that has been placed before it.<\/p><p> My colleagues and I have devoted a huge amount of time and resources to appearing before the committee, to answering its questions honestly and to responding to its written requests for information.  Since the Comptroller and Auditor General published his report, NAMA has supplied 1,500 pages of responses and records to the committee in addition to the opening statements which have been made by board members and NAMA executives.  We take the work of this committee very seriously and we hope that the committee&rsquo;s further deliberations and final report will be fair, impartial and evidence based.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Daly for that opening statement.

The witnesses would have seen when representatives of Cerberus were before the committee that they said that when Cerberus was approached by Brown Rudnick - Cerberus got a cold call approach by Brown Rudnick - Brown Rudnick informed Cerberus that it had been working on this project for a year.  Brown Rudnick approached Cerberus in March 2014.  If one works backwards one year, that is March 2013.  Again, Brown Rudnick had no problem volunteering that information.  PIMCO had no problem volunteering to us information on the background of April 2013.  However, Mr. Daly wants us to believe that PIMCO did not give NAMA or its board that information at a critical time when it was giving NAMA the information about the success fee.  From all of the documentary evidence that the Comptroller and Auditor General presented to us in terms of the contemporaneous notes, it is very clear to me that PIMCO was very aware of its legal requirements.  It was very conscious of them, so for PIMCO not to give NAMA the information that Mr. Daly says it did not give NAMA is very serious for PIMCO, and that is very troubling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#U02100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":261,"content":"<p>That is a matter for PIMCO.

I am not sitting here in judgement of Mr. Daly or NAMA, for that matter.  We have a report to produce and we are trying to establish the truth more than anything else.  The witness can understand, from our perspective, when we are hearing different narratives and polar opposite statements about different things, that it is quite difficult to find the commonalities and to ascertain the truth.  That is what we are paid to do and why we are here.  I hope he can appreciate why people get a bit excited at times about it.<\/p> <p>  I will start with a positive.  Mr. Daly's opening statement discusses documentation on page 9.  When he was previously before the committee, he did say that the process could have been tweaked better, if my memory serves me correctly.  Mr. John Collison of NAMA also said that there could have been improvements.  At the time, Mr. Daly said that the minutes should record decisions, not discussions.  However, in his opening statement on the issue of documentation, Mr. Daly said, \"If there is one message above all others that has come home to me based on that evidence, it is the fact that we did not document in greater detail and with greater clarity the rationale for key board decisions\".  That is something I asked him about on the last occasion and I think it is very important.  I am glad that he accepts that because it is a departure from what he originally said to us.  I believe that it will be helpful going forward in order that we alleviate something like this happening again.  That is what we are all about at the end of the day.  I welcome that in Mr. Daly's opening statement.<\/p> <p>  The other thing I will put to Mr. Daly is something I asked Ms Ann Nolan in the Department of Finance.  It is only fair of me to ask Mr. Daly today.  It is about the NAMA Act itself.  My view is that it was quite restrictive in terms of expediting the sales above everything else.  I said that to Mr. Daly on the previous occasion he was before the committee with regard to haste.  I know I outlined a lack of certain things and I will go through that in a minute.  What is Mr. Daly's view of the NAMA Act itself?  Does he think it was restrictive on NAMA?  Did it put haste above everything else?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#V05400","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":362,"content":"<p>That is probably getting into an area of policy, which is difficult for me to comment on.  There are many restrictions in the NAMA Act, including not selling back to defaulting debtors and all of that.  I would say that, in the aggregate, those measures were probably quite positive from the point of view of NAMA's business.  The expeditious point is in the Act a few times.  That is our mandate and we cannot really depart from it.  The point Ms Nolan made, or perhaps it was Deputy Madigan, was that there is a tension between that and getting the best value.  There might be some validity in that but, at the end of the day, an asset management agency has a number of objectives.  It must manage the assets, not necessarily retain them.  It also has the objective of getting the market going.

That speaks for itself in terms of the type of portfolio we were dealing with.  We cannot provide individual debtor details because of obligations under the NAMA Act but that is available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Debtors were continually missing milestones.  If debtors are continually missing milestones in terms of mandating rent, not achieving sales and rectifying security, then effectively they slip down the credit rate, which is why the Northern Ireland debtors had 76% in that category compared with the rest of the portfolio, which had only 38%.  That evidence is available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There are individual instances of what we call strategic credit reviews.

This implies to me it influenced its reasons for going in below the reserve price and seems to suggest the quality and completeness of the diligence was not to a standard it felt would allow it to go with the reserve.

We try to avoid this as much as possible because putting the portfolio back on the market is very expensive.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the diligence, we are satisfied we put as much due diligence into the data room as was necessary to allow people make a bid.  The important thing with Fortress, which comes back to the earlier question, is Fortress took on Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield as its property valuers after PIMCO withdrew.  If PIMCO allegedly had the benefit of a long period of working on the portfolio, then Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield may have been working the portfolio for a long time and Fortress would have got the benefit of it.<\/p> <p>  The major issue is bidders will always like more time and more information, but they must make a call on the price they will pay for the portfolio.  We think, and Lazard has also said, there was sufficient information in the data room for people to make a bid.  The question is whether they want to step up to the &euro;1.3 billion minimum reserve, and, if so, they then step up to the plate.  This is their own call.  They have their own views on valuations.  This is also in an e-mail I provided to the committee previously.  When Michael George wrote to me about getting into the process he said he had $4 billion in cash.  The question of him needing to get cash from third parties does not seem to have arisen if he had $4 billion in cash.

My position is that different discount rates would be appropriate for estimating what a purchaser of a portfolio of non-performing loans might be willing or able to pay for them and what the loans might yield to NAMA if it worked them out, as planned, over the medium to long term.  I have not changed my position in that regard.  That is my response to that point.<\/p> <p>  An issue was also raised with regard to a reference on page 8 of the same statement.  The reference is to the Comptroller and Auditor General's qualification of the report around probable loss and so on.  The report refers to NAMA's projected cash flows yielding net receipts of &pound;1.675 billion through working out the loans over the medium to long term.  Obviously, any future cash flow is subject to a certain amount of uncertainty and the eventual net receipts might have been above or below that.  That is really why I put the qualification of \"probable\" on the reference to the loss of value.  We will never know what the outcome would have been.  I do not think I mentioned figures of plus or minus &pound;200 million and I certainly do not recall the detail of that.  It is worthwhile for the committee to bear in mind that the cash flows that were prepared by NAMA for use in the financial statements would have been conservative.  There was a possibility, certainly, that the values achieved could have been higher.  The other element in that uncertainty was that PIMCO's indicative bid offered more for the top 55 assets than the cash flows were actually indicating they might yield two to three years into the future.  That is an indication of the variance there.<\/p> <p>  I was also reflecting on the suggestion around the term \"probable\" and so on.  I think I have explained previously that I changed from the use of the phrase \"potential loss of value\" on reflection in the last round up of the report.  The key reason for that change was that if one was talking about an investment possibility where one was comparing two potential lines of activity or two potential investment options, comparing one with the other and projecting forward that one would yield a value of \"X\" and one would yield a value of \"Y\", then one is talking hypothetically in that situation but here we were actually talking about assets that were owned.<\/p><p>If one were not disposing of them in a way that yielded what they were worth at the time or they might yield in the future and disposed of them at a lower price, it would result in a probable loss of value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#JJ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>The public, but not necessarily members of this committee, has the impression that NAMA sold the assets off and that the Comptroller and Auditor General is recommending that NAMA should have held them for the longer haul.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#KK00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":656,"content":"<p>No<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>This is what I want to clear up although I am quite clear on it.

The second point, which I have made in my statement, is that when the board decided to set a minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion, it was effectively locking in a loss.  That loss, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said, is &pound;190 million, bearing in mind the &pound;1.49 billion.  It turned out to be &pound;162 million but the point is that the board was fully aware that a loss would effectively be incurred and that it would arise anyway in future years in terms of impairment.  We could not take account of that loss in our 2013 financial statements under the accounting rules.  It is a very technical point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#KK04900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":704,"content":"<p>Based on what Mr. McDonagh said in his opening remark, did NAMA present alternative NPV scenarios generated using alternative discount rates?

The issue is the documentation presented to the board meeting.  I refer, in particular, to page 144, appendix C, of the report which refers to documentation presented to the board.  The right hand side of the column on page 144 shows that the documentation presented to the board was a 5.5% NPV and 2.5% NPV.

The impression had been created for the person in the street that PIMCO as an entity thought it would be an idea to make a play for this portfolio and mediated it through Brown Rudnick.  Mr. Daly should bear with me.  We now know in fact that was not how it happened.  How it happened is that Brown Rudnick suggested the deal to PIMCO.

This has come to light in PIMCO's letter of 8 November 2016.  On the call, we asked when the issue arose.  On the previous call, we had been told PIMCO wanted to contact us, out of a desire for transparency and to be as upfront and open as possible.  It was entirely reasonable for us, in asking when the issue arose, to expect that PIMCO would have outlined, in detail, when the issue arose, how it became aware of it, who was involved and all those things.  What we got, to my mind, was a vague answer that did not address those points.  Only in the letter of 8 November 2016 do we have far greater detail on it.  Maybe the people on the PIMCO end of the call were unaware of it at the time.

Given what transpired in the passage we have gone through, the correspondence we have from PIMCO and, above all, what was signed off on by, if I am not mistaken, Mr. Daly, this confirms to me that NAMA was aware of this.

That was the first objective evidence we ever had of Mr. Cushnahan's involvement with PIMCO, at any stage during 2013.  Immediately after that evidence we reviewed the transcript.  We actually entered into quite lengthy correspondence with Mr. Cushnahan which ran from, I think, November until February of this year.  We had extensive correspondence with him.

When it came to the point where PIMCO had withdrawn from the process - we are talking about the period around 14 March - the point in time when it notified Lazard of its withdrawal, Lazard was asked to ensure all of the documentation, including the informational materials, was destroyed or otherwise dealt with in accordance with the terms of the non-disclosure agreement.  That, equally, extended to all of its professional advisers under the terms of the non-disclosure agreement.  There was an obligation on PIMCO at that point to ensure both it and its professional advisers destroyed or returned the information or materials, primarily the content in the data room.  That is the sequence of events involved.<\/p> <p>  When Cerberus retained Brown Rudnick, the point to which the Deputy has come, and we were notified on 3 April of its intention to retain it as a strategic adviser, the requirement on it was that it notify us of who its adviser was.

I intended no discourtesy to you and your colleagues.<br \/><br \/>As you are aware, I attended a meeting of the Committee on November 17, 2016 as a representative of Cerberus Capital Management L.P. and certain of its affiliates (&quot;<b>Cerberus<\/b>&quot;).  Cerberus was invited to assist the Committee in its examination of the Special Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General with respect to a number of matters.  Some of those matters related to events in relation to which I had direct contemporaneous knowledge, whereas for others, I did not.<br \/><br \/>In advance of attending a meeting of the Committee I reviewed some contemporaneous documents dating from 2014, including emails that were not copied to me in 2014.  As part of that process I became aware that some information had been disclosed by Cerberus to Brown Rudnick LLP (&quot;<b>Brown Rudnick<\/b>&quot;) in March 2014.<br \/><br \/>Cerberus engaged Brown Rudnick to provide legal and strategic services in connection with Cerberus' proposed acquisition of the Project Eagle portfolio.  Cerberus was first approached by Brown Rudnick on March 14, 2014 and professional interactions began from that date.  The engagement was formally documented on March 24, 2014.  As solicitors permitted to practice in England and Wales Brown Rudnick are obliged by the Solicitors Regulation Authority's code of conduct to treat information received from clients or prospective clients as confidential.  This professional and legal obligation was acknowledged and other related representations and warranties were made both in our discussions with Brown Rudnick and in Cerberus' formal engagement letter with Brown Rudnick.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#UU01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Stewart"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":1293,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Stewart slow down so that members can absorb the letter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#UU01500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":1294,"content":"<p>I will do so.

I believe this correspondence, and that of March 21, was shared by Brown Rudnick with Tughans.  Tughans owed confidentiality obligations to Brown Rudnick. <br \/><br \/>-  On March 27 2014 Cerberus told Brown Rudnick that Cerberus' request for an extension of the bid deadline (to 1 pm on April 1, 2014) had been granted.<br \/><br \/>My responses to your queries are based upon the information of which I am aware concerning the NDA as of the date of this letter.  The preparation of our bid involved over 100 Cerberus personnel and advisory personnel.  Consequently, I have not conducted a full review of Cerberus' records nor have I interviewed all of our personnel, or those of our advisors.  I have included information concerning Cerberus' affiliates and advisers in the Appendix to this letter.<br \/><br \/>Although regrettable, the disclosure of this procedural information was not material in the context in which it occurred.  I accept that the three instances listed above may contain some information that may not have been previously known to Brown Rudnick and which may therefore be deemed to be &quot;Informational Materials&quot; as defined in the NDA.  I do not believe that the information sharing had any impact on the integrity of the Project Eagle sale process.  Brown Rudnick (and Tughans) had no role in determining the purchase price Cerberus offered for the Project Eagle portfolio.  I can confirm that Cerberus' sharing of these three pieces of information did not impact on the amount of Cerberus' bid.  I also want to acknowledge that the inadvertent disclosure summarized in this letter was Cerberus' responsibility and was not the result of any failures by NAMA or inefficiencies in the Project Eagle process.<br \/><br \/>Finally, I confirm that Cerberus does not object to NAMA providing a copy of this letter or the NDA to the Committee.<br \/><br \/>Very truly yours<br \/><br \/>Cerberus Capital Management, L.P.<br \/><br \/>Mark A.

The document, from around the time of completion of the sale, states: &ldquo;Based on preliminary calculations, it is anticipated that the loss generated on the loan sale may be up to &pound;160 million&rdquo;.  That is a figure NAMA recorded at its audit committee and would have been relevant because it was when there was a big discussion of how much one should provide in the 2013 accounts versus the 2014 accounts.<\/p><p>In his opening statement on Thursday, 9 July 2015 Mr. McDonagh stated:<\/p><blockquote>In overall cash terms, taking into account disposal proceeds, non-disposal income, advances and the proceeds of the loan sale, the net cash loss to NAMA, in layman's terms, on the Northern Ireland [debtor] portfolio was about &euro;280 million.<\/blockquote> <p>Around the time of the sale the figure was &pound;160 million.  With the passage of time and after looking at the figures, a year after the event, Mr. McDonagh presented a figure of &euro;280 million to the committee.  In September 2016 the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, in paragraph 3.86, referred to the famous issue of &pound;190 million being a &ldquo;significant probable loss of value to the State&rdquo;.  On 29 September 2016, in his opening statement to the committee, the Comptroller and Auditor General stated:<\/p><blockquote>NAMA recorded a loss of &pound;162 million in 2014 as a result of sales relating to its Northern Ireland debtors.  Most of this related to Project Eagle.  Losses of &pound;478 million on the Northern Ireland loans had already been recognised in earlier years, reflecting deterioration in market conditions since November 2009.  That was the market value reference point used by NAMA when it bought all its loans.<\/blockquote> <p>The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the loss of &pound;162 million in 2014 when the sale was completed.  Previous losses had been recorded by way of an impairment figure of &pound;478 million.  This adds up to &pound;640 million.  In his opening statement today Mr. McDonagh said:<\/p><blockquote>We note that if the timing of the Eagle sale had been six or 12 months later, additional impairment would have been recognised and I have little doubt that the cumulative impairment at that point would have been close to the &pound;640 million total impairment that we ultimately took on this portfolio.<\/blockquote> <p>That is exactly the figure the Comptroller and Auditor General had quoted here a month earlier.

That is a statement of fact that the committee can put to bed at this stage.<\/p> <p>  The next issue I want to mention is the issue of the discount.  I will not dwell on this too much because I mentioned it a little earlier in the meeting.  On page 5 of his written statement today, Mr. McDonagh mentions the \"alternative [net present values] scenarios ... generated [by] using alternative discount rates\".  Mr. McDonagh has not been able to demonstrate that, although he said he did discuss it.  I also want to refer to the opening statement of Mr. John Collison, head of residential delivery in NAMA, who appeared before the committee on 25 October.  On page 9 of his written statement, he stated: \"The fair value methodology for the 2012 accounts agreed [by] the C&amp;AG was based on a discount rate of 10% and, had this fair value discount rate been applied to the Eagle portfolio, the NPV [net present value] would have been &pound;1,365m.\"<\/p> <p>  Here we have Mr. Collison telling us just a month ago or so that, had the 10% discount been applied, it would have given that figure.  That implies to me that it was not applied.  If it had been applied, I would have expected his opening statement to have read that the 10% discount was applied, resulting in a particular figure.  However, his opening statement is qualified in that regard and I imagine these statements were carefully written.  Rather than specifically stating that the 10% discount was applied, he uses the phrase \"had [it] been applied\".

Part of our coming to the end of the process of these public hearings is perhaps to draw some of those issues together.<\/p> <p>  I now want to refer to page 111 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  I will lay out the scenario as I see it and will ask Mr. McDonagh to convince me otherwise.  I have not made up my mind yet, but this jumps out at me.  We are dealing with page 111, which contains the NAMA board minutes of 8 January 2014.  Towards the end of the third paragraph, they state: \"As agreed at [the] 12th December 2013 meeting the Board noted it would not consider the sale of Project Eagle portfolio of loans for a consideration [of] less than STG&pound;1.3 billion.\"  Mr. McDonagh accepts that.  Those are the minutes.  We will not argue.  That is a definite recording.<\/p> <p>  However, I have to ask myself where this figure of &pound;1.3 billion came from.  Mr. McDonagh has said that he has not been able to demonstrate it based on his figures.  The only thing that has been demonstrated to me is that PIMCO came to NAMA with a bid of up to &pound;1.3 billion in December or thereabouts.  It was towards the end of the year.  The only people to put a figure of &pound;1.3 billion on the table were PIMCO.  It offered up the &pound;1.3 billion and that became NAMA's price.  It is hard to believe there is a coincidence there.<\/p> <p>  I want to move on to the PIMCO offer.  The PIMCO offer had a number of what I would call restrictions.  I am pulling them from the notes prepared for the board.  The board stipulated that it would be cash only.  That is significant.  According to page 82 of the report, Lazard also referred to these restrictions when it was making its recommendations to NAMA.  At paragraph 4.61 of the report, it is stated that Lazard, in a letter dated 2 April, after the conclusion of the bids, noted that \"[t]he process involved a limited number of highly qualified bidders\".  That is a restriction.  There was a limited number of bidders.  It went on to note that there was \"limited due diligence information\".  That is a second restriction.  There was \"a single round of bidding\".  That was a further restriction.  \"[T]he requirement for bidders to acquire the portfolio 'entirely [for] cash'\" was another significant restriction.  There was a tight timeline as well, although it is not mentioned in that particular paragraph.  I also think that in one of the recommendations - in the information of the board meeting - NAMA said that there should be restrictions on the number of advisers appointed by the purchaser.  That was probably for confidentiality reasons.<\/p> <p>  When NAMA came to put out its proposal to tender, lo and behold, everything it had laid out - confidentiality, cash upfront, limited due diligence, time restrictions and the price of &pound;1.3 billion - appears to have been mirrored exactly in what went out.  I have to say that it looks to me - Mr. McDonagh might convince me otherwise - that NAMA's tender document was, possibly, based on what PIMCO gave it.  This whole thing about 10%, 5% and 11.7% is all well and good, but the figure of &pound;1.3 billion came from the PIMCO document.  That is the only place I have seen that figure.  Will Mr. McDonagh address that point?<\/p> <p>  My next question leads on and I will deal with all of this particular issue on PIMCO.  In respect of the last sentence on page 132 of the report, one has to ask how PIMCO came up with the figure of &pound;1.3 billion.  I would be surprised if the board did not ask it when out of the blue it gets an inquiry and an indicative offer from PIMCO and it comes in with the figure of &pound;1.3 billion.  It is a mystery.  I do not think it is based on NAMA's internal discount rates of 10%.  PIMCO has come up with the figure of &pound;1.3 billion, which NAMA ran with from there on in and which was the ultimate final figure.  I will require explanation of the last sentence on page 132, because whoever was preparing the information for the board obviously had to understand where PIMCO was coming from.  The sentence reads: \"PIMCO's analysis was conducted by way of reverse engineering NAMA's Balance Sheet and cross-referencing the publicly available information on NAMA's portfolio.\"  Therefore, there are two bases by which it came by the figure of &pound;1.3 billion.  Is \"the publicly available information\" newspaper articles about who the big debtors were, etc., or how was that established?  If it was publicly available information, did anyone ask at that stage if anyone on the Northern Ireland committee might have been aware and dealing with it and have already declared he or she was working with debtors to help put some of this information together?  I would have asked how it, out of the blue, came up with the figure.  I am asking Mr. McDonagh to explain it.<\/p> <p>  I have asked a couple of people how it was able to work out the bid based on reverse engineering NAMA's balance sheet.  It is a lovely, beautiful technical term to confuse us all, but I do not think NAMA issued a separate balance sheet for Northern Ireland.  The figures that are available or that NAMA normally gives us include Northern Ireland and the UK.  I do not know how someone could have used \"reverse engineering\" of NAMA's balance sheet to work out what was left in NAMA.<\/p> <p>  I will stop at this point now.  I want to take this further.

Yes, it is an allegation that he was involved in this, which was wrong and which I believe was absolutely in breach of his responsibilities towards the Northern Ireland committee and NAMA.  I believe was a clear conflict of interest if it happened and I believe should have been declared, and was and is reportable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#YY01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":1375,"content":"<p>Fine.

In the last sentence of the second paragraph referring to a call on 11 March it states, \"At this point, it was also noted that one third of the fee was in fact payable to a named individual at Tughans\".  Page 118 contains an extract from NAMA's board minutes of 13 March, two days later.  We have looked at this before, but I am picking out a particular aspect.  It refers to \"a potential payment of &pound;16 million split equally three ways between Brown Rudnick Solicitors (London), Managing Partner, Tughans Solicitors (Belfast) and Frank Cushnahan\".  Here are two references to NAMA knowing the money was not due for Tughans, it was due, according to the phone call, to a named individual and the NAMA minutes recorded that it was specifically to the managing partner.

It is part of a bundle of documents NAMA submitted to us.  I will read the paragraph which I find a bit unusual.  Obviously, Mr. McGuinness wrote to Mr. Daly concerned about all the things that emerged in 2015 and the revelations.  Mr. Daly wrote back to Mr. McGuinness as follows:<\/p><blockquote>It subsequently emerged only very recently, [this was July 2015] that a former partner of a Belfast law firm, Tughans, had, according to that firm, &quot;diverted to an account of which he was the sole beneficiary, professional fees due to the firm without the knowledge of the partners&quot;.  According to Tughans, the diverted fees relate to its professional work on the buyer side, not the seller side, of the NAMA loan sale.  NAMA could not have been aware of this matter and the disclosure has no relevance to the competitive sales process run on behalf of NAMA.  As you point out in your correspondence, the Tughans matter is subject to investigation by the police in Northern Ireland.  It would be entirely wrong, as some parties have sought to do, to conflate NAMA's process with the unrelated Tughans issue.<\/blockquote> <p>So NAMA was very much on notice that the first fixer's fee, as it is being called, was to the managing partner, the named person.

While four bidders had withdrawn from the process, in Lazard's view, which is the important thing, competitive tension remained in the process following those withdrawals.

That contract order for services set out the scope of those services, which included identification of prospective bidders, which is what it did.  I mean, that was one of the main objectives and tasks we set them.  The actual letter to us at the end of the process is this letter of 25 June 2014.  I think the committee has it albeit there may be a restriction on its publication.  Lazard confirms that the process was structured in order to seek to achieve NAMA's objective and, specifically, Lazard, in consultation with NAMA, identified a select group of investors who were qualified in terms of financial resources, expertise, track record and so on to undertake a transaction of this nature.  Lazard did that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked me earlier about Lazard's pitch book.  The only change I can recall relates to that sort of consultation around the selection of bidders.  I recall specifically that there was one particular firm in - let us call it - the second tier, which I think was Oaktree, and it was elevated after that discussion between Lazard and NAMA to tier 1.  It was in the first group of bidders that was approached.  Cerberus I think was switched to tier 2.  As it turned out, obviously, both of those bidders were approached, but the main rationale for that at the time was that we had had a lot more visibility and interaction with Oaktree in terms of it bidding on other NAMA portfolios than we would have had with Cerberus.  In fact, at that point, we really did not have much engagement at all with Cerberus.  That was really the rationale behind that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#LLL03700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Collison"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":1849,"content":"<p>Was that the only change made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#LLL03800","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":1850,"content":"<p>That is my understanding but I do not have-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#LLL03900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Collison"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":1851,"content":"<p>What does \"the pitch book\" mean?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#LLL04000","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":1852,"content":"<p>What does it mean?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#LLL04100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Collison"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":1853,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#LLL04200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":1854,"content":"<p>The pitch book is Lazard's summary of the initial briefing, what the overall objectives were, what the engagement was, how the process was to be run, and so on.<\/p><p>That is to my knowledge, but we can check it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#LLL04300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Collison","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":1856,"content":"<p>Was that disclosed to us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016112400002#MMM00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":1857,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

If NAMA had not had Fortress in there, it would have had just one bidder and it would not have been able to convince anybody here that there was a competitive process.  NAMA was very lucky that the media leak allowed this bidder in.  The only reason Lazard could say to NAMA at the end of the process that it had been a competitive process was that there had been two bidders.  One of them came in by fluke.  It was not asked in by NAMA, according to the letter from which I have read.

The witness has said that and there is a conflict there.  Let us look at page 112, paragraph 4 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  PIMCO were in the process from a very early stage, not with NAMA, according to the witnesses, but with Brown Rudnick and Tughans from April 2013.  They went forward to September and through the various board meetings.  On 8 January 2014, a decision was made by NAMA.  Paragraph 4, page 112 reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote>In parallel, PIMCO were permitted to complete their due diligence on the &quot;tail&quot; of the Eagle Portfolio and formalise their bid.

The witness can come back and correct me.  Reading this, PIMCO had been involved for a long time and had invested an awful lot of money and time.  NAMA was happy with PIMCO.  NAMA then had an open process with very limited time and directions for Lazard, as well as other matters that restricted the process.

Mr. Neporent was quite explicit, as I noted earlier.  In his view, &pound;15 million was the price tag on debtor information and access to movers and shakers.  These are decision-makers in the North and also in the South.  That was his position.  We know, along with the witnesses, that Mr. Cushnahan had a specific relationship with debtors.  We also know, as it is in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, that there was a specific provision in this transaction that there was not to be contact between bidders and debtors.  Is that not correct?

Like the Chairman, I acknowledge the enormous work that the other members of the expert group put in as a public service.  They did so without payment and put in a lot of very hard work.  As the Chairman did, I also acknowledge the secretariat for the group.  A lot of the heavy lifting was done by the secretariat from the National Economic and Social Council and Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris.<br\/><br\/>The committee has received the report.  On 10 November the committee heard from the presidents of the universities and the institutes of technology and, therefore, I do not intend to go through the report in detail.  Instead, I will concentrate on the thinking behind the group's conclusions and recommendations.  That is probably a better way of assisting the committee.  When members get down to discussing the specifics they will know why the group reached a certain conclusion or talked about an option in a particular way.  The report is not technical but has dealt with political and societal issues.  That is why we had extensive consultation with students, parents and employers around the country, and with institutes of technology and universities.  We also had two sessions with the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection which preceded this committee.<br\/><br\/>The group approached the work by concentrating on three areas.  First, why as a country do we need to invest more in higher education and, in that context, put students first rather than just institutions?  Second, what level of investment is needed?  Third, if that is the level of investment required, then how does one fund the investment?<br\/><br\/>The committee will be aware of the report's conclusion that higher education has been at the heart of this country's transformation since the 1960s.  Members do not need me to tell them that.  Education has been at the heart of our transformation individually, which is crucial for an individual and his or her social and economic development.  When I left school in 1968 only one person in my class went on to higher education but today half of the workforce have a third level qualification.  Nobody in my family went directly from the leaving certificate into higher education, although later on they did so in various ways.  Now all of my family, including nieces and nephews, are all expected to go into higher education.  We must recognise this significant transformation.<br\/><br\/>The second main conclusion we reached was that we once again need to restore education, in particular higher education, as a key enabler of future development.  Members will know better than anybody else, as politicians and people who are close to the ground, that the country is once again at a turning point in where we are trying to transition from a very deep crisis and revive development and future prosperity while trying to address a number of key societal challenges in housing, the health services or other areas at a time of uncertainty with Brexit and what is happening in other countries.  The report has concluded that as a people we need to rebuild and enhance our capabilities at a personal level, in terms of an individual being crucial, at an interpersonal level and at an institutional level.  We often have the habit of concentrating on the institutions instead of working the other way around.  We need to build those capacities in order to address the challenges and opportunities generated by moving again into a future phase of development.  That is why we reached the conclusion that we need to restore education as a key enabler of our future development.  Some people would conclude that it is not all about attracting students, foreign direct investment and multinationals.  If one considers the key societal challenges we are trying to address one will realise that it cannot happen without higher education as an enabler.  For example, members on the Joint Committee on Health when considering the health services would look at whether more nurses, carers, psychotherapy and doctors are needed.  One will only recruit people if there is a significant investment in higher education.  The same applies to issues such as housing and homelessness, regional development and local enterprises.  We deemed higher education to be the key enabler of all that and not just a means to feed into foreign direct investment.  We concluded that this requires significant investment in higher education, further education, apprenticeships and post-leaving certificate level opportunities.  It is that role that determined the level of investment that we have  recommended.<br\/><br\/>We acknowledge in the report that the requirement for the significant level of further investment that we recommended comes at a time when, despite a stabilisation of the national finances, public resources and household incomes remain stretched.  We need to take account of that context.  We must be aware that we face multiple competing choices, not conflicting ones, with understandable demands for increased resources for housing, health services and other areas of education the Chairman has mentioned before, in particular child care.  The committee must acknowledge that there are no easy options and it is a difficult area because a political and societal response is required as opposed to a technical one.<br\/><br\/>At the same time, if we say that higher education is the key enabler for Ireland's future development, dealing with societal challenges, as I mentioned, and prosperity, then that role comes at a time when the current system of funding higher education is no longer sustainable.  I know the committee had a meeting with the presidents of the universities and institutes of technology.  They may not have put it as bluntly as I do when I say that the system is broken.  There is no other way to describe the situation.  Whatever solution the committee comes up with, the one conclusion that the report reached was that keeping the <i>status quo<\/i>is not an option.  In fact, the <i>status quo<\/i>will worsen the situation significantly.  I have said all this in terms of how we approached the matter.  First, we said the current system fails to recognise the pressures facing higher education institutions.  I will not go into the figures as the committee rehearsed them all on the last day.  The committee had the report so members know how much the number of students has grown, they know about the reduction in staff numbers and the fact that the student-staff ratio has deteriorated significantly.  In the report, we said that the average was 20:1, which is way above the OECD average.  In fact, in any of the institutions the ratio is probably 40:1 or 50:1 in many cases.<br\/><br\/>The report does not take account of the scale of the coming demographic changes.  Members will all know that these people have already been born.  That is how we know that 45,000 people will want to access the system between now and 2030.  They are already in primary education or wherever.<br\/><br\/>The current system has been highlighted a lot in the responses to the report.<\/p><p>The system fails to recognise the pressure on families and students.  If we state students and families are at the centre of this and it is about building individual capabilities, we need to look at their experience of trying to access the system.<\/p><p> The &euro;3,000 is a fee, and it is felt particularly by families with more than one person attending third level.  We had extensive consultation with credit unions and families in various parts of the country who borrow money to pay for it.  The State has had to step in to pay this for almost 50% of students because of the drop in household income in recent years.  There is also the cost of going to third level and the high living costs and maintenance costs associated with studying.  As a result, to progress through successfully, a very high percentage of students undertake additional work outside of their studies, and many students travel long distances because of the costs of trying to rent or stay close to the university.  It is important the committee concentrates not only on the funding required for student numbers and the demographics but also on the actual cost of going to third level.<\/p><p> The group decided we would not look at patching up the existing system but that we needed to recommend a reformed integrated funding system for higher education which would do a number of things.  It would significantly increase investment in higher education to take account of the demographics.  It would restore the staff-student ratio, given the quality issues.  It would enhance financial supports for students, including increasing the value of payments and extending supports to part-time and postgraduate students.<\/p><p> In the 1960s, which I mentioned in the context of my family's experience, the social class gradient of those accessing third level was very clearly upper and middle class.  Something that has crept up on us, which we may not have noticed, is this social class gradient is re-emerging in postgraduate study, because a very high percentage of people from middle and low income backgrounds and disadvantaged backgrounds, including very good students, cannot afford to go on because the funding systems for postgraduate study were withdrawn.  We need to be aware of this.<\/p><p> There is a need to increase capital expenditure significantly, and not only because of the demographics.  We do not want to speak badly about our institutions or the sector, but we certainly found many of the laboratory-based engineering and technical programmes would not be accredited if they were to apply for it today because a significant element of practical work is associated with these programmes.  This is the scale of the difficulty we found.<\/p><p> The report states this increased investment must be underpinned by complementary reforms in the sector, and it would be quite in order for the committee to state this also.  We need a more flexible and responsive higher education system.  People speak about lifelong learning, but we have not embraced it as a concept involving all of society and the entire economy.  Our figures for the numbers and costs involved do not take account of the growth that would happen if we opened up in a responsive way to lifelong learning.  The funding numbers do not take account of pay increases.  If a pay increase process opens up, given the public discussion at present, it must come out of another pot.  It is not provided for in our figures.<\/p><p> This brought us to the level of funding required.  Based on the role we mentioned earlier of higher education being a key enabler, the demographics, what has happened to the staff-student ratio and the quality of education, we stated it must be an ambitious rather than incremental increase in investment to take account of the numbers, small group learning and the next phase of our development being very much involved in high expectation teaching.  We have provided the committee with numbers on this and I will not go through them except to say they are substantial.  This year's budget provided &euro;36 million for higher education.  This is welcome and is significant in the context of the difficulties we have in other areas, but what the report discusses would require more than &euro;100 million.  This is the scale of the difference we are speaking about and where we are in trying to deal with it incrementally.<\/p><p> Funding is also required for an ambitious and major increase in access, participation and progression for various socioeconomic groups, and the committee can recommend this.  It is almost like a social contract, where we state as taxpayers in society we are prepared to make a significant level of investment in order that anybody who has the capacity and wants to access it should be capable of doing so.  Committee members already know the figures.  Almost 100%, that is 99%, of youngsters in Dublin 6 go to third level but in Dublin 15 only approximately 15% do so.  We cannot have a social contract between society and the taxpayers which has this level of disparity in accessing what people believe is crucial for future capability development not only for employment but for the societal challenges we mentioned.  This is why we recommended a significant increase in the value of student supports, the extension of supports to part-time and postgraduate students, whom I mentioned earlier, and a more effective system of student financial aid.<\/p><p> With regard to funding, regardless of which option is chosen what is important is that it is underpinned with a major reformed maintenance and student support system.  This is where the problem is with regard to general access and students from particular backgrounds being able to access, continue and progress.<\/p><p> Having increased investment, and I will not go into the figures as they have been provided to committee members, we dealt with how this would be funded and the funding options available.  We put forward three particular options.  We were asked to provide options but we were happy to do so because these are political and societal decisions.  This is not a technical report and we need to put out the various options and their consequences to let people decide what they want from a political perspective.  We had a set of guiding principles, the main one being that fairness and balance need to guide the funding system.  We need fairness and balance between the public benefits of higher education and the private benefits to the individual.  We also need balance between investment in the sector and cost containment and, as I mentioned earlier, the committee is quite entitled to ask the sector to reform and be more flexible in this context.  We also need fairness and balance between various levels of family income.  This action is what brought into focus for us the key issue of how to share out the costs and funding given the collective benefits of higher education for society and the individual benefits.  The three beneficiaries are society, the individual and employers.<\/p><p>That is why we went with an employer contribution.<\/p><p> On the collective benefit, the committee does not need me to rehearse the contribution higher education has made to our society, economy, culture, public life and the formation of citizens.  We found that was well understood in the consultation process and it is important to see higher education in its own right as something somebody would want to do for its own sake as well as preparation for employment and so on.  It has been the key enabler of our economy and our social services.  The OECD has estimated a return in excess of 20% on that investment by way of tax returns.  However, there are also gains in personal terms for the graduates.  Someone with a higher degree will earn 100% more than an adult whose educational attainment is the leaving certificate over their respective lifespans.  That relates to the question of how the individual benefit is dealt with.  Higher education contributes to individual success and to the collective good.  That core idea underpins the country's long-standing drive to widen access to higher education.  We have submissions stating too many people are going into the system but the reason it is an open system is we can see the individual success and growth and collective good.  That is, therefore, an important consideration when we look at how we fund the system.<\/p><p> We gave three options to approach this.  One is a predominantly State-funded system.  It is important to remember that in all three options the State remains the biggest contributor.  People have pointed to what happens in other system such as the United States.  The state is not involved in the US and we reject that system in the report.  The three beneficiaries all have to contribute but the State will remain the biggest contributor.  In Britain, there has been significant increase in the student contribution but that was because there was an ideological decision that the state would withdraw from higher education.  None of that underpins our report.  Currently, the State invests approximately 60% of funding.  It varies by institution.  That would increase to 80% under the State-funded option.  The other 20% would come from philanthropy, fees from foreign students and so on.  We said all three options are feasible and we outlined the pros and cons of each.  In the case of a predominantly State-funded system with the State paying 80%, it would deliver higher education free at the point of access to everybody and if that is the goal, that could be key.  It is also administratively simple.  However, the question the committee has to ask itself is in the current climate or over the next number of years, will sufficient State resources be available to underpin that?  That is what members have to look out for.  Another question posed in the report is if higher education gives such great individual benefits, can it be considered to be solely a public good and, therefore, every taxpayer must pay for those who access it?<\/p><p> The second option is the continuation of the current system, which provides for a significant investment-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Cassells","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2553,"content":"<p>I am terribly sorry but a division has been called in the D&aacute;il.

The investment should be made because of the role of higher education as a key enabler of future development and because of the scale of investment needed.  Before the break, I was commenting on the funding options.  I have already talked about the predominantly State-funded system which would see State funding of 80%.  The question if this model is adopted is whether there should there be a breakdown and sharing of the cost between the individual who benefits and us as a society benefitting.<\/p> <p>  The second option is the continuation of the current system.  As we need the &euro;1 billion, this would require a significant increase in investment by the State and a continuation of the student contribution of &euro;3,000 and the waivers for students who do not qualify for the student grants, which, as mentioned earlier, account for 50%.  This model increases the State's contribution from 60% to over 70%.  It delivers a balance between the State and the student and it is already in existence.  However, there are a number of issues with it which the committee needs to consider.  First, it does not deliver free higher education at the point of access.  It does not deal with the impact of the &euro;3,000 fee on some families, particularly those above the threshold.  As I said earlier, we found in the work we did that significant personal borrowing is taking place, particularly from the credit unions and in situations in which more than one member of the family is in higher education.  People on moderate incomes are taking out fixed-term loans.  If a person does not benefit from or complete a higher education course, he or she must still repay the loan but does not have the earnings to do so.  In addition, this model deals neither with the fairness of the grant system, which, as I mentioned earlier, is key, nor with the lack of supports for postgraduate or part-time students.  These are the pros and cons of the second option.<\/p> <p>  The third option is a new system of deferred fees supported by income-contingent loans.  This model would require increases in State funding and the student contribution, so the State's share of the investment in higher education would continue to be over 60%.  The fees would be charged to all students, but payment would be deferred, as I said, and supported by an income-contingent loan.  The repayments would therefore be linked to the benefit of higher education, future salary levels and one's ability to pay.  One would not be liable for repayments during any period in which contingencies arose such as unemployment, maternity and so on.  The loan expires after a period if not repaid.  We modelled two possible fee levels in this scenario: the current &euro;3,000, an increase to &euro;4,000 and an increase to &euro;5,000.  We indicated, given the experience of what has happened in Britain, that the fee level needs to be regulated and should remain moderate and affordable.  The question whether there would be a different fee level depending on the cost of the programme - for example, medicine - also came up, and we considered this.  The system allows for such differentiation.  It was brought in in Australia, but we did not go down that road.  We are not saying it should not happen; we are saying the system we have come up with allows for it to happen if desired.  We had enough individual issues in the report to deal with at the time without exploring the matter further.  This model would deliver higher education free at the point of access for all students.  It also opens up and enables the maintenance support to be provided to a broader base of students.  Again, the report is quite clear that the model should not be adopted unless the maintenance system is increased and reformed radically.  Furthermore, as I said, with future repayments being linked to future earnings and ability to pay, the report raises the point that the model should not be a deterrent to participation as a result of one's family circumstances.<\/p> <p>  However, the report also highlights a range of concerns raised with us during the consultation process.  One is debt aversion.  There is a sense that people from particular backgrounds may be averse to taking on debt even though it would be repaid in a particular way.  However, as I mentioned earlier, we discovered that significant numbers of such people are borrowing money for the &euro;3,000 contribution at the moment anyway and repaying it.  The impact of emigration was also mentioned to us.  The answer to this question is that the debt is the same as any other debt.  If one emigrates, it does not evaporate; it remains and must be repaid at some stage.  The question of the future graduate debt burden and the need to take on debt at different stages of one's life - for example, for a house - together with the level of default and the possible implications of this are matters about which the Department of Finance will want to talk to the committee.  One matter we did examine, because it was raised with us, is that if the State is to set this up, it needs to borrow the money to do so.  We clarified that this can be done within the EU fiscal rules, just in case this is raised with the committee.  With Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris's help, we also did some initial modelling of the likely cost to the graduate and to the State across a range of fees and repayment parameters.<\/p> <p>  The last point we made was that whichever model the committee recommends should be underpinned by a new employer contribution to higher education.  We did not make the point just because we saw this might be an easy source of money.  The argument in the report is that if one takes the guiding principle of balance and fairness between the various beneficiaries and a better sharing of the cost among the main beneficiaries, in Ireland we do not have a high level of philanthropy.  However, equally, we are investing in higher education as a way of ensuring we have high-end jobs and people available to take them.  Therefore, there should be a contribution.  There is the National Training Fund, which helps with Springboard but nothing else in higher education.<\/p><p>At the moment there is more than &euro;350 million in the fund.  Therefore, if we expanded the fund to provide support for programmes in higher education with, say, a 1.1% increase, that would raise an additional &euro;50 million.  That is how we came at the issue.  It also opens up options in regard to how these programmes can be supported.<br\/><br\/>The main point about the options is that they need to be considered together.  Each of the options has strengths and weaknesses, and these have to be taken into account.  Each obviously has a negative aspect.  With the first option, it is significantly increased taxes.  With the second, the fees would still continue and people would have to borrow to pay them.  With the third, there is the question of student debt repayments, or there is a combination of all three.  Some people in the debate are sticking to their first preference, but if everybody sticks to their first preference, there is no way we will be able to come to an outcome and we will end up back at the <i>status quo<\/i>.  As I mentioned earlier, the <i>status quo<\/i>is probably the worst place we could end up.  The three options need to be considered together rather than saying one option is being ruled out because it has a negative aspect to it.  All the options have negative aspects and some positive aspects, depending on what one wants.  We cannot cite the negative character of any one option in isolation as if there was another way of funding it other than that.  These are overlapping circles, so we could end up with a hybrid system, and there is nothing to rule that out.<br\/><br\/>In a sense, the report has a home but it does not have the home which it normally would have, with a Minister promoting it.  Therefore, I have been asked by the Department to stay involved in explaining the report.  So far, from the feedback I have been getting, there would certainly appear to be general agreement on the investment requirements but, obviously, some level of understanding that the universities and the institutes of technology need to be more responsive to the needs I mentioned earlier.  However, it is when it comes to the funding requirements that the divergence occurs because people go to their first preference.  That is why I think it important that we do not end up back at the <i>status quo<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>It is important for the committee to realise that the <i>status quo<\/i>is not a cost-free option and it will actually leave us with deep costs in terms of the student experience, as I mentioned earlier.  At the moment, it also excludes a lot of young people from disadvantaged areas going to education, so by keeping the <i>status quo<\/i>, we would be saying that is what we are providing for.<br\/><br\/>Ultimately, obviously, it will affect the career opportunities of Irish graduates because we must remember we are operating in a European labour market.  Most of these companies people talk about are recruiting people across Europe, not just in Ireland, so they are competing against students from other countries for positions, particularly those in the newer companies.  There is then the overall contribution of higher education to our social and economic development which would also be affected.<br\/><br\/>The report concludes that we now have an opportunity to recommit ourselves and to reinvest in higher education.  Obviously, this committee has the opportunity to set a new level of ambition that would restore higher education, further education and apprenticeships as the key enabler in getting us from where we are now onto a much better trajectory.  The report concludes that whatever is done will require a comprehensive and fundamental change to our funding model, and we should have an open and considered debate on that.  Ultimately, we need to come to decisions and, in some way or other, they will have to be bold decisions, requiring decisive action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Cassells","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2558,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cassells for a very insightful presentation and also for setting it in the social and political context within which we find ourselves.

I should mention that I was not a member of the expert group and was not on the secretariat either.  My contribution to the report was to assist the group by sharing with them the results of research that I was undertaking on the viability of income-contingent loans in the Irish context.  That is the aspect of the report I will focus on because assessing the student loan option was my role.<\/p> <p>  The results of some of the analyses I have conducted are contained in the appendix to the report.  I will not go through these results in detail.  Instead, I will give a broad overview of the rationale for income-contingent student loans and the issues that need to be considered to implement such a system in a way that results in a level of repayments that is fiscally acceptable and that will not cause problems for the Exchequer while not placing an unreasonable burden on graduates.<\/p> <p>  I begin by explaining why income-contingent student loans are being considered as a way of funding investment in higher education in an increasing number of countries.  In these remarks, I will take it as given that students are expected to pay a contribution to the cost of their education.  I completely accept that is not necessarily the case, but that is the starting point I am going to work on, given my role in the report.<\/p> <p>  The key problem with charging fees for higher education is that, while returns to higher education are high on average, they are not the same for everyone.  They vary substantially according to the discipline studied, according to the employer and according to differences in life circumstances, such as illness, child care responsibilities and so on.  Given the risk of non-repayment if a student turns out to be one of the unlucky ones who ends up with low earnings, banks do not generally offer loans to students, so they must rely on their parents either to give them the money or to borrow on their behalf.  However, if parents do not have savings and do not have the ability to borrow, perhaps because they themselves have low earnings or no collateral to offer or a combination of both, some students who could benefit from higher education will not be able to access it, resulting in too few graduates being produced.  This is inefficient and also inequitable because those who cannot access funds are those whose parents are worst-off, resulting in intergenerational mobility being curtailed.  As we know and as Mr. Cassells mentioned, education is a key enabler of intergenerational mobility and plays a very important role in society.<\/p> <p>  Income-contingent loans, ICLs, are designed precisely to solve the problem of earnings risk.  The basic principle behind them is that repayments are made only to an extent that is affordable.  Affordability is ensured by placing an explicit cap on the proportion of earnings that can be taken up by repayments, and this is typically in the range of 5% to 10% in the countries that have introduced this.  Therefore, income-contingent student loan debt should not be thought of as debt in the usual sense.  It is a debt that has to be repaid only if the graduate can afford it.  Repayments fall to zero in months when earnings are low or zero.  Thus, there is no possibility of hardship due to loan repayments.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will know, ICLs have been introduced in several countries, including Australia, New Zealand, England and Hungary.  However, these systems differ from each other in the specifics of their designs.  Moreover, graduate earnings over the life cycle follow different paths in different countries.  Given these differences, these systems entail different repayment patterns and different levels of government subsidy.  Therefore, it is important to consider how alternative designs would work when applied to Irish graduate earnings.  That was my motivation for beginning this research, namely, to look at Irish data and to see whether these systems were viable in an Irish context.<\/p> <p>  The parameters of ICLs are the rules that govern whether and how quickly the loans are repaid.  These include the earnings threshold beyond which repayments start, the earnings base on which repayments are calculated, the rate at which repayments are made, the interest rate charged, if any, and the date at which outstanding debts are written off.  The total amount borrowed is also important in comparing alternative systems, a point Mr. Cassells also made.  In my work for the expert group, I considered how varying some of these parameters, especially the earnings base and the interest rate but also the amount borrowed, affects both the fiscal sustainability of the scheme and the affordability of repayments.  I will briefly explain these in turn.<\/p><p>Fiscal sustainability is typically measured using a figure that gives the proportion of the total debt that is not repaid.  This is often referred to as the government subsidy.  It is important to note that non-repayment of an ICL is a feature of the system, not a flaw.  ICLs are designed in order that those who do not benefit from their qualifications do not pay for them.  Nevertheless, it is important for fiscal planning to have a good idea of what the figure will be in advance of such a scheme's introduction.<\/p><p> Affordability can be measured in many different ways.  In my work, I calculated the number of years in which repayments were made, the proportion of gross and net earnings accounted for by the repayments, and the mean monthly payment averaged over the years of repayments.<\/p><p> To conduct the analysis of the various alternative schemes, the most important ingredient is a reasonable representation of graduate earnings across the entire distribution.  Knowing how the average or median graduate's earnings evolve over the life cycle is of little use because these graduates typically have no difficulty in repaying their loans in most systems, even the American one where the loan is like a mortgage.  It is the graduates towards the bottom of the earnings distribution that are of greatest concern.  Most of my work was to try to capture the earnings distribution of graduates.<\/p><p> I based my analysis for the expert group on a methodology I have used in joint research with Bruce Chapman of the Australian National University that models graduate earnings in great detail across the distribution and separately for men and women.  This latter point is important as women earn less than men over the life cycle and tend to work part time to a greater extent than men during the middle years of their careers.  That is true for graduates and non-graduates.<\/p><p> Once life cycle earnings profiles have been modelled, the analysis entails applying the rules of alternative schemes to those profiles and then taking into account labour force non-participation, unemployment and emigration.  In doing this, I assumed that 20% of graduates emigrate, with half of those, 10% of graduates, staying abroad permanently and another half leaving temporarily.  I made the conservative assumption that emigrants pay nothing towards their student loans while abroad.<\/p><p> A further conservative assumption that I made is that there will be no productivity growth in the economy in the future, a very pessimistic view, implying that real wages for graduates will stay at their current levels for the foreseeable future.  I should mention that in research I have completed since I contributed to the expert group's report, I have made the more realistic assumption that productivity growth of 1% per annum occurs, which is probably more realistic.  Given that 2% would typically have been made in the past, 1% is quite conservative.<\/p><p> To summarise the results regarding affordability, I found that for the parameter combinations considered, repayments are quite affordable, varying between &euro;100 and &euro;150 per month for a graduate with median life cycle earnings.  It will be less for graduates with lower earnings and sometimes zero if their earnings are low enough and higher for graduates with higher earnings.  The loan is typically paid off over ten to 15 years.  The longer times apply to scheme designs in which a positive real interest rate is charged, and where repayments are based on marginal income, only that portion of income above the threshold, rather than being based on total income once the earnings threshold has been reached.<\/p><p> In terms of the size of the Government subsidy required, I found that for the schemes where a positive real interest rate is charged, the estimated subsidy is about 30%.  This figure allows for time discounting, for repayments received in the future to be given lower value than repayments in the present, which is the sensible way to do things.  The discount rate I used is 2%, which is a fairly high rate.  Any productivity growth in the economy in years to come will lower the subsidy below this figure.<\/p><p> One lesson that came from the analysis I conducted is how important emigration is to the size of the subsidy.  The emigration scenario that I have assumed adds about 10% to the Government subsidy compared with a scenario with no emigration.  If a mechanism can be found to increase repayments by emigrant graduates above the zero level that I have assumed, the subsidy will be substantially reduced.<\/p><p> I wish to stress that I have investigated only a few of the many possible specifications of ICL student loan schemes.  As the expert group's report mentions, if an ICL were to be recommended, further research should be done before settling on the final combination of parameters that would govern the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2561,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Doris.  The issue of access for students, particularly those who come from socially disadvantaged backgrounds, came up in a couple of presentations.  That is a major priority for us for any new funding arrangement.  Do we accept that there is a danger that the introduction of student loans may serve as a deterrent to these students who wish to pursue full-time undergraduate courses?  Anecdotal evidence suggests that low income families may be very apprehensive about their children taking out significant loans.  Maintenance costs were mentioned in a separate context but would also be a big deterrent.  The presidents of the institutes of technology, ITs, made the point at our meeting on 10 November last that their cohort of students includes a larger group of disadvantaged students compared with universities.  They would require more significant supports.  Did the expert group fully take account of that distinct challenge in the IT sector?  Are there any views on the best way to structure the ICLs?  I am interested in the approaches made internationally.  The witnesses have said there are some disadvantages.  What type of loans would they single out as good examples and what are the models in other countries that would not be good or should be avoided?<\/p> <p>  We spoke in private session about the national training fund levy.  University presidents proposed that an increasing amount of the large surplus in the fund would be directed towards higher education and that the employer contribution be increased.  What are the witnesses' views on that?<\/p> <p>  What type of indicators would be suitable to measure quality and verification to measure how effectively money has been spent?  Accountability is significant.  That was the subject of some comment in our previous meeting in terms of gaining and winning public support too, because as Mr. Cassells said, we are competing with the health sector and many other areas and within the education sector for the money that needs to be spent in primary, secondary and special education.<\/p> <p>  Will Dr. Doris put the Government subsidy into the international context?  She assumes emigrants will pay nothing towards their student loans while abroad.  There is a fundamental inequity if that is the case.  Could there be a mechanism to allow graduates accelerate repayments of loans?  For example, graduates who have significant earnings in their early careers could pay those off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#N00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479978000,"counter":2562,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.09 a.m. and resumed at 11.20 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2563,"content":"<p>Deputy Thomas Byrne was the first to indicate, but he is not here.

One of my questions is around the loan schemes, although I admit that I hate to start with it.  With the loan scheme, we will see an increase in fees of &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000.  Looking at the Australian model, there was a different economic climate when it was introduced.  Our young people face an intergenerational debt burden in Ireland which is miles apart from the context in Australia.  Was that taken into consideration?  Why was the Australian model chosen rather than a fairer model like the Dutch model, which seems much better to me?  Perhaps the witnesses can speak to that.  Both speakers referred to migration in the context of repaying loans, however, they did not talk about it in terms of us losing talent or whether the loans would act as an incentive to migrate leading to the loss of good graduates rather than it just being a matter of the State absorbing the cost of their loans or fees.<\/p> <p>  My other question relates to access and participation.  Both speakers referred to disadvantaged students and the worst off and the ways in which a loan scheme could increase access or has, in some cases, elsewhere.  I find that logically difficult to understand.  If we say that free fees did not work, can we also say that poor children were just waiting until they would have to pay the fee at a later date?  It makes no sense.  It means the poor child is saying, \"I am not going to go to college while the fees are free but I am going to go when there is a loan in place which I will have to repay later\".  I do not understand how this impacts those students at all because that is not logical.  I see a further unfairness in a loan system.  As a mother, I am now in a position to pay my children's fees for college, which I will whether there is a loan scheme or not.  A child from a less well-off family with no income does not have the option or choice whereas children from better-off backgrounds do.  If the latter do not choose the loans, their parents will, in many cases, continue to pay.  It is still those kids from more disadvantaged areas who do not have an option.  The choice is taken away from them.  Can the witnesses speak to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#P00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2565,"content":"<p>I thank both of the speakers and the whole team for the exceptionally valuable work they have done in producing the report.  It is exceptionally important that we act on it sooner rather than later.  In the engagement with the heads of all of our third-level institutions nationally there was obviously discussion around funding to support that third-level structure, but was there any discussion around the autonomy afforded to the heads of those institutions as to how they spend funding within their own universities and institutes of technology, respectively?  Was there any discussion around giving them greater freedom or autonomy to spend those funds as they see fit to maximise the benefit to their students in terms of recruitment of academics, incentivisation and developing a culture of excellence in each institution?  Do the witnesses see any further autonomy being given to the heads of our institutions as to how they spend the resources that are available to them?<\/p> <p>  We were very fortunate to be able to engage with the heads of all of those institutions a couple of weeks ago in this very room.  There was significant discussion at that time around the national training levy and the fact that it is now running a surplus, albeit a fairly small one.  There was also discussion of how that might be further leveraged to support third-level education given that it is the mechanism whereby most of industry contributes at the moment, predominantly to the FET sector.  While our young people saw FET as an end in itself 30 or 40 years ago, it is increasingly the case that it offers a very clear and structured progression route through to third level.  On that basis, would the witnesses support a diversion of a significant amount of the training levy to third level and a consequent increase in the contribution towards that levy from industry itself?<\/p> <p>  We are all very much aware that the cost per student of education in a third-level structure depends very much on the course a student is participating in.  For example, while the average cost of providing education per student is approximately &euro;8,000, the cost for a medical student is &euro;30,000 per annum.<\/p><p>Some jurisdictions have looked at banding the fees that would somehow be subsumed into a loan structure.  On the basis that those who avail of those higher cost courses would expect to see a significant boost in their income as a result of participating in those courses, was there any exploration of the banding structure and subsuming it into our structure?  I think one existed in Australia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#P00300","speaker":"1241","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2567,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na finn&eacute;ithe ar fad agus gabhaim comhghairdeachas le Ms Forbes agus an tUasal Esslemont as ucht a gceapach&aacute;in.

We had a very interesting conversation yesterday about rural development.  It taps into what the witnesses said about access and participation from a geographical perspective.  We have some really good examples, for example, the furniture college in Letterfrack that is under the auspices of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta Gaeilge in Carraroe, which is a satellite campus.  Sometimes the issue of people participating is about geographical access, being able to pay for accommodation if they leave their home place, transport facilities, etc.  Have the witnesses had any opportunity to look at devolved education as opposed to a centralised model where it is all on the one campus in a large urban area?  Should we be looking at funding more devolved education in rural areas?  It would have the knock-on effect of rejuvenating rural areas and local schools and communities as well as providing educational benefit.<\/p> <p>  I am very interested to hear the witnesses say that social class grading at postgraduate level is re-emerging.  The cutting of the postgraduate grant was really cynical.  Will the witnesses elaborate on how that is borne out in the statistics?  Concerns have been voiced about the liberal arts in third level being dumbed down in favour of the more vocational courses - what are seen as the practical engineering, mathematics and scientific sectors which would be more vocationally orientated - to get people into the workforce.<\/p> <p>  Have the witnesses looked at non-academic issues in funding in third level.   The amount that is spent on legal fees and consultants in third level education is raised with me regularly.  Vast sums of money are being spent on investigations and reports - up to &euro;500,000 in some cases.  Have the witnesses had a chance to look at how that money is being spent and how it could be better used?<\/p> <p>  In respect of procurement and outsourcing, many agency workers are being brought in.  Is that saving money in third level institutions or is it costing more money in the long run?  Do the witnesses have any thoughts about how that should be reformed?  The witnesses also said that students are borrowing significant sums of money.  I see that regularly.  Students who contact me are doing two or three jobs in restaurants and bars so they are struggling.  Is it feasible even to contemplate bringing in a loan scheme that will affect them down the line?  Does Dr. Doris's model take into consideration that these people will be getting married, could to go to work in Dublin or Galway where the rents are very high and will have mortgages, children and health care costs?  It would seem to me that one of the arguments put forward against the loan idea is that people will be on very modest incomes anyway and will be trying to get on to the property ladder and make a life for themselves and that having another debt around their neck before they even start is a very detrimental step.

Mr. Cassells mentioned that the <i>status quo<\/i>is not an option.  I made a point here last week when I spoke to the heads of the universities that we have run out of road on this issue.  I was told that not only have we run out of road but an articulated lorry is coming up behind us.  It highlights that doing nothing or maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>is not an option.<\/p><p>My concerns about a loan system, which have been articulated by a number of speakers, is that the thought of a loan would be enough for low-income families to ignore third level because they might not have much experience or knowledge of loans.  This would be a shame.  The one thing we must keep in mind is that regardless of the option we decide to choose, it should not deter access but promote it for as many people as possible.  This must be the key driver.  The witnesses mentioned how a 1% increase in the employer's contribution could yield an extra &euro;50 million per annum.  How much further scope is there for employers to pay into the system?<\/p><p>In respect of how the universities and institutes of technology function, has much work being done on how efficient they are?  Is there room for improvement in how they spend the resources allocated and if so, where do those resources lie?  On the face of it, option number one would seem to be the safest option in that the State provides the funding and access is there for all who might require it.  The only problem with that is that it is dependent on the Government to increase funding from the current 60% to 80% at a time when there are a number of challenges on the horizon from the economic perspective such as Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the US.  All these issues are of concern to a varying degree and could have a negative impact on our economy, which is very much exposed to outside factors, as we all know.  It would appear to be the fairest way if we could get a commitment that this funding would be increased long-term rather than being year to year, but therein lies the challenge.  The job of this committee is to debate after we have heard all the contributions and try to find a solution or a recommendation we can put forward.  Ultimately, it is important to point out that it is not this committee that will decide.

The report outlines a cost of &euro;450 million to reduce student-staff ratios at third level to 14:1.  Do we have a breakdown of the other initiatives the report envisages and their costs?  How much will increasing the core grant to higher education institutions cost?  Are staff costs included in the core funding increase?

I met a delegation from the University of Worcester in the UK who told me that the loan system is failing miserably.  There is significant concern about it in countries that have implemented it.  I know the report states that there is a 31% repayment rate among graduates in the UK, but is there any evidence that the number of graduates who emigrate has increased as a result of the student loan scheme?  A significant number of graduates already emigrate so has there been any consideration of this?  Could the witnesses clarify the State subsidy for 30% and what that means for State finances?

Needless to say, I fully concur that higher education has been at the heart of the country's transformation and needs to be fully restored to make it a key enabler of future development.  Access is a key concern and one I share with other members.  I taught in a DEIS school in Dublin for more than 16 years and I have known children who were the first in their family to attend college.  Choosing to go to college is a major decision for such children and their families.  It is important, therefore, that such children can make a smooth transition into third level education.  I am concerned that a loans system would cause a child from a disadvantaged background to stop and wonder if he or she or his or her family are willing to take on the burden of a loan.  This factor must be taken into consideration.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant deficit in third level supports for students with mental health issues.  We hear, for example, of waiting lists of 18 months to access services and many universities and institutes of technology have noted a marked increase in the number of students with mental health issues.  As the witnesses pointed out, the current system fails to recognise the pressures placed on families and students by fees and high living and maintenance costs.  We must not increase the pressures and burden on students as this would cause even greater mental health problems when supports are not available to them.<\/p> <p>  It is assumed that 20% of graduates will emigrate and 10% will remain abroad permanently.  It is a serious concern that a loans scheme would incentivise graduates to stay abroad permanently on the basis of a conservative assumption that they would not repay any of the loan while living abroad.  Would a loans scheme result in the country bleeding its most talented graduates?  That is a major concern.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. Cassells to elaborate on the loans students may face.  He indicated that smaller student-teacher ratios are a desired outcome of a student loans system.  The student-teacher ratio varies significantly between colleges and courses.  Is it possible that, for example, students studying architecture would end up with a larger student loan than, for example, business studies students given the differences in funding required to run architecture and business courses?  The former are more labour and materials intensive than the latter.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cassells noted that the presidents of the universities appeared before the joint committee two weeks ago.  At that meeting, they stated that the national training fund is projected to be in substantial surplus by the end of 2017, to the tune of &euro;272 million?  What are the witnesses' views on the possibility of directing some of this surplus into funding third level education?  How precisely does he envisage this would be done?<\/p> <p>  If additional moneys are to be allocated to third level education, how can we ensure they go directly to students?  There is a consensus in the health sector that money should follow the patient.  How can we ensure that, where funding to third level is increased, the money will follow the student to ensure it yields an improved student experience and better learning outcomes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#R00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2572,"content":"<p>I apologise to the two witnesses for leaving during their presentation.

I acknowledge that all options must be considered.<\/p> <p>  I was pleased the report refers to lifelong learning, which should be encouraged from a young age.  I do not believe sufficient emphasis is placed on lifelong learning.<\/p> <p>  From my experience of the University of Limerick and Limerick Institute of Technology, I am aware that they co-operate with local companies and tailor some of their courses towards the needs of industry.

I am concerned about the quality of the student experience both at undergraduate and master's level.  Without a doubt, one can have large and successful class sizes for lectures but it becomes much more difficult if additional resources are not available to give students a personalised experience.  At the previous meeting, a number of speakers referred to the social and mental health pressures that students experience.  Greater contact with staff can substantially improve the student experience of third level education.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses have a view on the way in which third level staff are being recruited?  How do recruitment policies impact on the quality of institutions and the experience of students?  In the past decade, universities and colleges have shifted towards a model of limited staff contracts that are subject to constant renewal.  In our system, many third level staff do not secure tenure in the traditional manner.  I am not sure if the witnesses were able to identify the extent of this practice but it is especially difficult for women.<\/p> <p>  People doing PhDs are often offered welcome and supportive teaching hours while doing their PhD and this may continue for one year or two years after completing the PhD.  While they have a reasonable expectation of making a career in third level education, many of them never move on to a tenured position.  This is a significant problem.  In STEM subjects, for example, unless one is in an environment where there are many campus companies and employers in which PhD students can secure well paid jobs, it can be very depressing and demoralising and the system can lose very good people.<\/p> <p>  I will raise a concern I expressed at previous meetings.  The Teaching Council has moved to a two-year model for the postgraduate teaching qualification.  Finding funding for these courses will be a significant challenge to students because postgraduate fees are set at upwards of &euro;5,000 per annum.  I assume the current rate will apply to all the third level institutions.  I do not know if much consideration has been given to this issue.  Many of those who come through access programmes are attracted to teaching because it is a way of securing a job and they are often attracted to teaching because their experience of education will have been very positive.  I worry that students from working class backgrounds will be unable to afford postgraduate courses in education.  Did the witnesses give any thought to that issue?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of funding, my preference is for a combination of State funding and the use of the national training fund.  The fund has a major and positive role to play in this regard.  We need employers to buy into third level education.<\/p><p>I am very concerned that there are so few structures around the national training fund which would prevent it being raided for other purposes, for instance, for paying social welfare.  The overall Social Insurance Fund has come from a deficit five years ago of &euro;2.8 billion to being in surplus this year and next, and increasingly in surplus.  I wonder if the witnesses have a strategic view of how the national training fund should be managed.  I believe it has been underspending on apprentices and apprenticeship-type education.  That process has been slow.  From my knowledge of Germany, Austria and France, in particular, where they operate the dual model, I support an increase in the national training fund and I put forward in the recent budget proposals that some of the fund would go to third level.  It would also involve employers more in their contribution to third level given that it is not just society generally that will benefit in that employers will benefit from having very high quality graduates which we know is a very big draw, especially for foreign direct investment coming into Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#R00400","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2575,"content":"<p>I will interrupt the Deputy there as I must suspend the meeting.

I will comment on access, the national training levy and then a range of issues relating to how the system works at the moment in terms of accountability, staffing and costs and then Dr. Doris will deal with the questions relating to the operation of a loan system.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Byrne is right in what he said about the scheme.  We struggled with the issue.  At one stage, we called them deferred fees.  We tried to say it is not a debt in the usual sense because one does not have to pay it if one does not have the resources.  At one stage the idea of calling it a graduate tax was in the frame.  The way to look at it is as a deferred fees scheme.  It is not a debt.  If one considers it as a graduate tax then one is repaying the cost of one's education as a result of the significant benefits one got.  One only pays if one goes over a certain amount for a specific period.  One of the questions the Chairman raised at the beginning was about public engagement and winning public support for the scheme.  In our consultations we brought many groups together and spoke to many people.  There is no doubt about the great support for the contribution made by higher education and the investment that is required but there was less consensus on how one would fund it.  What Deputy Byrne said is correct and the public funding element, as you raised, Chairman, is also important.<\/p> <p>  The overall point I made in response to the three categories of question is that at the end of the day a lot depends on the scale of one's ambition in terms of what one believes is required to put higher education back in as the key enabler, because that determines the level of increase in funding one needs and it, therefore, determines how one is going to fund it.  For example, a number of the questions refer to the fact, and Senator Robbie Gallagher mentioned it, that option one, which is a fully-funded State scheme, appears to deal with the question of access and certainty.  The question we had to ask ourselves, and which members have to ask themselves, is what is the increase in taxation that will be needed to fund the &euro;600 million required between now and 2021, in addition to the other demands such as health and housing.  If we say it will be a fully-funded State system and that will be the level of ambition we are talking about and we tell students and their parents that is what we are doing and then we do not put in the money or do not say to them that it will require an increase in taxation of X amount, because that is the scale of the funding we need, that is where the difficulty will arise.<\/p> <p>  In terms of access, as Senator Ruane rightly said, half the people at the moment have their fees paid for them, and we discovered that the big difficulty was in two areas.  The first concerns those who are just over the threshold and who have enormous difficulties in paying the &euro;3,000 but the second issue is the maintenance and grant system.<\/p><p>The maintenance and grant system needs to be radically reformed.  In terms of policy and the political system, there are two or three reports knocking around on this issue but people have always backed off from doing it.  If the option of a State-funded scheme is taken, something significant will have to be done on maintenance, perhaps by way of the tax system.  If the second option of increasing State support while maintaining the &euro;3,000 fee is taken, more will need to be done on the maintenance side to address the barrier of the &euro;3,000 fee for low-income families.  The income contingent loan option has all of the difficulties mentioned by members but it would allow for the retention of State investment in the system albeit in a different way.  This would allow for reform of the maintenance system to ensure students of lower-income families can afford the cost of going to college.  The reason some students are not going to college is because they cannot afford to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Cassells","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2590,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Mr. Cassells but I disagree with him on his last point.

Regardless of what new funding system is chosen - I am not steering the committee in any particular direction - there will be a need for a radical access programme that deals with career development, career guidance, DEIS schools, funding and so on and at the same time tries to address the barriers - such as the cost of living, travel, income foregone and the current &euro;3,000 fee - for students with the capability of benefitting from education.  If the ambitious level of funding being talked about is to be realised, the issue of what to do with the &euro;3,000 fee remains.  It cannot be increased because of the impacts it will have yet it will need to be increased if that model of funding is chosen.  For this reason, all three options will need to be considered together.  If they are considered in isolation each one will lead to a dead end.  The fully State-funded system will lead to the dead end in terms of the significant tax increases that will be required.  Option two will lead to the dead end of the &euro;3,000 fee still being in place, what to do in regard to maintenance and the need to examine whether taxation can be increased to support State funding.  Option three also could lead to a dead end if one believes people could be adverse to doing this.  It also is important to ensure the wrong model is not introduced.  For this reason, we believe an implementation group should be established to oversee this process.<\/p> <p>  One the point raised by Senator Ruane, we did look at the Dutch model.  The only cost incurred by the group was in respect of my meeting on this issue in Amsterdam.  The Dutch model is maintenance based.  They introduced income contingent loans not in respect of the student contribution but in respect of maintenance and State grants.  As I said earlier, we could end up with a hybrid system.  Nobody should be thinking that we have to choose one option or the other.  We could end up with a hybrid for two reasons, one of which is that it is what is acceptable.  There is not much point coming up with something that is not implementable.  We need a system that is capable of being implemented.  It may that that is what is best suited to Irish circumstances right now.  <\/p> <p>  On the national training levy, the State might want to invest a particular amount but that raises the difficulty of raising taxation and in terms of the demands of health services, housing and so on.  There is a temptation to suggest the &euro;600 million in the national training levy, or a sizeable portion of it, should be transferred to the training fund.  The question that then arises is do we want a higher education system which is funded in part by industry and employers.  If we go down that road, we will be heading towards the American system.  We suggest that there are three beneficiaries, one being employers, although not only multinationals but the State and the health service as an employer, local enterprises and so on.  A 0.1% increase in that levy would provide &euro;50 million, which would go a long way towards supporting graduates into those industries.  Apprenticeships are now moving up to high-end manufacturing.  Many apprenticeships, particularly under the Danish and German models, are a step towards degree level programmes and even to PhD level.  I do not think the training levy fund should be raided just because we are short of money.  It should be viewed as an integral part of our funding system in the context of the benefits it provides to employers, with the decision in terms of an increase being made on that basis.  We have suggested an increase of 0.1% for illustrative purposes but the increase can be whatever percentage the committee decides, bearing in mind that there should be no additional costs for companies competing in the context of Brexit.  <\/p> <p>  The third issue was raised by a number of speakers, including Deputy Nolan.  The report sets out the breakdown of costs for each of the areas.  For example, it shows that the average increase in the demographics would be approximately 3,000 students per year.  This would require an additional 350 staff, with the final cost being approximately &euro;25 million.  If the committee would like a more detailed breakdown, I am happy to have one forwarded to it.  The report also shows that in terms of the reduction in the student ratio, in respect of which a reduction from 20:1 to 14:1 was mentioned, the cost for each point of movement is &euro;60 million.  It can be and has been done.  All of the necessary detailed figures are available.  <\/p> <p>  Deputies Catherine Martin and Cannon asked how we ensure we get the required outcome from this investment.  The report is very strong about this not being a question of giving funding to the institutions but a question of the student experience because that is what determines the capabilities we have for the future in terms of jobs, the economy, societal challenges and so on.  We have to ensure the investment is made at the front line.  We dealt with the notion of accountable autonomy.  The institutions argue for autonomy but we are arguing for accountable autonomy such that institutions would agree a compact with the Higher Education Authority on what percentage of students from particular backgrounds, in terms of access, they would commit to; what programmes they would provide; how they would be evaluated; the quality of programmes; student ratio and so on.  That is the basis on which funding would be provided.  If institutions want to do research and so on they are free to seek philanthropic funding for that or to apply for grants under Horizon 2020.  If they want public investment they will have to agree a compact with the Higher Education Authority that could be rolled out over three to five years in order to provide certainty in terms of funding over that period but which would be evaluated on an annual basis in terms of the contribution being made.  That is important because the committee will hear much argument in favour of autonomy.<\/p><p>I would give autonomy in one area - Deputy Cannon hinted at it.  Once they have been allocated the resources, they should be allowed to deploy the staffing in the way that is required.  At the moment there is the employment control framework introduced because of the difficulties arising from the crash.  That meant they had to go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, almost, to get authority for it.  Now that that can be devolved and they are advised what their staffing budget is, they can decide what they require in terms of the types of people and the levels of qualification but stay within the budget.  It would be possible to devolve a significant level of flexibility to the universities and the institutes of technology once a staffing budget is set for them to give them the flexibility as to who they want rather than having to get central approval for every one of them.<br\/><br\/>I will cover one other item before asking Dr. Doris to deal with the income-contingent loans, ICLs.  A lot of detailed technical work went on behind some of these areas.  If the committee members want a briefing - it does not necessarily have to be in public session - on the modelling done etc., I would be quite happy to have people make it available to them in order that they are not looking at things blind and wondering<i><\/i>what might happen in certain scenarios.  It is fair enough for the committee members to ask what would happen if it were taken a stage further and done in a particular way and whether that could be made available to the committee.  I would be happy enough to make that available to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Cassells","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2593,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cassells.

Let me talk about that first and then come back to access and some of the other things that came up.<\/p> <p>  One of the difficulties in trying to incorporate emigration into the modelling is that there is a dearth if information about emigration, which is remarkable considering how much a feature of our society it is.  It is clearly the standout issue when trying to work out whether an income-contingent loan would work.  I took a guess at 20%.  I subsequently found that an OECD study, which tried to calculate graduate emigration across different countries, estimated it at 21% of the stock of graduates.  I was happy to see my guess was not too far out.  It is higher than other countries.  I believe that of all the OECD countries, it was the highest.  The next closest was New Zealand, which has an income-contingent loan system.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, we have an idea that the proportion of graduate emigrants is about 20% in any given year, but we do not know whether they are abroad temporarily or permanently.  Again I made a guess that the proportion is about 50:50.  When emigrants come back, the repayment is not a problem because they slot back in.  It delays things and sets the repayment schedule back a bit.  It is a different matter with permanent emigrants.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, one of the big concerns is whether this would incentivise emigration or prevent return migration.  Although we know there are some positive aspects to emigration, most of us see it as a negative thing.  I have not seen any economic research on this for Ireland, but there is some research for Australia.  It seems that the factors determining return migration are actually not economic but are mostly to do with life cycle.  When people get to the stage of having children, they come home.  If that is important to them, they come home even if they take a hit on their standard of living.  On that limited basis, I would not be too concerned about preventing return migration.<\/p> <p>  However, there is very little evidence on the impact of student loans on outward migration.  Deputy Nolan asked if there was any evidence of increasing emigration by graduates in the UK.  I have seen no commentary on that, which makes me think it is not an issue, but the UK is starting from a lower base than we do.  It has less graduate emigration to start with.  As far as I understand it, an increase in graduate migration as a result of the student loan system there has not been an issue.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked about the size of the subsidy compared with other countries.  In the absence of emigration, it is similar to other countries.  That is why I say that emigration is key.  Based on how I looked it, it would add about 10% to the subsidy, which is not inconsiderable but would not completely destroy the system either.  I have assumed that emigrants do not pay anything while abroad, which is not necessarily the case.  Other countries have started to try to work on how to bring emigrants in.  I agree that it would be inequitable and would be perceived as very unfair by those left behind if emigrants did not have to pay anything.  There may be exceptions to this, but broadly speaking graduates want to be legally compliant.<\/p> <p>  While it has only recently been introduced and we do not know how it will work, Australia has made it a legal requirement for graduates to pay a minimum amount of their loans every year while they are abroad.  People have to send that money home.  In that way, it loses the income contingency aspect, which is a negative, but it is set at $1,000 a year and so is not excessive.  It is manageable and graduates can chip away at it.  I think that is probably the way to go.  Realistically we will not get 100% repayment from emigrants, but if we could get even a majority of it repaid on that basis, it would make a substantial difference to the size of the subsidy that was required and also counteract the feelings of inequity.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne is exactly right on the access issue.  Income-contingent loans do not result in debt as we usually mean debt.  It is a debt that only has to be repaid if it is affordable.  People understand that when they take the loans out.  I accept a little bit of education will be required for school leavers, as has been done in the UK, to make them understand that this is not debt in the usual sense.  There is evidence that lower-income people have a higher degree of risk aversion.  The whole point of income-contingent loans is that it reduces the risk enormously and the students entering these systems understand that.  When the fees in the UK went from &pound;3,000 to &pound;9,000 practically overnight, many people expected a big drop-off in participation by the lower socioeconomic groups, but it has not materialised at all.  One of the reasons is that the students understand that they will not have to repay this if they cannot afford it.  The key thing is to make it affordable.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Byrne asked about the &euro;37,000 income.  I have done a quick tot and I hope I have done it correctly.  We ran a couple of different scenarios using different parameters.  It depends on whether we have a system based on marginal income - that is income just over the threshold - in which case the loan repayments would be calculated on the difference between &euro;37,000 and &euro;26,000, or whether it would be calculated on the total income because that &euro;37,000 would be over the threshold.  Using the marginal basis, it would be &euro;73 a month and using the total basis it would be &euro;123 a month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2595,"content":"<p>Would that be for a period of ten-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#V00400","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2596,"content":"<p>That would be while the person was on &euro;37,000, because it would go up as they progress up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#V00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2597,"content":"<p>How long does it take to pay off?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#V00600","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2598,"content":"<p>Up to 15 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#V00700","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2599,"content":"<p>It depends.  The further down the income distribution one is, the lower one's monthly repayments and the longer the repayment period.  One pays a smaller amount over a longer period of time.  People on very high incomes can repay the loans in four or five years.  That gives one an idea of the order of magnitude involved.<br\/><br\/>By setting the loan repayment rate, whether at 8% of margin, 2% of total or whatever, one is setting the level one thinks is affordable.  It is up to policymakers to decide on that.  Nothing is set in stone that states the rate has to be 2%, 8% or whatever.  One can decide on the level of repayments one thinks is acceptable and pick the one that gives that level.  The beauty of these loans is that the maximum of a person's income they can take up is set by law, unlike standard mortgage-type loans where if one becomes ill or unemployed one still has to make repayments which can be a disaster and result in poor credit ratings for those who default.  That is the beauty of these schemes.  If, at the end of one's working life one still has not repaid the loan it does not follow one to one's grave.<br\/><br\/>If students do not have upfront fees to pay and see them being postponed in a way they think is affordable, the key issue then becomes the maintenance grant.  Many issues of access raised by the committee are more related to maintenance grants.  One of the major strengths of the report is that it envisages substantial reform of the maintenance grant system at the same time which, it could be argued, is only possible if there is some contribution to fees from students.  <br\/><br\/>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned geographic inequalities.  One of the reasons that students from poorer backgrounds tend to attend local colleges is because grants do not allow them to attend any other institutions.  Grant are the only way they can possibly afford to attend college.  It is not optimal for people to choose courses solely based on proximity.  If people want to study architecture in Dublin, we would like them to be able to do so.  The aspect of the report that emphasises the importance of maintenance grant is significant.<br\/><br\/>I agree with Senator Ruane that intergenerational debt burdens are an important issue.  The report comes at a time when we know the crisis has impacted most negatively on young people.  There have been cuts to unemployment benefit and pay for entry level jobs has fallen.  Younger people suffered more than anyone else during the crisis.<br\/><br\/>It is important to decide what level of burden one thinks is affordable and set the parameters in a way that provides affordability.  It would also be really unfair to students if they are receiving a quality of education that is getting progressively worse.  We are not doing anybody any favours by doing that.  We have to believe that leaving the <i>status quo<\/i>in place is damaging young people which is not good for anyone.  We need to take that into account when making decisions.<br\/><br\/>Bruce Chapman, with whom I have worked, said that when student loans were first introduced in Australia they were very much resented by the students who would be impacted by them first, but within a few years they thought the system was completely reasonable and fair.  The students saw they were affordable, manageable and allowed them to attend university.<br\/><br\/>Deputy O'Loughlin asked which model we should go for.  I do not think we have to go for any one country's model of income contingent loans, if that is the preference.  We definitely should not go anywhere near the UK model; it is heading down a very negative road.  The schemes in Australia and New Zealand differ in several ways.  In New Zealand, one starts paying at a much lower income threshold.  I am not sure I agree with that model.  The Australian system is quite good, but it ran into problems when expanding to private sector providers which is something that needs to be considered in terms of regulation.  If it is decided to allow private sector providers to access student loans, the system will need to be very carefully regulated.  A lot of profiteering took place in Australia which increased the cost enormously without achieving much.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#W00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2600,"content":"<p>Did that expand the cost to the state or to individual students?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#W00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2601,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2602,"content":"<p>There was a loan system and the state still-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#W00400","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2603,"content":"<p>It increased the cost to the state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2604,"content":"<p>The state has the subsidy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#W00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Cassells"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2605,"content":"<p>The state was picking up the tab.

Our courses require the highest CAO points of all engineering courses nationally.  I speak today from my experience as head of the UCD school of mechanical and materials engineering.  In doing so, I point to the key areas where additional resources would be applied if the Cassells report's proposals on funding were implemented.<\/p> <p>  Student numbers entering first year engineering have risen by 20% in the past ten years, from 250 to 300 per annum.  These extra students include EU and non-EU students.  We need to provide additional supports for these students because of the wider spread of mathematics ability across this wider student cohort coming from the leaving certificate, and to support our non-EU and mature students.  Budgets for these supports were used previously for small group learning opportunities for our students via teaching assistants, tutorials and laboratory attendants.  Taught masters student numbers have also increased dramatically.  Ten years ago, my own school delivered only one taught masters programme to complement our honours BE degree in mechanical engineering; we now lead nine such programmes.  This welcome growth has been largely in response to market needs in key industry sectors, including energy and biomedical engineering, but it led directly to my student-staff ratio exceeding 27:1 two years ago.<\/p> <p>  The FTE student cohort across our five engineering schools has increased by more than 35% since 2008.  A key challenge for staff on our taught programmes is to provide good student feedback and to have small-group interactions with students.  This can only be done with adequate student-staff ratios.  International comparators indicate ratios of less than 15:1 in leading engineering schools, and less than 10:1 in the world&rsquo;s top ranked universities.<\/p> <p>  A constant concern that we face is how to ensure that the quality of education provided to our students does not diminish.  Two issues make this increasingly difficult to achieve, despite the constant use of newer technologies.  We have fewer postgraduate research students.  These people largely deliver the supports I mentioned earlier.  Academics have increasingly less time or capacity to carry out research with PhD students and post-docs and to seek the competitive funding that supports them.  Within my own engineering school, we previously budgeted approximately &euro;100,000 per annum to pay these as teaching assistants.  It is almost ten years since our budget permitted this.<\/p> <p>  The lack of adequate space is an acute problem.  In my own school, the dramatic growth in our taught student numbers has meant that rooms and laboratory spaces that were previously available for students for project work are almost in constant use for classroom and teaching purposes.  Effectively, our students now have no dedicated space available to them for project work in our computer rooms, our workshops or our laboratories.<\/p> <p>  When I joined UCD, there were eight full-time technicians in our workshop.  Last year, we had only two full-time technicians here.  A key requirement underpinning the quality of our engineering programmes is the workshop, laboratory and hands-on project support that technicians provide as a major part of all students' training.  The vast majority of the laboratory teaching equipment in my school is at the limit of its useful service life and its residual value has depreciated to zero.  In the past five years, since I have been head of school, we have only spent approximately &euro;50,000 to either repair or replace such equipment.  Putting this figure in context, less than 0.5% of my annual operating budget is available for this.<\/p> <p>  Engineering at UCD is very ambitious for its research and innovation activities.  The relationship between these and our teaching and learning activities is deeply intertwined, impacting positively on the experience our undergraduate students have when they work on cutting-edge topics with our research students.  We have a diverse research income stream, with 40% coming from Science Foundation Ireland, including direct funding for two research professors in the areas of precision manufacturing and the Internet of things.  The EU provides one quarter of our research funding and we are home to five ERC awardees.  Industry provides a similar level of funding for research equipment and for people.  However, the key factor that is beginning to limit our ambitions and future successes is the availability of suitable laboratory and office space to carry out engineering research.<\/p> <p>  In the last decade, there have been nine spin-out companies from UCD engineering, including OxyMem, which develops novel wastewater treatments and is the only Irish Global Cleantech 100 company; APC, which employs 60 people and is recruiting a further 100 for its Cherrywood premises; and BiancaMed, now part of ResMed, which specialises in non-contact sleep monitoring equipment and is based at NexusUCD.<\/p><p>In summary, it is talent and innovation that will be key to developing Ireland's future indigenous industries and sustaining manufacturing multinational companies here.  Education and research are fundamental to this.  We simply must address the gaps in our higher education system as it is the foundation of our future economic growth and a vibrant society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael Gilchrist","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2620,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members.  I am dean of research at Trinity College Dublin and a former director of the CRANN institute.  As such, I will speak to the committee from the perspective of the student pipeline, the training necessary and the impact in terms of innovation.  As a nation, we share a deep understanding of the value of education which provides the single biggest economic return to the State and the individual.  Ireland's future prosperity, like that of other developed nations, depends on the quality of the education we provide to our citizens.  Universities are now recognised as the engines of modern economies, generating talent, engaging with enterprise and creating new ideas and the technologies of tomorrow.  Universities are Ireland's front line in the global battle for talent.<\/p> <p>  Our economic ambitions are embodied in Innovation 2020 which details the investment needed for Ireland to become a technology leader.  The entire Innovation 2020 strategy assumes a well-resourced and fully-functional third-level sector.  Despite our shared values and stated ambitions, years of underinvestment have brought the Irish university system to breaking point, a crisis heightened by the emergence of protectionist ideologies in the UK and USA.  As a small open economy, we compete in an increasingly complex and globalised world.  Increasingly, we do so without the capacity to develop our human capital fully.  The competition for talent is intense and knows no national boundaries.  Every day, we hear of demand for skilled workers and many of these positions are now being filled by overseas talent.  Our situation is perilous with our corporation tax advantage being eroded and the emergence of tax barriers jeopardising our position as a European hub.  Maximising the potential of our indigenous talent is our only realistic strategy.  There is no plan B.<\/p> <p>  The decline in third level funding is well documented.  For example, Trinity's income from the Exchequer has dropped from 80% of total income to just 40% in the last ten years.  Trinity has done everything possible to cut costs and generate new income and those cuts have had a significant impact.  Class sizes have increased dramatically and small group teaching, a central provision of third level, is becoming impossible.  Students in science and technology take fewer laboratory practicals while humanities' students get the bare minimum of contact hours.  To be honest, we cannot right now meet the needs of our own students and truly have little capacity to attract the best students from overseas.  If left unchecked, this situation risks dumbing down the courses we offer and ultimately the loss of accreditation of professional degrees.  Even new income streams pose challenges.  We now face the very real risk of replacing qualified Irish students with less qualified non-EU students.  We are also shutting off sources of philanthropic funding as donors are increasingly unwilling to fill the gap left by the shortfall in State support for public universities.  This is a really serious problem.<\/p> <p>  An immediate consequence of underfunding is a slide in Irish universities down the international rankings tables.  There is a direct and unambiguous correlation between our ranking level and funding into the system.  Rankings are imperfect but they really matter in a globalised world.  Many countries will no longer provide scholarships to their students to study abroad in poorly ranked universities, which closes off that income stream.  Even now, the IDA is being challenged to explain the disconnect between the talent pool we have on offer and the rankings of our universities.  That disconnect is real and obvious.<\/p> <p>  As parents we are heavily vested in primary and secondary education, taking active roles in our children's schoolwork and extra-curricular activities.  It is not so for third level.  Admission to university is often seen by parents as the end of the journey and the culmination of hard work rather than as an important step along the path of lifelong learning.  The result is a completely unjustified confidence in the health of the third-level sector with profound consequences for the public support of Irish universities.  We need a more holistic view of education which recognises the benefits it provides to the State and the individual.<\/p> <p>  The third-level sector is in need of investment, not additional funding.  Investment means carefully examining the outcomes for individual students and the State.  Investment means not rewarding HEIs based simply on student numbers, as we currently do, but including consideration of outcomes that reflect quality such as the employability of our students, levels of non-Exchequer funding, patents, licences and spin-outs.  For students, the outcome needs to focus on the capacity to secure suitable employment.  The Cassells report correctly recommends that a component of this investment should be in the form of income-contingent loans.  Students should be required to repay loans only if they materially benefit.  Without a completely new approach to investment in third level, we will never reach our true potential as a people or as a society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John Boland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2621,"content":"<p>I am grateful to the committee for giving us a chance to speak to the members.  I am a professor of drama at NUI Galway and I would like to provide a snapshot of how things are for us, how the cuts have affected our students in particular and to set out what we can do into the future.  As a lecturer, I see the human cost of higher education cuts on a daily basis.  The number of students experiencing difficulties has increased significantly at a time when we are struggling to fund support services.  We are seeing falling numbers of access students, evening students and mature students because of child care costs, mortgages, transportation costs and many other barriers.  Postgraduate study is now closed off completely to very large numbers of people for financial reasons.  I ask the members to think about that in the context of second-level teaching and what we heard from Mr. Cassells about how social class has emerged as a factor in who gets to do postgraduate study and who does not.  All of this is a clear example of how things are in the wider university system now.  All of those involved, which is to say staff, students and parents, are working incredibly hard and doing their best but they are doing their best to just about manage.  It has become very difficult to do any more than that.<\/p> <p>  There is a great deal more, however, that we could do.  Looking at my own area, we want to work to a much greater extent with our own communities.  One of the things about drama is that it is a very powerful medium to connect to parts of our society that have become isolated.  It can give a voice to those who do not have one.  Researchers in my department have gone into primary schools to work with children whose parents have immigrated here and whose first language is not English.  They have worked with infants who are at risk of neglect and they have worked with adults with intellectual disabilities.  This research attracts attention from all around the world but it also makes lives better here in Ireland.  We have been able to do this because we went out and got competitive research funding for it and we will continue to do that.  However, it would be great if we could put those kinds of activities on a sustainable footing and integrate this fully into our curriculums so that all of our students have opportunities to engage in these kinds of service learning activities.<\/p> <p>  We also want to do more to contribute to the creation of jobs, not just in the west of Ireland but nationally.  Within my own field, corporations in the USA are increasingly recruiting graduates in the creative arts because they see their skills in teamwork, problem solving and creativity in general.  Ireland is famed internationally for its creativity and for the creative arts.  As such, there is a great deal we could do to work with industry to develop that area.  Galway is going to be the capital of culture in 2020 which is an enormous opportunity for the west and the entire nation in terms of reputation and job creation.  Looking at the humanities generally, we can see that if Ireland is to cope with Brexit, we need more graduates with language skills.  That can only happen with investment in the humanities.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, I note that my students are brilliant.  They are creative, confident, hardworking people and we want to do the best for them that we possibly can.  Everyone in higher education wants to do that.  As a sector, we want to do more than just cope.  We want to do more than just manage.  We could potentially even thrive but to do so we need action and we need it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Lonergan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2622,"content":"<p>I am the associate dean for teaching and learning in the business school at DCU.  That means I look after all of our taught programmes and the quality of the student learning experience.<\/p><p>I am also a senior lecturer in risk, crisis and emergency management.  I thank the committee for inviting me to come before it today to share my view of how the reduced funding for higher education has had an impact on the work we do as academics within the seven Irish universities and, in my case, within DCU.  I will reflect on the three areas that have been impacted by the underfunding for higher education but first I will say that the impact on students has been greatly reduced because of the efforts of the university and academic and administrative staff to shelter students from the impact of these cuts as far as is possible.  However, we are at a point where this is becoming increasingly difficult.<\/p><p> I will begin with a focus on quality.  The poor staff-student ratios within the sector mean that quality cannot be sustained in the long term, no matter how much we try to reduce the impact on our students.  The cuts have resulted in reduced subject choice within programmes, larger class sizes, less opportunity for small group tutorials, a reduction in the number of assessments being completed and fewer pieces of work of a formative nature.  Instead, greater emphasis has been placed on terminal assessments, such as examinations, which are summative in nature and focus on checking if students have reached the specified learning outcomes rather than guiding their development along the way.<\/p><p> Enhanced funding would allow for greater innovation and diversity in terms of the learning opportunities, enhanced feedback on assessments at several points during the semester and even more industry and community-based projects for our students.  DCU Business School, since its foundation, has been focused on industry and community engagement.  We have always been recognised for our proactive approach to the development of programmes that we need at a national and regional level.  However, time pressures now mean we have little time for developing new, innovative programmes.  This lack of development can be absorbed in the short term but is not compatible with the medium to long-term economic and social well-being of the country.  Our university strategic plan commits us to being a research-intensive university.  This means the research we complete is fed into our classrooms on an ongoing basis.  This is absolutely vital in order to expose students to cutting edge theory and practice.<\/p><p> Our students study research undertaken in an Irish setting and not just, for example, US-centric material.  Teaching and research quality are inextricably linked.  Sacrificing research to cope with unfunded increases in student numbers is a false economy.  This approach is not sustainable if we are to produce graduates who can perform on a global stage.  It is important to remember that there is a direct relationship between the quality of our university graduates and the quality of our national institutions and services.  We need the resources required to produce the quality of primary and secondary school teachers, nurses and doctors, engineers, social workers etc. that our citizens deserve.  Finally with regard to quality, I must mention the urgent need for investment in the infrastructure of our universities.  Our buildings, classrooms and technology are in need of maintenance in the short term and upgrading in the medium to long term.<\/p><p> I am proud of our participation rates in higher education in Ireland and I too ask that all decisions on future funding preserve this important right for our citizens.  However, it is important to remember that equality of access does not always mean equality of opportunity.  Many of our students require specific supports because of special learning needs and competing pressures in their personal lives.  The reduced level of funding, at a time when we have more students than ever entering via Higher Education Access Route, Disability Access Route to Education and Access programmes, along with post-experience students, means increased time must be allocated to this element of our work at a time when we are already stretched.  Improved student-to-staff ratios and additional specialist services will allow us to support all students to reach their full potential.  We need to invest in our campuses so we can extend the capacity of our classrooms and so that students do not have to travel excessive distances each day because of a lack of student accommodation. We need to do so now so we are prepared for the opportunities which can come from the increased student numbers projected as a result of Brexit and as a result of our own demographic profile.  Let us be ready to meet the challenge and not struggling to manage a crisis.<\/p><p> I will highlight the impact that the continued lack of funding and other restrictions has had on the overall success of Irish universities.  We are often set incompatible objectives.  We are asked to secure additional non-Exchequer funding to sustain high-quality teaching and research, yet we are asked to do so without additional staff and with inflexible human resource management protocols.  A more balanced workload model is required if we are to have time to bid for and win international funding for all our activities.  To conclude, I ask that the committee works with us to fund higher education to the appropriate level.  It is clear that we have a mutual desire to have a higher education system held as an example of good practice across the world.  The implementation of the Cassells report is an important step in the achievement of this ambition and I endorse it wholeheartedly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caroline McMullan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2624,"content":"<p>I am professor of education in Maynooth university.  My background is philosophy of education and I work in initial teacher education so my comments will reflect that position.<\/p> <p>  I would like to us to reflect on the nature of public education and the question of what a democratic education system might look like.  I want to reflect on this under the broad banner of two headings, access and quality.  We have the ambition in Ireland to widen access and participation and we have witnessed dramatic and transformative changes in the country as a consequence of changed policies with regard to education.  With changing labour markets come changing patterns of engagement with education.  We need to think about higher education in its broadest sense as being for everybody, at some stage and in some way during their lives if they so choose.  We also need to reflect on the diverse goods that arise from educational engagement.  Thinking about higher education as not only a universal aspiration but also as a universal right should frame the way in which we understand and enact our commitments to education in the 21st century.  It seems fitting for a republic to have a deep understanding of what public education means and the importance of this not only for the good it contributes to the economy but also to its citizenry.<\/p> <p> If we are to understand public education as universal education, it must be democratic education in its deepest sense.  We know our grant system does not meet the living costs of our most vulnerable students.  We know families are going into debt to afford to put their children or themselves through college.  An education system should be judged and evaluated not just by the achievement indicators of those who are flourishing in the system but by those who are marginalised or struggling to survive, working while studying and finding it difficult to meet the cost of living.  This has an impact on the quality of the student experience and embeds inequality in the system because of the different capacity for full engagement in study.  We know that numbers of part-time students and mature students have declined and this affects the rich diversity of higher education institutions.  Higher education institutions should reflect the diversity of our society and create enabling conditions for all students.  There are, of course, private benefits to higher education, including increased personal wealth, but progressive tax systems should act to redistribute incomes in order to mitigate sharp inequalities.  I am concerned by proposals that involve significant student debt, which will particularly affect lower to middle income families which have to manage that debt alongside the other debts that they will incur.  There have been discussions about student debt and the implications for long-term national debt.<\/p> <p>  I will respond briefly to the question of how to communicate this to the wider public, as it has come up a few times.  We need to better communicate to the wider public what it is we do in universities and the value of this.  Universities create diverse goods and it is not simply about educating students.  We engage in a diverse range of activities.  I am not sure this is fully understood according to research taken out in respect of the Cassells report, as people did not seem to fully understand the range of activities involved with the institution of the university.  Furthermore, Ireland has had an anomalous relationship with education with regard to the relations between State and church in this regard.  I suggest that we have not fully reflected on what public education means and this opportunity to discuss funding is also an excellent opportunity to begin the conversation of what we understand by public education.<\/p> <p>  We could think about the UN convention on economic, social and cultural rights, which indicates that higher education should be made equally accessible to all on the basis of capacity by every appropriate means and, in particular, the progressive introduction of free education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Aislinn O'Donnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2625,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today to join the conversation, which is pivotal not only for our industry but Ireland as a whole.

Increased student numbers and correspondingly worse staff-students ratios have resulted in several inevitable consequences, including larger class sizes, reduced numbers of tutorials, reduced time to devote to individual students, reduced programme offerings such as electives and specialist modules, and reduced introduction of new programmes to meet new economic, technological, scientific, social and regulatory imperatives.  These challenges impact both the current student experience and the future-proofing of student learning. <br\/><br\/>The second issue is the impact on research activity.  An increased workload results in academics having less time to devote to translational research which addresses scientific, industrial, technological and societal issues.  It starves innovation and stifles knowledge transfer.  This affects academics in their individual and professional capacity, which in turn affects the reputation of Irish universities.  The consequences of that are reflected in the recent university rankings.  Irish universities have become less attractive for international investment and funding opportunities, less attractive to leading international academics and less attractive to international students.  There is less opportunity to locate cutting-edge companies beside research centres of excellence. <br\/><br\/>The third impact of the reduction in funding relates to the future of the country.  The funding challenges of the past decade have curtailed maintenance and development of what was an adequate hard and soft third level infrastructure.  Lack of investment or reduced investment in technology and other learner supports have affected teaching, making it much more difficult to innovate pedagogically in line with students' environment.  Students are working with facilities, equipment and technologies which are neither world class nor best in class.  In addition, insufficient funding limits faculty engagement in current debates in international settings.  Staff absence at the forefront of developing knowledge and technology means that although they can facilitate learning for today, they are not sufficiently equipped to facilitate learning for tomorrow.  This directly impacts Ireland's competitiveness, our ability to attract foreign direct investment and our economic stability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michele O'Dwyer","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2627,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. O'Dwyer.

I will focus on what has happened in my department since 2010, which provides an interesting context for the discussion we are having today.  I have been working in the higher education sector in Ireland since 1997 and in UCC for 14 years.  The department I run was particularly negatively affected by the crash.  In 2009, we had a small staff for a large student cohort of 900 to 1,000 students, varying year on year.  Between 2010 and 2011, as a consequence of both a demographic quirk in terms of when our staff were hired and the incentivised retirement scheme, five members of our very small core staff retired.  We were left with a skeleton staff to deal with huge student numbers and with no possibility of replacing those staff as a result of the employment control framework.  In that scenario we were obliged to collapse modules and create classes with larger student numbers, even though we all know the advantages of small group teaching.  We launched new programmes even though we did not have the staff to teach our existing programmes.  We also contributed to a range of other new programmes across the institution.  We put a massive impetus into generating research funding.<\/p> <p>  In 2008, my department, together with the department of mathematics, was ranked as the top research department in the university, which placed it equivalent to the top 10% to 15% of departments in the UK.  However, we have lost a lot of our core research-active staff as part of the retirement exit.  Moreover, many local sources of funding - particularly in social sciences, which is my area - disappeared, as did many national sources.  This meant we had to chase international funding, including schemes like Horizon 2020.  We have been successful in that regard but it has involved massive demands in terms of engaging with other institutions.  All such bids are required to be inter-institutional and involve travel to Brussels and other places to meet with institutional partners.  We were facing those demands in the context of the constraints imposed on us in terms of staffing.  We did all the things we were told to do under austerity.  We did more with less, generated income through increased student numbers, started new programmes and won funding awards.  Our performance has been mirrored in a number of other colleges and departments across the EU.  However, as head of department, my concern is for how long this can realistically be sustained.  A response to a D&aacute;il question in 2014 indicated that the staff-student ratio in the sector was 1:19.  The Cassells reports refers to a ratio of 1:21.  My colleagues and I can only dream about those type of staffing levels.  Our current staff-student ratio is 1:45.  When we include our new programmes, it tops 1:50.  That is the reality we are dealing with.<\/p> <p>  The international league tables have been hard on Irish universities, for good reason.  In the case of my department, operating with a staff-student ratio of 1:45 makes it almost impossible to give students the level of attention that is required, particularly given the specific strains students are experiencing in terms of housing and debt.  Furthermore, we are finding it very difficult to deliver the inclusion agenda, to which my department and the institution have a strong commitment.  There are huge challenges in supporting students with special needs in this type of environment.  In the past two years, we have lost two of our most high-performing staff members and are struggling to replace them even though there is a huge supply in the labour market.  That reflects the types of stresses under which we are perceived to be operating.  As manager of a university department, I find the discourse around the requirement to perform and reform very problematic.  We have done more work with half the staff in the past five years.  If I tell my staff they need to perform better, it will be met with a good degree of cynicism.  The source of the crisis in the third level sector is not a lack of performance by staff but the funding situation and the urgency with which it needs to be addressed.  It is important that front-line staff in the universities are upfront about the extent of those challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niamh Hourigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2629,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their excellent contributions.  It is helpful to have so many faculties and areas represented, from engineering to social sciences, drama and philosophy.  We have students from DCU coming in later to talk to us.  I thank all the delegates for respecting the time parameters so closely.  Every day is incredibly busy for this committee and we could spend hours discussing the various issues with witnesses.<\/p> <p>  In regard to Brexit, several speakers referred to engaging with the EU on funding such as that available under Horizon 2020.  Do the delegates foresee that Brexit will impact on the potential for securing such research funding?  Dr. O'Dwyer noted that Irish universities are less attractive to international students, which is part of the ranking issue.  Is that likely to change in the context of Brexit?<\/p> <p>  I was interested in the comments regarding students with learning difficulties or emotional challenges and how they are experiencing particularly negative consequences as a result of lecturers being so stretched.  That issue was brought to our attention at our meeting of 10 November with the presidents of the institutes of technology.  Is there scope for other State supports, such as the health services, to link in more effectively and efficiently with the universities on mental health?<\/p> <p>  Dr. McMullan spoke about the challenges of developing new innovative programmes that are compatible with furthering the economic and social well-being of our country.  I am getting the sense the same applies across other universities.<\/p><p>Professor Gilchrist said equality of access did not always mean equality of opportunity.  I could not agree more.  He has outlined some of the areas there.  He also spoke about the wider spread of mathematical ability.  There has been a focus on the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects and raising students' mathematical capabilities.  Perhaps he could tell us about his experience in recent years regarding this issue among undergraduates.  Professor Gilchrist said his department has nine taught masters programmes, which is a tenfold increase from one programme ten years ago.  However, he also said there were fewer postgraduate students.  I am sure there is a good rationale or explanation for it.<\/p><p> It is great to see Galway supporting integration in such a positive way linking in with the communities.  All our universities should do this.  While it is not feasible or possible for everybody, it is great to see universities and third level institutes playing a meaningful role in it.  Professor O'Donnell said public education should be democratic education, and it is true.  This concept would get a lot of support from here.  I get the sense that the maintenance costs are possibly a greater barrier than the fees charged.  We went into it in an earlier session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#AA00400","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2631,"content":"<p>I apologise, I have to ask questions and leave given that I am next to speak in the Seanad and I will lose my spot.  We are talking about what Brexit means for us.  Perhaps those working in research could elaborate on the fact that, due to having no capital funding for a period, we would not be able to cater to any sort of research and development in the universities as they stand unless there is an injection of capital funding in order that they can increase lab space.  This may be disproportionate.  Trinity College has a historical relationship with England and is in a prime position to lead out on some of the English research.  Is there a way this could be dispersed throughout the country in order that other universities could benefit from sharing the Horizon 2020 research projects?  After Brexit, England will come under new EU rules and will not be able to lead on research.  Ireland will be in a good position, given that we have the infrastructure to cater for it.<\/p> <p>  Between 2008 and 2011, there was a revision of the medical curriculum which directly impacted on the number of doctors now in place in our medical system.  Perhaps Professor Boland can answer this.  If third level funding increased, what kind of impact would it have on the medical curriculum and the people availing of it?<\/p> <p>  I read Dr. Hourigan's recent comments on emigration and her points were not picked up in the earlier session.  Will she comment on how she thinks the loan system will impact on emigration and pensions?  Is there anything about the loans that we are missing or that is not making it into the public arena and debate from a sociological perspective?  We speak about the fact they asserted that the State stepped out regarding other countries and funding.  Will there be a governance issue?  We cannot predict whether the State will also step out once we open the door for income-contingent loans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#BB00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2632,"content":"<p>I apologise that I had to step out.

Where should we be going with the future funding model?  My fear is that we are going towards the corporate model of education which will push for more of these types of contracts rather than having permanent staff in departments.<\/p> <p>  Is the assault on the arts really happening?  Is most of the funding and focus of the universities going to subjects where the biggest industry financial input can be given?  Is funding for the arts in the colleges being decreased?<\/p> <p>  How significant an issue is it that students are picking the wrong courses and how big an impact has the lack of career guidance at second level had on it?  Are people trying to get on a certain pathway into work by doing a degree which is easier to get through given that it will get them to where they need to go, and then doing a postgraduate course?  Are people, for example, going on to primary teaching having done the wrong basic course in which they did not have a fundamental interest?<\/p> <p>  How have the cutbacks associated with austerity affected gender equality in the colleges?  I am aware of major issues in NUI Galway.

When people look for lab equipment, money is very scarce.  However, when there is a legal case to be fought, there seem to be buckets of money to back up the colleges.

First, Brexit is a very serious problem for Ireland in terms of how the economy will work.  It is a very big deal for SMEs.  For the educational sector there could be some upsides to it.  There are a lot of academics who are hugely unsettled in the UK and looking for positions elsewhere.  A lot of them have left the UK.  There are now people moving to places such as Holland.  In reality, we are not well positioned to benefit from Brexit because of the lack of infrastructural investment.  We have great difficulty hiring anybody at the moment.  It is not just a matter of providing the salaried position; facilities and reputation are also issues.  Our rankings have dramatically impacted our reputation which does not make us an attractive opportunity for Brexit.  There are some other structural issues that have to be dealt with.  Brexit could work if we can provide UK colleagues a base in Ireland for UK universities to engage with European funding opportunities.  This means that universities will have to understand how to operate real joint faculty appointments so faculty members can be in Ireland 50% of the time and benefit from that.  We are not set up for this currently but we could possibly do it and it would have a big positive outcome.<\/p> <p>  I will address one of the specific items that was mentioned.  There are very serious issues that nobody wants to talk about and which presidents do not want to mention but the reality is we are having a problem with the accreditation of professional degrees.  This is happening in skills-based courses.  For example in medical courses, where one needs time with the patient, the right kind of clinical training and the right hands-on time, whether in a lab or elsewhere, we are not providing the requisite level of engagement.  We are running the risk that if we have to go for accreditation we will not be professionally accredited.  That would undermine a huge range of courses and not only that, it would undermine Irish society.  <\/p> <p>  One other last thing is fixed-term contracts.  This is a major issue.  There are two edges to this.  It is a double-edged sword.  Universities cannot become the homes for everyone who engages in research.  It is really important that we can identify the people who are engaged in research and, where appropriate, provide them faculty positions because we need that stream of new talent coming through.  It means our universities have to work very effectively with industry so that these people are in our shop window.  We need to be absolutely engaging with industry in terms of career development of the staff we currently have.  There is not a single postgraduate or postdoctoral training programme in Ireland worth its salt.  If we compare ourselves with professional entities like Imperial College, they have a shop window.  They have huge numbers of researchers engaging in world class research and they interface with industry and employers in a way that can actually move people out of the system.  Given the employment control framework, we will not solve in European law fixed-term contracts but we need to be conduits for training talent and moving them on to the next level.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John Boland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2642,"content":"<p>I will pick up on a number of points.  The Chairman asked how we have had a ninefold increase in the number of taught programmes.  They are taught master's programmes, not PhD level programmes.  In engineering, to become a chartered engineer, it is important to have a master's qualification as the primary requirement rather than a bachelor's programme.  In UCD we led the development of these.  Industry demands that our courses are at this level and industry snaps up our graduates.  Let me be particularly clear.  We could double the number of engineering graduates and maintain their world class quality but we are at our capacity limit.  What that means for us is that if we want to increase the numbers of students beyond our 300 at the moment, we will require significant recurrent funding to reduce our student staff ratio towards the 15:1 ratio.  That is similar to the engineering schools at better UK universities, including Imperial College, and other European universities, not even the universities that are the top ranked in the Ivy Leagues in the US, where the student staff ratios are lower than 10:1.  It will also require significant capital investment to provide us with additional well-equipped engineering buildings.  Deputy Thomas Byrne asked about making the case.  I teach first-year engineering students.  I was with them last night until 9.30 p.m. doing hands-on project based learning.  When we do laboratories, we repeat every lab 15 times so that a small group of five students can get around a piece of apparatus and do it a multiplicity of times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael Gilchrist"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2643,"content":"<p>I will offer an addendum to Professor Boland's earlier comments.  One thing that concerns me about the start of the discussion just now is that we are looking for opportunities.  We are looking at Brexit as an opportunity.  We are looking internationally for students to come here and pay substantial fees.  It is obviously very attractive for us to focus on that but the danger is we are bursting at the seams right now with the students we have.  We are not servicing them in the way we should.  We are not providing them with the level of education we have in previous years.  We are just about managing to service their needs now.  We are not equipping them in the same way we used to previously for their future education.  We are not sending graduates out who not only are dropping into the workplace but are able to run faster than everybody else.  We are not equipping them and we are not equipping industry.  I am concerned that we move on too fast to looking at the opportunities without looking at what we have right now, which is an immediate crisis.  We have not even taken into account the demographics and the impact on that.  We could easily take students from Britain.  We could take more international students if we had a better quality product but we do not have an adequate quality product at the moment.

We have heard about the kinds of changes we are seeing in higher education as a consequence of the lack of resources available to students to study, for example, as part-time or mature students.  Senator Ruane discussed the way in which we need to think about access more broadly rather than simply creating financial conditions.  When we are looking at initial teacher education, we really need to diversify the population engaging in initial teacher education at both primary and secondary level.  We are seeing a drop off in the rates of mature students entering the profession, which is problematic.  We need to resource the ways in which we engage a wide diversity of students, in particular those from hard-to-reach backgrounds, to think about becoming a teacher.  Maynooth has begun a programme of reaching out to those communities and looking across the continuum of education from primary through to adult education.  How we engage with the question of access is not just about funding in higher education.  We need to think synergistically right across the sector and we need to stop chopping up public education into these different categories.  That engagement, by creating a community of teachers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, will make a difference to kids in DEIS schools who see the possibility for themselves of becoming teachers.  That is the kind of model we need to think of far more expansively than in our different sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#CC00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Aislinn O'Donnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2646,"content":"<p>I will respond to the question about the assaults on the arts.

I have had colleagues working in science who have gone abroad on recruitment missions for students or trade missions with the State and have met people who might not be able to pick out Galway on a map but know who W.B. Yeats is.  That identification of Ireland with creativity is very important.  There has been an assault not so much on the arts but on the arts degree.  We have seen at open days, particularly after 2008, huge numbers of students coming in saying they desperately want to study French or want do a degree that includes IT and archaeology because that is what their passion is but their parents are saying they must not do it.  This will have an impact.  We have talked a lot about Brexit.  Where are the language graduates coming from, given that the number of people doing arts has declined?  There are jobs to be created and jobs to be gained from studying the arts.  It is something we need to focus on.

Something we have taken very seriously in Dublin City University, DCU, and I am sure it is the case in the other universities, is that allowing students into our universities is not enough.  We have to make sure they develop to their full potential and that we eliminate as much stress in the system as possible.  In the past, we would have had a team at the centre of our university that would have taken much of that work on board.  We still have incredible specialist teams at the centre helping our access students in particular but much of that work has been mainstreamed into the general academic role within the business school, for example, but also across the university.  To make up for the shortfall in specialist help, we had to put in place a system of one-to-one staff-student consultation in place in first year, which means that all our students are allocated an academic mentor.  That has helped.  We have also tried to put more sophisticated systems in place to identify early warning signals that a student is not engaging.  If they fall off from, say, reading their notes online or their class attendance, we will very quickly intervene to see if there is a problem at home, etc.<br\/><br\/>Sometimes when we talk about figures, data and money we do not realise the human story behind that and how dedicated many people are in our universities.  For example, I have a student who was on a one-year course. He is now four years into the course because of very serious issues that arose.  He has come back year after year to try to get through the course.  In the end I was calling him in the morning to make sure he was up out of his bed.  I was identifying what he would do that day.  I was calling him before he went to bed that night to check if he had achieved his objectives for the day and discuss what we would do the next day.  I am not saying that to show that I am different.  Every one of my colleagues here could tell the members that, but that is how serious we are about not just bringing our students in.  We need to talk about access but we need the committee to give us the funding to make sure they exit correctly.<br\/><br\/>I am pleased to tell the members that in terms of our access programmes, because we are so aware of the students' needs they are competing and completing their programmes very well.  I am very proud of that.<br\/><br\/>Another member asked if there was a problem with choice and whether students choose their own programmes.  They sometimes do that.  We are trying to eliminate that by opening at night and on Saturdays and bringing in careers teachers to give advice sessions.  We all do that but in DCU we are putting more time into that to eliminate, as far as is possible, poor choice.  We are also allowing flexibility within the university so if somebody comes in to do a business programme and it is not what they thought it would be or what they wanted, although that does not happen very often, we will transfer them to engineering, the sciences or <i>vice versa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>We are genuinely committed to our students and to the quality of their education experience but we are at close to breaking point.  We can extend the day to allow us see our students one-to-one, as Professor Gilchrist said, but we ask the committee not to make us do that for very much longer and instead to put the time and the money into getting this sorted for the benefit of every student in the country, regardless of their geographic or educational needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#DD00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Caroline McMullan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2649,"content":"<p>I want to respond to a number of issues raised by several members.  A member asked if the maintenance grant was a particular issue.  I would have a concern that the maintenance grant is being treated as a monolith.  Within that, the question of accommodation is a massive source of tension and a problem for students, international students, new staff and that particular strata of staff who are more precarious, which the member and Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh highlighted.  There is a link here to infrastructure because the universities can go a long way to providing accommodation.  That is a nettle that will have to be grasped.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of career guidance, something that comes across clearly from the limited research we have is that middle class students whose parents have been through university are fairly well equipped to negotiate the transition from second level to third level.  The cohort of students who are suffering from the career guidance cuts is that cohort whose parents have not been through university and who, with the best will in the world, struggle to negotiate.  They are the group more likely to make decisions that are not the best fit.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of emigration, I have a slight concern in terms of the report because it leans so much on the Australian model.  The Australian dynamic of emigration is quite different from ours in the sense that for many young people in Australia, emigration is part of the life course.  In many cases, when they leave college they live abroad for a couple of years and then return for family formation, as Dr. Doris mentioned.  As Ireland is located in a completely different part of the world, our emigration patterns tend to be much more strongly influenced by push and pull factors related to our economy.  For instance, if we consider the early stages of the Celtic tiger boom, much of that was generated by graduates who had left in the 1980s and came back in the 1990s.<\/p> <p>  Peter Cassells said this morning that his report is not a technical report.  I would say, as a social scientist, that we need a technical report because there is the issue of how income contingent loans will impact on people's capacity to access housing, particularly in terms of the debates we have just seen about Central Bank rules, and also in terms of saving for pensions.  We have a looming pensions crisis.  Some 30% of people in the United States are still paying back student loans when they hit retirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niamh Hourigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2650,"content":"<p>Barack Obama was still paying his when he entered the White House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#DD00300","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2651,"content":"<p>He was, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#DD00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niamh Hourigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2652,"content":"<p>He sold a lot of books subsequently so I think it became-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#DD00500","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":2653,"content":"<p>We do not want to increase taxes either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016112400002#DD00600","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":2654,"content":"<p>No.  That is part of the matrix that needs to be examined.

As members are aware, a technical or token Supplementary Estimate does not involve additional Exchequer funding for the Vote, other than a very small technical increase of &euro;1,000.  This is because corresponding savings, or as in our case, corresponding additional fee income, fully covers the additional expenditure required.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this week, on 22 November, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform moved a motion in the D&aacute;il seeking a technical Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 for the Department and the approval to move excess income from appropriations-in-aid to fund increased expenditure on international contributions and on the Passport Service.  The Department is seeking an increase of &euro;5.001 million, which is offset by additional passport fee income of &euro;5 million resulting, as already stated, in a net technical or token increase of &euro;1,000.<\/p> <p>  The increased expenditure is being sought for Ireland's increased mandatory contributions to several international organisations - mainly the United Nations, UN, but also to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD - and for increased operational costs relating to the Passport Service due to an exceptional increase in demand of 10% in 2016 compared to 2015.  These increases are fully offset by additional passport fee income of &euro;5 million.  The international contributions in question are Ireland's contributions to the organisations outlined, not just those of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but across all Departments which interact daily with, and benefit from, Ireland's membership of these valuable organisations.  The mandatory contributions of Ireland and all other member states of international organisations are based on scales of assessments and these can vary.<\/p> <p>  The first purpose for which additional expenditure will be incurred this year relates to the Passport Service, which has experienced an exceptional increase in demand of an extra 10% applications this year compared with 2015.  Last year, just over 680,000 passport applications were received and this is expected to grow to over 740,000 this year.  There was a strong underlying increase in demand for passports in the first half of the year.  Indications are that this will be further affected by the UK referendum on EU membership.  From July to October this year, applications from Northern Ireland increased by approximately 70% compared to the same period last year, while applications from Great Britain have almost doubled.<\/p> <p>  A significant proportion of the operational costs of the Passport Service are demand-driven and directly correlate to the level of applications.  Consequently, the significant increase in demand has led to a proportionate increase in operational costs, particularly for passport books, postage, the printing of application forms as well as for additional temporary clerical officers and overtime.  The relocation to Mount Street in the early part of the year resulted in increased challenges to maintain passport delivery within expected timeframes.  I am proud that the Passport Service was recently, in the customer experience, CXi, survey, ranked number one in the Irish public sector.  This survey confirms that the Passport Service delivers very strongly in facilitating travel for citizens, sometimes in urgent circumstances, and in ensuring that applicants are properly advised about their passport entitlements.  I congratulate and thank the staff of the Passport Service for their commitment to delivering a friendly and efficient service.  Gabhaim comhghairdeas agus bu&iacute;ochas le foireann Sheirbh&iacute;s na bPasanna.<\/p> <p>  The largest source of increased expenditure relates to Ireland's international contributions, accounting for some &euro;4.2 million of the additional &euro;5 million on which the Supplementary Estimate is based.  The largest element of this, Ireland's payments to the UN, consists of mandatory contributions to the UN regular budget, UN peacekeeping budget and UN tribunals which accounts for some &euro;3.3 million of the additional funding included in the Supplementary Estimate.  UN member states' contributions are based on a formula, called the scale of assessment, which is reviewed at three-year intervals.  In December 2015, a new scale of assessment was approved for the 2016-2018 period, with Ireland's rate set at 0.335%.  The challenge in forecasting the UN peacekeeping budget, which is the largest part of our payments to the UN, is not easy.  The budget depends on the level of UN peacekeeping activity around the world.  This is influenced both by the number of conflicts, as well as the size and complexity of the UN operations which the Security Council decides to put on the ground.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult to estimate this in advance, as an existing peacekeeping operation might be increased or decreased, depending on the circumstances, or a new one might be established.  Also, and this was the case for 2016, the timing of the bills for peacekeeping can cause problems in estimating costs.  Normally, the majority of peacekeeping payments fall due in July at the beginning of the peacekeeping budget cycle.  However, for technical reasons, every three years these bills are split between July and January.  As a result, this year several payments that would ordinarily have been paid in full in July 2015 were split between July 2015 and January 2016.  As a result assessments payable by all member states, including Ireland, in January 2016 were higher than usual.<\/p> <p>  As regards the OSCE, we require an additional &euro;450,000.  The amount provided for in the Revised 2016 Estimates was &euro;1.168 million.  The amount spent in 2016 will be &euro;1.619 million.  The shortfall is due to the fact that the provision in the revised Estimates was insufficient.  The amount spent in 2016 covers both Ireland's contribution to the OSCE unified budget, &euro;1.070 million, and its contribution to the special monitoring mission in Ukraine, &euro;550,000.  Both these contributions are mandatory and arise from Ireland's participation in the OSCE, which is integral to long-standing Irish foreign policy goals of supporting human rights and the rule of law.  The special monitoring mission in Ukraine plays a vital role in monitoring the implementation of the Minsk peace agreements.<\/p> <p>  The final international contribution which was under-provided for in the 2016 Revised Estimates was a shortfall of &euro;440,000 in Ireland's contribution to the OECD.  The amount allocated in the Revised Estimates for 2016 was &euro;2.26 million but the total amount to be paid to the OECD in 2016 will be &euro;2.70 million.  Member countries' contributions to the OECD are determined in part on the basis of the relative size of their economies and are thus affected by economic growth.  The shortfall arises due to a combination of growth in the Irish economy and an underestimation of the likely final allocation.<\/p> <p>  I trust that my remarks have clarified the purpose for which the Department is seeking a technical Supplementary Estimate but, of course, I will seek to answer any questions committee members may have.

We have a very dedicated sub-committee at Cabinet level, headed by the Taoiseach which held its fourth meeting this morning.  There are significant proactive actions we can take in light of the Brexit result.  There are lots of positives such as, for example, the business-to-business engagement between the UK and Ireland.  I know that at a symbolic political level, whether it was the Queen's visit or the President's visit to the United Kingdom, the language around relationships has never been stronger.  On the ground, one can see the incredible synergies between businesses on an UK-Ireland basis and companies feeding into the supply chain in Scotland.  There is an infrastructure of which we must be conscious.  I acknowledge the work of Enterprise Ireland, which held a very successful trade mission in Edinburgh recently.

It is seldom that I hear a complaint about the passport service and as a public service it is first class.  Above all, its personnel always give the impression that they are trying to help people and it is not just a case of going through the motions.  There is an ethos that should be recognised by us all.  The personnel in question are behind desks and providing a service and never really receive recognition for the work they do.  Many times they have to deal with somebody in the airport who is panicking as he or she has just realised he or she does not have a passport.  There is always an attitude that personnel should try to help people rather than tell them to come back tomorrow.  The service is excellent.<\/p><p> The fact that we are renowned for our part in peacekeeping missions is a great advertisement for Ireland.  I have witnessed it at first-hand and we cannot underestimate the value to Ireland of our troops operating on peacekeeping missions.  Very often we speak about the situation in Lebanon where we have 500 or so troops, but there are other areas where 20 or 30 members of the Defence Forces are serving on very small missions but who are playing a vital role.  They do not receive the recognition they deserve.  Again, I highlight the work done on all missions, including the small ones, as well as the big ones.  The troops involved play such an important role in enhancing the image of the country.  We cannot overestimate the value of their role as peacekeepers, nor can we overvalue Ireland's role as a neutral country and in not being tied to European armies or anything else.  Our neutrality is very precious and allows us tremendous scope in participating in peacekeeping missions.  We are not seen as serving some agenda or other but as being there purely to help.  Expertise has been built during the years, dating back to the mission in the Congo, and it is second to none, as the Minister of State has seen at first hand.  Small missions are just as important as bigger ones in various parts of the world.<\/p><p> I am glad that we are contributing to a special monitoring mission in Ukraine.  Do we have many troops or officials there in that capacity or are we only subscribing to the overall cost for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe?  I have a particular interest in the situation in Ukraine as it has been messed about and become a political football.  It says a lot for the way the world works today when Russian troops can march into Crimea and just take over, without a finger being lifted to say boo to Russia as such.  There are sanctions, but the situation is horrific.  I have had the pleasure of being in Ukraine on a couple of occasions and although they are making tremendous strides, they need ongoing support.  I am delighted that we are contributing in some way to stabilising the country and allowing its people to pursue their independence.<\/p><p> It is always great to have an opportunity to say thanks to those who serve on UN missions.  We cannot overestimate the value to the country of those ambassadors who serve throughout the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2016112400002#B01100","speaker":"1219","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479997800,"counter":2681,"content":"<p>The Minister of State and his team are most welcome and I thank them for their presentation.  I know that all of my colleagues have touched on the work of the Passport Office.  It is interesting that the Department is seeking an increase of &euro;5.001 million, with &euro;5 million being offset by the increase in revenue from the Passport Office.  That is direct evidence of the work it is doing.  The 10% increase in demand has resulted in an extra &euro;5 million for the Exchequer, which has allowed us to cover the additional cost of our contributions this year without having to look for much more from the country's funds.  It is incredible and significant evidence of the fantastic work the Passport Office is doing.  I join my colleagues in commending it.<\/p> <p>  I am heartened in going through the table of specific programmes with which we are involved by the number of people serving at home and abroad who are working for a fairer, more just, secure and sustainable world.  We are advancing prosperity and promoting our economic interests internationally, while protecting and advancing Ireland's values and interests in Europe and strengthening and influencing our capacity to deliver on our goals.  Although austerity has permeated nearly every aspect of our life in the past few years, we have continued to maintain our interactions and work internationally and remained committed to advancing our core values in foreign affairs.  It is a credit to the country that we have managed to do this during the years, particularly given the increased pressure to cut and cut some more.  I commend the Department for its work in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I will go through some more specific contributions to international organisations within which we operate.  Our most significant contribution is, as we know, made to the United Nations.  UN operations are a major source of pride to the country and its citizens, as well as for those who serve or have served in the Defence Forces.  There is no doubt that they are very well trained and equipped.  They do fantastic work abroad and Ireland is very well regarded by international colleagues when it comes to defence matters.  Our contributions to the United Nations are based on a formula, with the scale of assessment reviewed at three-year intervals.  There was a new scale introduced in 2015.  How does it compare with the previous one?  Have our contributions increased or decreased since the previous assessment?  The Minister of State has indicated that the budget depends on the level of UN peacekeeping activity.  I appreciate that demand can very often change, in reacting quickly to what happens globally, but how do we even attempt to estimate what our contributions will be, given the volatile nature of both UN peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions?<\/p> <p>  I have a question about the OSCE.  The Minister of State has indicated that there was a shortfall owing to the fact that the Revised Estimates were insufficient.  Why was that the case and where was the mistake made?  Was it due to a lack of information?  I have had some contact with the OSCE.  It is a very valuable organisation, of which Ireland is a member.  As international as well as Irish citizens, it is vital that we participate in organisations such as the OSCE to contribute to international peace and support human rights and the protection of the rule of law.  These are objectives which Irish people value.  I am very happy to see that Ireland is participating fully in the organisation.  I am interested in hearing a little more about the monitoring mission in Ukraine.  Where exactly is the money going?  Do we have any direct control over where it goes or is it included in a general budget for the entire project?<\/p> <p>  I have a question on the OECD.<\/p><p>Again, there was a shortfall in the Estimates.  Why was that?  It was estimated to be &euro;2.26 million for 2016 but the actual amount paid will be &euro;2.7 million.  Again, it is a considerable sum of money and I wonder why that shortfall is there.<\/p><p> How are our contributions calculated?  We know they are calculated on the basis of our economic growth but is that done every three years or every year and what figures are used?  How have we fared over the past number of years?  Have our contributions to that organisation increased?  That concludes my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2016112400002#C00200","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479997800,"counter":2683,"content":"<p>To take Deputy Barrett first, I acknowledge the service and agree with him about it.  The entitlement to a passport is based on citizenship in the first instance and determined by law.  There are two automatic categories.  If one is born in Ireland or one's parents were born here, that is automatic.  Then, one has the grandparent facility, but that is after registration.  As such, there is a registration process.  Then, there is naturalisation and we have many new citizens in the State as a result of that process.  The Deputy is right about having that information available on the Passport Office website.  I am sure it is readily available.  If there is anything specific that would be of benefit to the Deputy, we will organise its provision.<\/p> <p>  One of the officials showed me a passport card today.  It is useful and it prompted me to apply for one.  I admit I do not have one.  It will get one around Europe and is handy because it can be kept in one's wallet.  Obviously, one needs a passport to get the passport card.  If Deputy Barrett does not have one either, we could jointly apply.<\/p> <p>  He talked about the role of our missions.  He is absolutely right that, big or small, they are doing a phenomenal job internationally.  I can see that the roles are changing and that they are adapting to new challenges and ways of communicating.  The best example of a person using social media is Mr. Dan Mulhall in London who one sees tweeting most days.  In the smaller embassies such as the one in Edinburgh, there is a greater capacity to engage with community.  It is very bottom up and when one speaks to members of the Irish community or those who have an affinity for Ireland within the Scottish community itself, they talk about the great work that goes on at grassroots level.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned empathy earlier.  The high profile example was Mr. Philip Grant in San Francisco and the work he did during the Berkeley tragedy.  At the time, it was a very personal thing for him in his role.  I received feedback on that from meeting different people out there and he has had an ongoing engagement.  It is the follow-through that is very significant.  He is still doing work and different aspects of legislation in California are being looked at.  He is still in touch with all the families.  That empathy and investment in humanity that all our ambassadors and consuls general demonstrate all over the world is something into which I have been given a bit of an insight.  I note the work of Mr. D&oacute;nal Cronin in Uganda and I will be meeting with Dr. Vincent O'Neill in Kenya next week where Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan will be joining me.  The work Mr. O'Neill's team has done in advance of our visit next week has been going on for months and then there will be the work of following that visit up.<\/p> <p>  Where Government needs to raise the bar is in terms of our strategic approach internationally, whether sourcing investment or otherwise.  That is a message for myself and our political colleagues.  It is in the follow-through.  Embassies and missions can only do so much as their resources are limited. A whole-of-Government approach to using our State agencies better, including Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, is needed.  We have to look at a more strategic approach.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is already initiating that.  At the moment, it is working on an Asia strategy and last week it was working on an American strategy.  It is not just about the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; there has to be a whole-of-Government buy-in across Departments.  That will bode well for the future.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barrett also mentioned Ukraine and our work there.  Ireland makes an assessed contribution to the monitoring mission in Ukraine, which is tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Minsk agreement.  This is also a mandatory contribution arising from our participation in the OSCE.  We are providing a monitoring role.  I acknowledge Deputy Barrett's comments on the challenges out there.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lisa Chambers asked a series of questions.  If I leave anything specific out or I fail to get back to her, the officials will follow up on some of her observations.  She mentioned the reduction and asked what was missing in relation to the assessment and the scale of assessment, which is reviewed at three-year intervals.  In December 2015, a new scale of assessment was approved for 2016 to 2018 with Ireland's rate being set at 0.335%, which was down from 0.418%.  The reduced rate is the result of Ireland's depressed economic performance over the preceding years.  Deputy Chambers was correct to say it was measured against our economic performance.  I acknowledge her point that, even during the years which were difficult economically and otherwise, we continued to face our international challenges in a proactive way in relation to our work with different organisations as well as financially.  The taxpayer should be constantly reminded of the figure.  When I set it out, people are often startled.  From 2011 to this year's budget, the Irish taxpayer contributed &euro;4.5 billion in contributions to overseas aid.  Notwithstanding the fact that since 2008, some &euro;28 billion came out of the economy and that a great many hard and difficult measures were taken, as the Deputy said herself, the Irish taxpayer still contributed &euro;4.5 billion.  It is a phenomenal contribution.<\/p> <p>  While there are still challenges about getting to the 0.7% target, we can work better in terms of that strategic approach.  We should not simply be waiting for the next budget to come along to see if there will be an increase or decrease and, if so, how much it will be.  Rather, we should be a bit more ruthless in relation to the 0.7% target and set out a five-year plan.  The committee has been working on and made proposals around this and it is important that we are clear about trying to provide a continuum towards the objective of reaching the 0.7% target.  On the other hand, as the economy improves the percentage decreases, but that does not make up for the fact that we need to get up to a different place.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about UN missions.  We are in Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Western Sahara, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Ivory Coast and Cyprus.  Deputy Barrett asked if we were in Ukraine, but these are the ones we are in at the minute.<\/p> <p>  A few issues were raised about scale and Deputy Chambers asked how we estimate our contributions.  It is difficult.  It is a best-guess scenario because everything changes so quickly.  I mentioned in the D&aacute;il yesterday some of the figures we got from the International Committee of the Red Cross this week.  To take the example of Chad, 9 million people are displaced from that country at the moment, the majority of whom have refugee status in Somalia and Ethiopia.  In the context of a total global displacement figure of 65 million, 9 million are from one country alone.  In Italy, 25% of refugees are from Eritrea, from which country 5,000 people leave per month.  One is looking at the scale of movement and displacement of people and everything is changing.  The challenge is absolutely enormous.<\/p> <p>  I would like to acknowledge all of those involved in peacekeeping meetings as well as Irish Aid, whose personnel I have got to know very well and with which some of the Deputies here have worked very closely over the years.<\/p><p>It is doing great work in terms of rising to the challenge.  The responsibility on the EU and UN is massive.  The world is changing by the day.  We need to also focus on the positives, including the hosting by Uganda, despite its own challenges, of 500,000 people in temporary refugee status.  We can draw inspiration from what is being done in places like Jordan, Lebanon and Uganda.  While there are positives, the reality is that the challenges are enormous.  <\/p><p> In regard to how we estimate our contributions, that is done on a best guess analysis.    <\/p><p> My officials will communicate with Deputy Lisa Chambers on any of the questions to which I have not responded.  On the OECD, the budget submission was based on the estimated balance of the 2016 contribution and advances on assessed contribution for 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2016112400002#D00200","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479997800,"counter":2685,"content":"<p>I am aware the Minister of State's recent visit to Canton in the US.  I also visited the US recently to attend a wedding.  During my visit I had a meeting with Mayor Marty Walsh regarding the undocumented Irish and he assured me that Boston will retain its sanctuary status in that regard.  As the Minister of State will be aware Boston, New York, Chicago and San Francisco are cities of immigrants.  During my visit, I also met a number of Irish people working in the trade area whose driving licences are nearing expiration.  These people need to be able to drive to get to their places of work.  When a person is stopped by the police in the United States, the first thing he or she will be asked for is a driving licence.  If that person does not have a driving licence, he or she is arrested.  The point was made to me by these people that when their passports expire, they can apply by post to the consulate office for a new one - everybody knows that a passport is a more valuable document than a driver's licence - but when their driver's licence expires, they cannot renew it because they are required to return home and present themselves at a driving centre to get it.  In reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister on this issue, I was told that a person living abroad in a particular country for a specific period should be able to obtain a driver's licence in that country.  Unfortunately, undocumented people, particularly in the United States, do not have a social security number and so they cannot produce the documentation required to get a driver's licence.<\/p> <p>  Many people are living in fear because their driver's licences are due to expire.  I have asked the Minister to look into undocumented Irish people in the US being permitted to apply to the consulate office for a driver's licence, as they do in respect of passport renewals.  I do not know why a person has to present in person to pick up a driver's licence.  That appears to me to be a little crazy given one can get a passport through the post from anywhere in the world.  It should be possible for people to renew their driver's licence at any of the Irish consulate offices throughout the United States.  I accept that this is not a matter relevant to today's discussion but it is an issue I would like the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to examine.  This is a serious issue for the undocumented in the United States which needs to be addressed jointly by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I ask the Minister of State to ask his officials to contact the officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to see if some resolution can be found to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2016112400002#E00200","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1479997800,"counter":2686,"content":"<p>I have no problem doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2016112400002#E00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1479997800,"counter":2687,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2016112400002#E00400","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1479997800,"counter":2688,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the contributions made during the past few years but I welcome the statement by the Minister of State that the strategy into the future will be around meeting the 0.7% target.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Passport Office and the increased demand on staff, have extra staff been recruited and, if not, how is that demand being met?

The crucial task for all of us is to ensure Ireland is clearly seen as an attractive location for business in which to invest capital and resources.  This challenge has grown considerably in recent times.  This is my first opportunity since I became the bank's chief executive in May 2015 to meet the joint committee and I look forward to hearing members' views on how we can move forward together in the economy in facing up to these challenges and availing of many opportunities.<\/p> <p>  The committee will have received our written responses to the questions in its questionnaire, to which we will return.  I would also like to give it an overview of how I see AIB contributing positively to the growth of the economy and to assure members that the bank now has a sustainable business model and is in a position to continue to facilitate the return of capital to the State when the Government decides.  <\/p> <p>  First, I will introduce the members of my management team who are with me.  They are Mr. Mark Bourke, chief financial officer; Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, head of financial solutions group; and Mr. Robert Mulhall, managing director of retail, corporate and business banking.  <\/p> <p>  AIB is a critical part of Ireland's economic infrastructure.  The banking system and the supporting infrastructure were rescued from collapse at great expense to the taxpayer because of the crucial economic role of the banks.  The financial crisis and the role the banks played in its creation led, understandably, to a reputational battering of the banking sector which will take a lot of time to heal and will never be forgotten.  Fortunately, the reality is that the banking sector in Ireland is now in far better shape and delivering on a daily basis the economic support it has been designed to deliver.<\/p> <p>  Overall, while the GDP growth rate is expected to lessen slightly next year, the economy is forecast to continue to perform well in the next three years, prompting demand for new loans and banking products and reducing pressure on problem loans.  AIB's role is to be a strong net contributor to Ireland's prosperity to demonstrate why it was an organisation that was well worth saving.  We can do this by providing reliable financial support for every aspect of the economy, including business, farming, families, individuals and communities.  As evidence of its progress, the bank is recording a strong underlying profit, has made substantial repayments to the State and is ready for sale at a time of the Government's choosing.  <\/p> <p>  In summary, after a period of enormous transformation, AIB's financial performance has improved, with a sustainable underlying profit of approximately &euro;1 billion, excluding write-backs and one-off benefits which are incremental to it; a reduction in our cost base of &euro;450 million over three years to 2015; an &euro;18 billion reduction in impaired loan balances to &euro;11 billion in June 2016 from &euro;29 billion in 2013; new lending approvals of &euro;14 billion in 2015 and &euro;6.1 billion in the first half of 2016, an increase on the figure for the previous year; a total of 37,000 forbearance solutions provided for mortgage customers in difficulty; owner-occupier arrears greater than 90 days past due at a figure of 5.8%, significantly below the industry average of 8%; significant capital generation and strong capital ratios; and repayments of capital in the past 12 months of &euro;3.5 billion to the State, bringing total payments to &euro;6.5 billion, including fees, coupons, dividends and levies.<\/p> <p>  AIB received a &euro;20.8 billion investment from the State and our objective is to facilitate the repayment of this amount in full.  The timing, nature and structure of a return to the public markets are matters for the Minister.  From my perspective, the aspect within my control is the management and performance of the bank and ensuring international investors have a clear understanding of our strategy, progress and future trajectory.  Members will have recently seen that the  Department of Finance has begun the process of appointing investment banks as \"global co-ordinators\" as part of a banking syndicate to assist in a potential future initial public offering, IPO, of AIB.  The selected investment banks will assist the State in the initial stages of preparation for an IPO and the Department has confirmed that the global co-ordinators selected will be appointed for an 18-month period with an option to extend.  <\/p> <p>  If proof were needed of the importance of a strong banking sector, it has rarely been more starkly illustrated than in very recent times.  Economic uncertainty has been introduced in unprecedented measure by the Brexit vote and possible policy changes under a new US Presidency.  I strongly preface my remarks by stressing how premature it is at this stage to accurately foretell what lies ahead in either the EU, US or UK scenarios.  However, as a small open economy which is particularly influenced by developments such as those we have just seen in two of our most significant trading partners, we must give serious thought to the risks and benefits that might yet result for the country.  In the short term a weakening sterling is affecting some of our indigenous exporters and we are working hard with our customers who are impacted on to address these effects and plan with them for alternative and diversified markets.  I believe that in the longer term Ireland can present itself as a bridge between two major economic regions on either side of the Atlantic.  This must be the most attractive location in which to invest capital and resources.  This must be true for local entrepreneurs, domestically headquartered businesses and the multinational sector.  This goes well beyond headline tax rates.  If we have a truly supportive and agile approach to attracting all investment, we can maintain the healthy job creation that has been a feature of the past few years.  There is no reason we cannot benefit from additional foreign direct investment inflows and possibly the relocation of financial firms from the United Kingdom, but in order to attract business we must have the required supporting infrastructure such as commercial office space, housing, transport and efficient access to finance.  As a well capitalised bank with excess liquidity, AIB is strongly placed to help to drive and support that strategy.  <\/p> <p>  During the summer the publication of the ECB stress test results attracted negative media attention.  The market reaction was more muted.  The methodology used is particularly penal to banks such as the Irish banks, with their relatively high levels of non-performing loans, NPLs, and a recent history of losses on distressed loans.  The tests were a snapshot in time and do not fully reflect the current state of the bank and the pace of our recovery.<\/p><p>Crucially there are no required capital actions.  Earlier this month, Moody&rsquo;s outlook on Ireland&rsquo;s banking sector was positive in spite of the Brexit vote, saying the uncertainty introduced by the result was manageable and that Irish banks had materially strengthened their solvency ratios owing to a mix of factors including strong internal capital generation and simplification of their capital structures.<\/p><p> After the initial phases of the financial crisis, the level of non-performing loans, NPLs, still on AIB's balance sheet was almost &euro;30 billion at the end of 2013.  AIB has in the intervening years engaged with customers in difficulty to implement a range of forbearance and restructuring solutions.  This work meant that by the end of June 2016 these NPLs were 61% lower at &euro;11 billion.  Despite this progress and the fact that we hold almost half of this in bad debt provisions, we recognise it is still a high number when compared to other peer European banks.  Elevated NPLs attract both regulatory and market attention and the ECB in particular is very keen to oversee the lowering of NPLs across the entire European financial system.  Their stress tests will continue to focus very heavily on this aspect, as will other regulatory actions.  Therefore, we must continue to address the challenge of non-performing loans as a matter of the utmost strategic importance.  We will continue to seek and implement sustainable solutions for those customers who engage with us whilst also recognising that after years of consistently working to restructure the number of loans in long-term arrears, we must keep all options open that reduce the overall level of NPLs.<\/p><p> We are essentially a core Irish bank.  With 2.2 million AIB customers and 360,000 EBS customers, the AIB Group is rooted in the country&rsquo;s economic life and communities.  A total of 60,000 customers use our 205 AIB branches every day, with a further 7,000 customers visiting our 71 EBS locations daily.<\/p><p> Our partnership with An Post, with its 1,100 offices, provides banking services to 15,000 customers every day, with approximately 4 million transactions expected to be recorded by the end of this year alone.  These combined banking services amount to a deeply embedded and widespread network across the country.  Our network bank staff are drawn from within the community, bringing with them local knowledge and an understanding of our customers and their needs.<\/p><p> Close engagement between AIB and our customer base is important to the success of our business and underpins our performance.  We have recently reorganised our banking model in order to work more closely and connect better with our customers across our retail business and corporate activities.  We created 19 new local markets which are now in place and headed by an individual senior manager responsible for AIB&rsquo;s overall engagement with customers in that region.<\/p><p> The bank is organising around customers at a local level, eliminating duplication and unnecessary complexities in the system.  The new structure aims to provide customers with a convenient one-stop-shop flexible form of service, allowing more local management autonomy when it comes to decision-making, including lending.  It is designed to be more tailored to individual customer needs, allowing far greater agility of service and enabling us to move working capital faster and more efficiently.<\/p><p> When I joined AIB in 2010, I could not have predicted the amount of change in customer behaviour that would occur in a relatively short period of time.  The systematic move by customers to digital and technological banking means that AIB is more than half way through an &euro;870 million investment programme focused on improving the customer experience, digital innovation and information technology resilience.<\/p><p> AIB is leading the expansion of digitalisation of services.  For example, 76% of all AIB&rsquo;s personal loan applications are now done through digital channels and 95% of all customer transactions are automated.  This activity is by no means conducted just by a younger generation of customers.  The use of digital channels by older age groups is growing consistently, regardless of geographical location.  In line with European norms, banking online and through remote channels has been embraced across the country.  Almost 50% of customers in rural counties now use digital banking of one kind or another.  More than 40% of our 500,000 daily transactions are conducted outside of normal banking hours, and are transacted online or on mobile.<\/p><p> There is a balance to be maintained between providing our customers with personal, one-to-one services and an accessible and robust digital or mobile service.  AIB opened three new branches last year, in Little Island, Cork, Carrickmines and Grand Canal Dock in Dublin.  Earlier in 2016, we opened the only in-store banking outlet in the Republic of Ireland through SuperValu in Lucan.  It is an illustration of the increasing number of flexible banking options available to our customers, to be used when and where they choose.<\/p><p> AIB is also increasing its mobile salesforce where trained staff travel to meet customers where and when it suits their needs.  In addition to the core retail opening hours, by the end of this year the bank will be operating 20 bank lobbies across the country providing a wide range of services, seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.  In addition, students now have access to exclusive on-campus banking services at 13 universities and colleges from Waterford to Sligo, and from Dublin to Galway.  Where there is a lack of physical branch infrastructure, AIB operates community banks in rural areas of Cork, Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary, Mayo, Galway and Donegal via mobile branches.  We have recorded over 40,000 transactions at these branches this year.<\/p><p> Supporting our customers with speedy and efficient credit decisions remains central to our aims.  Overall, the bank is approving approximately &euro;14 billion a year in new lending to SME, corporate, mortgage and personal customers.  The bank is now clearly performing its fundamental role of facilitating our retail and business customers in protecting as well as creating jobs.  On the SME and corporate side, the bank sanctioned &euro;4.8 billion in lending last year to existing and new businesses and the current momentum is positive.<\/p><p> The bank has 250,000 SME customers and can now provide a decision within 48 hours on a credit application of up to &euro;30,000.  Since this initiative&rsquo;s launch in September 2014, some 28,000 applications have been approved through this process.  The performance of loans in what was a very challenged SME sector has improved significantly, a welcome metric as it directly involves saving jobs and creating employment.  Meanwhile, we have been building out bank sectoral teams, developing specialists to work specifically with key areas of the economy.  These teams have gained an insight into the needs of farmers, retailers, the hospitality sector, transport, technology, exporting, energy and health sectors.  This approach of building sectoral capability has been very effective.  It has given the bank a high level of understanding of the specific requirements of businesses and allowed us to shape products and funds suitable to their needs.  For example, our agri-team now includes eleven specialist advisors with front-line experience of farmers&rsquo; needs and opportunities and who can respond rapidly and pragmatically to issues such as flooding, price volatility and poor crop yields.  Farming is a major aspect of our business and, following the full drawdown of the first &euro;500 million agri-loan fund, at the end of last year we launched a second &euro;500-million agri-loan fund to support the sector.<\/p><p> Recently, AIB has been engaging with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland or SBCI in regard to the Low-Cost AgriCash Flow Support Loan Fund announced in the budget.  AIB&rsquo;s successful partnership with the SBCI in helping the expansion of small businesses and farming is reflected in the aforementioned figures.  Since the launch of AIB&rsquo;s &euro;400 million SBCI fund in 2015, which is available at a 4.5% rate, AIB has approved more than &euro;5 million of credit each week to businesses and farmers under the fund.  Last year, the average loan drawdown under this fund was &euro;28,500 but loans ranged in size from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1 million.<\/p><p> AIB is the largest provider of mortgages in the Irish market.  We have a 34% share of market by drawdowns and we approved &euro;2 billion of loans to customers last year alone.  Conscious of the need to treat customers fairly, as soon as the bank&rsquo;s underlying performance allowed, and in particular as our cost of funding improved, AIB moved to cut its standard variable rate.  The joint committee is aware that we have implemented four mortgage rate cuts totalling 1% to new and existing customers in the past 24 months.  Our SVR rate is now a market-leading 3.4% and LTV variable rates start as low as 3.1%.  It means savings of approximately &euro;1,300 a year on the average mortgage.  We also introduced a &euro;2,000 contribution to switching costs to facilitate that process.<\/p><p> Case by case restructuring of problem mortgages continues to absorb a high degree of bank resources but, as the figures show, we are making good headway.  We have produced a comprehensive range of sustainable solutions including split mortgages, low fixed-rate options, term extensions, arrears capitalisation, reduced repayment and voluntary sale for loss.  All of these measures are underpinned by the bank&rsquo;s determination to keep people in their homes where possible, when customers engage with us and prioritise mortgage debt.  Repossession is always a last resort and, in spite of popular misapprehensions, less than 200 repossessions of owner-occupier homes took place last year as a result of enforced security.  Our engagement with third-party channels such as the Irish Mortgage Holders' Organisation and Stepchange has also led to the resolution of thousands of what appeared to be intractable cases.<\/p><p> As everyone is acutely aware, we are operating at present in a very constrained housing market.  The societal and economic impact of the lack of housing supply makes an early solution to this crisis imperative.  AIB recognises the critical role it plays in the housing supply chain and is actively engaged with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as well as other relevant agencies, to ensure we play our role in establishing a normalised housing market.  The bank is also providing a pipeline of hundreds of empty houses to the Housing Agency to provide homes for families.<\/p><p> In summary, on behalf of AIB, I want to again express thanks to the committee for inviting us here today.  From our perspective, these engagements with the Oireachtas are a valuable means of explaining our position to the committee and to the broader public.  They allow space for debate and also provide us with a clear view of the opinions and expectations of the committee.<\/p><p>Once again, with the bank now profitable, our priorities are to maintain the focus on delivering a strong and sustainable financial performance, to be ready for an IPO when our shareholder decides, to continue to reduce impaired loans, to strongly support Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth and jobs and to keep our customers' needs at the heart of all our policies. <\/p><p> The Irish banking sector is an integral part of the Irish economic infrastructure.  In addition to supporting our indigenous industries, we play our role in establishing Ireland as the European location of choice for international investment.  I assure the committee my team and I will continue to build on the advances already secured by AIB and support our customers in the challenges ahead.  It is through the delivery of professional, efficient, reliable and experienced service that we intend to match our strong financial performance with a full redemption of customer trust in the bank.  We welcome the committee's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016112400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479979800,"counter":2705,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Byrne.

Part of that referred to a limit or number.  We are part of that group but in overall terms I believe that number came from looking at the average first-time buyer property in terms of the pricing that was set and to move the limit from &euro;220,000, which seemed low relative to the experience in the market, to a level which reflected the experience in the market.  The guiding thought on that number was based on market practice more than anything else.  Based on quick observation of what the Central Bank has done, it has simplified the system even more than that.  Effectively, it has stuck with a 90% position and moved away from a property boundary on the loan-to-value, LTV, side, so it is creating an environment where a 90% mortgage for a first-time buyer on a LTV basis is okay.  It is important to remember that the loan-to-income, LTI, restriction will still be in place, so that will place a boundary on part of the criteria.  Affordability is central to everything and what has happened on the LTV side will certainly help in freeing up what was probably the major stalling point, as we would have seen it, in terms of the ability of people to gather deposits.  It has helped that piece.  However, the affordability piece in terms of incomes will still be in place.  It will take time to see how that plays out.  As a quick perspective on it, we believe it is helpful.  We believe it will help bridge the apparent real problem which was people's inability to gather deposits.  However, affordability is still central to this.  People will get closer access to a deposit but affordability will be key.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016112400002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1479979800,"counter":2714,"content":"<p>I understand, but my specific question was what impact, if any, Mr. Byrne thinks this will have on house prices when one looks at both schemes combined.  I will give him an example.  Let us say I am a first-time buyer who is borrowing from a body in the AIB group, such as EBS, and I wish to purchase a house for &euro;300,000.  The deposit I must put together now is &euro;9,000, which is 3%.  Obviously the loan-to-value ratio is 90%, the Government will give me 5%, which takes me up to 95%, and EBS will give me 2% back.  In effect, from a borrower's point of view, it is like a loan-to-value ratio of 97%.  We know that is not the reality but the reality for the borrower is that he or she is only required to have 3%.  Does Mr. Byrne think that is prudent?  That is close to a return to the 100% rates, which could allow for much more credit to flow and could have the impact of pushing house prices up again.

There is an element of the pricing for first-time buyers, other things being equal, having to rise to attract supply into the market.  There will be two factors playing out and it will be difficult in the first six to 12 months to figure out which of them is happening.  One will be a move to a clearing price in terms of first-time properties and the second might well be price inflation as a result of a supply-demand imbalance still in the system.  In the short term one is likely to see prices rising.  Some of that is necessary to encourage supply to come forward and some of it will be simply a consequence of that shortage of supply for demand.  As a measure, it will encourage the development of first-time properties in a significant way.  That is something we will see playing out.  Property developers, and banks, will now be able to look at the market and see how properties can be moved into a consumer marketplace as consumers can get the deposit together, so they can construct.  The measure is likely to have a positive impact from that point of view.<\/p> <p>  The other positive measure in the Central Bank announcement yesterday is that it is clear from the Governor, Mr. Lane's speech and the actions of the Central Bank that the Central Bank will keep this under very close review.

On the mortgage side, as we have engaged with customers we have put 38,000 solutions in place.  We have written off &euro;1.3 billion of debt in an attempt to right size particular positions for home owners and property owners on mortgages who have engaged with us.  Our stance has always been that if somebody engages with us, gives us the disclosure and allows us to understand their affordability, we will right size the debt and come up with an answer.  That answer in many circumstances involves the right sizing of debt, and &euro;1.3 billion is the total write-off.  We think that will continue but we think there are a couple of categories that are starting to become very obvious.  Some of them are about people's inability to engage because they just have no affordability and, on the other hand, people's desire to stay out of the process because they see that as a better outcome than getting involved in the process.

As Bernard Byrne said, we have 38,000 mortgage restructures in place.  We have 13,000 customers who are post 90 days past due in our private dwelling or owner-occupier mortgages which, as the Deputy pointed out, is still a significant number of customers in difficulty.  The challenge for us is that it is about engagement.  We have been working very hard on engagement because we recognise that borrowers, for various reasons, find it difficult to engage with the bank.  We have worked with the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, IMHO, StepChange and various organisations.  That engagement is critical to us working through this portfolio.  In the engagement we have had with the IMHO, where people feel that they can have independent engagement with ourselves, funded by ourselves, we have had almost 3,000 customers come through that and we have put solutions in place for over 2,500.  They would have been customers that we would have seen within the cadre of customers who were not willing to engage and work with us.<\/p><p>As the committee will see from the documentation, we have almost 7,000 customers out of the broad group of 13,000 that are at various stages of the legal process.  The legal process and repossession are a tiny part of the solution.  When we look at the scale of repossessions that have taken place, from our perspective, and on an industry level, compared to the amount of restructures that have happened, it is about 1%.  When one looks at the volume of restructures that have happened in the bank through 2015, for example, nearly 48,000 restructures occurred and close to 700 repossessions took place and some of those would have been voluntary.<\/p><p> Engagement is critical.  One can see from the list that we have a wide range of solutions.  Even in the legal process when we look back to 2015 we see that between 20% and 25% of that grouping re-engaged with us and in the vast majority of cases we were able to find solutions for them.  As we move forward what will be critical for everybody is that either directly with ourselves or through engagement with third parties, people are encouraged to come forward to the banks to find solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016112400002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim O'Keeffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479979800,"counter":2720,"content":"<p>I will move on to another issue, but with respect, it is the same spiel &ndash; engagement, engagement, engagement - but there must be a point where the situation is resolved and the bank does something different.<\/p> <p>  The bank holds 569 vacant properties following repossessions.

We have never come out with a number so any numbers that are in the system are media numbers.  The number mentioned by Deputy Doherty is not one we have ever used.<\/p> <p>  Last August we started a programme to look at whether there was an issue in the bank associated with tracker mortgages.  As we developed through the programme we determined that there was an issue and there are two parts to it.  One is that in certain situations customers had, or should have reasonably been entitled to think, that they had a contractual right to a tracker.  The second part is that there is probably a larger group of those we confused, or where the documentation was confusing or our communication with them was misleading.  There are those two cohorts.  As the work progressed, the Central Bank came out with a framework in December and we brought the two programmes together.  In July we announced that we were starting to communicate with the first group of customers that we had brought through the whole programme at that stage and we put them on to the correct rate.  The number of customers we are talking about in that circumstance is approximately 2,600.<\/p> <p>  As we have progressed, this month we are engaging with customers in terms of actually fixing those balances.  We changed the rate and now we are fixing the balances and before the year end, in respect of those customers we expect to have resolved all items and issues, subject to the fact that they have appeals rights and that there may be other issues that need to be investigated.  In respect of that group, which is the majority of the customers, we expect to be through that, so it is a slightly different number but I am just giving the context of where we are at.  We have not completed all of the work in respect of that at this stage and it will run into the early part of next year in terms of conclusion of that programme.<\/p> <p>  The provision that we have we announced last year and we still remain confident it is the correct provision so we have no change in respect to it.  Based on the work we have done at this point in time our assessment, knowing what we know - we have not fully engaged with all of the customers so we do not know everything - in respect of people's homes, where the rate was an issue, we might have 14 customers where the home was lost as a result of the rate.<\/p> <p>  If I could add the context to that, because I think it is relevant, one of the reasons that we have written off &euro;1.3 billion of debt and mortgage loans is that as we have engaged with customers, we have tried to right size their loan based on affordability.  In situations where they could not afford the whole debt we therefore did a write off.  So the historic rate that existed on the product was not hugely relevant all the time in terms of the position that they were in.  If they were in a modest amount of arrears or they could not afford the repayment we looked at a different solution, so a split mortgage, for example, would not have looked at the existing product offering, it looked at affordability and we tried to see whether we could do something.<\/p> <p>  In order to make sure that we were clear on the boundaries of what we were trying to do and not to make another mistake, problem and loss to the customer, we effectively expanded our definition of the criteria to apply for those products.  Our solution for the 14 customers, which is the position as we know it at the moment, is based on an assessment that asks whether they would have been entitled to a forbearance solution.  All of them would have a problem under any solution, and if we were applying a more expanded definition, a bigger boundary to that forbearance solution, would we have been able to come up with an answer which may have allowed us to progress?  That is the full context to the number we have at the moment but until we conclude I will not be able to say definitively where we are at, but for the sake of the committee, that is where we are at today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016112400002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1479979800,"counter":2724,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Byrne and his colleagues and like Deputy Doherty I thank him for the information he provided in advance by way of the questionnaire.<\/p> <p>  I will start on the issue of the bank's interest rates, the standard variable rates, SVRs, and acknowledge the progress AIB has made on that front and the fact that the bank does not differentiate between new and existing customers, unlike some other banks.

If one looks at the overall book of Irish rates versus European rates, in all banks not just AIB, we are right on the average in terms of the European zone in total book when one takes the pricing.  Some markets are higher, for example, France, Germany and the UK, and some markets are lower.<\/p><p>On a front book pricing basis, Irish pricing is higher than the European average, but the features of the market are very different.  For example, in many European countries, the imposition of fees upfront has a significant impact.  The European average is about 43 basis points.  In France, it is 87 basis points if the effect of upfront fees is annualised across.  Different markets operate in different ways.  In the Irish market, this manifested itself in banks offering a significant upfront benefit in the form of a cashback offer.  For our core AIB franchise, we felt it right to continue to offer the front and back book benefit in terms of the customers' positions.  Any time we make a change to the SVR, we spread it across the customer base.  This costs us about &euro;140 million in benefit to the customers.  However, the feature of the market attracting particular interest was the cashback offer, which does not come without a cost.  The 2% cashback offer comes at a cost to one's position.  Effectively, we differentiated the two offerings we had on the market and positioned EBS as a cashback offer for customers for whom cashback is very important and who wanted a cashback position.  Interestingly, the changes about which we talked earlier may have an impact on the relative attractiveness of this product in the future.  Pretty much all the competitors were offering cashback at the time.  We then tried to facilitate switching, if this was important to the customer and was what he or she wished to do, from an EBS brand to AIB.  It was not a perfect measure but it was our attempt to match customer choice in the two relevant offerings in the market and to facilitate switching via a benefit of &euro;2,000.

We mentioned in our opening statement the position we adopted as we tried to address the very high level of non-performing loans we had.  Over the past five or six years, we have engaged significantly with customers.  As I have indicated, there has been &euro;1.3 billion of write-offs on the mortgage side.  A similar volume of write-offs has taken place across SME and other portfolios as we have tried to address this issue.  We have successfully reduced the balance to &euro;11 billion and we have indicated that this figure will be closer to &euro;10 billion by the end of the year, which is great.  However, non-performing loans will still comprise 17% of the bank's balance sheet.  The European norm is approximately 5.5%.  The primary issue of focus for the ECB and the regulatory authorities is the level of non-performing loans on a bank's balance sheet.  The stress tests we mentioned earlier make that very obvious when they focus on the capital position of the banks.  For that reason, we emphasised in our opening statement that it is of the utmost strategic importance that we continue to address this topic.  I suppose that is consistent with Deputy Pearse Doherty's comments.  The level of arrears remains very high.  It must be addressed and dealt with.  It was in that context that I said we are keeping all options under active review at this time.  I include the options that have been mentioned, such as portfolio sales and disposals, if appropriate, in that context.  Any attempt in that direction will focus on commercial portfolios in the first instance.  We are continuing to work as hard as we can on the private dwelling house portfolio and other portfolios.  This issue will have to be addressed.  A famous investor, Warren Buffett, once said that if something cannot last forever, it will end.  The ECB's view is that the number of non-performing loans in Irish banks must be reduced.  If this issue is not resolved, the consequences in terms of capital, etc., will be very significant and that will feed through to pricing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016112400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1479979800,"counter":2761,"content":"<p>Under the relationship framework agreement with the Minister, is the bank required to consult or get the permission of the Minister if it is seeking to dispose of a loan portfolio above a certain threshold?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016112400002#L00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479979800,"counter":2762,"content":"<p>That is an issue for the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016112400002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Mulhall"},{"type":"speech","time":1479979800,"counter":2763,"content":"<p>Okay.

Many of the issues that are seen on the voluntary side refer to specific cases that have been worked through with the customer, and in respect of which deals have been done and agreements have been reached about debt write-offs and relieving people of future obligations.  That has been helpful in this context.  There is a legal element to this because as part of the process, we must make constant progress through the process.  We end up in that circumstance when people do not engage.  As Mr. O'Keeffe mentioned earlier, the legal approach sometimes has a positive effect in terms of re-engagement.

I am surprised that the cases in question are before the courts.  Despite intervention to try to explain the situation through intermediaries, they remain before the courts.  In other words, when the bank passes them to its legal representatives, they just take a course and end up either with a registrar or in the Circuit Court and it is impossible for some of them to be represented properly in those courts.  They have to apply for free legal aid, which further adds to their distress and upset because they are dragged through all of this process without the appropriate supports in terms of solicitors and everything else.  There must be something wrong with the process if cases like that end up with the registrar or the Circuit Court.<\/p> <p>  There is something wrong with the fact that when the bank passes its cases to its legal representatives, it becomes an inflexible process that just closes down in the interest of pushing the proceedings through the courts.  Has the bank examined that matter?  A number of Deputies and Senators attend these courts and what goes on is shocking.  I have also said it to the Bank of Ireland that it is difficult to believe that such cases would be taking place in light of all the discussion we have had about saving family homes and working through all the options.  One particular case comes to mind and I must set it out.  The case in question involves two brothers living together, one of whom is now attending the department of psychiatry and has been for years.  He is still getting letters from the bank's legal representatives despite the fact that it has torn his life asunder.  His brother is now on the verge of the same thing.

One of the key features that matter from an IPO point of view is the investor appetite for the marketplace.  Ireland is an attractive market relative to other jurisdictions.  It still has a higher growth rate, a younger demographic and is seen as an attractive location from a European point of view.  That is positive.  Another feature is the strength of our banking franchise.  Approximately 40% of the marketplace is seen as attractive as a growth opportunity and that is given we have a disproportionate share of younger customers.  The fact we have restructured the bank and are delivering profitability is seen as attractive and is still giving an opportunity for growth going forward.  The next phase of any development is to make sure people are comfortable with the capital.  At this stage people are comfortable with the capital and can see how the bank is generating a return on that capital.  The final element, which is a very important one, is the market dynamic, which is influenced by a whole series of things.  It is influenced by an interest rate environment which is low at the moment.  It is influenced by a view on Europe, Brexit, the US elections and the sort of things which introduce volatility.  It is also influenced by a view on the regulatory regime and its likely impacts.  They are all decisions that investors make independent of us.  We have nothing to do with that.

At this point in time that is much lower down the list and the surveys that exist will support this.  From our point of view, what we have done and what we continue to try to do is deal with the speed at which credit decisions get made.  One of the key issues that has affected people is decisions taking a very long time, which they interpreted as a slow \"No\", but not giving a person a decision at all.  Hence our commitment, and we mentioned it in the opening address, to the turnaround times for small loans, that is a loan for under &euro;30,000, which is 90% of all SMEs loans, is 48 hours.  Our approval rate for SME loans is 94%.  <\/p> <p>  Basically, we are saying that SMEs should apply, it is a very short process, the document that an AIB customer has to fill out is very small, about three or four pages.  We are encouraging AIB customers to fill out the application and we can track what happens.  If the SME customer does not like the bank's decision, there are many mechanisms available, both internal to the bank and also the Credit Review Office.  There is professional machinery that works and will deal with the customer when a loan decision or an investment is declined.  We will always work, and have always worked with the decision of the Credit Review Office and implemented the solution that has come out of that process.  <\/p> <p>  The numbers that take those routes are very low, but it is very difficult to deal with the anecdote.  It is very difficult to deal with people who say they did not apply because they knew the bank would say \"No\".  In terms of encouragement to people, the first priority should be for them to apply for a loan.  I would not be too concerned if our approval rates dropped because more people applied.  At least that would be evidence and information with which we could do something.  The first issue is to try to ensure that everyone applies.  If we the bank end up saying \"No\", there is an appeals process and a Credit Review Office.  That is important. <\/p> <p>  In the second point about the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, we engage very actively with it and in terms of its loans, we put in place a &euro;200 million facility.  We utilised it very quickly and then we actually drew down another &euro;200 million, that is &euro;400 million in total.

I would like to update the committee today on the work I have been doing in the Department of Finance with the cost of insurance working group, which brings together all the relevant Departments and offices involved with the process.  In September when I last appeared at this committee, I welcomed the initiative of the Oireachtas committee to hold public meetings in order to produce its own report on this urgent matter.  I am, therefore, pleased to see that the committee has published its report with its own set of recommendations, many of which complement the emerging recommendations published by the Department of Finance.<\/p><p>Both strands of this work are hugely important.  The Irish insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, as the committee will know.<\/p><p> When one looks at the inflation data from October 2016, one will see that insurance prices have increased by 47% since January 2011, motor insurance prices have increased by 51% during the same period and by 8.5% in the 12 months to October 2016.  These kinds of increases &ndash; these so-called &ldquo;super-cycle&rdquo; trends &ndash;  while down from September, are very damaging to the economy.  They hit consumers hard and they undermine competitiveness.  The future for insurance in Ireland must have certainty, clarity and transparency at its core.<\/p><p> In that regard, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, set up a task force to look at the insurance sector earlier this year.  I was asked to chair a working group under this task force to examine the various factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance.  The cost of insurance working group was established in July.  It brings together the relevant stakeholders on the Government side, namely, the Departments of Finance, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Justice and Equality, as well as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the State Claims Agency and the Central Bank.  The objective of the working group, as set out in its agreed terms of reference, is to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of non-life insurance, with particular focus on motor insurance, and to recommend short, medium and longer-term measures to address the issue of increasing insurance costs, taking account of the requirement for an economically vibrant and financially stable insurance sector.<\/p><p> The core areas being examined by the working group in this first phase are the motor insurance sector generally, at present and in recent years; the effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs, the current claims compensation arrangements and the cost of claims, insurance data and information, the impact of accident rates, the impact of unlawful activity on the insurance sector and other market issues.<\/p><p> As the issue of the cost of insurance is complex and multilayered, I decided as a starting point to establish four subgroups to examine particular issues in detail.  These issues were understanding the motor insurance market, improved data availability, the cost of claims and other public policy issues.  Chairs were appointed to these subgroups, which have been meeting on a weekly basis since September.  The outputs of these subgroups are currently feeding into the regular meetings of the working group.  The working group has held ten meetings to date and will continue to meet every two weeks to the end of 2016. <\/p><p> The consultation process is ongoing and to date, the working group and the four subgroups have met with representatives from AA Ireland, Auto Records Limited, the Consumers Association of Ireland, the Freight Transport Association of Ireland, the Irish Brokers Association, the Car Rental Council of Ireland, the Irish Road Haulage Association, Insurance Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, Tiom&aacute;na&iacute; Tacsa&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann, and the chief executive officers from AIG, AXA, Aviva, FBD, Liberty Insurance and RSA Insurance.  In addition, submissions received from all interested parties are being considered as part of the process.  I have also personally met a number of stakeholders to help me develop a greater understanding of their perspective on this complex issue.  In that regard, I have had informal meetings with representatives from a number of key stakeholders including: Insurance Ireland, AA Ireland, the Injuries Board, the Irish Brokers Association, IBEC, FBD, the Bar Council of Ireland, and the Central Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p> Undoubtedly there are a number of specific issues contributing to the increasing cost of car insurance in Ireland and because of this, I believe it is generally recognised that there is no quick-fix solution to this problem.  In addition, in considering solutions the group has been very conscious of the need to ensure the maintenance of a stable financially solvent insurance sector to ensure that risks to policyholders and the wider financial system are minimised.  Consequently, the importance of insurance companies meeting regulatory requirements and maintaining adequate reserves cannot be understated in examining the pricing of insurance products.  Moreover the constraints imposed by Solvency II on the State&rsquo;s ability to influence insurance pricing must be factored into the overall approach to satisfactorily resolve this issue. <\/p><p> A key part of the work of the group has been to try to build consensus on appropriate actions, which then need to be implemented as soon as possible to restore some stability to pricing in the motor insurance market.  Another important aspect of our work is to make Ireland more attractive for new entrants.  It is likely that some of our actions may take time to implement, particularly if legislation is required.<\/p><p> In order to progress this agenda, however, political consensus among the different parties and Members in the Oireachtas is essential.  Consequently, for this reason I welcome and am appreciative of the work of this committee in conducting public hearings on this matter and in producing a report.<\/p><p> At the end of October, I provided the Minister for Finance with emerging recommendations.  The emerging recommendations touch broadly upon nine areas and between high level and lower level contain about 40 actions.  One area relates to consumer protection.  It seems clear to me that we need better and more proactive information on the part of insurance companies when quoting for insurance or renewing insurance, including providing more information on how a person&rsquo;s premium has been calculated and the reasons behind changes year on year and so forth.  Other issues, such as providing greater recognition of previous driving experience outside the State for returning emigrants, are also the subject of a recommendation.  In summary there is a host of well-documented consumer issues to which the emerging recommendations speak.  I believe this committee's report has identified similar issues, as well as solutions.<\/p><p> A key area where change is required is in the claims environment.  We need to enhance transparency and facilitate the use of data sharing and collection that we see in other jurisdictions.  A resource, either in the form of a claims database or a claims register, is needed for the sector so that among other things, we can see what claims are being made against property or for personal injuries, the legal and other costs that are being incurred and the channel of resolution and what impact that has on the final settlement.  This happens elsewhere and it should happen here.  It is my view that greater transparency in the claims environment should lead to greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and should help prevent these &ldquo;super cycles&rdquo; both up and down that have occurred regularly in the Irish market in the past.  I note the emphasis the Chairman also place on transparency in his preface where he states &ldquo;This Committee, above all, requests the publication of 'raw' insurance data and that transparency becomes the norm within the insurance sector ... from this day forward.&rdquo;<\/p><p> Significant concerns have been raised around the uncertainty of the claims process, its cost and the method for making awards for personal injuries.  I am fully respectful of the right of Judiciary to set awards but I have heard concerns expressed on the need for more consistency in the setting of those awards.  Again, I note this is an issue on which this committee's report has a particular focus.<\/p><p> The working group is therefore going to make a recommendation to establish a personal injuries commission to look at those areas that speak directly to the cost of personal injuries.  Subject to Government approval, I hope this commission can be up and running as soon as possible and will work alongside the ongoing reform of the book of quantum and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  Its terms of reference have yet to be finalised but we have already scoped out the priority areas for it to look at.  These include conducting an exercise to look at the average awards in other jurisdictions, as well as the grading of personal injuries.  I hope this committee can be broadly supportive of this proposal, as I believe it covers some of the areas highlighted in its report.  If, from their engagement with the industry and others, members of the committee or the Chairman believe they can identify a person or persons to nominate to this commission, such a proposal would be very welcome.<\/p><p> Two other important areas that need to be tackled are uninsured driving and fraud.  In regard to uninsured driving, the working group is likely to recommend that a fully functioning insurance database to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to check insurance compliance through the use of technology such as automatic number plate recognition be finalised.  Much work has already been done in this area, however, I would like to see the roll-out of such a database to be expedited.<\/p><p> On the fraud issue, we are exploring what can be done to improve data sharing around suspected fraud, through the possible establishment of a fraud database.  The legal requirements of such a database such as, for instance, data protection issues are being examined by the working group and any recommendations must be conscious of them.  I note this committee's recommendation in this area that fraudulent and exaggerated claims should be pursued and tackled more aggressively by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and insurance companies and I have no issue with it.  Other recommendations that are emerging include giving consideration to reviewing relevant legislative provisions in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, as well as Road Traffic Act 2004.  The group is also looking at some sector-specific issues in light of concerns raised by hauliers and taxi drivers.<\/p><p> Since providing these emerging recommendations to the Minster for Finance, the working group is working to finalise the report and developing an action plan to enable the relevant Departments and offices to commence the implementation of agreed priority actions.  The report and action plan will detail any legislative or regulatory changes that may be required and will include a detailed timeline for implementation.  I am determined to ensure that this important work progresses at a pace and that it meets its implementation deadlines.  I am taking a hands-on approach as chairman, working closely with Department of Finance officials and liaising closely with the four subgroups that are now established.  Our plan is to publish a report in December of this year.<\/p><p> In conclusion, our work is about taking action on credible solutions to address the problem of the increasing costs of motor insurance with a view to implementing them as soon as possible.  While we cannot direct insurance companies on pricing of insurance products, I hope these recommendations will settle the current uncertainty we are seeing around premium prices.  As these recommendations work their way through, I believe we will then see a sustainable reduction to more appropriate insurance premium prices.  We can achieve that for the customer, while also protecting the stability of the insurance market and ensuring it is a market worth being in.  I have asked my officials to review the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach with a view to incorporating aspects that complement the analysis of the cost of insurance working group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016112400002#FF00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479979800,"counter":2964,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  The joint committee has made 71 recommendations and it took time, deliberation and conversations with the various stakeholders to arrive at the recommendations.  We believe a number of the recommendations can be dealt with immediately.  For example, section 4 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 provides for the Minister to confer additional powers on the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  It is necessary also to reform solicitor's fees.  Could the Injuries Board be reformed so that it takes a greater role in settlement?<\/p><p>More cases might be settled at that level rather than being pursued through the courts with the greater degree of costs and so on.  There is also the other legislation, namely, the Civil Liabilities and Courts Act 2004 and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003.  These are steps that can be taken alongside the work of the Minister of State's working group.  This committee wants to work closely with the Minister of State and that group to achieve the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations we have made.  One of the issues that arose today, and from our recommendations, was to do with the Irish Road Haulage Association and a submission made by its president, Verona Murphy, which indicated that hauliers are obtaining insurance elsewhere in the market in the European Union.  It is a point that we did not develop fully in the context of our recommendations.  We expressed an interest in the area and support the case being made but there is a need for the Minister of State's group to look at this in more detail.  This might be something that he may comment on and maybe resolutions to address the issue could be brought about pretty quickly.  I would like to see that happen.  <\/p><p> Recommendation 59 in our report into the rising costs of motor insurance recommends that Government examines the reasons Irish businesses, in particular the transport sector, are procuring motor insurance abroad with a view to reversing this trend.  The committee also recommends that government engage directly with businesses in this regard.  I know the Minister of State has done that and maybe he has not examined all these recommendations in detail but I would like his opinion on the possibility of implementing some of those recommendations in the short term or having the legislation examined in the short term to see what parts of the legislation were not enacted, what could be enacted, what would impact on the premiums immediately and so on.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on that and I will leave it with him.

From the chance I have had to look at the committee's report, which is very detailed and has a number of recommendations, I see a lot of alignment with the work done by the working group, and there is no surprise there.  The Government and the Oireachtas share concerns around doing something to protect the consumer while also ensuring a stable and attractive market for these companies to operate in and to provide the necessary insurance.  This process has evolved in a good way and I hope the way we have worked together to date can continue because it is in everyone's interests.  If legislation is to come from government, I hope it would be agreed by the House so it could be implemented swiftly.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that we are not coming at this from a standing start.  Work is already under way, not just in our working group, but also in reviewing certain legislation, which the Chairman mentioned, and in technological developments that are already at an advanced stage but perhaps have not been implemented as quickly as we would have liked.  When we publish the working group report in December, the timelines, actions and priorities we have will speak to the fact that work is already under way in certain areas and those areas will have shorter timelines.  Where we see that priority action can be taken, because it can be an early win, we will certainly prioritise that action, always bearing in mind the fact that we will not be able to solve it overnight but should try to move quickly when we can.  Pace is absolutely essential because it will send the correct signal to all the market players about how serious the politicians are to do something to protect consumers from the unfair spikes they have seen in recent years.<\/p> <p>  When one talks about section 4 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, for example, the review is already ongoing, so we are not coming at it from a standing start.  Reform of the Personal Injuries Board is essential and we have spoken to it in terms of our emerging recommendations.  I note also that the Personal Injuries Board is part of our working group.  We are aligned with it in what we hope to do, which is another important factor.  There is no point in the committee or me coming out with recommendations for the Personal Injuries Board which it does not agree with or which it might not think were a priority.  We have been able to make sure that our thinking is aligned with those people who want a similar outcome from this process.<\/p> <p>  Data is the key to understanding everything here and we just do not have the data we need.  There is not the requisite transparency there is in other jurisdictions.  Let us be clear, there are companies operating in Ireland which operate in other jurisdictions where they share data and are transparent with the data on a level that Ireland is nowhere near close to being.  That really concerns me and it very much concerns the working group.  We have strong recommendations which speak to that and to getting that data.  Of course, it would be very helpful if the insurance industry was willing to come forward with the data in a way that the Chairman speaks of it.  We would like to propose an independent body - this has to be finalised in the report - to decide on the defined standard sets to feed into the data, to then control it and share it in a transparent way with everybody.  Data should not be held by certain parts of the industry and data should not be presented in such a way that it is not meaningful to the work we want to do.  Data is key to understanding what we need to address around the claims channels and settlement channels in terms of understanding exactly what is happening and for those 70% of cases where there is no transparency.  Some 10% of cases go to court and 20% go through the Personal Injuries Board but there is a mystery over what happens to the 70% of other cases.  We need to lift the veil on that mystery, which is a crucial act which the Government and the Oireachtas need to take.  We have recommendations that speak to certain sections of the Civil Liabilities and Courts Act on the review of the sections and the commencement of other sections.  Since we published the emerging recommendations further sections have been brought to our attention.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman spoke about the hauliers.  We looked at that initially but we need to look at it a bit more.  We met the Irish Road Haulage Association.  It is important to understand that hauliers who are getting insurance abroad have had to relocate in order to do that.  There are a number of factors that might compel or attract a haulier to operate outside Ireland and insurance is one of those factors but, as the Chairman knows, there are other factors at play.  These factors have been raised with the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport and with Government and there are a number of issues at work there.  We think there is a potential difficulty at EU level with what the hauliers are looking to achieve, namely, to remain registered in Ireland and to purchase insurance from companies in another jurisdiction which do not operate here, do not have freedom of services here and are not registered with the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland.  There is not going to be a quick win there.  If it requires a change at EU level, it will take time.  We need to be clear about that with the hauliers.  I believe I have addressed the issues raised by the Chairman in the first round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016112400002#HH00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1479979800,"counter":2967,"content":"<p>With regard to the issue highlighted by the Irish Road Haulage Association, and in spite of the fact it may take time in terms of the European Union, that cannot stop us and the Minister of State from highlighting the issue, from being determined to bring about the necessary changes and from having a focus on the issue.  I have said it umpteen times today that the Minister of State is the Minister with responsibility in this area.  We know what is happening as do the participants in the business.

That is why when I talk about it, and I hope the committee sees this, and when we come to publish the working group's report with the detailed timeline reflecting all the good work done by the Oireachtas committee and in showing the determination to get things done and to take action, it will have a calming influence on the recent spikes we have seen in the cost of motor insurance premiums.<\/p><p>That is my hope.

The State must intervene to protect consumers as well as protecting the insurance market.  We need reform across a lot of areas.  As the Chair also said, there is no silver bullet policy issue here.  There is a range of complex policy responses that need to be taken.  That is what our emerging recommendations, and the committee's report, speak to.  Reforms have taken place arising from the financial crisis, including the introduction of solvency measures, that prevent some super-cycle trends from happening in future.  One of the first things we must do, however, is stabilise the current spike in premiums that people have witnessed particularly over the last 12 months.  I hope we will be able to give a strong message to all aspects of the market in our recommendations and timelines.

Technology to automatically detect number plates will also be used to detect uninsured drivers and other behaviour.  As those type of actions are implemented they will no longer justify an additional &euro;50 increase on a premium.  Whiplash claims add &euro;130 to premium costs while uninsured drivers add &euro;35.  As our recommendations work their way through, the industry will no longer be able to make a defence for loading premiums in such areas.

We have recommendations that speak to this matter.<\/p> <p>  We are examining the recommendations of the committee's report and determining what further research might be necessary in order to incorporate them.

We just touched on this with his colleagues on the committee around getting the right data.  In our emerging recommendations, which will be finalised in December, we will be doing this through legislation.  The working group has found it difficult to get the information we want from the industry, in so far as trying to drill down into some of the problem areas, including the one raised by the Deputy at the committee.  After our engagement we went to industry with a request for different types of information, not just the type of information Deputy Doherty was looking for, but also the information I was seeking.  Commitments were made, about which the industry was completely genuine, and there was desire by the industry to work with us.  When we actually tried, however, to get that information, it was not as forthcoming as I had hoped.  Different reasons were given around data protection, commercial sensitivity and whether or not information given to a working group in the Department of Finance can be subject to a freedom of information request and what that might mean.  On that point, I take the industry on good faith, but it indicates the very serious need for us to make sure that, through legislation, we are able to grab all the data we need and in the right manner for publication.  That is why we have a recommendation that speaks to the national claims database or register.  It is also why one of our recommendations for the future is that whenever there is an increase on premiums at renewal, the increase would have to be explained to the consumer.  There would have to be something behind that and it would not just be an automatic increase when driver behaviour had not changed.  That is what we are working to, and while I do not want to repeat myself, I have already said that data is the key to all this.  We need to make sure that the type of data we are looking for is clear in legislation and that the data can be given.  <\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, there are insurance companies operating in Ireland that are also operating in other countries.  They are giving that type of data elsewhere for publication but they are not doing it here.  The industry says it is trying to, and that it going to, but it is not happening quickly enough.  I want the Government or an independent body to be in charge of it and to have ownership of the matter.  That is where we are heading and where our work should be going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016112400002#LL00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1479979800,"counter":3005,"content":"<p>I appreciate that and we are at one on the importance of data and raw data.  Reference was made earlier to the statistics released by the industry rebutting claims by the Law Society of Ireland.  This information, which was provided by the industry to the Minister of State on request, was about the average increases in legal costs over a three-year period.  Everybody knows that when one controls the data, one can very much abuse the data also, and the way it is presented, to make a particular argument.  Even at a quick glance, it was very clear that the information was presented in a way that suited the narrative the industry was peddling.  The data shows the levels of compensation but there is no reference to the additional numbers of motorists on the roads between 2013 and 2015.  This increase in driver numbers is a factor.  As there are more cars, there will automatically be more claims, unfortunately.  On the increase in legal costs, the industry made the issue that the insured person's legal costs were running at around a 12% increase over three years.  When we actually look at the industry's own figures, the increase in claimant legal costs is shown at about 8% between 2014 and 2015.  This is exactly the same as the legal costs for the industry itself over the same period.  Again, it is about how the data is put forward.  When it controls the data, it allows it to provide it selectively.  That is an aside but it is important that we get the data availability right.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact the Minister of State has made the point a number of times now about reasons behind increases.  When the motion was going through the D&aacute;il, it was one of the areas I focused on, and that it was not a case that we were just looking at 33% increase on average.  Individuals must have a right to an explanation as to why insurance premiums are increasing above the average in the sector.  If he would not mind, will the Minister of State pursue that issue again?  The argument he has received from the industry do not hold water; it is bull.  That is the reality.  We are not looking for names and addresses of individuals.  We are looking for sample cases such as Mary Jo in Fanad was insured for &euro;350, had no claims, is driving the exact same vehicle and has no penalty points but her renewal premium is &euro;985 and this is the reason for it.  That can be a fictional person but based on a real case file.  There is no reason the industry should not provide the data to the Minister with responsibility for this issue.  If the industry does not provide it, let me be clear that it is basically shunning the work of this committee.  The request from this committee, through the Minister of State, for this type of data to be made available is so that we can be satisfied that the insurance industry gouging its own customers or that it is not doing so.  That is what we need to know and, if he would not mind, I ask the Minister of State to pursue that again, bearing in mind that he requested it earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016112400002#LL00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1479979800,"counter":3006,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty is absolutely right when he speaks of the control of data being key and data being presented in a certain way to make a certain impression.  This has been part of the difficulty we have all had in trying to get to grips with what has been happening over the past number of years.  Companies have used their data in their own way as part of this blame game, and that needs to end.  We will need, through legislation, to very clearly define exactly what data we are looking for, how it is to be presented, what it means and how we intend to publish it.  The control part is key and that is why it needs to be by an independent or a State body, and not the insurance industry.  I want to let the Deputy know about an exchange I had with one of the industry companies that came in.  It may have been a little bit indicative of the exchanges we have been having.  I put the point across to the company that we need to know, and a person needs to know, why a premium has increased.  The company is providing the service, the person is paying for it and needs to understand why there is an increase.  I asked the company if it could commit to doing that and it said that it could.  I asked if a person would get a detailed understanding of why a particular premium had increased.

Forgive me if I picked this up wrong, as we had quite a long session on the Finance Bill, but when George Hook focused on the issue of fraud, the Minister of State said that he had seen evidence or information provided by the industry that suggested a level of fraud takes place.  We know from the industry and from cases that there have been staged accidents and so on, but that does not amount to the level of fraud being suggested.

These measures to tackle fraud are key.  We could use automatic number plate recognition technology to make it easier for the Garda to identify uninsured drivers.

There is a huge onus on the industry to front-up in providing data and information.  It speaks constantly about the economic incentive to settle early, but this is causing a problem in providing an incentive for some people to chance their arm, the expression which might have been used by the Deputy, which impacts on everyone.  To go back to the point made by Senator Rose Conway Walsh, let us not come out of the committee trying to support the impression which some are trying to give that the reason is people suffer from whiplash as a result of an accident.

It is important that we tackle all of these issues.  Some of them may be minor, but they should be tackled because it will help to reduce premiums a little.  The increases stem from the investment end of the companies' portfolios - that has been the main driver - and imprudent practices in recent years.  Having said that, I am concerned that the Government's approach will be to reduce the existing safeguards for motorists and those with a legitimate claim, for example, through providing care, not cash.<\/p> <p>  There is an idea that the prevalence of whiplash claims in Ireland is way beyond what it is anywhere else.  I made the point in private session that - no harm to them - certain comments made by individuals in the debate were over the top.  They received headlines for their comments on the weakest necks in Europe and such nonsense.  Yesterday I made the point in private session that in a fire the injuries suffered would be burns, while in a car accident typically they would be damage to soft tissue and whiplash.  The idea that this is the dominant claim in the sector should not, therefore, come as a surprise.<\/p> <p>  In tackling these issues to try to push down premiums I am concerned to ensure we will not reduce the safeguards for motorists and benefits.  It should be borne in mind that many people do not claim from motor or home insurance companies when they have legitimate reasons to do so.  I have been in that situation.  Somebody hit my car while it was parked outside Leinster house.  On another occasion I damaged my car and it cost money to fix it.  The reason people do not claim is their premiums will increase and they will lose their no claims bonus.  As a result, they put their hand in their pocket and pay themselves.  If paint falls on the carpet, homeowners do not claim because they know their insurance premium will increase.  Two years ago my oil tank leaked causing an oil spill in my garden.  Obviously, I had to have the soil removed.  When I telephoned the insurance company, I was told I should not claim because I would lose my no claims bonus and that there was an excess.<\/p><p>I said \"Yes, but what about the cost?\", which was ridiculous because the amount of damage was small but the cost was approximately &euro;27,000, a quarter of what it cost me to build my house ten years ago.  The point I am making is that many people who have legitimate claims do not claim from the insurance industry, which is profiting as a result of the fear it instils and the model it has in terms of people who take out insurance for damages that occur to themselves, physically, to their vehicles or to their homes.  People do not claim, even though they are insured, because of the structure of the industry's business model.  In a way, the insurance industry is committing the fraud.  My point is that in dealing with this issue and trying to drive down premiums, it is important that we do not reduce the type of support and protections that are there for legitimate claimants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016112400002#MM00800","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479979800,"counter":3022,"content":"<p>That is a very important point.

We are pleased to provide a brief background on medicinal cannabis.  The HPRA is the competent authority for the authorisation of health products in Ireland, which includes medicinal products.  It is our role to ensure that where products can demonstrate they are safe, effective and of an appropriate quality based on clinical and scientific data, they can be authorised and supplied as medicines in Ireland.  Medicinal use of cannabis is a broad term where part of the dried cannabis plant material, or products which have been manufactured from chemicals, known as cannabinoids, extracted from the cannabis plant, are used in medical treatment.<\/p> <p>  Cannabis under Irish law is considered to be a drug of abuse and is controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 2016.  Under this legislation, cannabis and products that contain the psychoactive chemical, tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC, or its related derivatives, are subject to strict controls.  Cannabis is prohibited other than in specified circumstances where all activities relating to cultivation, manufacture and supply of cannabis, and products containing THC, are subject to licence.  Under this legislation cannabis and products containing THC are not viewed as products having medicinal use.  However, a doctor could prescribe in limited circumstances, if granted a licence to do so by the Minister for Health.  While it is generally perceived that our current legislative framework prohibits medicinal use of cannabis, this is not fully correct.<\/p> <p>  It is important to clarify that the cannabis plant also contains a range of cannabinoids some of which are psychoactive, which means they affect the mind, and some not.  Examples of cannabinoids that are not psychoactive include cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD.  Products containing non-psychoactive chemicals, such as CBD. are distinct in that these do not fall under the Misuse of Drugs legislation and its restrictions.  In considering medicinal use of cannabis and the debate on the need for new legislation, we must be clear that this does not extend to CBD, which can be prescribed by doctors, without special licence.<\/p> <p>  However, regardless of the control status, if cannabis or its products make medicinal claims, they would be considered to be a medicine.  In general, medicines are required to have a marketing authorisation enabling supply on the Irish market.  The existence of an authorisation provides reassurance that a rigorous scientific assessment of the medicine&rsquo;s quality, safety and effectiveness has been carried out by an authority such as ours.  Based on this, the benefit-risk profile for the authorised medicine is both known and considered positive.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has authorised one medicinal cannabis clinical trial under a ministerial licence, which the company sponsoring the trial did not progress.  We have also authorised a cannabis-based medicine which is known as Sativex.  This contains the psychoactive chemical, THC, and also CBD.  It is indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  The product met the required safety, effectiveness and quality standards for authorisation as a medicine, and demonstrated clear patient benefit.  The misuse of drugs legislation was amended in 2014 to allow for its prescribing, dispensing and supply.  With regard to medicinal cannabis, the authorisation of Sativex and the earlier approval of an application to conduct a clinical trial, demonstrate that there are provisions within the existing misuse of drugs legislation that can enable patient access.  In addition, the legislation can also be adapted to enable wider access, as in the case of Sativex, where this is justified based on scientific and clinical evidence.<\/p> <p>  With regard to current research we are aware that a number of clinical trials evaluating cannabis and cannabis products are being conducted within Europe and internationally.  These relate to treatment of a range of conditions including chronic pain, psychiatric disorders and neurological disorders including epilepsy.  Currently, some 30 such trials are ongoing within Europe.  The majority of these trials involve adults.  Some involve children and are investigating the use of products containing only non-psychoactive CBD for the treatment of epilepsy, including severe forms of this condition, which have failed other treatments.  A product known as Epidiolex is the most widely used medicine in such trials.  While the results appear promising, they have not yet been peer reviewed or independently evaluated by a regulatory authority.<\/p> <p>  While many countries have the same approach as Ireland, a number of countries have introduced changes to their misuse of drugs legislation to remove prohibitions which can, in certain circumstances, permit medicinal use of cannabis.  Examples of where such changes have been introduced in Europe include the Netherlands, Croatia, Malta and the Czech Republic.  Denmark and Germany have recently announced their intention to progress similar changes.  Beyond Europe, Australia, Canada and a number of US states have introduced schemes for medicinal access.  Internationally, the schemes in place are focused primarily on controlling the quality and supply, principally of dried cannabis for medicinal use, as prescribed by a doctor.  Other than synthetic cannabinoids and Sativex, countries have not authorised medicinal cannabis as a medicine due to the limitations of currently available clinical data on safety and effectiveness.<\/p> <p>  In recognition of a growing demand for access to cannabis for medicinal purposes, it is, at this time, appropriate to consider whether patients' best interests could be served through enabling access to medicinal cannabis in Ireland.  If on balance, it is considered that a less restrictive approach is appropriate for Ireland, in the absence of clinical data to allow the authorisation of cannabis, and related products, as medicines, there are a number of elements that such a framework may potentially cover.  Based on international models and experience, these might include securing the quality of the cannabis plant which is cultivated, and can vary in terms of its chemical constituents and growing conditions.  The framework would also have to consider patient safety and how that is achieved through appropriate medical oversight, while recognising that the requirement for access has been driven by patient demand.  As such, patients and carers must recognise the limitations of the framework in assuring the safety, quality and effectiveness, as compared with what would be expected from an authorised treatment.<\/p> <p>  The HPRA has been requested by the Minister for Health to provide an expert opinion on medicinal cannabis and required policy and legislative changes.  This is a complex issue which needs to be appropriately dealt with in order that all the needs of patients in Ireland who may benefit from medicinal use of cannabis can be considered.  This also needs to take account of concerns that have been expressed on the potential harm from exposure to cannabis.  We are currently in the process of convening a working group of experts to assist us with this issue.  The conclusion of our work will be an advice to the Minister on the use of medicinal cannabis and if warranted, possible frameworks, based on international experience, to address collective patient needs.  If the Minister, following receipt of our advice, takes a policy decision to implement a new legal framework for medicinal cannabis, it will require time to develop, may require primary legislation and needs to be done in a manner that is effective and best meets both patient and societal needs.  It would also require control of the supply systems for cannabis which have their own complexities.  However, as I have explained, there is provision within the existing legislation for prescribing in limited circumstances.  The HPRA would be happy to further explore, in conjunction with the Department of Health, how this could potentially be used to provide access to medicinal cannabis in the short term and in response to specific needs.  We would be happy to keep the committee updated on our progress.  I thank the Chairman, and we will be happy to address any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016112400002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorraine Nolan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479978000,"counter":3035,"content":"<p>I am a consultant neurologist from St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin with expertise in treatment all forms of epilepsy.  I am the national lead for the epilepsy programme in Ireland and senior lecturer at Trinity College school of medicine and a member of the International League Against Epilepsy, ILAE.  I will give a brief review of the history of cannabis use for epilepsy and describe the science underlying its potential use a prescribed treatment and I will attempt to outline a pathway for developing a consensus around potential prescribing practice.<br\/><br\/>In the history of cannabis use for epilepsy, while there are references to medical uses of hemp going back 8,000 years in China, Irish physician, W.B. O'Shaughnessy is widely acknowledged to have written the first modern scientific paper on medicinal use of cannabis in the<i>Provincial Medical Journal<\/i>published in 1843.  Mr. O'Shaughnessy was born in Limerick in 1809 and moved to Calcutta with the East India Company where he observed the local use of cannabis for various ailments.  He is now considered the father of the medicinal cannabis movement.  In 1851, following his paper, the US Dispensary classified cannabis compounds as useful treatments for neuralgia and convulsive disorders.  By 1860, the Ohio medical society committee on cannabis declared efficacy for infantile convulsions, epilepsy and many other disorders.  However, the narcotic effects of cannabis led to unregulated recreational use and medicinal cannabis was caught up in the prohibition movement that lead to the banning of alcohol and other drugs.<\/p><p>In 1911, Massachusetts became the first state to outlaw cannabis.  Other states quickly followed with marijuana prohibition laws and they persisted throughout the 20th century such that, by 1970, the US Controlled Substances Act was passed, classifying marijuana as a drug with \"no accepted medical use\".  Countries throughout the world now have stringent laws and punishments for the possession and distribution of cannabis.<\/p><p> Let us consider the botanical and chemical aspects of cannabis use.  The herb and its extracts contain more than 100 chemically similar compounds, called cannabinoids.  It also contains over 400 other non-cannabinoid compounds.  As we know, cannabis remains best known as a drug of recreational use and is consumed by approximately 150 million people around the world each day.  Recreational use implies the ingestion of leaves, resin and oils of the Cannabis sativa plant, which has large amounts of the psychoactive form of the cannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol, THC.  It is cannabis which is rich in THC that causes the \"high\" people commonly associate with the drug.  However, the indica plant produces a more fibrous compound that has no psychoactive effects, and this was also probably the first non-food crop grown by man, for the production of hemp rope, sacks, etc.  Hemp is rich in cannabidiol, CBD, which is the form that appears to be useful for treating convulsive disorders.  While the pharmacology of THC is considered to be reasonably straightforward, the pharmacology of CBD is extremely complex.  CBD is known as a multi-target drug whose action is not completely understood.<\/p><p> Over the past 50 years, there has been a growing community of campaigners for more widespread and regularised use of medicinal cannabis.  Among the most popular indications are chemotherapy-induced anorexia and chronic pain in cancer and multiple sclerosis.  Of course, there have also been reports of spectacular reversals in the treatment of epilepsy leading to a chorus of calls from patients, carers and parents for a more thorough evaluation of the drug for epilepsy, and if proved useful, its legalisation.  In 1996, California became the first state in the United States to legalise cannabis, for medicinal use only.  Now cannabis is legal in 26 states in the United States.<\/p><p> I wish to consider the growing evidence for the efficacy of CBD in treating epilepsy.  The first scientific reports in recent times did not appear until the early 2000s.  After a number of case reports of success in treating epilepsy, the issue came to the fore in 2013 when Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's doctor, broadcast a two-part documentary called \"Weed\" on medicinal cannabis use.  The series features Charlotte Figi, a young girl from North America with Dravet syndrome, a severe genetic form of epilepsy that is often resistant to anti-epileptic drugs and puts sufferers at risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, SUDEP.  Some 20% of people with Dravet syndrome will be dead by the age of 20.  Charlotte began to have seizures at the age of three months, and by three years she was having more than 300 per month.  She spent three years in and out of intensive care units.  Her parents moved to Colorado having researched cannabis and obtained a high CBD content oil that had a sudden and dramatic effect on the seizures.  The Figis noted that the amount of CBD in each preparation was important, and they worked with a local grower family, the Stanley brothers, to perfect the strain that worked best.  The product has now become known as Charlotte's Web.<\/p><p> This and other stories like it have led to unprecedented co-operation in open-label studies in the United States of Epidiolex, a purified phytocannabinoid form of CBD derived from the whole plant in the United Kingdom which is produced by the pharmaceutical company GW Pharmaceuticals.  Results from 213 children and young adults who received Epidiolex, which is 99% CBD, in an open-label study were presented first at the American Academy of Neurology in April 2015.  They can be summarised as follows.  Some 9% of patients, or one in ten, with an average age of 11, became seizure free.  The average number of seizures per month was approximately 100 but this number reduced to zero.  Some 50% of patients saw a decrease in the seizure rate of at least 50%, so the number decreased from 100 to 50.  Patients who had Dravet syndrome responded more positively, with a 63% decrease in seizures over three months.  CBD did not work for all and was associated with adverse events, including drowsiness, in 37% and fatigue in 16%.<\/p><p> Two phase III placebo-controlled studies on Epidiolex have recently been completed.  These are the types of trials usually required for licensing.  Preliminary results were posted in a press released on 26 September 2016 on GW Pharmaceuticals' website.  From having spoken to the researchers, I know one of the studies has been accepted for publication.  The other has yet to be published.  Therefore, they have not been published yet in peer review journals.<\/p><p> Despite increasing evidence in the scientific literature of the value of this almost pure form of CBD, there are calls for other as yet unproven forms to be made not only legal but also available for medicinal use.  These forms have various levels of THC that adherents claim will improve its antiepileptic effect.  The evidence for this is based on anecdotal reports of benefit in some children.  While there may be reasons to be optimistic that such claims may have validity, there are as yet no controlled or uncontrolled trials being run to endorse such a position.  Furthermore, recreational forms of cannabis with high levels of THC have been associated with psychosis in susceptible populations.  Extreme caution, and significant evidence, will be required in determining the safe level of this drug to give to sick children.<\/p><p> Let me address issues concerning the availability of CBD in Ireland.  Under Irish law, cannabis is not recognised as having any medical benefits.  The most recent Misuse of Drugs (Designation) Order lists cannabis, cannabis resin and its derivatives as Schedule 1 drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Acts of 1977 to 2016.  As a consequence, the manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession of cannabis are unlawful for any purpose, except under license from the Minister of Health for the purposes of research.  The availability of various formulations for use in cancer, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy has led to calls for a liberalisation of the law in regard to medicinal use.  In the past few years, a form of medicinal cannabis called Sativex has been specially licensed in Ireland for use to reduce spasticity and pain in multiple sclerosis but this has not been reimbursed by Government payment schemes, which may explain its slow uptake.  The main form of cannabis that appears to work for epilepsy - high CBD, low THC - can be considered an unscheduled drug only if the THC level is no more than \"trace\".  Nevertheless, a number of forms of high CBD, low THC oils can be purchased in retail stores in Ireland and imported online.  However, since the drug is not regulated or designated as a medicinal product it cannot yet be prescribed by Irish physicians.  <\/p><p> The use of cannabis to treat epilepsy offers a tantalising new horizon for severe disabling seizures.  There is an urgency created by the community of families with severe epilepsy to complete a proper, sober and reflective scientific evaluation of the efficacy and safety of this drug.  Initial studies are encouraging but not definitive.  Already, it is possible to state with confidence that this drug will not work for everyone and will cause intolerable, but probably not dangerous, side effects in a few.  For those for whom it would work, however, it may be life-saving.  Despite the short timescale for these hearings, I have already consulted widely with Irish and UK colleagues and international researchers, including one of the lead researchers in the US studies quoted.  As of the last count, only ten countries in the world have legalised cannabis for medicinal use and only one that I know of, Australia, has a proper national framework for medicinal prescribing for children with epilepsy.<\/p><p> In conjunction with those behind the national epilepsy programme and the Irish section of the International League Against Epilepsy, whose president is Professor Norman Delanty of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and with representatives from the pharmacology and therapeutics committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, we propose to work with the Health Products Regulatory Authority to determine whether such a framework for limited prescribing of pure CBD oil is possible based on the current level of evidence, with particular focus on the safety for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016112400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colin Doherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":3037,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Doherty.

I did not come as prepared as my colleagues.  I was going to print out a little photograph to show the members my daughter Ava.  I brought a number of pictures of her on my iPad, one of which shows her after she had a seizure.  Perhaps the members would like to pass it around.  Ava has Dravet syndrome and is six years old.  Dravet syndrome is an intractable form of epilepsy.  Ava can suffer from anything up to 50 seizures per day.  She was diagnosed when she was four months of age.  We took her to Macroom to get her vaccinated at 11 o'clock in the morning and then brought her home.  By 8 p.m. that evening, she had her first 45-minute seizure.  We took her to hospital by ambulance and we were obviously terribly frightened.  When we got in, a considerable number of blood tests and other tests were carried out.  Ava's bloods were sent to Glasgow for tests.  After a number of weeks, the results came back and we were given the diagnosis of Dravet syndrome.  It is an intractable form of epilepsy that causes multiple seizures of all types, including absences, drop seizures and tonic-clonic seizures, which are the ones where the individual falls to the ground and shakes.<\/p> <p>  The photograph I have circulated shows Ava after having had approximately a dozen seizures.  One can see quite vividly that she is in a considerable amount of pain.  It is very frightening.  When she has that many seizures, we do not know what the outcome could be.  She could come out of a seizure with a dramatic loss of skills.  That has happened before.  When she was about two years of age, she had five seizures, after which she lost the ability to walk.  It originally took us two years to get her up on her feet and walking but after having those seizures together, it took us another year to get her back on her feet again.  She did it, however.<\/p><p>I would like to show the committee a picture of my daughter at her best.  It is a lot nicer.  That is how she is.  That is how we love to think of her when she is having seizures.  I will explain what has happened during her treatment.  She has gone through 11 different forms of medication.  She began on phenobarbital and she has since gone though Frisium, Topamax, Epilim, stiripentol and many other medications.  All of them were unsuccessful in treating her seizures.  Some of them were successful for a short period, but the nature of Dravet syndrome is that it breaks through the medication - it makes its way around and the seizures begin again.<\/p><p> We were told 13 months ago that we had come to the conclusion of all the medications that were available to treat Ava's seizures.  We were told there was nothing left for her to try other than the ketogenic diet, which is a regulated diet for children with epilepsy that can result in weight loss for some.  It is quite severe.  Members might be more familiar with it if I were to describe it as something close to a modified Atkins diet.  I have been doing a considerable amount of research into medicinal cannabis.  Many families in the US have moved to states where medicinal cannabis is available.  We did not have access to that here last July, when it became known to me that the Charlotte's Web product, which has been mentioned by Dr. Doherty, was available in England.  We were not comfortable with ordering Charlotte's Web online because we did not know exactly where it came from or anything like that.  We were told in September that it was available in Dublin, so we decided to travel there.  Fortunately for us, we met Joel Stanley, who is one of the producers of Charlotte's Web and is a very nice and ordinary person.  He was very willing to talk.  After discussing Ava's situation with him, we decided to purchase the Charlotte's Web product.  Although we had done a great deal of research, it was very frightening to have this product in my hand.  I was very concerned because I wanted to do the best thing for my daughter.<\/p><p> At the end of September, Ava had 23 tonic-clonic seizures in 36 hours.  That was the worst bunch of seizures she had had for some time.  Things were going in a bad direction for Ava, so we decided to begin to administer Charlotte's Web and see what would happen.  After we started the Charlotte's Web treatment, Ava had seven seizures between 2 October and 31 October.  I believe that was a reduction of between 80% and 90%.  In previous months, Ava could have had seven seizures in two hours.  It varied every day.  We would not know what to expect from Monday to Tuesday.  She might have ten seizures on Monday and two seizures on Tuesday.  We experienced just seven seizures last month.  This improvement was accompanied by an awakening of the child whom I knew was there the whole time.  When Ava was diagnosed, we were told she would never walk or talk and would be in a wheelchair.  These were presented as facts in Ava's future.  Ava runs rather than walks when she goes to school and she likes to climb.  We have to accept that she is not like every other child, but we can see how much she has achieved.  Since we have been giving her the CBD oil, there has been an improvement in her awareness.  She is now able to do something as simple as getting her shoes.  When I ask her to get her shoes, there is a delay but she goes to pick them up.  When I ask her to close the door, there is a pause but she does it.  She has had little achievements like that.  It has been noticed in school that she is more engaged with her peers and other students.  She is better able to concentrate on school activities.  Ava has improved dramatically on a broad scale, solely as a result of the use of Charlotte's Web.<\/p><p> While this product is completely legal, it is just one component of the marijuana or cannabis plant.  We are anxious to get an opportunity to get the help of the doctors.  We want the very best for Ava.  I have seen in my own home that this is working.  I can see that my daughter is standing up straighter.  I think it is because she is in less pain.  Ava is not non-verbal, but she has very few words.  Her speech has been improving since we started to give her this oil.  There is more chat and little sentences coming out of her.  She is improving.  This improvement could be enhanced dramatically if we had access to THC.  Overall, we would prefer to be in a position where a doctor could prescribe this product for Ava.  That would enable doctors to work with us, rather than being in a sort of grey area.  We do not feel we can really talk to our doctor.  I cannot say how our doctor feels, but I am sure that if doctors were allowed to prescribe this treatment, they would be able to play a bigger part in Ava's treatment and to help us more.  That is what we would like to achieve.  We hope the Government will come forward and help us with this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016112400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Vera Twomey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":3040,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Twomey for her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016112400002#F00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":3041,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Connell and I are going to the D&aacute;il Chamber to help to make up a quorum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016112400002#F00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":3042,"content":"<p>We will be back in 15 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016112400002#F00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":3043,"content":"<p>I invite the members of the committee to make contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016112400002#F00500","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":3044,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Twomey and the other witnesses.  In the broader context, there is an ongoing debate within the regulatory authority, in society and among clinicians and physicians about the benefits that may arise from the use of cannabinoids to treat epilepsy and other ailments.  A Bill relating to this issue will be debated in the D&aacute;il next week.  Perhaps that will open up a wider debate in society.  I find that when cannabis is mentioned, certain people almost immediately express the view that it is a harmful substance that creates huge difficulties in society.  On several occasions during debates with people, I experienced a certain mindset revealing itself when the word \"cannabis\" was used.  Clinicians and regulators might have some knowledge in this area, but how much research is available out there for lay people, politicians and legislators to assess when they are making determinations on the use of these products?  I know there can be a lot of division within clinical views, particularly in Ireland.

I do not think I would characterise the debate in clinical circles as one of division.  There is not a great deal of knowledge.  The average clinician would not be aware of it, because of the way that cannabis treatments have arisen and come through families of carers.  That is a little unusual.  Let me give an example.  A new drug Fycompa has been licensed recently for epilepsy treatment and is being rolled out in various clinics for patients with epilepsy.  Fycompa came through the usual scientific circles.  It was an investigational product at the level of small scientific laboratories and it was taken up by a drug company which developed it as a product.  The drug went through clinical trials.<\/p> <p>  Patients do not come into the office looking for Fycompa.  They ask the doctor about new medicines to treat the condition.  It is important to know that while Dravet syndrome, which is the form that Vera's daughter has, is at the top of the pile, we still have 15,000 from the 40,000 people with epilepsy who have not got full control of their epilepsy.  About one third of patients do not have full control and a smaller number - several thousand - have very severe epilepsy.  We are dealing with patients who ask their doctors if they have anything else to treat their condition.  Many have reached the end of the line, just like Vera's daughter has.  They have tried everything from ten to 12 different drugs and are not looking for Fycompa.  The clinician will go through the data on various drugs and may recommend the patient to try out the drug, having informed the patient of the known side effects, and introduce it slowly.<\/p> <p>  The cannabinoid drugs have come by a completely different route.  Patients are coming into the doctor's surgery, telling him or her that they have researched this drug and they want to know why they cannot have it prescribed for them.  It has come to the fore in an unusual way.  Patients are walking into doctor's offices and they have more information on the drug than the doctor.  That is the simple fact, as Ms Twomey can confirm.<\/p> <p>  Allowing for the fact there are a small number of highly specialised people in the epilepsy field who know the drug, I would not characterise their feelings about it as one of division.  It is simply a question of evidence.  It is very important to distinguish between evidence in the generic colloquial term, where there is evidence that something works for this child or that child, and what we call scientific evidence.  Scientific evidence should not be open to interpretation.  We have established in the western canon of scientific thought that one arrives at scientific evidence by conducting an experiment.  Typically in the experiment, one gives the drug to one group of patients and the other group with the same condition get a placebo.  We follow the two groups of patients.  The groups have to be large enough to be able to draw conclusions.  One cannot just give the drug to two people, with two others getting the placebo.  In an experiment, there are several hundred people in each wing and at the end of a period, usually 12 to 24 weeks, one establishes whether the drug has worked or not.  That is scientific evidence.  What we need to have is clear scientific evidence that the drug works.<\/p> <p>  What we know at this time about cannabis is that there is a purified form of CBD oil made by a small pharmaceutical company called GW Pharmaceuticals.  This CBD oil is not a scheduled drug in this country, and although it has passed several layers of evidence, it has not quite reached the level that most doctors would be happy to prescribe it.  Once the two placebo controlled trials are published, which will be any time in the next three to four months and if the company then submits the drug for regulatory approval, that is usually the point at which people will say they are happy to prescribe.<\/p> <p>  There is no division, but caution.  The medical profession needs to say that they need to wait until it reaches such a level, a mark on the wall of significance.  I would separate this out from personal use.  I have no problem with people making a personal decision to use a drug and feel that using a drug with varying levels of THC is a decision they have made for themselves or for a family member.  That is a question for society.<\/p> <p>  There is a solemn duty on a doctor when prescribing a medicine to ensure that drug is safe and effective.  It is a very solemn duty and it cannot be gainsaid by anybody suggesting that the medical profession is naturally conservative.  It is naturally conservative but for the right reasons.  If we end up giving all various forms of this drug to children and find out in a year's time that it has created some very difficult behavioural or other problem in the children, that reflects on the doctor.  It is very important we separate out those two phenomena - somebody making a personal decision of how much they want to give themselves or a child versus what we are asking the medical profession to do.  It is not a matter of persuading one or two doctors.  We have to bring the whole profession with us.  As Ms Twomey said, the doctor-patient relationship is extremely important.  Nobody wins if anything is pushed through and people are being asked to prescribe something they are not comfortable with.  There is much more to the treatment, as Ms Twomey will know, than giving a drug.  There are support services, rehabilitation, diet and there is a significant amount going on.  If we rupture that relationship by forcing a doctor to prescribe something that he or she is not quite comfortable with, people will leave their doctor to go to other doctors who may not have the same level of expertise.<\/p> <p>  I am very excited about this form of treatment and I think we can use the evidence that exists and in a reasonably short space of time we will come up with the framework and we can all get behind it.  If there is a rupture, it will be around forcing people to prescribe something where the scientific evidence does not exist.  I am not saying there is no evidence.  I am saying the scientific evidence does not exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016112400002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colin Doherty"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":3049,"content":"<p>When Dr. Doherty speaks about scientific evidence, is saying that scientific evidence does not exist that the drug works.

If something happens in only one in 5,000 children, one will not see that in the original trials.  There are a number of examples going back in history, for example, the drug Vigabatrin, which is still used today, was released in 1991 to great acclaim.  It was thought it would be a great addition to the treatment of epilepsy.  By 1996, it was clear that it was causing blindness in a small number of people.  That drug was banned initially, but now it has been reintroduced in very limited circumstances.

That child was getting over 300 seizures a day and after the Stanley brothers produced the oil for Charlotte her seizure count went down to three or four a month.  Now that little girl is nine years old and she is doing very well.  She is doing regular things like riding her bike and playing games.<\/p> <p>  In some respects there is an absence of reports but there are good reports, including one done by Professor Mike Barnes which is a very important document to read and take notice of because he covers not only epilepsy and the Dravet syndrome but multiple sclerosis, cancer and many other ailments that are helped by CBD in combination with THC.  There are reports from Israel as well that are very promising and that information is available.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher asked who mentioned the different products to us.  We did have a conversation with a consultant about a company called Bedrocan in Holland and that is one avenue that seems promising.  The company is well researched and its products are made according to manufacturing guidelines.  I suppose the evidence is limited.  When we went down the CBD route a lot of our research was coming from families but they were families like us that were struggling and that had gone through 11 and 12 different medications and were left with no alternative.  We went down the CBD route because as Dr. Doherty said, from the time Ava was four months old we were told that she could pass away from her seizures at any time.  She could go into a seizure that could last 30 minutes or two or three hours.  One never knows.  She might not come out of a seizure and she would be gone from us.  When one is put in that situation, in spite of the fact that there might not be a vast amount of information there, when one speaks to families, and when one looks into the issue and does careful research, although the evidence was anecdotal we took it very seriously.  The other families were in the same position as we were.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to medication and the side effects of CBD.  At present, what I have noticed in terms of side effects with Ava on CBD is an increased appetite, which we could badly do with so that she could put on a little bit of weight, better sleep, and a better stance and gait.  She has more words coming and she is doing better at school.  I genuinely cannot point to a negative.  If there was I would tell the committee but from what we have seen there is not.  We cannot say in the long term how things will be, but the risk for our daughter who had over 20 seizures in a 24-hour period is so serious that it is a real balancing act.  Trying CBD for Ava has been the best thing we have done so far for her.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Smith asked about the side effects of other medications.  We have been on 11 different medications.  I wrote down the names earlier.  Frisium was one of the medications we were on and it caused problems with Ava's balance.  She was on another drug, Rivatril, which is a benzodiazepine.  It is a little like a sleeping tablet so one can get quite addicted to that.  Ava was on Rivatril previously and came off it.  It took over 12 months for us to wean her off it because it is so potent one has to reduce it by the tiniest degree, three or four weeks at a time.  It takes a long time to come down off it the drug is so addictive.<\/p> <p>  Topamax is another drug which caused significant speech delay for Ava.  We were working really hard to help her with her speech and while the Topamax was helping at the time to control her seizures we did not realise until afterwards that it was affecting her speech.  The efforts we were making were being hampered by the medication she was on to stop her seizures.<\/p> <p>  Keppra is another medication that Ava is on at the moment.  Fortunately for us she is not on a huge dose of Keppra but patients that are on a high dose sometimes encounter an effect known as \"Keppra rage\" where people get very upset, emotional and angry.  It is hard to calm such a person down and that is proven to be associated with Keppra.  Thankfully, we have not experienced that ourselves but Ava was on another drug which was brought in for her from England when she was about two and a half called Stiripentol.  That has been shown to be of significant benefit to a lot of people with Dravet syndrome.<\/p><p>Unfortunately for us, however, Ava was in a coma for a week having been on the medication and subsequently lost the ability to walk when she was approximately two and a half years of age.  There are drugs that are available but which have had a very negative effect on us.<\/p><p> As Dr. Doherty mentioned, we are always watching.  Even though things are now going well, it is difficult to relax and get used to Ava not having seizures.  That is very new for us in the past six weeks or so.  She has to be monitored all the time and we have to take great care because there is a serious risk that she will pass away from a seizure.  I cannot recall the exact date, but she had a bad seizure at or about the beginning of November and I believe firmly we could have been in serious trouble.  The seizure was violent and its power rose her high off the bed.  It took her and she lay down; it took her again and she fell.  Anyone who has seen an epileptic seizure will understand what I am saying.  Had we not had the break in October, when she had just seven seizures, we would have been in real danger of losing our daughter.  The cannabidiol, CBD, helped her to fight off the seizure she had at the beginning of November and she is still with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016112400002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Vera Twomey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":3069,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Twomey.

Deputy Kelleher spoke of the mindset towards cannabis, which comes from its history and the fact that it has always been viewed by regulators as a substance of abuse.  There are, however, authorised medicines which contain cannabis such as Sativex and a range of synthetic cannabinoid products.  This shows the flexibilities among regulators who recognise that they have therapeutic value and that, once there is sufficient scientific evidence, a product can be authorised as a medicine and viewed as part of conventional therapy.  Dr. Doherty said the issue was one of evidence and it is a lack of evidence, rather than division, which is the underlying factor.  We echo that and while we recognise that there is emerging evidence from research on a range of cannabis-type products many reviews, such as the Barnes report and the Cochrane reviews, cite the limitations within that emerging evidence.  The Barnes report, which is cautious and balanced, puts forward strong evidence in favour of the use of cannabis for neuropathic pain, spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and nausea control but found that, in other cases, the evidence was moderate or poor.  It also cites limitations in the studies which have been conducted in that they involved small numbers of patients, were not peer reviewed and included controlled populations.  We are getting there but we are not there yet in terms of having the evidence to authorise them as medicines.<\/p> <p>  Other jurisdictions have introduced frameworks to allow access to cannabis for medicinal purposes, but all of these have been demand led and are part of drugs legislation in those countries.  Access has been allowed by a relaxation of drug laws so they sit outside what is considered conventional medicine.  The focus is on ensuring a controlled supply source that is regulated, particularly in the case of cannabis material, the purity and content of whose cannabinoid components can be controlled.  In this way the chemical content, such as the amount of THC and CBD, is known and standardised.  The focus has not been on a level of quality control which one would accept from a conventional medicine, though elements of quality control have been put into the system to give reassurance on the quality of the dried cannabis.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Smith said that side effects were associated with conventional medicines, such as those used to treat epilepsy, and that is a fact but an authorised medicine has been through a rigorous scientific evaluation.  All medicines carry risks and all medicines can have side effects.  Our job in assessing medicines is to monitor those risks, weigh them against the benefits and ensure the profile is positive in favour of the benefit.  The side effects of an authorised medicine are identified during its development.  The risks are known and medicines are sold in the market with patient information leaflets showing a product's characteristics.  They always list the side effects and say what the expected risks are.  Once a medicine is authorised it is subject to a rigorous process whereby the experience of patients is monitored, and things which may not have been anticipated are reported to competent authorities, properly investigated and addressed by regulators.  It may be that extra controls are applied or the supply restricted when they are not suitable for full populations.  A rigorous system is in place for conventional medicines and they have a full benefit-risk assessment.  The risks associated with their use are known and anticipated.  We equip our health care professionals to monitor them and, where side effects or new signals arise, they can be reported to an authority and be appropriately investigated.<\/p> <p>  A point was made about the importance of the best interests of patients and nobody in this room would disagree that the best treatment option for a patient is an authorised medicine.  In the absence of the availability of an authorised medicine, or one authorised in another jurisdiction and on which an assessment has been carried out by a regulatory authority, the next best option is access through a clinical trial.  There is an appropriate level of regulatory oversight of these mechanisms but there is a limit to the number of cannabis products which are available to meet these needs.  They are investigational products although some, as Dr. Doherty pointed out in the case of Epidiolex, are more advanced and there is more evidence with which to work.<\/p> <p>  In its review of this area the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, will weigh up all these factors.  It will take into account emerging evidence in a balanced and impartial way which takes into account the risks associated with using cannabis, which is typically used as an adjunct supportive treatment in an established ongoing therapeutic programme for a patient.  The review will assess how it can be used and what harms are associated with cannabis.  The information we have on the harms comes from illicit use and there are strong links between prolonged and excessive use of cannabis and psychosis and schizophrenia.  These things are more prevalent in those who start to use cannabis illicitly at an early age and in people with a susceptibility to mental illness.  There have been very limited studies which have monitored the side effects of the medicinal use of cannabis.

The Barnes report, which Dr. Nolan is familiar with, was conclusive on the benefits of medicinal cannabis.<\/p> <p>  I had very little knowledge of medical cannabis until eight months ago when I met a family from Clondalkin whose daughter had Dravet syndrome.  I met Ms Twomey four or five months ago in Leinster House.  The more that I find out about this plant and medicine, the more I am fascinated by its medicinal benefits.  In the past five or six months, I have been astounded by the number of people who use cannabis for medicinal purposes.  Shockingly, they are criminalised in some ways.  They are not the usual suspects.  They are ordinary citizens in very difficult circumstances for whom traditional medicine has not worked.  Medical cannabis has worked.  They should not be stigmatised or criminalised.  I hope that the Bill I am proposing next week will open up the debate on medical cannabis.  The movement for medical cannabis is unstoppable.  Consider what has happened across Europe and the US.  It will happen in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  There are many people in Ms Twomey's situation, in that they are almost drug resistant.  I do not know about Ms Twomey, but in the case of the Clondalkin family, some of the drugs that the child has taken for Dravet syndrome are toxic.  CBD oil has a major future.<\/p> <p>  Will Dr. Nolan explain the review and does it have a timeframe?

He has also asked us to review the status of ongoing clinical research involving cannabis and associated products.  He has asked us to review the international experience of the medicinal use of cannabis.  On the basis of these factors, he has asked us for our opinion on its use and, depending on whether we view it positively or negatively, our policy advice.  These are the terms of reference that we have been given.<\/p> <p>  The HPRA has expertise in the authorisation of medicines.  There are medicines containing cannabis.  From that perspective, we have the experience to know what we are looking for.  We also have a section that deals directly with the licensing of controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  I have worked in the area of controlled drugs since 2001.  As an organisation, we have considerable expertise on this subject.  We have many toxicologists, clinicians and specialists in the quality of medicines.<\/p> <p>  As an organisation, we do not provide health care.  We are not engaged in clinical practice.  Our role is the authorisation of products.  It is from those on the front line in the treatment of patients with these conditions that we need to understand where this sits.  For that reason, we have decided to convene a group to assist us.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right, in that patients and the demand that exists need to be heard.  Theirs is an important voice in this programme.  The changes brought about in other countries have been based on demand.  The scientific evidence is where it is and more information will continue to come through, but we need to examine it collectively and properly.  A review is necessary because it is the best way for us to protect patients' safety.<\/p> <p>  The timeline set by the Minister is tight.  We have been given until the end of January.  Regarding other countries that have examined this issue, the Barnes report took three months to produce.  We are conscious of the timeline and the immediacy of the situation and we are committed to working through this as efficiently as possible.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the committee's composition, we have identified the clinical specialists that we would like to have on it.  We have secured the participation of two consultant neurologists, one of whom specialises in childhood epilepsy.  We have secured the participation of a palliative care specialist, a pain control specialist and a pharmacist with an extensive background in cannabinoid research, particularly the pharmacology of cannabinoids.  We have also secured the participation of a pharmacist who specialises in palliative care and the possible compounding elements of medicine.  We also want to involve patients.  We are looking into the best way of achieving that.  We undertake patient engagement as part of our role and we normally work through the patient associations relating to the major therapeutic areas for which cannabinoids are being investigated.  We will look to those associations to assist us with this.<\/p> <p>  We must be realistic about the group's composition.  If it grows too large, it becomes inefficient and unworkable.  We need to control the number of participants so that it can work effectively, but the group will involve a large consultation process.  We are trying to achieve a mechanism for including as broad a range of expertise as we can to inform us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016112400002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorraine Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":3081,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Nolan.

It has been enlightening to hear of the first-hand experiences of patients and those who are directly involved in addressing the issues presented by same.  Like everyone else present, I have seen epileptic seizures in children that were so severe as to be distressing, not only to their parents, but to people who were not accustomed to such situations.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is anxious to bring this matter to a conclusion and to achieve the best outcome as quickly as possible, but I accept that we should take safety precautions.  If we do not, we will knock the process back and the benefits might not quickly accrue to those whom we have in mind.  A long time ago, a treatment was authorised and prescribed for hepatitis C.  It both worked and did not work.<\/p> <p>  For some patients, the results have been dramatic.  Compared with having no control over a child's situation, a parent or relative will be heavily on the side of trying to avail of the best possible treatment.  I am disposed towards this approach, provided that adequate safety precautions are taken and we do not rush the fences by cutting corners and saying that, since everyone else is taking it, it must be good and we will all have a bit of it.  We cannot do that when patients' lives are at stake.  Consider the health of the nation.<\/p><p>We have had the debate about the various vaccines prior to this and some patients react in a totally different way to others.  The question then arises as to whether we have taken the right decision.  We have had this conversation before.  I was involved in this back in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, unfortunately.  When one has seen some of the things that can happen, one begins to become a little bit cautious, notwithstanding the beneficial elements of it.

Even when the Minister takes the advice at the end of January, there will still be a considerable period in which the development of the new legal framework will be progressed.  Dr. Nolan also stated it may be possible to start administering medicinal cannabis to meet specific needs within the existing framework.  While I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the review, if it is the case that a recommendation is made or policy advice is given to explore this, we must be clear that there is nothing to stop it.  It cannot then be put on the long finger; we cannot wait on the Minister to state we need new legislation or a new legal framework.

I thank especially Ms Vera Twomey for her attendance.  I cannot even imagine what it is like to deal with that number of seizures in a day.  I have a family member with epilepsy and have only seen a couple of seizures.  It is not an overly pleasant experience and it must be very difficult for her.<\/p> <p>  I am very heartened by the considered approach of the HPRA to this issue.  As a community pharmacist by profession, I would almost say that all drugs are bad, in the sense that all drugs have side-effects and that a patient should never take something unless it is absolutely necessary.  In light of previous failings of regulation with regard to Thalidomide and the incomplete trials and data of the past, I note that in the case of CBDB, an extremely complex and multi-targeted drug, it is very difficult to quantify potential side-effects when one cannot track exactly the effect of a drug or the response that it elicits within the system.  I also make note of the statements regarding already-licensed drugs such as Keppra, Frisium, Rivotril and such products.  As this meeting is in public session, it is important to note that children and families are using those medications at this time.  I have a duty to state I would not like to see anybody taking those drugs away from their children because of the risk involved.  I wish to say that in public session.<\/p> <p>  I assume that Dr. Doherty thinks that a consultant or medical professional would need to be involved in the titrating up of a dose of cannabis oil or products containing CBG or THC.  A medical person should be involved in the titrating up of those drugs and perhaps in the reduction in dosages of other drugs in order that seizure thresholds are not reduced.  As a medical person, I would strongly advocate that a medical professional prescriber be involved in all treatment programmes for people.<\/p> <p>  Following on from Deputy O'Brien's statement about the illicit use and medicinal use of cannabis, it is worth noting that diamorphine, which is heroin, is used in operating theatres all of the time.  It comes in a completely different form than the block one sees on the telly when there has been a drugs seizure.  When we talk about medicinal cannabis, it is very important to point out that it is a medicinal product in an oil form.  It is not a case of doctors writing prescriptions and pharmacists shovelling grass into bags and sending them off with labels on them.  It is a completely different concept and it is worth saying that in order that the argument is not put forward that we are legalising cannabis for people to use on the street, at home or wherever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016112400002#N00500","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1479978000,"counter":3088,"content":"<p>I wish to bring to the attention of members that a vote has been called in the D&aacute;il.

I believe we need to ensure this a health-led debate about the medicinal use of cannabis from a medical viewpoint and a treatment viewpoint.  The recreational use of cannabis is not part of this.<\/p><p>As I understand it, recreational use might be examined by the national drugs strategy next year as well.<\/p><p> I refer to the point Deputy Gino Kenny made on the cannabis Bill.  Some provisions in the Bill would remove cannabis and the THC cannabinoids from the misuse of drugs framework, which would have the effect of legalising them from that point of view.  The proposals in the Bill are not fitting for something that is really a legislative proposal for medicinal use.  I should make that point.<\/p><p> I am heartened by the point Deputy Durkan raised about patient safety, which was echoed by Deputy O'Connell.  Our role is to protect patient safety.  That is the reason for our existence.  That is the reason we are taking an approach that is robust and involves sufficient expert consultation to ensure that if we make a decision to introduce this, based on evidence of patient benefit, it is done safely.  We must remember the way this would be used.  It is a supportive treatment so if we make that decision, and we cannot pre-empt the outcome of the review, many patients would remain on their conventional therapy, so even the safety issue becomes complex.  We must consider how this material, containing in excess of 100 active components, may interact with other medications as well.  Those are the types of issues involved, so it is important we give this time and carry out a thorough review.<\/p><p> Deputy Jonathan O'Brien asked what format our advice to the Minister would take.

We acknowledge that, and we raised that point in the statement for that reason.  It is an important issue.  We have had this debate for a long time and the needs of many patients in the State have to be examined within this, so it must be done correctly.  The Deputy referred to the point that I emphasised in the opening statement.  There is provision within the existing framework which would allow a doctor to prescribe.  To my knowledge it has only been used once previously, in the context of a clinical trial authorisation.  To look at that previous precedent, it was in a circumstance where the patients were under the supervision of a specialist and the specialist was monitoring those patients and could follow up on their care.  Certainly, there is provision there which can be looked at and, as part of the review and the work of the expert group, it would make sense to include that provision and examine it in the context of whether it could be used.

There could be a scenario where there is a recommendation that we should pursue a new legal policy or framework to provide medicinal cannabis in the future without the clinical reviews being published.  Would the witnesses see that as a barrier to any recommendations they might be examining or would they be of the same opinion as Dr. Doherty?

To take a step back before answering it specifically, the only important thing from my point of view is to make sure we bring the medical profession along with whatever we decide.  For the reasons I articulated earlier, and I know from my conversations with Vera Twomey that she would agree, we must have a solid doctor-patient relationship as we move forward on this.  If that breaks down, people will be out on their own looking for other doctors, who perhaps do not have the same expertise, and asking them to prescribe a medicine.  There are a relatively small number of specialists in this country who can justifiably call themselves experts in these difficult forms of epilepsy.  It is a handful of fewer than ten or 12 specialists.  These people must be brought along.  For good or ill, that is what it means to be in Ireland because it is a relatively small community.<\/p> <p>  The question of whether they will be satisfied that there will be an interregnum before the publication of the data in a peer-reviewed journal will be an interesting one.  My sense of it is that we can still come up with a framework where people balance the severity of some forms of epilepsy - to be blunt about it, the risk of death - versus the wait for that pinnacle of evidence.  They are human beings like everybody else.  They will say that perhaps we can consider this in a limited way for these most difficult forms until the evidence goes through.  If there was support across all the regulatory groups and all the experts agree, my sense of it is, and I will not state it definitively, that we could probably come up with some way of administering or prescribing the drug before the definitive evidence is across the line.  It is not an issue of conflict, but there will be strong voices on both sides of that argument.

If I can return to the point about the provision that can be used, it is a licensing provision which the Minister can use at his discretion and ultimately it is up to the Minister to decide whether it should be used.  I can give a legalistic explanation of it.  It is an exemption from prohibition.  By virtue of it being an exemption from a prohibition, it is always unique to the individual circumstances of a particular case.  That brings me back to what Dr. Colin Doherty said.  It might be for some patients given the immediacy and urgency of their needs and lack of alternatives.  All the evidence is taken together to make a decision collectively and it may be that in those instances a clinician, and I cannot speak for clinicians, may make the decision that in his or her opinion and judgment, he or she wishes to try this.<\/p> <p>  The other point is that the review must look at the range of products that exist.  Different levels of evidence are being gathered for each.  Dr. Colin Doherty spoke about Epidiolex.  That is more advanced than others.  When one looks at the weight of evidence that exists for some products, it might be the case that the outcome of this review would be that we can make a decision on certain products and on certain indications.

Within the structures of what we are reviewing here, we will have no capability of jurisdiction for stating that this drug should be made available under the long-term illness scheme, which is the main reimbursement scheme for anti-epileptic drugs.  People also get it on the medical card, but as there is a charge per medication there, most people choose to get their medicines under the long-term illness scheme.  Getting a drug designated for treatment on the LTI scheme is completely separate and is just not covered by this review.  We could recommend it, but it would not necessarily move the situation along.<\/p> <p>  Cost will be a big issue in this.

I thank the Chairman for allowing me to make some introductory remarks to outline the legislative proposal for the members of the committee.<\/p><p>The Bill is entitled an Act to amend the Irish Medicines Board Act 1995, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 and the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015; and to provide for related matters.  It has four main purposes: to amend the 1995 Act to allow for the payment of fees to members of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, formerly the Irish Medicines Board, as such fees are payable to the members of other boards; to amend the 2009 Act in order to exclude certain <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments that have been or will in future be made to individuals under specific schemes approved by Government for the purpose of assessment of means under that Act; and to amend the 2013 Act so that over-the-counter medicinal products, including emergency contraception and nicotine replacement products, can continue to be reimbursed to medical card holders after June 2018.  Otherwise, medical card patients will have no way to access such products without charge other than the prescription charge.<\/p><p>The Bill's purpose is also to amend sections 2, 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 of the 2015 Act to provide by way of regulation for a number of elements relating to the appearance of tobacco packaging.  The regulation of the appearance of the packaging is intended to contribute to improving public health by reducing the appeal of tobacco products to consumers; increasing the effectiveness of health warnings on the retail packaging of tobacco products; and reducing the ability of the packaging of tobacco products to mislead consumers about the harmful effects of smoking.  The Bill's amendments to the 2015 Act set out further provisions relating to retail packaging of tobacco products, some of which are of a technical and practical nature and some of which seek to provide basic information to the consumer.<\/p><p>The Bill has five Parts and 16 sections.  Part 1 sets out the Title of the Bill and all Parts will be commenced on enactment.  Part 2 amends the 1995 Act to allow for the payment of fees to members of the HPRA.  Under section 8(7) of the 1995 Act, as amended, only the chairman of the authority is entitled to a fee.  There is an onerous responsibility and a significant time commitment placed on members of the authority and we wish to attract the highest calibre of people to apply to be members of such boards.  Some people may be self-employed and, without the modest fee that will be paid under this amendment, it would be difficult for them to give the time commitment involved.  There is no additional cost to the Exchequer relating to paying board members of the authority, as it is mainly self-funding.  The fee approved for payment to each board member, in keeping with the guidelines issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is &euro;7,695 per annum.  The additional cost to the authority will be up to approximately &euro;61,560 per annum.  However, some members may choose to waive their fees and the one person one salary policy will also apply to members who are in receipt of a salary from the public service.<\/p><p>Part 3 aims to amend the 2009 Act in order to exclude certain <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments that have been or will in future be made to individuals under specific schemes approved by Government for the purpose of assessment of means under the Act, also known as the fair deal scheme.  A number of groups within the State have been in receipt of, or will receive, <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments as a result of Government decisions that acknowledge the hardship, pain and suffering that these individuals underwent.  The schemes being covered in this legislation are the Lourdes Hospital Redress Board, involving 119 women; the Lourdes Hospital payment scheme, which compensated women who were excluded from the redress board on age grounds alone, which relates to 47 women; the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme, which has made awards to approximately 400 women; and payments made either by the Government or the German Contergan Foundation to 32 Irish survivors of thalidomide.  The Bill will also amend section 36 of the 2009 Act, giving regulation-making power to the Minister to allow for an exemption for other similar groups that may receive <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments from being taken into consideration for support under the nursing homes support scheme, provided such schemes have been approved by the Government.  This is the way that such exemptions under various social welfare schemes are managed by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>The key principle underlying this legislation is that a person should not be disadvantaged because of acceptance of a payment under an <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme that has been approved by the Government.  Applications under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 are means tested and the individuals or their partners could be over the income threshold for availing of Nursing Homes Support Scheme supports due to receipt of their <i>ex gratia<\/i>awards.  The proposal will not give access to free nursing home care to the various groups.  Rather, the awards or payments that they receive under Government-approved <i>ex gratia<\/i>schemes will be excluded from the financial assessment for supports under the fair deal.<\/p><p>Part 4 of the Bill amends the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, Part 1 of Schedule 3.  This amendment is required to ensure that over-the-counter products that do not require a prescription can continue to be available under the general medical services, GMS, and community drug schemes if so required.  This will ensure that over-the-counter medicinal products, including emergency contraception and nicotine replacement products, can continue to be reimbursed to medical card holders after June 2018.  The amendment will allow the HSE to disapply the criterion regarding prescription-only medicines when considered appropriate in the interests of patient safety or public health.<\/p><p>Another amendment proposed is to paragraph 1(<i>e<\/i>) of Part 1 of Schedule 3 of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which specifies that medicinal products must have a marketing authorisation referred to in paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) of the definition of &quot;authorisation holder&quot; in section 2(1) of the Act.  The reference to paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) is unintentionally restrictive, as it excludes products that are authorised by the European Medicines Agency and parallel imports.  Parallel importation is the importation from an EU member state or a country within the EEA of a medicinal product that is essentially similar to a product already authorised in Ireland by an importer who is someone other than the importer appointed by the marketing authorisation holder of the product on the Irish market.  The parallel trade of medicinal products is based on the principle of the free movement of goods within the internal market of the EU under Articles 28 to 30, inclusive, of the EC treaty.  It was never the intention to exclude such products and any such inference would be contrary to free trade principles.<\/p><p>The Bill's explanatory memorandum noted that allowing &quot;reimbursement of certain over-the-counter medicines under the GMS and community drug schemes will give rise to some additional cost from loss of prescription charges over time, but this is not expected to be significant.&quot;  However, this is not correct.  My officials have confirmed that there are in fact no additional costs arising from the amendments proposed in Part 4.  The explanatory memorandum also notes that over-the-counter medicines will not be available for reimbursement under the schemes after June 2016.  However, the Minister for Health granted an extension of this period under section 18 of the 2013 Act until June 2018.<\/p><p>Part 5 of the Bill seeks to amend sections 2, 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015.  Section 2 of that Act sets out the definitions used in it, section 7 deals with retail packaging of cigarettes, section 9 with roll-your-own tobacco products, other tobacco products, including cigars are dealt with in section 10, presentation of tobacco products in section 13 and features of retail packaging in section 14.<\/p><p>The Act provides for a number of elements to be prescribed by the Minister, including the colour of the outer and inner surfaces of tobacco packaging, the form and manner of bar codes and the manner in which a name may be printed on tobacco products.  The amendments to the 2015 Act proposed in this Bill are to provide by way of regulation for a number of other matters relating to the appearance of tobacco packaging.  Some of these matters are of a technical and practical nature and some seek to provide basic information to the consumer.<\/p><p>These amendments will permit the following elements to be included on tobacco retail packaging: text to indicate the type and weight or number of tobacco products contained in the packet; the inclusion of a tab to allow consumers to reseal the pack, excluding cigarette packs; the inclusion of a calibration mark, which may be necessary for the automated production of the packaging; contact details of the manufacturer; and additional information on cigar bands.<\/p><p>I intend to bring forward an amendment to the Bill on Report Stage.  It relates to Part 5 and the amendment of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015 in the context of the transitional times outlined in section 6.  The reason for it relates to the lapse of a substantial period of time since the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was first initiated in the Houses.  The Bill serves to make important changes to four Acts in the interests of equity or, in some cases, patient safety.  Of course, tobacco legislation is to help to protect public health.  I hope Deputies will give their full support to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2016112400002#D00300","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479988800,"counter":3124,"content":"<p>As there is only one amendment, the issue of groupings does not arise.

The section, as I have proposed it, corrects an anomaly in existing legislation in which current rules only allow medicines that are prescription-only to be supplied under the community drug schemes.  This affects a number of products that were prescription-only but are now over-the-counter, as well as some over-the-counter items that have long been available under the schemes.<\/p> <p>  The legislation gives a temporary reprieve in supplying over-the-counter medicines until 2018.  The amendment, as I have proposed it, will make this permanent.  The effect will be that some very useful medicines such as emergency contraception and nicotine replacements will continue to be available under the drug payment scheme, the medical card scheme and other schemes.  Patients will still need a doctor's prescription to obtain an approved over-the-counter product under the various schemes.  This applies to all schemes and both over-the-counter and prescription-only items.  This is a very important control, both clinically and for the financial operation and governance of the schemes.<\/p> <p>  Specifically regarding access to emergency hormonal contraception, there are a number of issues I have considered carefully.  Medical card holders already have access to emergency contraception which is currently available free under the general medical services, GMS, scheme to medical card patients provided they obtain a prescription first.  It is also available as an over-the-counter treatment.  Therefore, anybody can go into a pharmacy and buy it without a prescription.  The most up-to-date figures show that in the 12 months to August this year, just under 13,000 emergency hormonal contraceptive prescriptions were dispensed across all schemes, of which more than 12,000 were under the medical card scheme.  The barrier, therefore, for medical card patients in obtaining emergency hormonal contraceptives as soon as possible is not access.  More than 12,000 people a year go to their doctor and then the pharmacy.  The issue arises when people need emergency hormonal contraception but cannot obtain a prescription in time to receive treatment.  It might be the weekend and they cannot get an urgent appointment or they might not be able to afford to buy it.  I share Deputy Clare Daly's concern about timely access to treatment for medical card holders and fully accept that there should not be unnecessary barriers to receiving this treatment.  However, while I agree with the principle of the Deputy's amendment, I do not propose to accept it for the following reasons.  The Minister for Health has instructed officials to remove this requirement as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>  Work on the development of services and clinical structures is under way.  A minor ailments pilot scheme was run over the summer, allowing pharmacies to treat medical card patients with over-the-counter medicines for minor conditions without a doctor's prescription.  Much of the IT infrastructure needed has been trialled under the minor ailments pilot scheme.  In line with the Minister's instructions, the HSE is developing the operational structures to implement this service safely and effectively, including the clinical standards required to ensure patient safety; procedures for identifying pharmacies in compliance with these standards as for the vaccination programmes; and the infrastructure required to provide a secure claiming and verification process.  Service development will be built on work already done, including the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland's professional practice guidelines for dispensing over-the-counter emergency hormonal contraception and existing structures for providing specific services in pharmacies such as the vaccination programme.<\/p> <p>  The amendment is not legally necessary.  There is no legal barrier to the proposal other than that being corrected in section 9.  The amendment which prescribes the supply of a single treatment in a specific manner through primary legislation raises a number of challenges, including that it could undermine the requirement placed on the HSE to provide treatment in line with patient safety and cost constraints, for example, to get the best price or refuse individual products.  Crucially, it might remove the ability of pharmacists to make clinical judgments and decisions, in particular, a decision not to supply where it may be unsafe for a patient for clinical reasons.  This is a professional clinical service set out by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland which the amendment does not reflect and which would make it unsafe.<\/p> <p>  Discussions will be required with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on implementation and officials will pursue this aspect.  The Irish Pharmaceutical Union has previously indicated a willingness to expand into this type of professional service and was involved in the minor ailments pilot scheme for over-the-counter products.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has issued professional practice guidelines on dispensing emergency hormonal contraception and advising patients.  Deputy Clare Daly and other members of the committee will appreciate that significant steps have been taken to remove barriers to timely treatment for medical card holders in the case of both emergency contraception and over-the-counter products in general.  The principle behind the amendment is worthwhile.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and Deputy Billy Kelleher for raising it in her stead.  The amendment makes a valuable contribution but is actually not necessary in addressing this health need.  In fact, it could have unintended consequences.  In addition, given the operational challenges to be addressed, it would not speed up implementation which is already under way.<\/p> <p>  There are other issues that have been raised about cases in which pharmacists would not provide treatment.  They may not have been able to provide treatment or may have had personal reasons for not wishing to do so.  The statutory code of conduct for pharmacists requires that, where they are unable to provide a service, they take reasonable action to ensure the patient's care is not jeopardised.  In practice, the patient should be referred to another pharmacist, pharmacy or health service.  All pharmacists must prescribe to this code.

Since there has been a lot of misinformation in the public commentary on the linkage between stamp duty and affordability, although not from the Deputy, there is a point worth making in this regard.<\/p><p>It must be recognised that any changes to the operation of the scheme which result in lower stamp duty on some policies do not necessarily increase affordability for individual consumers.  For example, last year, my predecessor reduced the stamp duty on non-advanced plans by &euro;38 from &euro;240 to &euro;202 and no insurer announced price reductions on such plans as a result of this measure.  While some of the insurance companies and their communications people are putting out information about this, it is important that they reflect on the reality that when my predecessor reduced the stamp duty on non-advanced plans, the benefit was not passed on to a single consumer.  That is an important point in terms of how this has been described.<\/p><p> I acknowledge what the Deputy is trying to do and he is making an important point.  I will elaborate on a few facts about how we arrive at this point annually.  Each year, the HIA holds discussions with insurers before it makes a recommendation to the Minister about the credits and stamp duty rates under the risk equalisation scheme.  In both 2016 and 2015, one of the insurers indicated a preference for switching to a percentage-based stamp duty.  This view has been taken into account by the authority but it still has not recommended changing from the current system of fixed amounts of stamp duty.  The stamp duty applied under the scheme is on a fixed amount basis for a number of reasons, which relate to both the practical administration of the scheme and the key objective of the scheme, which is to share costs in a fair way across the market to support community rating.  An important feature of our risk equalisation scheme is that the total amount collected in stamp duty from insurers equals the total amount of credits paid to them.  If the stamp duty collected was higher than the credits paid, the scheme would be inflationary for the market at least in the short term, and if the stamp duty collected was lower, temporary funding would be required from the Exchequer, which would impact on Government current expenditure.<\/p><p> The scheme is also based on fixed amounts of stamp duty with reduced rates for those with non-advanced products and for children.  Taking into account market trends each year, the HIA is able to accurately predict the total cost of credits and the stamp duty rates required to fund them.  Switching to stamp duties as a percentage of premium would pose a number of difficulties for the operation of the scheme.  Insurers regularly increase and decrease the prices of their products and, therefore, there is no price control in the market.  The health insurance Acts permit them to vary the premiums of health insurance plans once they provide at least 30 days notice to the HIA.  With a percentage-based stamp duty, it would be more difficult to ensure the total amount of credits paid matched the total amount of stamp duty collected.  The authority has calculated that the percentage-based stamp duty required to fund the credits proposed from 1 April 2017 would be 29% of the premium.  This would mean that the stamp duty would be higher than &euro;444, which is the proposed fixed amount for all advanced policies costing more than &euro;1,531 and the stamp duty would be lower for all policies costing less than that.  In the case of non-advanced policies, the percentage-based stamp duty would be higher for policies costing in excess of &euro;765 and lower for policies under that price.  However, changing from a fixed amount of stamp duty to a percentage-based stamp duty would affect the overall financial impact of the scheme.  The authority must take into account the net impact of both stamp duty and credits when considering the support required for groups of people under the scheme.  Older people, in general, require more support under the scheme because they have higher claims costs.  That is at the core of the scheme.  However, older people on average pay more for health insurance and, therefore, the authority's recommendation in respect of credits would have to take this into account.  There could be an unintended consequence for older people were we to move on that.<\/p><p> I accept the bona fides of what the Deputy is trying to do.  If it was useful for committee members to be briefed by the HIA and to further explore its views, I would be open to asking the authority to do any further body of work that the committee or individual members feel should be done.  It might be useful to further explore this but there is no benefit to legislating for this.  I have available to me the opportunity to ask the authority to conduct a review if members feel that is necessary.  It would be worth further engaging with the HIA in this respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2016112400002#S00600","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479988800,"counter":3149,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.

Has there been any policy discussion about the issue of rewarding insurers that take on high risk types?  The Minister referred to chronic illness.  There is little in the current set-up that incentivises or even encourages insurers to take on these cohorts.  If we continue to use age as the means of assessing how money is paid from the Central Fund, there might be a logic to examining this issue.  A broader policy decision would be required and it would not come under this legislation.

The age profile of the population has changed since then.  Many more young people have come into the country in the meantime, some of whom emigrated and returned.  They are being told they are paying a higher premium because insurers have to look after men and women in my age group.  I have tabled countless parliamentary questions but I have never been able to find out exactly where the money goes in terms of the comparison between the public and private sectors.  I have never been able to get that information to my satisfaction.  I have been suspicious over the years and I have never been able to find out to what extent the credit applied for the pain and suffering my peers and I experienced as a result of paying more to carry the older age groups in terms of risk equalisation when I was aged 25 or 30.
