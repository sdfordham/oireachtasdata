This programme has brought to fourteen the number of barracks closed during that time. To-date nine of these barracks - Clancy (Dublin), Castleblaney, Ballincollig, Fermoy, Naas, Monaghan, Cavan, Castlebar and a large portion of Longford - have been sold. <\/p><p>  In relation to the remaining barracks agreement has been reached for the sale of Lifford and Rockhill to Donegal County Council. <\/p><p>  Discussions are ongoing in relation to the possible sale of Clonmel Barracks to South Tipperary County Council and the remaining part of Longford has been reserved by the OPW for the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   Magee Barracks in Kildare and Columb Barracks in Mullingar remain the property of the Department of Defence. <\/p><p>Regarding the remaining Barracks, in accordance with normal procedure for the disposal of State property my Department has written to Government Departments and other Public Bodies   seeking expressions of interest in acquiring any of the properties to benefit the local community. Negotiations are well advanced with the Department of Education for the purchase of a site in Magee Barracks of around 20 Acres however there has been no interest in the remainder of the site.  No Public Body has expressed an interest in purchasing Columb Barracks in Mullingar.  <\/p><p>I am of course aware of the possibilities for the use of surplus Defence Buildings and I would be happy to discuss with any interested group proposals they may have for the purchase and development of the site for the benefit of the local community. However any proposal involving the long term retention of the remaining properties by my Department, administering multiple leases and fulfilling the many responsibilities of a landlord would put a significant administrative and financial burden on my Department. Given the current resources available and the need to provide investment funding for the development of the Defence Forces I do not feel that the multiple leasing of the remaining Barracks Barracks is feasible and does not meet the purpose of the property disposal programme as outlined in the White Paper.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600071#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":9,"content":"<p>Question No. 11 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Question No. 12 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Funding","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600071#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[46636\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600071#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to ensure the availability of sufficient resources throughout the Defence Forces in order to facilitate the full requirements in terms of strength, training, upgrading of military hardware and equipment notwithstanding the budgetary situation he inherited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>I am satisfied that the level of resources available to the Defence Forces, including, training, equipment and up to date technology, enables the Defence Forces to carry out their roles both at home and overseas.

At the conference, he stated that if European countries are to have access to the full spectrum of capabilities and forces they require for crisis management operations, they must cooperate more closely.  In this regard, he referenced the European Defence Agency&rsquo;s initiative on &ldquo;Pooling and Sharing&rdquo;, which complements the &ldquo;Smart Defence&rdquo; initiative in NATO.  The context of his speech was the significant cuts in the defence budgets of EU member States and the global security challenges faced by Member States against the backdrop of increased investment by countries outside of the EU.  I can recall the NATO Secretary General made a similar call for greater cooperation at European level when he was in Dublin to attend the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers during Ireland&rsquo;s EU presidency.  As such, this is nothing new and such cooperation is something which Ireland also supports.     Cooperation in the development of defence capabilities is necessary to ensure that the reduced resources available for defence are spent effectively and that there is no duplication of effort either within the Union or between the Union and NATO.  Through cooperative efforts we can achieve greater efficiencies in the delivery of military capabilities for crisis, management operations.  To this end, cooperation between the European Defence Agency and NATO is ongoing in areas such as Counter Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED), Medical Support and Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) protection projects.    The Agency is also actively engaged in enhancing cooperation with the European Commission in a number of EU policy areas which have civil and military dimensions including, Maritime Surveillance, Cyber, Single European Sky and Radio Spectrum.  This enhanced cooperation will help minimise any duplication of effort or inefficient use of resources across the EU system as a whole. <\/p><p>  Ireland has been a strong supporter of effective cooperation among member States and with NATO on the development and delivery of military capabilities for crisis management operations.  Our participation in Partnership for Peace, has enhanced both the capability and the interoperability of the Defence Forces when engaged overseas in UN authorised peacekeeping and peace support operations.  <\/p><p>  During the course of our recent Presidency, a key priority was enhanced cooperation between the Commission and the European Defence Agency in relation to investment in maritime security and surveillance capabilities, cyber security and defence, and countering improvised explosive devices.  Ireland as part of the EDA&rsquo;s cooperative pooling and sharing initiative is also providing a lead role in reviewing Naval training with a view to greater cooperation and sharing of training resources across the Union.  <\/p><p>  All these projects have the potential to deliver more effective capabilities more economically and I welcome such initiatives and the statement of support from the NATO Secretary General for them.      <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600071#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Representative Organisations","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600071#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[46633\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600071#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he has recently met with the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association to discuss their concerns regarding the changes to the Reserve Defence Forces and if he will provide an update on same.","asker":"998","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>Since I accepted the Report on the Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) which identified the need for reform I have not received a request for a meeting with the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association (RDFRA).

The cost of the two new ships is &euro;108m, exclusive of VAT.  In addition, the cost of providing a weapons system for the ships, similar to the systems on L.E. Roisin and L.E. Niamh, is &euro;7.8m, exclusive of VAT.  The two new ships are being built by Babcock Marine in Appledore, Devon in the United Kingdom, the same shipyard where both L.E. Roisin and L.E. Niamh were built.  The build programme for the first ship is well advanced and the float out of the ship, to be named LE Samuel Beckett, took place last Sunday evening in Devon.  The ship will replace LE Emer which was decommissioned and sold by public auction late last month in Cork.  The fitting out of the ship and the final build work will be completed over the next two months and it is expected that the ship will be ready for sea trials early in the New Year.  The cutting of steel and the fabrication of units for the second ship is also well advanced and the keel laying ceremony for this ship took place last Monday.  The second new ship will replace LE Aoife when it is delivered in early 2015.<\/p><p>  This vessel replacement strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level.

However, personnel may be deployed for training, for humanitarian operations and for other such reasons under the authority of the Government in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006, which formalised arrangements in this regard.  <\/p><p>  The White Paper on Defence, which was published in 2000, has provided the policy framework for Defence for the past thirteen years.  In the period since its publication there have been significant changes in the defence and security environment and the defence policy framework has continued to evolve.  In this context, the Government decided that there is a requirement to prepare a new White Paper on Defence. is will provide the policy framework for Defence for the next decade. <\/p><p>  A Green Paper on Defence, which was published in July of this year, initiated a broad public consultative process, which provided for members of the public and interest groups to input their views as part of the process of developing the new White Paper on Defence.  In this context the Green Paper engendered discussion on all relevant matters including the &quot;triple lock&quot;. <\/p><p>  The requirement for a UN resolution as part of the &quot;triple lock&quot; reflects the central importance of the UN in granting legitimacy to peace support and crisis management missions.  At the same time, it also constitutes a self imposed, legal constraint on the State's sovereignty in making decisions about the use of its armed forces.  This could prevent the State from participating in a peace support operation.  In 2003, the EU led peace support mission EUFOR Concordia in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was welcomed in UN resolution 1371 in terms that did not conform to the requirements of the Defence Acts at that time.  Accordingly, Ireland could not participate in the mission. <\/p><p>  The benefits of a formal legislative requirement for UN authorisation must be weighed against the possibility that this constraint may lead to an inability to act on occasions where there is a pressing moral or security imperative and overwhelming international support to do so, but where UN sanction is not forthcoming, in circumstances where a veto is exercised by a permanent member of the Security Council acting in its own national interests. <\/p><p>  It is acknowledged that there is substantial public support for the triple lock mechanism and that, in practical terms, due to the size of our Defence Forces, the State only has a limited capacity to contribute to UN Missions.  In real terms Ireland has, in the context of its size, punched above its weight and made a valuable, disproportionate contribution and, save for the example of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, has not been excluded from peace keeping engagements by the triple lock.  On balance, the advantages of retaining the mechanism can be seen as outweighing the disadvantages.  Having said that, it is an issue worthy of discussion in advance of the adoption of a new White Paper. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600073#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":59,"content":"<p>Question No. 29 answered with Question No. 17.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":60,"content":"<p>Question No. 30 answered with Question No. 8.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600073#WRC01000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abduction","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600073#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[47292\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600073#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the action he has taken to return a person (details supplied) from Egypt to Ireland.

The FAC adopted Conclusions which, while welcoming the encouraging progress made in recent weeks on the disarmament issue, underlined the need to maintain the momentum behind the &lsquo;Geneva II&rsquo; process and emphasised the overall need for a political solution to the crisis in Syria. The Council made clear that it welcomed the call of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for the Geneva II Conference to be held before the end of November and reiterated that the objective of the Conference must be the swift establishment, by mutual consent, of a transitional governing body with full executive powers and control of all governmental and all security institutions. Discussions are due to continue in Geneva this week aimed at agreeing specific dates for the Conference as well as details of who will be invited.<\/p><p>  The Council, in its Conclusions, also prioritised the alleviation of the humanitarian suffering and called for safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all populations in need of assistance throughout the country. The EU is the largest international donor of assistance to the Syrian people and Ireland, for its part, has contributed a total of &euro;13.8m to date.<\/p><p>  In my intervention, I voiced Ireland&rsquo;s continuing full support for Joint Special Representative Brahimi and his efforts to convene the Geneva II conference as well as informing partners of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;200,000 to the OPCW disarmament efforts.<\/p><p>  In recognition of the immense burden placed upon, and risks to, neighbouring countries, the Council emphasised the absolute and urgent necessity for all donor countries to ensure the fulfilment of pledges already made. The urgent necessity for all donor countries to continue to provide financial support to enable host countries to respond to the growing humanitarian needs of refugees was also emphasised. I took the opportunity to call for greater efforts to address the humanitarian crisis and, in particular, the need for access across borders. The conflict in Syria will remain a major priority for Ireland at all levels of our international engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600074#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600074#WRD00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Collection","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600074#WRD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[47192\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600074#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the final date for cash payments of the local property tax; if he will instruct the Revenue Commissioners to supply clear transparent information to person's regarding payment options as letters currently being sent out have no information about cash payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[47249\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600074#WRD00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason it is necessary for persons who wish to pay their local property tax for 2014 by one lump sum postal order or cheque must do so immediately; if tax for 2014 be only paid in 2014 and if he considers it unfair to expect persons to pay this tax twice in 2013.

The launch of the Report on Pension Charges report in October 2012 was followed by a three month consultation with stakeholders. Following the consultation, it was agreed by Government in April 2013 that the recommendations contained in the report will be implemented, and this work has commenced.

I have pursued this issue with the representative bodies of these companies but the response has not been positive. I have been told that it would be a matter for individual companies to decide on the question of absorbing the cost of the levy into their existing fees and charges but that the scope for companies to do so is very limited. There have been calls to force the companies through legislation to absorb the levy but I do not consider that this approach, which would ignore the circumstances from case to case, would be appropriate. <\/p><p>  The levy applies to the market value, on the valuation date (generally 30 June each year), of assets under management in pension funds and pension plans approved under Irish tax legislation, including funded Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution occupational pension schemes. However, the levy does not apply where the trustees of an occupational pension scheme have passed a resolution to wind up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600076#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Deferrals","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600076#WRF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[47377\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600076#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address an issue (details supplied) where the owner signed up for deferral of the local property tax but keeps receiving payment demands from the Revenue Commissioners to the wrong person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>\tI am informed by Revenue that a key aspect of the work it has undertaken in connection with the administration of Local Property Tax (LPT) has been the development of a register of residential properties in the State.

In the case of jointly assessed spouses, the name of the person registered for Income Tax was used for the purpose of issuing LPT forms and notices.    In the case to which the Deputy refers, the persons involved are jointly assessed under a common PPS number.

","asker":"1073","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":145,"content":"<p>Parliamentary questions linked to the substance of the High Court case taken by Student Transport Scheme Ltd against my Department, including the arrangements between my Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann, have been raised on a number of occasions in the House recently.<\/p><p>  For this reason, I feel it is appropriate to give a background to the conduct of the particular case. In doing this I will not stray into the area of issues that were raised before the Court and which were appropriately dealt with in that forum. Nor will I comment on matters which may be the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court.<\/p><p>Student Transport Scheme Ltd is a company first incorporated in June 2011; it initiated the legal action against my Department in October 2011.  Bus &Eacute;ireann was joined as a Notice Party in the proceedings at the direction of the High Court. The records with the Companies Registration Office show that the sole shareholders of Student Transport Scheme Ltd are Mr Tim Doyle and Mr Brian Lynch who hold 101 and 99 shares of &euro;1 each respectively, or a paid-up share capital of &euro;200. The company was represented in the legal action by Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates, Solicitors.<\/p><p>  Given the fact that the company had effectively no assets, my Department judged it prudent to seek an Order from the High Court for security for costs. This process preceded the actual hearing of the court case. In January 2012, the High Court gave the Department an order for security of costs. The effect of this was to provide the tax payer with security in the event, as actually occurred, that the Department won the court case and received an order in its favour in respect of its costs. In the absence of such security the taxpayer was at risk in relation to the costs of the action.<\/p><p>  The essential thrust of the legal action was to seek an Order from the High Court setting aside the existing arrangements for the provision of national school transport services. The case was heard over a six day period in the Commercial High Court spanning the period from 10th July to 18th July 2012. During this period Counsel, on behalf of all parties (the company, the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann) advanced the detail of their respective cases and the legal arguments to the Court. The High Court Judgement was given in October 2012. The detail of this Judgement is available on the Courts Service website and other than to make the point that the Court found decisively in favour of the Department, I do not propose to comment further on the detail of the case.<\/p><p>  It is worthy of note that the court case was litigated in an unusually belligerent manner by the applicant.  The Department is in receipt of very extensive correspondence accusing the Department of illegality, obstruction of a solicitor, tampering with evidence, perverting the course of justice and drawing purported parallels between my Department and a fiefdom of thugs in Limerick City.  At trial, Senior Counsel for the company apologised for the excessive zeal of this correspondence.<\/p><p>  Subsequent to the Court Judgement in favour of the Department the company, through their solicitor, Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates initiated an appeal to the Supreme Court.  In addition the company, again through their solicitor Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates commenced an action against two named officials of the Department, the Chief State Solicitor and a named official of the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  This action alleged contempt and sought committal of the public servants in question. <\/p><p>The Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann also sought security for the legal costs in relation to the appeal to the Supreme Court. The underlying purpose of seeking this security was to safeguard the taxpayer against the costs to be incurred in defending this appeal. In the event the issues of contempt\/committal and security for costs came before the Supreme Court in February 2013. The Supreme Court dismissed the contempt\/committal issue. The Supreme Court also awarded the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann security for their costs in an amount to be decided by the Master of the High Court in the event of the appeal against the High Court judgement proceeding.<\/p><p>  The litigation in this case continues to be conducted in a most unusual, threatening and aggressive manner.  Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates on behalf of the company, and Mr. Tim Doyle, as managing director of the company between them have written many hundreds of letters to Ministers, Deputies, the Department, Bus &Eacute;ireann, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and to individual officials and retired officials of the Department.  Elements of this correspondence allege corruption, refer to an ongoing investigation of corruption by Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates, and repeatedly raise issues and contentions which were either the subject of the failed High Court challenge and\/or are proper to any appeal to the Supreme Court.<\/p><p>  It should also be pointed out that earlier correspondence to Bus &Eacute;ireann contained references to bias, bribery and bullying and these allegations are now the subject of separate defamation proceedings initiated by Bus &Eacute;ireann against Mr Tim Doyle.<\/p><p>  I consider it necessary to bring the foregoing information to the attention of Deputies. It is important that litigation be conducted in the appropriate objective forum, namely the Courts, and that Ministers refrain from comment on matters which are the subject of further legal proceedings.  Myself and my officials have sought to respect this principle in our approach to the litigation. The Office of the Chief State Solicitor has corresponded repeatedly with Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates pointing out that issues in relation to the proceedings should be dealt with in the appropriate process and will not be debated in the course of correspondence by either my Department or that Office.<\/p><p>  Subject to provision of the appropriate security for costs as directed by the Supreme Court and as determined by the Master of the High Court, my Department will deal fully with the relevant issues and contentions raised by Brian Lynch &amp;amp; Associates in the context of the Supreme Court appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600078#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1042"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers Panel Rights","counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600078#WRH00750"},{"type":"question","counter":147,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[47387\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600078#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if time spent completing an internship under the JobBridge scheme at a primary school can be counted towards supplementary panel rights for the teacher; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":148,"content":"<p>The core function of the redeployment arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers to other schools that have vacancies.

The Department is in the process of introducing a series of reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme.  These reforms are predicated on activation and on getting people back into the workforce once their children have reached an appropriate age.  A wide range of supports and services are presently available to lone parents who are clients of the Department and who pro-actively engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation process.  As part of the supports that are available to lone parents my Department has provided funding to One Family for its &lsquo;New Futures&rsquo; programme for the 2011-2012 period.  In 2012, One Family obtained further funding from my Department for its &lsquo;New Futures &ndash; Securing A Career&rsquo; programme for the 2012-2013 period.  The recently introduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) transitional arrangement caters for OFP recipients who lose their entitlement to the OFP payment from July, 2013, onwards, who have a youngest child aged under 14 years, and who are entitled to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment.  These customers are exempt from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  They are also exempt from having to prove unemployment and can work part-time without restrictions and still receive the JA transitional arrangement payment &ndash; subject to a means test.  The exemptions from the full JA conditionality will remain in place until a recipient&rsquo;s youngest child reaches the age of 14 years.  At this point, should they continue to claim the JA payment, they will be subjected to the full JA conditionality.<\/p><p>  Recipients of either the JA payment or the JA transitional arrangement payment may qualify for other social welfare income support benefits at the same time as their primary payment.  They can also avail of a wide range of education, training, and employment supports, and are entitled to apply, subject to qualifying conditions, for subsidised child care through both the community child care subvention (CCS) programme and the child care education and training support (CETS) scheme that are administered by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D\/CYA).  In addition, they can apply for the after-school child care scheme in the event that they take up employment, increase their days of employment, or commence certain employment programmes.  This scheme, which was announced in Budget 2013, and which is also funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs but jointly administered by my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will continue to provide subsidised after-school child care places into 2014.<\/p><p>  I have also secured the agreement of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on a new strand of child care support for customers of the Department, including lone parents, who are participating in the community employment scheme.  This new child care support will be provided via the CETS scheme.<\/p><p>  Lone parents can also qualify for the family income supplement (FIS).  FIS is an income support payment for families on low income that incentivises them to retain or increase their hours of employment.<\/p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 to 96, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  The Report on Pension Charges 2012 was undertaken by my Department, working with the Central Bank and the Pensions Board, and with support from PWC.  The primary objective of the report was to gather information on the level of pension charges levied, to assess whether these charges are reasonable and transparent, to report on the findings and to make recommendations.  The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges.   <\/p><p>  With our ageing population and with people living longer, planning and saving for retirement is more important than ever.  A key part of this is to know what level of pension you are likely to receive in retirement and for employers, trustees and scheme members to understand the very significant impact pension charges can have on your final pension fund.  The report shows that small percentages can add up to big reductions in a pension fund over time.<\/p><p>  The launch of the Report on Pension Charges was followed by a three month consultation with stakeholders.  There was a broad range of views expressed in the submissions received as well as a range of suggestions and proposals aimed at improving various aspects of the pension charging environment.  Following the consultation period, it was agreed by Government in April 2013 that the recommendations contained in the report will be implemented, and this work has commenced.  <\/p><p>  A Pension Charges Working Group is in place to initiate actions that follow up on the recommendations of the report.  This group comprises the Department of Social Protection, the Pensions Board and the Central Bank.   Each has a core role to play in delivering on the recommendations contained within the Report on Pension Charges and work has commenced in this regard.  Joint action undertaken by the group has and will include consultation with other stakeholders as appropriate.   <\/p><p>  I have also previously signalled a change to the governance structure of the Pensions Board which will be restructured.  Under the new structure, a separate unpaid Pensions Council, with a number of members representing consumer interests, will advise on matters of pensions policy.  The first task I will be giving the new Council is to monitor the implementation of the recommendations in the Report on Pension Charges and advise me if further actions are needed.  Should this prove necessary, a further policy and regulatory response may be brought to Government.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600080#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":185,"content":"<p>Question No. 82 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Appeals","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600081#WRL00250"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[47281\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600081#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision will issue on a jobseeker's allowance appeal in respect of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"973","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":188,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who has decided to convene an oral hearing in this case.

Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 15,981 at 1 November, 2013.  <\/p><p>  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to October 2013 reducing to 34.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 26.3 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>  A similar trend is reflected in processing times for invalidity pension appeals. In 2010 the average processing time for an invalidity pension oral hearing was 59.7 weeks while a decision requiring a summary decision took an average of 40 weeks.  This had improved to 48.7 and 38.8 weeks respectively in 2012 and has further improved (up to October 2013) to 43.1 and 36 weeks respectively. <\/p><p>  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.<\/p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.  <\/p><p><b>Invalidity Pension Appeals 2011 to  2013 (to 31 October 2013)<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>Average Processing Times<\/th><th>Average Processing Times<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Appeals on hand at year beginning <\/td><td>Appeal Receipts<\/td><td>Appeals Officers Decisions<\/td><td>Summary Decision    (in weeks) <\/td><td>Oral Hearing   (in weeks)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>   612<\/td><td>2,285<\/td><td>   903<\/td><td>36.4<\/td><td>58.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>1,582<\/td><td>4,765<\/td><td>1,465<\/td><td>38.8<\/td><td>48.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 (to 31 October 2013)<\/td><td>4,356<\/td><td>4,027<\/td><td>3,995<\/td><td>36.0<\/td><td>43.1<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600082#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Eligibility","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600082#WRM00750"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[47349\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600082#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if every person who is the subject of a disability allowance review is now being seen by a Department medical assessor before a decision is taken on their case; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":214,"content":"<p>Applications for disability allowance are normally medically assessed at desk by one of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors who assesses the available medical evidence with reference to evidence based protocols and guidelines.

The primary objective of the report was to gather information on the level of pension charges levied, to assess whether these charges are reasonable and transparent, to report on the findings and to make recommendations.  The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges.   <\/p><p>  With our ageing population and with people living longer, planning and saving for retirement is more important than ever.  A key part of this is to know what level of pension you are likely to receive in retirement and for employers, trustees and scheme members to understand the very significant impact pension charges can have on your final pension fund.  The report shows that small percentages can add up to big reductions in a pension fund over time.<\/p><p>  The launch of the Report on Pension Charges was followed by a three month consultation with stakeholders.  There was a broad range of views expressed in the submissions received as well as a range of suggestions and proposals aimed at improving various aspects of the pension charging environment.  Following the consultation period, it was agreed by Government in April 2013 that the recommendations contained in the report will be implemented, and this work has commenced.  <\/p><p>  A Pension Charges Working Group is in place to initiate actions that follow up on the recommendations of the report.  This group comprises the Department of Social Protection, the Pensions Board and the Central Bank.   Each has a core role to play in delivering on the recommendations contained within the Report on Pension Charges and work has commenced in this regard.  Joint action undertaken by the group has and will include consultation with other stakeholders as appropriate.   <\/p><p>  I have also previously signalled a change to the governance structure of the Pensions Board which will be restructured.  Under the new structure, a separate unpaid Pensions Council, with a number of members representing consumer interests, will advise on matters of pensions policy.  The first task I will be giving the new Council is to monitor the implementation of the recommendations in the Report on Pension Charges and advise me if further actions are needed.  Should this prove necessary, a further policy and regulatory response may be brought to Government.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600082#WRM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Reform","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600083#WRN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[47367\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600083#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"in view of the recommendation of the report on pension charges in Ireland 2012 and the OECD Review of the Irish Pension System, if she plans to put in place a universal pension scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Compared to the rest of the population, older people in Ireland have the lowest consistent poverty rate (at 1.9%) and are least likely to be at risk of poverty, pointing to the adequacy of the State pension.   However, many people retiring from work will have a significant income gap if they do not have supplementary private pension provision. <\/p><p>  Figures indicate that only half of workers aged between 20 and 69 years have a supplementary pension and this relatively low coverage is of major concern.  It is a priority for the Government to increase supplementary pension coverage, particularly amongst the lower paid and those with gaps in their employment.  Significant reform of our pensions systems is necessary to safeguard future sustainability and adequacy.   The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges faced by Ireland, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and the deterioration in the public finances.  This means that the task of financing future increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to pensioners will decrease from 5.3\/1 at present to 2.1\/1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing: in the mid-1990s, life expectancy for males was 73 and for females 78.5.  In 2041, it will be 86.5 and 88.3 respectively.  Whilst this is very welcome development, it also presents very real and obvious public policy challenges. <\/p><p>  In April 2013, the OECD published its Review of the Irish Pension System.  Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report also makes a number of recommendations for future reform.  The OECD&rsquo;s key recommendation is to improve the adequacy of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment based pension system.  <\/p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers.   I have previously stated that a soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, is a very proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage, though it is recognised that introduction of such an initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case.<\/p><p>  International experience has shown that significant increases in coverage can be obtained from such systems. In addition, the significantly larger economies of scale have the capacity to achieve more competitive charging structures, which in turn would lead to improved returns for consumer members.   As was highlighted in the Pensions Charges Report 2012, this type of arrangement could assist in resolving the difficulties inherent in the current Irish scheme structure of a proliferation of small schemes paying considerably higher charges than larger schemes, ultimately eroding the value of the pension received by the member.<\/p><p>  Analysis of the options available is on-going in my Department and consideration of the recommendations of the OECD review will inform further developments in the area of pension policy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600083#WRN00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600083#WRN00350"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[47381\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600083#WRN00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a date will be agreed for an appeal of invalidity pension payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

However, they are not entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  This compares to employees in respect of whom a combined 14.75% rate, under full-rate PRSI Class A, is paid giving entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.<\/p><p>  Any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may claim means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services.

The Advisory Group is charged with, inter alia, examining and reporting on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  Any proposals for change must be cost neutral. <\/p><p>  On 6 September 2013 I published the Group&rsquo;s report on the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons. The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries. To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work because of a long-term illness or incapacity through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for Class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  This is in line with the estimated level of contributions needed to provide access for the self-employed to invalidity pension contained in the 2010 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund. <\/p><p>  In the course of the Group&rsquo;s deliberations, the Group identified a range of issues associated with the subject of social insurance for the self-employed that should be addressed and have made a number of recommendations in this regard.  These include, among others, the means assessment for self-employed income in terms of accessing jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments, credited PRSI contributions, self-employed access to activation and training schemes and the role that information campaigns might play in addressing information deficits, particularly with regard to entitlements to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.<\/p><p>  The question as to whether the present arrangements regarding social insurance for the self-employed are appropriate has increased in prominence over recent years. I welcome the Group&rsquo;s finding that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment. <\/p><p>  The recommendation concerning long-term sickness or injuries is an important contribution to the policy debate regarding the range of benefits the self-employed might access through their social insurance contributions.  In this regard, the 2010 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, published last year, determined that the self-employed are obtaining better value for the level of their current social insurance contributions than employees (the Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contributions needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%).<\/p><p>  This finding was noted by the Advisory Group in its recommendations.  Consequently, the recommendations of the Advisory Group require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the 2010 Actuarial Review relating to the level of contributions levied on Class S contributors and the current shortfall in this regard.<\/p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will now carefully reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600083#WRN01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":238,"content":"<p>Question No. 102 answered with Question No. 93.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600084#WRO00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Projects","counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600084#WRO00075"},{"type":"question","counter":241,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[47245\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600084#WRO00100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will provide a full list of outlets that provide heritage funding nationally; the total amount these outlets provide on an annual basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Commercial decisions by individual private operators in relation to its infrastructure are a matter for the company concerned.  Any regulatory issues surrounding the provision of services are the responsibility of ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions.<\/p><p>  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Cork, can be found on ComReg's website at .  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Cork.  This will be achieved by providing: a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers.  ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.<\/p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600084#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Resources","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600084#WRO00450"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[47293\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600084#WRO00500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if his Department has reviewed the most recent capacity assessment by the UK energy regulator, Ofgem, published in June 2013, which warned of an increased risk of energy shortages over the coming winters; if his attention has been drawn to proposals by the UK's National Grid that large energy users could be forced to shut down their operations from 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. during peak winter energy usage periods; if, in view of Ireland's almost full dependence on imported energy, including the fact that 96% of our gas comes from the UK, his Department is concerned about these energy issues; what plans, if any, his Department has drawn up to deal with possible energy shortages and significant energy price hikes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1082","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The Energy Regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, published its most recent annual Electricity Capacity Assessment on 27 June, 2013.  The assessment analyses security of electricity supply in Great Britain over the forthcoming five winters.  It shows that the buffer between peak electricity demand and supply could be lower than previously expected and proposed for consultation certain measures to address this issue.<\/p><p>  In contrast, the most recent All-Island Generation Capacity Statement published in January 2013 forecast that the adequacy situation in Ireland is positive for the next 10 years.  Indeed, there is considerable generation surplus forecast for the Irish electricity system.  These electricity Capacity Statements are required to be published annually by Eirgrid and the Transmission System Operator in Northern Ireland, SONI, and take account of interconnection with Great Britain.<\/p><p>  Turning to the issue of gas, it is correct to say that currently Ireland is dependent to a large extent on imported gas from Great Britain.  In terms of long term plans for energy security, Ireland's approach is to diversify fuels and supply sources.  The use of indigenous gas and access to Liquefied Natural Gas storage will enhance diversity.<\/p><p>  Continuing to develop indigenous renewable electricity is also a key strategy in ensuring supply diversity.  Currently over 19% of electricity is generated from renewable sources and supports are in place to ensure we attain our target of increasing this to 40% by 2020.  In addition, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, funded and assisted by my Department has, over the past decade, been proactive in maximising energy efficiency.  Several successful initiatives have been undertaken while new initiatives are also being considered which will further improve the efficiency of energy consumption, thus reducing our consumption (including consumption of imported energy) and contributing to security of supply.  As well as enhancing long term energy security, there are detailed operational plans in place to deal with any unexpected short term disruption to energy supplies.  In the unlikely event of a major disruption, EirGrid and Gaslink would implement their respective emergency plans to deal with the situation. <\/p><p>  On the issue of prices, electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including wholesale gas prices, the cost of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density.  Wholesale gas prices are by far the most significant factor with prices rising since 2009 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and the significant growth in demand from China and India.  At a national level, the competitive energy market in place helps put downward pressure on prices.  There is an ongoing focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600084#WRO00600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Generation","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600084#WRO00650"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[47308\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600084#WRO00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"how his Department will encourage and attract businesses to commence operations in respect of building wind turbines in the State, either the key elements or the complete structure, to obviate the need to import materials from outside Ireland for the construction of wind turbines.

The END aims to define a common approach intended to avoid, prevent or reduce on a prioritised basis the harmful effects, including annoyance, due to exposure to environmental noise.<\/p><p>  The END was transposed into national law by the Environmental Noise Regulations 2006, which set out a two-stage process for addressing environmental noise. Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria. Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned. The fundamental objective of noise action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise. Responsibility for noise action planning is assigned to local authorities.  The latest round of noise mapping was undertaken during 2012. Local authorities subsequently prepared <font color=\"#263137\">related<\/font> noise action plans for the period July 2013 to November 2018.

The Regulations require that a local authority undertakes consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before submitting a proposal for quiet area designation to me for approval. Proposed quiet areas should have existing low levels of exposure to environmental noise with naturally occurring sounds being the dominant sound source. The purpose of a quiet area designation is to preserve a location as a public amenity space by protecting it from increased exposure to environmental noise. The designation could affect future development in the vicinity of a quiet area if it has the potential adversely to impact on existing low noise levels.     <\/p><p>  As part of the noise action plan for the Dublin agglomeration, Dublin City Council proposed 8 locations around the city as being suitable for quiet area designation under the Regulations.

I also advised the Associations that they could seek to meet me at any time on issues of concern to them and assured them that my officials would continue to engage pro-actively with them through the various consultative arrangements already in place.<\/p><p>  My officials meet with RACO and PDFORRA on a regular basis in relation to work within the framework of the Public Service Agreement 2010 &ndash; 2014 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013 &ndash; 2016. They also meet regularly in various Council and Council Sub-committee meetings under the auspices of the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme. <\/p><p>  My officials meet with RDFRA as required to discuss matters of concern to their members. In addition my officials have been having a series of bi-lateral meetings with RDFRA in relation to the re-organisation of the RDF which is currently underway.  These meetings, chaired by the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support), attended by Military personnel and Departmental staff afford RDFRA an opportunity to raise issues they may have in relation to the re-organisation of the Reserve.  Similar meetings were held with RACO and PDFORRA at which they were afforded the opportunity to raise issues they had in connection with the PDF Cadre support staff in relation to the re-organisation of the Reserve. In addition to these bi-lateral meetings my officials meet with RDFRA as required <\/p><p>  Military management also meet regularly with the Associations in Military Forum. I am regularly briefed by my officials and by the Military Authorities in relation to the issues and concerns of the Associations. <\/p><p>  I remain satisfied that there are sufficient and robust systems in place within the Defence Organisation to ensure that issues of concern to members of the Defence Forces are brought to my attention, as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600087#WRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Corps Strength","counter":310,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600087#WRR00950"},{"type":"question","counter":311,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[47391\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600087#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which the strength of the Air Corps has been maintained over the past two and a half years throughout all ranks; the extent if any to which recruitment is contemplated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":312,"content":"<p>The tables contain the strength of the  Air Corps for each of the years 2011 and 2012 and to the 30th of September 2013, the latest date for which figures are available.

approximately 560 Defence Forces personnel to 14 different missions throughout the world. Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement attached.    The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 356 personnel, including the Deputy Force Commander. The joint Irish\/Finnish Battalion is tasked primarily with patrolling, reconnaissance and occupying static posts while operating in close coordination and cooperation with the Lebanese Armed Forces in Sector West of UNIFIL&rsquo;s area of operations.<\/p><p>  Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the EU Training Mission (EUTM) Somalia with eight (8) personnel, including the Mission Commander; the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) with eight (8) personnel; the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with seven (7) personnel who are based at mission headquarters in Sarajevo; the NATO-led international security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with twelve (12) personnel based in the mission Headquarters; and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan with seven (7) personnel who are based in the mission Headquarters in Kabul. Ireland also contributes 24 observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions and 16 other personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU and OSCE headquarters.<\/p><p>  The most recent deployment overseas was in response to a United Nations request and resulted in the deployment of the 43<sup>rd<\/sup> Infantry Group to United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Golan Heights in Syria.  This deployment was successfully completed on 28 September 2013.  The 43<sup>rd<\/sup>   Infantry Group is tasked primarily to serve as the Force Mobile Reserve within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility.   A total of 118 Defence Forces personnel are currently serving with UNDOF, including four (4) personnel who were deployed to UNDOF earlier this year for service at the Mission Headquarters.  <\/p><p>  Also, at the request of the United Nations and following Government approval, four (4) members of the Permanent Defence Force deployed for service with the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in South Sudan in August 2013.  Their role is to provide a specialist training team on Conventional Munitions Disposal (CMD), mine and specialist search awareness to South Sudan Police personnel.<\/p><p>  The current contribution of some 560 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.  <\/p><p>  My Department constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.

However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, must take into account the current difficult economic environment we are now operating in. The budgetary situation, in the context of the current difficult economic situation, will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment, training and upgrades.  Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces has a robust and comprehensive training system which incorporates a wide variety of modern training methods. <\/p><p>  Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice. Participation in ongoing overseas operations also necessitates multi lateral-training and assessment. This facilitates ongoing review of Defence Forces training methods and standards within an international military context.

These modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair on the other vessels in the fleet, will ensure the Naval Service continues to meet the required operational capability.   A considerable training effort is also involved with the new ships programme to allow for a smooth entry of the first ship into operational service in 2014 and the second ship in 2015.<\/p><p>  The Air Corps keeps abreast of all developments in modern aviation.  It will continue to conduct its training in accordance with industry best practices and to the highest standards, referencing European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements, using the most modern methods and equipment available.<\/p><p>  The budgetary situation, in the context of the current difficult economic situation, will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment, training and upgrades.  Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600088#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Promotions","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600088#WRS00750"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[47395\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600088#WRS00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of promotions outstanding in the Defence Forces in the Army, Navy and Air Corps; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, the Air Corps has a role in assisting and supporting the civil authorities and, in this regard, both they and the Naval Service provide support to these agencies as the need arises and within their available capabilities.    A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Irish Coast Guard which sets out, inter alia, the search and rescue assistance that the Air Corps and Naval Service can provide to the Coast Guard. The provision of onshore assistance by Air Corps helicopters for mountain rescue operations is also covered in the Agreement, as is provision by Air Corps aircraft of fixed wing &lsquo;top cover&rsquo; to Coast Guard helicopters operating offshore.  <\/p><p>  The Air Corps Maritime Patrol Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone. <\/p><p>  A Service Level Agreement is in place between my Department and the Department of Health which formalises the arrangements for the provision of emergency inter-hospital transfers by the Air Corps.  In addition, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between my Department and the Department of Health underpins the Air Corps&rsquo; support to the National Ambulance Service for a pilot Emergency Aeromedical Support service, focussing primarily in the west of Ireland and operating out of Custume Barracks Athlone. Following a review of the pilot service carried out by an Audit and Evaluation Group established under the MOU, a Report was submitted for consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Health. Following a subsequent request from the Minister, I have agreed to extend the Air Corps&rsquo; participation in the pilot in order to allow him an opportunity to give consideration to the Report and to examine the options for the implementation of its recommendations. <\/p><p>  These matters are kept under review and I am satisfied that the Air Corps has the necessary capabilities in these important areas. <\/p><p>  In July 2013, following Government approval, I launched a Green Paper on Defence. This initiated a consultative process that will inform the development of a new White Paper on Defence.  When finalised, the new White Paper will provide the defence policy framework for the next ten years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600089#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":343,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600089#WRT00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600089#WRT00750"},{"type":"question","counter":343,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[47214\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600089#WRT00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding farm grants due to a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and when payment may issue.","asker":"1058","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":344,"content":"<p>   The person named submitted a Single Farm Payment\/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme application on 25 March 2013.

These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually. In addition, my Department undertakes Nitrates inspections under the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) regulations on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>  Rules regarding the advance notification of inspections are clearly laid down in the governing EU regulations and must be adhered to by officials in my Department. In general, all inspections should be unannounced. However, the regulations allow my Department to give up to 14 days notice for land eligibility and cross-compliance inspections involving SMRs other than those related to animal identification and registration, food, feed, and animal welfare. For checks involving cattle and sheep identification and registration the maximum advance notice is 48 hours. For SMRs dealing with feed, food and animal welfare no advance notice may be given and these inspections must take place on an un-announced basis. Where it is considered that the purpose of any type of inspection may be jeopardised by giving notice, the inspection will take place on an un-announced basis. In determining the type of notice to be given for an inspection a number of factors are considered so as to ensure that the inspection process is not jeopardised.  These notification procedures are in accordance with those outlined in my Department&rsquo;s Farmers&rsquo; Charter and Action Plan. <\/p><p>  The following table provides a breakdown, by county and by year, of the number of unannounced inspections under the Single Payment and Disadvantaged Areas Schemes and the Nitrates (GAP) inspections for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 to end October.

The minimum landing size provides some protection to juvenile lobster, allowing some spawning to occur before lobsters enter the fishery.  The v-notch regulation prohibits the landing of v-notched lobsters until the notch is repaired by growth (usually occurs over 2-4 years) thus allowing such lobsters to contribute to spawning.  V-notching is a voluntary conservation measure and v-notching rates vary around the coast.<\/p><p>Recent stock assessments, and evaluation of the existing conservation measures, indicated that spawning stock is not adequately protected and recruitment to lobster stocks may be impaired.  Having examined the issue with my Department&rsquo;s scientific and technical advisers from the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the SFPA, I initiated a consultation process on 20 August 2013 on proposals to change the current lobster stock management rules.  I proposed two alternative measures; either to introduce a <i>maximum<\/i> landing size of 127mm or to increase the <i>minimum<\/i>   landing size from 87mm to 90mm.  The consultation documents I published set out in some detail the pros and cons of each option.  Both options assumed the continuation of v-notching at present rates and further measures would be required in the absence of v-notching.  The deadline for submissions was 25 October 2013 and I am now reviewing the in excess of 200 submissions received.

In advance of that meeting, I also held bilateral meetings with Commissioner Damanaki, Spanish Fisheries Minister Canete, UK Minister Eustice and Scottish Minister Lochead to press Ireland&rsquo;s case.  At the Council meeting, I sought information from the Commission (who negotiate on behalf of the EU at the Coastal States meetings) on the current state of play in the negotiations, details on the Commissions&rsquo; discussion with Norway, a key partner for the EU on this issue, and confirmation that the Commission were prepared to consider an approach to the negotiations that would protect Ireland&rsquo;s interests and at the same time go some way to meeting the legitimate expectations of Iceland and the Faeroes.<\/p><p>  I argued strongly against rewarding Iceland and the Faeroe Islands for their unacceptable and irresponsible actions in respect of the shared mackerel stock over the past number of years and outlined what I consider must be the fundamental principles for any agreement with Iceland. Specifically, I expressed my view to the Council that any new offer to Iceland must be jointly agreed with Norway on the basis of equal burden sharing and that Iceland should not be granted access to EU waters as a part of any deal. I made it clear that I was not opposed to a deal and recognized that Iceland should be provided with a fair and justifiable quota share.  However, I also made it absolutely clear that any deal must also protect the interests of EU Member States like Ireland who have relied on this fishery for over 40 years.<\/p><p>  In this regard, I asked that the Commissioner and my fellow Ministers give serious consideration to a proposal developed by the European Pelagic Industry that would involve a tiered approach with different percentage shares for each of the Coastal States depending upon the level of the Total Allowable Catch advice.  The core concept behind this proposal is to protect those fleets that have developed and now depend upon the mackerel fishery over a long number of years.  I was pleased that the Commissioner and many of the Member States took away this concept for more detailed examination in advance of the Coastal State negotiations in London the following week, and with the positive consideration of all of the points raised by me.<\/p><p>  At the negotiations in London on 23\/24 October, in addition to my officials, Ireland was also represented at industry level.  Unfortunately however, there was little by way of concrete progress.  In large part this was due to the fact that a new Norwegian Fisheries Minister had only been appointed the previous week. One positive aspect was that, again at Ireland&rsquo;s instigation, there was a detailed presentation to, and exchange of views with Member States, from the European Pelagic industry on their proposal. <\/p><p>  Another round of Coastal State negotiations is now due to take place in Clonakilty from 18-22 November.  Ireland will play a constructive role at those negotiations and will leave no stone unturned in an effort to reach a solution that is balanced and fair to all of the parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600090#WRU00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600090#WRU00950"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[47295\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600090#WRU01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Kerry will be paid their 2013 disadvantaged area payment and 2013 single farm payment; the reason for the delay in paying these grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":364,"content":"<p> An application under the 2013 Single Farm Payment\/Disadvantaged Areas&rsquo; Scheme was received from the named person in my Department on the 2<sup>nd<\/sup>   of May 2013.

The number of premises providing such services throughout Ireland has also greatly increased.   The risks associated with body piercing can range from acute infection to allergic reactions.  There is also a risk of hepatitis B and C and HIV with all piercing.  Oral piercings pose particular risks which include tooth damage, airway obstruction, gum swelling and injury. I would encourage anyone who is experiencing any of those symptoms to visit their dentist or GP.<\/p><p>  There is no legislation in Ireland specifically regulating body piercing business.  However, these businesses are required to comply with general public health and safety legislation in the same way as any other business.   In addition, under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, a Medical Officer of Health, or an Environmental Health Officer is empowered where there is reason to believe that a suspected case of an infectious disease or a probable source of infection exists, to take such steps as are necessary for investigating the nature and source of such infection.<\/p><p>  High standards of hygiene are necessary when performing body piercing in order to minimise the risks for both the person carrying out the body piercing and the client.  Standard Infection Control Precautions were developed for the health care setting but they can and should be applied to any settings where there is a potential for persons to be exposed to blood or other body fluids including body piercing premises.  It is also advisable that anyone carrying out body piercing receive the hepatitis B vaccination.<\/p><p>  My Department is reviewing policy regarding body piercing.  In the first instance, the focus is on the development of &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; guidelines for persons carrying out body piercing rather than legislation.

The airports and Tourism Ireland have attractive incentive and marketing programmes available\u00a0which will\u00a0help support new services and build on the success of The Gathering in the months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600100#WREE00800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sporting Events","counter":539,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600100#WREE00850"},{"type":"question","counter":540,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[47403\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013110600100#WREE00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to promote the use of this country to host major international sporting events; the extent to which he continues to engage with sporting organisations in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
