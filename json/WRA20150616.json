Stock assessments can only be carried out on the individual stock in each river.<\/p>  <p>  Juvenile salmon migrate from rivers to marine feeding grounds returning to their native rivers as adults. Research has shown that adult salmon from both rivers in Ireland and other counties travel through Ireland&rsquo;s coastal waters. These &ldquo;mixed stocks&rdquo;, either in coastal waters or distant waters, pose particular difficulties for management as they contain individual fish often from a wide range of rivers some of which are below sustainable reproductive capacity. <\/p>  <p>  In order to align fully with the EU Habitats Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) advice, the Irish Government closed mixed stock fisheries in 2007 including coastal and offshore fishing for salmon. This measure also had regard to the decline of almost 75% in mixed stock catches in the period 1975 to 2000. Since then the independent Standing Scientific Committee on Salmon (SSCS) advise annually on the predicted returning stocks for all of Ireland&rsquo;s 142 salmon rivers; based on this advice harvest fisheries are only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus of fish over the conservation limit. <\/p>  <p>  A conservation limit is, in its simplest form, the number of adult salmon required on each river to maintain a healthy population. Fisheries in estuaries may also be permitted where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuaries are each meeting their individual conservation limits. Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime is compliant with the Habitats Directive under which salmon is a protected species.<\/p>  <p>  The conservation\/exploitation balance is best achieved where fisheries target individual river-based stocks that have been shown to be at full reproductive capacity and capable of sustaining the genetically unique population of that individual river. Any deviation from this policy, such as the opening of drift net fisheries for salmon, would be contrary to national and international independent advice and such a move could potentially lead to conflict with EU and international obligations on grounds of not protecting vulnerable Irish and international salmon stocks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600061#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Media Mergers","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600061#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[22941\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600061#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the measures he is considering to better regulate the ownership of media in the State; if he can account for the reason, as has been reported recently, that proposals on regulation of media ownership will only apply to new acquisitions-mergers, and will not attempt to regulate or ameliorate existing concentrations of media ownership in the State, in the public interest; the conclusions of the European Commission with regard to retrospective regulation proposals and their compatibility with European Union market law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These changes were designed to deal with contemporary issues like an increasingly fragmented media, the rise of online media and an increasingly dynamic media sector. The central element of the new regime is a new public value test, involving a far more exhaustive definition of media concentration than before and which deals explicitly with cross media ownership as well as the relevant criteria by which media mergers will be examined. Guidelines explaining the legislation governing the new media mergers regulation and providing guidance on the process were published on 10 June 2015.

This points to a situation where the recruitment of glass eels and elvers remains perilously low and sustainable availability of juveniles presents a significant challenge. Stocking of elvers is a long term conservation measure with no short or even medium term benefit as regards eel fisheries. In Ireland, on average it takes up to two decades for eels to reach maturity.

It is &ldquo;of its time&rdquo; and also itself a consolidation of legislation dating back to the 1800s. While the Government are committed to modernising and updating this code, it must address a range of complex issues including improving access to fisheries, aquatic alien invasive species (plants and animals), overhauling fishery offences and bringing the penalties in line with the Fines Act, 2010, updating and modernising the current water-keeper system and clarification of ownership of fisheries. Considerable effort has been directed to this task, and I particualrly want to recognise the effort and commitment of the various Angling Federations in advancing a unified submission to my Department. An undertaking was given by my predecessor not to advance legislative provisions as regards Inland Fisheries until the angling stakeholders (the various Angling Federations) had an opportunity to meet and consider what cohesive contribution they could make in respect of to the proposed Bill. The Federations have recently finalised their views in the form of a submission and I intend to meet with them very shortly in advance of an extensive public consultation process which will involve all stakeholders.  <b><font color=\"#1F497D\"> <\/font><\/b><\/p><p>As regards the situation with eel fisheries, I am advised that the latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 2014 states that &ldquo;The status of eel remains critical and ICES advises that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to &ndash; or kept as close to &ndash; zero as possible. The annual recruitment to Europe has increased over the last 3 years from 5% to 12% of historic levels, however, recruitment is still well below the reference levels of 1960-1979, there is no change in the status of the eel as being &quot;critically endangered&rdquo;, and the overall requirement and objective remains to provide, with high probability, a long-term 40% escapement to the sea of the biomass of silver eel, relative to pristine conditions (i.e. if the stock had been completely free of man-made influences including commercial fishing).<\/p><p>A public consultation process on Ireland's eel Management Plan is currently underway as part of the 2015 review and stakeholders have the opportunity to make written submissions up to the closing date of 17 June. To assist the consultation process a number of documents have been made publically available: the activity report of the statutorily independent Standing Scientific Committee on Eels; IFI&rsquo;s three year monitoring report 2012 to 2014; and Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Regulation Report to the EU 2015.  The documents are intended to stimulate an exchange of views within the public consultation for the 2015 review during which it is expected that a range of issues will be raised and considered.<\/p><p>I intend to make the full details of the outputs of the public consultation available when this process concludes.

The post office is seen as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  Part of the strength of the post office brand, and one of its chief selling points, is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be assessed by anyone. It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s continuing support for An Post is apparent, both in terms of the cost of postage services and the value of the contract for welfare payments.  In this regard, we anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers.  This contract is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.  <\/p>  <p>  As you are aware my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr Alex White, T.D., formally launched the Post Office Network Business Development Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr Bobby Kerr in February, 2015 to explore potential commercial opportunities available to the post office network.  I look forward viewing the report from this Group.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand An Post is anxious to grow its existing levels of services in the light of emerging market pressures which extend beyond the delivery of welfare payments.  In this context I am pleased to note An Post has tendered for the provision of a new payment and transaction account.  I look forward to that becoming available in the not too distant future as it will provide alternative payment opportunities for my Department&rsquo;s customers.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to recognise the general societal trend to electronic payments the Department has been changing some of its application forms.  The option to be paid at the post office remains on the forms. <\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the amendments do not remove the option to be paid at the post office. This option still remains on the forms.  Therefore, customers are free to opt to receive their payment at the post office if they wish. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, not only in respect of social welfare payments but also in offering other financial services such as paying bills and carrying out a range of banking services.

This is equivalent to a poverty reduction effect of 63%. Ireland is the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers, higher even than the Scandinavian countries such as Denmark, Finland and Sweden. <\/p><p>Furthermore, Irish social transfers are almost twice as effective in preventing poverty as the EU average and up to three and a half times more effective than the member states worst affected by the economic crisis, such as Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain.<\/p><p>With regard to income inequality, in 2013, Irish social transfers reduced the Gini coefficient from 46 to 30, an inequality reduction effect of 35%. Ireland is the best performing EU member state, again ahead of the Scandinavian countries. <\/p><p>Social transfers in Ireland reduce income inequality by over twice the EU average and up to five times more than in the crisis countries of Italy, Greece and Cyprus.<\/p><p>Looking at the trends between 2008 and 2013, Ireland has improved the poverty reduction effect of social transfers from 54% to 63%. A similar improvement can be seen in regard to income inequality: 28% to 35%. <\/p><p>These data highlight the crucial role that Ireland&rsquo;s social protection system has played in cushioning the effect of unemployment on household incomes and acting as an automatic stabiliser during the economic and fiscal crisis. It also belies the assertion that fiscal consolidation has impacted on the most vulnerable in society.

Social Welfare Bill, &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; Bills and Bills that were at an advanced stage of drafting at the time the Standing Orders were adopted.<\/p><p>The General Scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection for pre-legislative scrutiny in July 2013 and, following consideration of these Heads of Bill, the Joint Committee issued its report on 16 January 2014.<\/p><p>A number of other Bills which I have initiated since September 2013 fall into the categories of Bills exempted under the Agreed Protocol from the requirements for pre-legislative scrutiny, for example, the Social Welfare Bills enacting amendments arising from Budgets 2014 and 2015 and the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2014 which was at an advanced stage of drafting at the time the Standing Orders came into effect. <\/p><p>The details requested by the Deputy are set out in the Table below.<\/p><p><b><i>Bills Initiated by

As Minister for Finance I can only respond in relation to the recommendations made in relation to my own Department.<\/p><p>The tribunal pointed out problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation.\u00a0 Poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis.\u00a0 This Government has undertaken a number of significant reforms since the financial crisis towards building a strengthened regulatory framework for the Irish financial services sector and to respond to the shortcomings identified.\u00a0 In 2011 the new Fitness and Probity regime was rolled out by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers.  Following on from the Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 enhances the Central Bank's regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past in Ireland and abroad.  It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.\u00a0 The Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice.  The reforms introduced under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 are complemented by a number of strategically important reforms at EU level in financial services.  Under our Presidency, agreement was reached on the single supervisory mechanism, one of the main cornerstones of Banking Union which will provide for the European Central Bank to act as supervisor for systemic important banks throughout the Union.  Agreement was also reached on the Capital Requirements package which will ensure that European banks hold enough good quality capital to withstand future economic and financial shocks.  These legislative reforms have been supplemented by a significant increase in regulatory activity by the Central Bank with a corresponding increase in staff numbers and skill levels.  The Central Bank of Ireland's Enforcement Priorities for 2015 highlight the importance of enforcement within its risk-based regulatory framework (PRISM).  PRISM represents a challenging and proportionate risk-based system of supervision for all financial institutions operating in Ireland.  The Central Bank's Strategic Plan 2013 2015 also sets out a strategy of assertive risk-based supervision underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.<\/p><p>In response to the Tribunal recommendations I considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and decided against introducing such relief.  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act 1997 and imposed new limits for donations.  Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted.  Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted.  These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.<\/p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners have provided me with the following information in relation to Revenue issues raised in the recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal.<\/p><p><b>Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners<\/b><\/p><p>Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments.

Action against it is, therefore, a priority for them, and they undertake, on an ongoing basis, an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement activities that are designed to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of fuels and to allow action to be taken against fraud.  Among the key elements of programme are the carrying out of control and compliance inspections at critical points of the fuel supply chain, and the targeting, in co-operation with other enforcement authorities, of the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of fraudulent activity.<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have also, since 2011, introduced a range of measures that have enhanced progressively the controls on the fuel supply chain, with the objective of reducing the scope for criminals to source fuels for laundering or to get laundered fuel on to the market.\u00a0 Key initiatives include the following.<\/p>  <p>  -\tThe introduction in September 2011 of a strengthened licensing regime for auto fuel traders. <\/p>  <p>  -\tThe putting in place in October 2012 of a new licensing regime for marked fuel traders.<\/p>  <p>  -\tNew requirements for the keeping by fuel traders of records of stock movements and fuel deliveries, to ensure that data are available to support supply chain analysis.<\/p>  <p>  -\tThe inception, from January 2013, of a requirement that all licensed fuel traders, make monthly electronic returns of their fuel transactions to Revenue, providing data that can be used to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions or patterns of fuel distribution and support follow-up enforcement action, where necessary.<\/p>  <p>  -\tThe introduction from the start of April 2015 of a new and more effective product for marking rebated fuels that was identified as a result of a joint process conducted with HM Revenue and Customs in the UK. The work of Revenue officers in testing fuel for the presence of the new marker will be supported by mobile equipment that will allow on the spot analysis of samples.<\/p>  <p>  I introduced the necessary legislative provisions to underpin these important initiatives, and have also put in place other measures designed to strengthen Revenue's hand in combatting fuel criminality.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that a supplier who is reckless in supplying fuel for a use connected with excise fraud will be liable for duty at the standard rate of tax, and represents a significant disincentive to such activity.  In the Finance Act 2014, I introduced measures to further strengthen Revenue's ability to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where the trader does nor comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information.  Revenue's action against fuel fraud has already yielded significant results.  In the period since 2011, 31 oil laundries have been detected and closed down, more than 3 million litres of fuel have been seized and 139 filling were closed for trading without a licence or breach of licence conditions.  In addition, industry sources report a much-reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market and increased road diesel consumption.  While other economic factors have contributed to this growth, reduced fraud is also an important contributory element.  In relation to petrol stretching, I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners have, since last summer, received reports from around the country of problems relating to petrol quality, and suggestions that these problems are attributable to petrol stretching.  Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low-tax commodity to petrol, defrauding motorists and the State.  Every filling station about which a complaint was made has been visited by Revenue officers and petrol samples taken have been sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis.  360 samples were submitted but, despite this extensive programme, evidence of the presence of prohibited stretching agents has been found in only two samples, both from one location.  The conclusive results received from those tests led to the seizure of the product.  A case is currently before the Courts in one case, and a file is being prepared with a view to prosecution in the other.  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results indicated the presence of road diesel in samples from a variety of locations.  This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time.  If the problems that have come to light were caused by unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed with petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved.  However, the Revenue Commissioners are investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems.  In any instance where the analysis of samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against alleged offenders where possible.  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are undertaking a wide-ranging and effective programme of action against all forms of fuel fraud and am assured that combatting such illegal activity will continue to be a key priority for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600069#WRJ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ireland Strategic Investment Fund Investments","counter":384,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600069#WRJ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":385,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[23270\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600069#WRJ03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the investments made through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, and the Innovation Fund Ireland\u00a0in biotechnology start-up companies since 2011; if he will project the long-term employment dividend that is expected to result from these investments; if he will provide relevant data (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. <\/p><p>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free thresholdknown as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.<\/p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.<\/p><p><b>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000,<\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<\/p><p><b>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, <\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<\/p><p><b>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, <\/b>applies in all other cases.<\/p><p>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold. In recent years these thresholds were reduced and the rate has been increased in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes in the face of falling asset prices and as part of our fiscal consolidation efforts. In addition, taxes on certain capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.<\/p><p>I am aware that property values have increased, with\u00a0developments that had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country, though not to the same extent in terms of price rises. I recognise that this has a bearing on taxation of the inheritance and gifting of property with respect to CAT thresholds. In this light, I will be keeping Capital Acquisitions Tax thresholds, rates and other aspects of the tax under review, particularly in the context of preparations for Budget 2016 and the consequent Finance Bill.<\/p><p>In regard to Deputy O'Dea's question about people with disabilities who receive properties through gift or inheritance, the position is that if such an individual is living in the property they receive then they may be able to qualify for an exemption from CAT, provided certain conditions are met. I do not currently have further plans in this area, but I would be glad to examine without prejudice any specific proposals for change that the Deputy may wish to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600071#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deposit Interest Rates","counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600071#WRL01450"},{"type":"question","counter":451,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[23741\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600071#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to reduce the rate of deposit interest retention tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":452,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is the standard practice for the Minister for Finance to review all tax expenditures and reliefs in the run up to annual Budgets.

To further achieve its objectives the framework Directive has changed the emphasis of the regulatory regime to a system which focuses on risk management. <\/p>  <p>   In my role as the Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation. The day to day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Central Bank, which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions. The Central Bank of Ireland has informed me that it has\u00a0a comprehensive and detailed plan for the implementation of the Solvency II Directive in Ireland. The structure of the Solvency II project in the Central Bank includes a Steering Committee to provide strategic oversight, a Programme Board which directs and guides the project and an Implementation team. The Steering Committee is chaired by the Deputy Governor (Financial Regulation), Cyril Roux. The Programme Board is chaired by the Director of Insurance, Sylvia Cronin. A full analysis of the requirements of Solvency II has been undertaken and a number of workstreams were established in the Central Bank to cover each area.

My function is to put in place an appropriate legislative framework for the regulation of the financial services sector. <\/p><p>The Government undoubtedly recognises that small businesses play a central role in a sustainable recovery of the Irish economy. To facilitate this, Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources and Financing Growth for SMEs is a key aspect of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015. <\/p><p>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small business, and the establishment of the State Bodies Group has also provided a forum where this issue is discussed and policy options explored.<\/p><p>The Credit Review Office (CRO) was established to assist an SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced\u00a0and who feel that they have a viable business proposition, or who feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment. The Credit Review Office initially dealt with\u00a0cases\u00a0from\u00a0Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks customers and Ulster Bank have recently announced voluntarily joined the Credit Review Office process. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. Further details are available at .<\/p><p>The following provides an overview of some other incentives introduced by Government to encourage access to credit for small business:<\/p><p>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established to encourage small business, as an additional means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient access to credit, with increased flexibility such as loans of longer duration and loans with built-in payment holidays. SBCI loans are currently available through AIB and BOI and subsequent phases will see the SBCI supporting smaller, existing bank and non-bank funding providers and bringing in new participants to the Irish market.<\/p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, was established under the Action Plan for Jobs and can provide loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices LEOs nationally to administer this fund.<\/p><p>- With over &euro;2bn of Government supports available to small business in Ireland from over 20 Departments and Agencies, it is vital that SMEs can quickly access information on this range of supports available to them. With this in mind, the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports. In the first four months after its launch, this website had over 17,000 unique visits.

Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings no longer qualifies for tax relief.\u00a0 Prior to this, income tax relief for medical insurance premiums was provided at source, at the standard rate of income tax, on the entire premium amount regardless of cost. Therefore, the State was paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums. <\/p>  <p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance increased significantly in the years leading up to Budget 2014, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and &euro;463 million in 2013. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured were estimated to have reduced by approximately 150,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover decreased on some policies.

Since conferring with the Deputy a number of weeks ago, the following has been established:<\/p>  <p>  Clare Abbey is in State ownership only as far as its outer wall, and not beyond.  The property is therefore effectively landlocked by privately owned land.  A new laneway leading to the site was developed as part of the new motorway link road and this is the sole means of public access.  This lane leads to a turning \/parking area which is part of the private land holding and which is used as a farm access to the land beyond.  Any signage in this location will require the owner's agreement; additionally, as the site for the signage lies outside the National Monument boundary, it is likely that planning permission will be required.   <\/p>  <p>  Killone Abbey is not in State ownership but is in the Guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works.  Public access to this site is therefore currently at the discretion of the owner.  Given that a private landholding is in question, the erection of a sign would need the approval of the owner.

I understand that they have forwarded the findings to the University of Limerick for consideration in the context of the study I commissioned UL to carry out, following a competitive tendering process, into the prevalence of zero-hour and low-hour contracts and their impact on employees.<\/p><p>The study has a broad scope, covering both the public and private sectors, with a particular focus on the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors.  It will fill the gap in knowledge that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy.  The study will examine how such contracts operate in practice and assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee.  It will also assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts, and consider recent developments in other jurisdictions, including the UK in particular.  The findings will enable me to make any evidence-based policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.<\/p><p>A wide range of stakeholders is being canvassed to contribute to the study, which I expect to be completed by the end of the Summer.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the study, or the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the study&rsquo;s findings.<\/p><p>Making work pay continues to be a cornerstone of this Government&rsquo;s agenda.  In this respect the Government has already introduced a number of measures to enhance workers&rsquo; rights, especially the most vulnerable workers in our society. In particular, the Government restored the cut in the national minimum wage initiated by the previous Government, thereby reaffirming that a statutory minimum wage is a statement of core values, providing a threshold of decency under which society agrees that workers&rsquo; wages should not fall. The national minimum wage in Ireland is relatively high by international standards. The most recent figures published by Eurostat show that Ireland&rsquo;s rate is the fifth highest among the 22 EU Member States that have a national minimum wage. When the cost of living is taken into account, Ireland&rsquo;s rate is the sixth highest. The Government also enacted the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012, to reinstate the Joint Labour Committee system to support wage setting in sectors where workers are poorly organised and vulnerable and wages tend to be low. <\/p><p>The establishment of a Low Pay Commission (LPC) is one of the key commitments in the Statement of Government Priorities agreed in July last year.  The National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill 2015 which provides for the establishment of the LPC on a statutory basis was published last month and is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I expect that it will be enacted by the end of next month.<\/p><p>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, which is also currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas, provides for a new statutory framework to replace the former sectoral Registered Employment Agreements (REAs).  The Bill will also <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">provide a mechanism for workers who seek to improve their terms and conditions in companies where collective bargaining is not recognised by their employer. When enacted it will ensure that such workers, aided by a trade union, can advance claims about remuneration, terms and conditions and have these determined by the Labour Court based on comparisons with similar companies. The Bill includes strong anti-victimisation protections.<\/font><\/p><p>The developments outlined above are all key elements of the dignity of work agenda which this Government is pursuing. <\/p><p>It is also worth noting that the most recent figures for youth unemployment show that the Government is succeeding in its twin track approach of creating the conditions for job growth and helping people back to work, including young people in particular.<\/p><p>For example, the under-25 age group had an unemployment rate of 20.3% at the end of 2014, down from a peak of 33% in early 2012. The absolute number of young unemployed people has fallen substantially &ndash; from close to 80,000 on average in 2009 to 47,000 on average in 2014. The most recent figures show youth unemployment down by 10,000 year-on-year to 39,000 in Q4 2014.

It is expected that the majority of those who clear administrative checks will receive a first instalment of 75% of the eligible payment for the period October to December by end of year.<\/p><p>A full breakdown of the applications received is supplied below:<table><tr><th>County <\/th><th>Submitted <\/th><th>Submitted with Commonage <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow <\/td><td>299 <\/td><td>53 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan <\/td><td>961 <\/td><td>24 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare <\/td><td>1684 <\/td><td>85 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork <\/td><td>2347 <\/td><td>327 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal <\/td><td>2043 <\/td><td>670 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin <\/td><td>66 <\/td><td>13 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway <\/td><td>3250 <\/td><td>701 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry <\/td><td>1853 <\/td><td>610 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare <\/td><td>305 <\/td><td>5 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny <\/td><td>473 <\/td><td>9 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois <\/td><td>393 <\/td><td>16 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim <\/td><td>1067 <\/td><td>141 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick <\/td><td>1130 <\/td><td>16 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford <\/td><td>536 <\/td><td>9 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth <\/td><td>160 <\/td><td>36 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo <\/td><td>2681 <\/td><td>809 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath <\/td><td>481 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan <\/td><td>611 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly <\/td><td>505 <\/td><td>1 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon <\/td><td>1585 <\/td><td>31 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo <\/td><td>978 <\/td><td>112 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary <\/td><td>1233 <\/td><td>96 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford <\/td><td>393 <\/td><td>64 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath <\/td><td>680 <\/td><td>1 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford <\/td><td>859 <\/td><td>34 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow <\/td><td>362 <\/td><td>71 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>26935 <\/td><td>3934 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600078#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Data","counter":707,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600078#WRS01400"},{"type":"question","counter":708,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[23227\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600078#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of farmers who are, at present, in the rural environment protection scheme 4; the agri-environment options schemes 1; 2; and 3; the number that left each scheme this year; the completion date for participants in each scheme if they see out their full contracts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":709,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table below:  <table><tr><th>Scheme <\/th><th>Numbers in scheme now <\/th><th>Numbers left scheme in 2015 <\/th><th>End date of scheme <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>REPS <\/td><td>845 <\/td><td>3 <\/td><td>31\/12\/15 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AEOS 1 <\/td><td>7,459 <\/td><td>1 <\/td><td>31\/12\/15 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AEOS 2 <\/td><td>5,889 <\/td><td>3 <\/td><td>31\/12\/16 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AEOS 3 <\/td><td>5,783 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>31\/12\/18 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600078#WRS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":710,"content":"<p>Question No. 361 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishery Harbour Centres","counter":711,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600078#WRS01800"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[23273\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600078#WRS01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the date that the tendering process will begin for properties in Howth Fishery Harbour in County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":713,"content":"<p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that two properties at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre were made available by competitive public tender yesterday, 15<sup>th<\/sup>June.

On 20 April, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Justice &amp;amp; Equality attended a joint meeting of EU Foreign Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs Councils in Luxembourg.  At that meeting, the Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Commissioner presented a 10 point plan of immediate action to be taken in response to the crisis situation in the Mediterranean.  The key focus of the plan is on preventing loss of life. <\/p><p>On 23 April the Taoiseach attended a special meeting of the European Council at which the <i>10-point action plan was considered. <\/i>A comprehensive range of commitments were agreed, including at least tripling financial resources for Operations Triton and Poseidon, thereby enabling an increase in the search and rescue possibilities within the mandate of FRONTEX.  EU leaders also committed to actions to prevent illegal migration flows, to reinforce internal EU solidarity and responsibility in relation to the processing of asylum applications and relocation of migrants, and to combat traffickers in accordance with international law.  As part of the Comprehensive plan, the Council invited High Representative Mogherini to begin preparations for a possible CSDP mission. <\/p><p>Subsequently, at the formal Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council with Ministers of Defence in Brussels on 18 May, a Council Decision to establish a European Union military operation, EUNAVFOR Med, in the South Central Mediterranean was adopted.\u00a0 The Mission&rsquo;s mandate will be implemented in sequential phases.  The first phase of the operation will support the detection and monitoring of migration networks through information gathering and patrolling in accordance with international law.  A second phase, involving the targeting, seizure and possible destruction of the vessels and assets of human traffickers will only begin once appropriate UN Security Council authorisation is in place. The third phase is an operational\/disruption phase, and the fourth and final phase is a mission withdrawal and completion phase. <\/p><p>While our focus remains on the humanitarian search and rescue mission to which we have deployed L.&Eacute;. Eithne, Ireland is fully supportive of the first phase of the CSDP operation which is being carried out in full accordance with international law.  In relation to further phases of the CSDP operation, we believe that many elements of the proposed action will require a UN Security Council Resolution.  The Permanent Defence Force will not be participating in the mission in the absence of such a resolution. Ireland continues to support the actions of the Union to address the major challenge of migration in the Mediterranean.

The Civil Defence Board was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished. The then Minister for Defence appointed a 14 person interim Board as a temporary measure in 2011 and in this context none of the positions were advertised. Legislation to dissolve the Board was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012. Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence. <\/p>  <p>  There were no appointments to the Board of Coiste an Asgard from 2009. In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. The formal wind up of the Company including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office was completed in early 2013. <\/p>  <p>  The only body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board. The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act 1927. The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members. The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the non-military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  There have been three appointments to the Army Pensions Board since March 2011. Commandant Adam Lagun was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011. This position became vacant in October 2014 due his deployment overseas. On the recommendation of the Chief of Staff a temporary appointment to the Board was made to cover the absence period of October 2014 to May 2015. Commandant Lagun resumed as Ordinary member of the Board in June 2015. As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, the positions were not publicly advertised on either occasion. Details of these appointments to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on 13 January 2012 and 4 November 2014 respectively. <\/p>  <p>A civilian doctor was appointed as ordinary member of the Army Pensions Board in November 2013. The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website.

The objective is to support the necessary changes to ensure the Department provides strategic oversight and added value to its agencies.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that the Review Group envisaged a two year timescale for the full implementation of its recommendations and that will certainly be achieved although the work of embedding and sustaining the changes will continue.  It should also be remembered that a number of recommendations reflect changes being made across the civil service under the Civil Service Renewal Plan which my Department is also committed to implementing.  Having said that, since the report was published last July, all the short term recommendations in the report have been implemented addressing issues such as the purpose, functions and procedures relating to the Management Board (MB) meetings have been restructured in line with the recommendations in the Report; the format and structure of my regular meetings with the Management Board, which are also attended by the Ministers of State, have also been formalised; the membership of the Department's Management Board has been extended to include the Director of the Probation Service and two Principal Officers to ensure broader coverage of the Department and its agencies.  External assistance has been procured to support the Board with the changes underway. The new Deputy Secretary post which was recommended in the report has been filled following an open competition conducted by TLAC. There have also been a number of appointments and changes made at senior management level following TLAC competitions. A Corporate Secretariat Office has been established and a Head of Communications and a Chief Information Officer have been appointed to improve managerial support, internal and external communications and work with the Government's Office of the Chief Information Officers to develop the Department's information capacity. Following a Round table consultation meeting with Heads of Agencies, two new groups have now been established to improve coherence, communications and governance across the sector. The first meetings of these groups (Criminal Justice Strategic Group and the Justice and Equality Leadership network) have taken place and work programmes are being developed. Formal annual Performance Agreements have been signed off with a number of agencies and are being monitored regularly - this process is continuing with the aim of formalising and strengthening governance arrangements and two-way dialogue with agencies. A new Strategy Statement for my Department covering the period 2015-2017 was published in April and an Annual Strategic Business Plan has been put in place to set out clearly the strategic objectives and priorities of the Department against which progress can be measured. Twice yearly progress reports will be published on my Department's website. A new more user friendly website has been developed and launched recently. This provides routine access to all replies to Parliamentary Questions as published in the Oireachtas Official Report as well as access to the Department&rsquo;s Twitter feed. The Principal Officer cohort in the Department has established a network aimed at contributing to improving the overall coherence and efficiency of the Department's management and leadership. Measures to ensure that staff are kept informed and consulted on the process include a series of 6 town hall meetings and regular communications through the Department's internal portal. A staff survey has also been conducted with a view to establishing a baseline measurement for staff engagement and informing the change process. Work has also commenced on developing new Human Resources and Learning and Development Strategies.<\/p>  <p>  The more long term recommendations around culture, leadership and management processes are also being addressed. A series of focus groups are scheduled to take place with staff over June and July to engage on the Department's future organisational culture.  The Department has engaged international expertise to assist in the cultural change project which emphasises the need for a bottom up, organisation-wide approach to this change. <\/p>  <p>  Another stream of the change programme includes the establishment of the Policing Authority as part of the comprehensive reforms relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This work, which is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform, has largely been achieved, including opening up recruitment to international competition for the posts of Garda Commissioner and Deputy Garda Commissioner; expanding the powers and remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; and enacting the new whistleblower protection.  As the Deputy is aware, the legislation relating to the Policing Authority has started its passage through the Oireachtas and it is envisaged that the membership of the Authority and the CEO position will be publicly advertised shortly.  <\/p>  <p>  The cost of the Report of the Independent Group was &euro;36,000.

The following tables set out the waiting times for civil cases in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.<table><tr><th>High Court <\/th><th>Waiting time<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Asylum<\/td><td>4 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chancery Actions<\/td><td>4 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chancery Special Summonses<\/td><td>3 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Commercial List<\/td><td>1 week to 4 months depending on duration<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Family Law<\/td><td>4 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Garda Comp <\/td><td>4 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Hague Luxembourg Convention<\/td><td>6 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jury List <\/td><td>4 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Judicial Review<\/td><td>4 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Non Jury (including Circuit Court appeals) <\/td><td>6 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork Personal Injury List<\/td><td>23 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin Personal Injury List<\/td><td>4 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dundalk Personal Injuries  <\/td><td>5 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway Personal Injuries  <\/td><td>4 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny \/ Waterford Personal Injuries<\/td><td>9 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick Personal Injuries<\/td><td>7 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo Personal Injuries  <\/td><td>5 months<\/td><\/tr><\/table><table><tr><th>Court of Appeal<\/th><th>Waiting Times <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>New Appeals<\/td><td>8 &ndash; 9 months from date of lodgement on notice to appeal to hearing <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Transferred Appeals<\/td><td>8 -9 months from application to  Direction List <\/td><\/tr><\/table><table><tr><th>Supreme Court <\/th><th>Waiting Times<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>New Appeals <\/td><td>See below<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Priority Legacy Appeals<\/td><td>12 months<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Legacy Appeals<\/td><td>54 months<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>With regard to the Court of Appeal, I am informed that every new appeal appears in a Directions List usually within 4 weeks, for appeals categorised under the provisions of Order 86A Rule 7 of the Rules of the Superior Courts as expedited appeal and within 7 weeks for all other appeals.  Two such Direction Lists are held each week, one for appeals categorised as expedited appeals and one for all other appeals and hearing dates are allocated for the first available date having regard to the time required for the hearing.  I am informed that appeals requiring a priority hearing, for example Article 40 (habeas corpus), bail, extradition and Hague Convention cases will be accommodated at short notice and by scheduling additional sittings if necessary.  <\/p><p>In relation to appeals transferred to the Court of Appeal from the Supreme Court, over 1,350 such cases exist and I am informed that they are managed by way of parallel listing system in the Directions List.  The court has been proactive in listing over 150 transferred appeals for directions and allocating hearing dates and will in due course list further tranches of transferred cases.  In the meantime any party to a transferred appeal may apply for directions by way of the procedures set out in a Practice Direction issued by the President of the Court of Appeal and any such application will be included in the weekly Directions List and a hearing date allocated usually within 8 to 9 months of the directions hearing.<\/p><p>The Supreme Court's list is in transition and it is managing a legacy appeal caseload together with applications under Article 64 of the Constitution (transferred appeals) and applications for leave to appeal under the new Constitutional jurisdictions.  In relation to new appeals, leave to appeal has been granted in a small number of cases since the establishment of the Court of Appeal.  It is proposed to deal with these cases as expeditiously as possible.  In respect of priority legacy appeals and other legacy appeals, I am informed that the historic average waiting period has been 12 months and 54 months respectively but it is anticipated at this point that the legacy appeal caseload will have been disposed of by mid 2016 subject to the level of new business that is filed with the Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600083#WRX00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court of Appeal Establishment","counter":901,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600083#WRX00950"},{"type":"question","counter":902,"qnumday":427,"qnumall":"[23010\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600083#WRX01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the full capital cost of establishing the Civil Court of Appeal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":903,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service.

While the persons recommended could not be appointed to the IHREC in advance of the required legislation being enacted and commenced, the Government appointed fourteen individuals as members of the Human Rights Commission and subsequently they were appointed as members of the IHREC when the legislation was enacted, on a three-year and five-year basis to ensure that the terms of office of all members of the new Commission will not come to an end at the same time so as to preserve institutional continuity.<\/p><p>On 31 May, 2013, my predecessor Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D. appointed twelve of their number to the Board of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended, on an interim basis of three years, but which expired when the Bill to establish the IHREC was enacted and commenced and the two Bodies were dissolved.<\/p><p>Ms Emily Logan was nominated by PAS as Chief Commissioner of the IHREC and at a Government meeting on 18 July 2014  Ms Logan was appointed on an interim basis as President of the Human Rights Commission pursuant to section 5 of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000. She was also appointed as Chair of the Equality Authority pursuant to section 41 and 42 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.<\/p><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 which passed both Houses of the Oireachtas was signed by the President on 27 July 2014.

The implementation of the Report at this remove, and the introduction of any legislation to enable the type of collective legal action envisaged would, therefore, remain matters for the Government and the Oireachtas who would have to be convinced of their merits and impacts in the public interest - including in terms of the sustainability of a collective action regime and its potential costs to the parties concerned and to the Exchequer.  These are also issues which would require the inputs of several Government Departments impacting as they do on areas of law such as those of consumer protection, competition, the environment and the provision of financial and other services.  Consideration would also have to be given to the relevant intervening developments that have taken place at the national, European Union and wider international levels.

The author of this appendix acknowledged that its conclusions remained a matter of conjecture until such time as a more forensic examination of the home&rsquo;s records could be undertaken by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  As these matters were outside the direct remit of the McAleese Committee, the HSE subsequently advised that these wider concerns would be examined separately by the HSE.  At that time my Department advised the HSE that any validated findings of concern from this separate process should be appropriately communicated by the HSE.  I can confirm that my Department is not aware of any such subsequent report by the HSE. As these issues are now within the remit of the Child and Family Agency, I will ask the Agency to reply directly to the Deputy and request that I am sent a copy of this reply.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs became actively involved in responding to the concerns relating to Mother and Baby Homes following the publication of information on the former Bon Secours Home in Tuam around mid-2014. The Inter Departmental Review Group was set up by my predecessor to assist Government in its deliberations on the terms of reference of a Commission of Investigation and to map the important dimensions of the issues in the short time available. The more extensive process of assembling and investigating all relevant records now forms a very significant part of the Commission&rsquo;s work. The Group's Report cites a range of academic research and published social histories which explore matters related to Mother and Baby Homes and demonstrates that concerns in relation to the role and purpose of these institutions have been the subject of attention, report and debate since their establishment in the early years of the State.<\/p>  <p>  This work culminated in the establishment of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters in February 2015. Using its extensive legal powers, this Commission is now examining matters within its comprehensive terms of reference to ensure that what happened to vulnerable women and children in Mother and Baby Homes is fully examined. Its findings will be published.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, together with the terms of reference set out in S.I. No. 57 of 2015, provides this Commission with all necessary powers to comprehensively examine the broad range of public concerns that have been expressed in relation to mother and baby homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600090#WREE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Funding","counter":1148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600090#WREE02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1149,"qnumday":528,"qnumall":"[23914\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600090#WREE02800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will confirm that Tusla-Child and Family Agency has cut its funding to the Rape Crisis Network of Ireland;

These services were previously funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE).<\/p>  <p>  Sexual violence services are being developed by Tusla, as a national specialist service, so as to enable better outcomes for both children and adults who are survivors of sexual violence.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has undertaken a comprehensive review of sexual violence and domestic violence services. The purpose was to identify strategic priorities and set out a roadmap for the delivery of these services.  Tusla considers that there is scope for a more co-ordinated and more equitable provision of these services across the country.  In reviewing the make up of current services, it is seeking to address any identified gaps in services, to avoid duplication and to support effective delivery of frontline services nationally.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has appointed a national manager to ensure a single line of accountability for all resources in this important area.  Tusla is currently in the process of recruiting eight additional staff for domestic, sexual and gender based violence services.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has commenced an external consultancy process to assist with developing key components of models of domestic and sexual violence service provision.  This does not involve an evaluation of current service providers, but there will be outputs from this process, including a report for internal Tusla for planning and implementation purposes. <\/p>  <p>I requested that Tusla give particular priority to protecting frontline services, and in that context, funding for the 16 Rape Crisis Centres nationwide which provide services directly to rape survivors has been protected in 2015. Almost &euro;4.0m in funding is dedicated to Rape Crisis Centres in 2015, with funding maintained at 2014 levels. I can confirm that no Rape Crisis Centres are to be closed.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that it informed RCNI of it's decision to withdraw funding at a meeting last December.  I subsequently became aware of this decision in January of this year and had ongoing discussions with Tusla in relation to its budgetary plans for 2015 including its decision to withdraw funding from RCNI.<\/p>  <p>  The specific funding provided for RCNI by Tusla was to develop and maintain a database of information recorded by workers in Rape Crisis Centres. Tusla had concerns that this database did not capture information from all 16 Rape Crisis Centres as only 11 centres are affiliated with the Network.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla did not always have timely access to the data collected, which is essential to support the delivery of high quality services across both the domestic violence and sexual violence services sector.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, Tusla has taken the decision to put in place a comprehensive data system that best meets the current and future data needs of a developing service.  In order to plan properly for the future, Tusla needs access to complete and reliable information.<\/p>  <p>  As part of revised governance arrangements, funded sexual violence services will provide information directly to Tusla, creating, for the first time, a comprehensive dataset on all such services funded by the Agency. This information is critically important as Tusla continues to reform services to ensure that we provide the best possible response to survivors of sexual violence.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla's own analysis indicates that there is sufficient service provision with regard to Council of Europe guidelines and Tusla is currently looking at access to these services arising from population distribution.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, Tusla will spend approximately &euro;19m on these services. The information sought by the Deputy in relation to a breakdown of funding by constituency has been requested from the Child and Family Agency and I will respond directly to the Deputy when the information is received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600090#WREE03600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":1160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600091#WRFF00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services","counter":1159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600091#WRFF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1160,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[23310\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600091#WRFF00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is aware of the Amnesty International report on the criminalisation of abortion here (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1161,"content":"<p>I am aware of this report and have been considering its findings.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware article 40.3.3 of the Constitution states: 'The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.'<\/p><p>The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was signed into law by the President on 30 July 2013 and it was commenced on 1 January 2014.

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website -  - and also by phone.  The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.  The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883\/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State. <\/p><p>The healthcare being sought under the CBD can only be healthcare that a person would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation.  Referral for care under the CBD can be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians.  It will be a matter for the patient and his\/her referring doctor to identify the clinician abroad and satisfy him\/herself in relation to the qualifications, quality and safety of the services being availed of in the other jurisdiction. <\/p><p>Prior authorisation may be required from the HSE for certain healthcare.  This requires completion of an application process; consequently patients intending to access care under the CBD should check with the HSE in advance of travelling.  The costs must be borne by the individual and he\/she then will seek reimbursement for the cost of the healthcare upon return to Ireland.  The HSE will reimburse the patient for care which meets the terms of the CBD in line with the Directive.  Costs will only be reimbursed up to the level that would have been arisen if the healthcare had been provided in Ireland or the actual cost of the healthcare in the other member state, whichever is the lesser.  All other costs associated with accessing care abroad under the CBD are a matter for the patient and will not be reimbursable by the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600093#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600093#WRHH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1238,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[23182\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600093#WRHH01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure that units (details supplied) at Connolly Hospital in Dublin 15 will remain open, and that existing places for residents will remain secure, until the new unit is open.","asker":"1195","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1239,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

In our statement of Health priorities for 2015, the Minister for Health and I have reiterated our commitment to implementing the Strategy.<\/p><p>The National Positive Aging Strategy provides a vision for an age-friendly society and includes four National Goals and underpinning Objectives to provide direction on the issues that need to be addressed to promote positive aging. As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I am driving implementation at the political level. The Strategy is a cross-Departmental one and my Department has an overall coordinating and collating role and a more direct role for the health-related objectives.<\/p><p>A key objective of this Strategy is to change the mindsets of decision makers across Government agencies and to raise the priority that is given to the concerns of older people. The first step in doing this is to establish a system of regular reporting on actions and initiatives that impact on older people, and these reports are regularly sought and collated by my Department. The fact that such reports are already and will continue to be required will in itself increase the focus that is given to older persons' issues, and these reports will be submitted for consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Sector Reform chaired by An Taoiseach.  Implementation is accordingly an ongoing process.<\/p><p>It is important to point out the many initiatives already in train which contribute to the Strategy's goals. For example, in the health sector, in the area of older people&rsquo;s services and supports, the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will be completed shortly. The Single Assessment Tool, which will allow for a systematic assessment of need and allocation of services to older people, is being developed by the HSE; measures are being taken to ensure integrated care for older patients, and palliative care services are being improved. The Deputy will also be aware that &euro;25m<b><\/b>was allocated in Budget 2015 to support services that provide alternatives to, and relieve pressures on acute hospitals.  In April 2015, an additional &euro;74m was allocated to further tackle the ongoing issue of delayed discharges in acute hospitals. The majority of these patients are older people, and these funds are being applied across both long term and short term residential services and at community level.  As a result the waiting time for funding of approved patients under the Nursing Home Support scheme has fallen to four weeks now from eleven weeks in March.<\/p><p>A Healthy and Positive Aging  Initiative (HaPAI) has also been established to implement the research objective of the National Positive Aging Strategy. It is a joint initiative between the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Well-being Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies and will run from October 2014 to December 2017, with a commitment to Department of Health funding for a further two years. The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and well-being linked to the Goals and Objectives of the Positive Aging Strategy. This will be done primarily through the development of positive aging indicators to be published every two years. A preliminary positive aging report will be published shortly.  The HSE will also develop a physical activity communications campaign under the Initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600095#WRKK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Data","counter":1329,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600095#WRKK01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1330,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[23319\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600095#WRKK02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons seeking placement approval under the fair deal scheme in counties Longford and Westmeath; the average duration of wait; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. <\/p>  <p>  Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions.  International studies and scientific assessments suggest that the best way to prevent most disease due to human papillomavirus (HPV) is to vaccinate as many girls and women as possible.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from NIAC which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  <\/p>  <p>  Gardasil vaccine has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006.  It was first introduced into the national immunisation programme in Ireland in 2010 and it is estimated that over 55 million girls and women have been vaccinated worldwide since it was first authorised.<\/p>  <p>  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  The most recent EU review of cumulative global safety update data completed in December 2014 concluded that the benefit\/risk profile for Gardasil remains positive and concluded that no updates to the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) were considered necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Up to the 31\/05\/2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 861 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions in association with Gardasil.  National monitoring experience has been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects known to occur with the vaccine, as outlined in the approved product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) for Gardasil.  The majority of the reports received to date involved events\/reactions related to injection site reactions, malaise, headache, myalgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and skin reactions.  Vaccination related events such as dizziness and syncope (fainting) was also reported and would not be unexpected in this patient population.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA published updates relating to national monitoring experience on its website during the first year of the HPV schools immunisation programme, with additional updates on national monitoring experience included in several editions of its Drug Safety Newsletter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600099#WROO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600099#WROO00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1466,"qnumday":644,"qnumall":"[23786\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600099#WROO00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to conduct a review of services for transgender people, with a view to increasing provision to meet demand, increase locations, and reduce costs for persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1197","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1467,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

As is often the case in these matters, however, it has not proved possible to establish the full facts in every instance.  The promotion and protection of human rights is a core principle of Ireland's foreign policy and we have prioritised the protection of trades unionists, human rights defenders and others who are in immediate danger. I remain concerned at reports of violence against civil society leaders in Colombia, including trades unionists and others.<\/p>  <p>  Human rights in Colombia, and in particular the slow pace in the decrease of impunity, are a major concern for the EU and for Ireland and are addressed in detail in the context of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue.  Through this mechanism, which addresses the subject directly with the Colombian authorities at official level, the Union engages in a structured manner across the full range of human rights issues, including as regards human rights defenders and trade unionists, prisoners, land restitution, environmental issues, and economic crimes.  I believe that this policy of engagement, dialogue and scrutiny, which is ongoing, regular and structured, is the best way to promote human rights and the interests of labour in Colombia.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, Colombia is facing a significant challenge in overcoming decades of violence, and he will be aware of the peace talks in Havana between the government and the main guerrilla organisation. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia has pointed out that an end to the longstanding armed conflict has the potential to transform Colombia in terms of its level of respect for and enjoyment of human rights. As I noted at the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 April, the peace process in Colombia is potentially one of the most significant advances in conflict resolution the region has seen and we strongly support it.<\/p>  <p>  Our Embassy at Mexico City is accredited to Bogot&aacute; on a non-residential basis.  Officers of the Embassy regularly discuss human rights issues, including some of those mentioned by the Deputy, with government interlocutors during their visits to Colombia and meet with international and local civil society organisations working on human rights issues there, including on labour and environmental rights. The Embassy oversees Irish Aid funding which supports civil society organisations in Colombia, with a focus on the protection of human rights defenders and raising awareness of violations. In addition, Irish Aid provides funding to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, focused on their work in support of human rights in south-west Colombia.<\/p>  <p>  The EU-Colombia\/Peru Free Trade Agreement, in addition to the emphasis it places on human rights, includes a mechanism for oversight and monitoring of the implementation of labour laws involving the active participation by civil society actors, and establishes an obligation of transparency and public accountability regarding initiatives that could have consequences for labour and\/or the environment. This process is overseen by a Trade Committee which will review the implementation of all aspects of the Agreement, including labour, environmental, and trade issues in regular meetings. A meeting of the Committee will take place later this month. Ireland will be represented at the meeting and this will allow us to hear directly the views of Colombia civil society organisations and experts about the implementation of the Free Trade Agreement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600101#WRQQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":1531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600101#WRQQ00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1532,"qnumday":668,"qnumall":"[23046\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600101#WRQQ00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on all public and private, official and unofficial engagements and meetings with a person (details supplied), and with senior executives within the person's media companies here; and the outcome of such meetings.","asker":"1186","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1533,"content":"<p>As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade I have not met with the named individual nor have I met with senior executives of his media companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600101#WRQQ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications","counter":1534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600101#WRQQ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1535,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[23164\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600101#WRQQ00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 130 of 17 June 2014, if the application process is now completed in view of the conclusion of the naturalisation process in respect of the person concerned (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Additionally at this time of year approximately 250 customers are seen daily by appointment at our public counters in Dublin and Cork and receive a turnaround service of between one and 10 days as appropriate. This high level of service delivery has been achieved in no small part due to the dedication of the staff in our passport offices in Dublin, Balbriggan and Cork.  In line with the wider public service reform programme, the passport service actively pursues opportunities to improve customer service with reduced staff numbers through an effective combination of internal and external service delivery initiatives. Additionally, to cope with the seasonal demand the passport service recruited 160 additional temporary staff, most taken from the live register.  I am aware that problems have arisen for certain callers seeking to reach us by phone. I regret these difficulties and we are currently exploring ways in which this can be resolved while maintaining overall service levels and application processing times.  I would advise applicants that our online tracker service which is updated a number of times a day is the best way of getting the most up to date progress report on an application. The passport service provides advice and answers queries via social media to over 3000 twitter followers.  Additionally the Department&rsquo;s website is an easy way of getting answers to the most frequently asked passport queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600101#WRQQ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":1546,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600101#WRQQ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1547,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[23200\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600101#WRQQ01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has raised the use of excessive police force against young persons and minority groups (details supplied) in McKinney, Dallas, Texas, United States of America, with the authorities in the United States of America; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1548,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question refers to a recent incident widely reported in the media that took place on Friday 5<sup><\/sup>June in McKinney, Texas.

My Department has not incurred expenditure on external public relations services since my entry into office in July 2014.  The expenditure in question has rather arisen in the context of specific initiatives under Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme for which we have from time to time commissioned companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management.  DHR Communications has been contracted to manage and administer grants to journalists reporting on international development issues under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and to manage and administer annual Africa Day celebrations.  The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year and managing the SCMF student competition. This typically involves the following activities: Convening national and regional information workshops; Managing and administering the application process; Organising the judging process; Providing detailed feedback to all applicants; Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records; Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.  <\/p><p>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund. This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.  DHR was awarded a new two-year contract in April 2015 following a competitive tendering process.<\/p><p>Following a further competitive tendering process, DHR was also engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day 2015 flagship event in Dublin. Like annual Africa Day events held over successive years, this incorporated musical entertainment and cultural activities aimed principally at family audiences. DHR&rsquo;s role involved the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which they managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website. This work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.<\/p><p>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed below.

The conflict in Ukraine was among a number of important foreign policy issues which was discussed. In their summit declaration, G7 leaders expressed full support for the efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict within the framework of the Normandy format and the OSCE Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine.  They called on all sides to fully implement the ceasefire and withdraw all heavy weapons from the contact line.      On economic sanctions against Russia, the G7 agreed that the duration of existing restrictive measures should be clearly linked to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements.

Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, contain relevant evidence that clearly demonstrates that person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue to him\/her. The child in question was born in the State in 2013 to parents who are non-EU nationals.  His entitlement to Irish citizenship is, therefore, subject to Section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended (the Act).<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>This provides that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>person&rsquo;s birth.  It should be noted that periods of authorised residence in the State for study are excluded under the Act for the purposes of section 6A.<\/p><p>In line with guidelines provided by the Department of Justice and Equality (D\/JE), which is responsible for immigration and citizenship, the proofs of lawful residence of a non-EU parent, which are accepted and considered by this Department for the purposes of passport applications are immigration stamps in passports or the registration cards\/books, which are given to persons registering with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  <\/p><p>A passport application for this child was received by the Department on 5 March, 2014.  However, it could not be finalised for passport issue because the duration of his mother&rsquo;s lawful residence was insufficient to demonstrate his entitlement to Irish citizenship under section 6A of the Act. <\/p><p>This decision was reached on the basis of submitted evidence of the mother&rsquo;s lawful residence, which included the immigration stamps on her passport and her registration card.<\/p><p>The Department wrote to the applicant&rsquo;s mother on 19 May, 2014 to inform her of this. This included a request for any correspondence, which she may have received from the D\/JE that granted her right to reside in the State.  (This letter would have enabled her to subsequently obtain the relevant immigration stamps from GNIB for her passport.) <\/p><p>This evidence is crucial to the Department&rsquo;s assessment of her child&rsquo;s passport application.  The calculation of residence for the purposes section 6A of the Act is strictly based on the validity period of an immigration stamp and\/or registration card.  However, as a letter from the D\/JE would normally predate the validity date of a stamp\/card, the calculation of the reckonable residence can be extended back to the date of that letter &ndash; thus rendering more residence to the parent.  <\/p><p>If such evidence exists, it has not yet been submitted to the Department for consideration.<\/p><p>The submitted application is now out of date and has been cancelled.  A new application should be submitted with the any additional original evidence plus any correspondence from the D\/JE in regard to the granting of residence to the child&rsquo;s mother.<\/p><p>If this is not feasible, the parents may wish to apply to have their child naturalised.  To do this, they will need to contact the D\/JE.  In the event that an application is successful, a certificate of naturalisation would be issued to the child.  This certificate would be sufficient evidence to demonstrate his Irish citizenship for any future passport application.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600102#WRRR02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":1604,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600103#WRSS00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":1603,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600103#WRSS00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1604,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[23085\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600103#WRSS00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on a matter (details supplied) regarding examination support for the leaving certificate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1605,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. <\/p><p>In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600103#WRSS00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":1606,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600103#WRSS00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1607,"qnumday":694,"qnumall":"[23381\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600103#WRSS00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide an update on the European Social Fund, targeted at poverty; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1608,"content":"<p>The Irish European Social Fund Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020 contains a total budget of &euro;1.153 billion.

This is addressed in schools through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in PE. <\/p><p>  My Department collates data from schools on a range of issues relating to healthy eating and physical activity through the 'Lifeskills' survey of all primary and post primary schools.  This survey first issued in 2009 and was repeated in 2012.  The findings from the 2012 survey were published by my Department last year and are available on www.education.ie.  The 2015 Lifeskills survey is currently being completed by primary and post primary schools.  It is my intention to publish the results of this survey before the end of 2015.  This will provide a benchmark for schools' performance in this area since 2009 and 2012. <\/p><p>  One of the specific issues addressed through the Lifeskills survey is whether schools have a healthy eating policy in place.  The data from schools indicated that almost all primary schools and the majority of post primary schools have a healthy eating policy in place or are in the process of developing one.<\/p><p>  The survey also asks schools whether there is a facility on site, such as a vending machine or school shop, for selling less healthy foods.  The data from the 2012 survey indicated that approximately 30% of post primary schools had a vending machine that contained less healthy alternatives.  There were no such facilities reported in respondent primary schools.  In response to such findings, my Department has finalised guidance for schools about how to further promote healthy lifestyles.  This encompasses measures to promote healthy eating, healthy vending, as well as the promotion of P.E. and Physical Activity.

These were issues that were central to the recommendations made in the Moriarty Tribunal Report which was published in March 2011.  The Tribunal recommended that the income of political parties be disclosed and that political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be reported. <\/p>  <p>  The 2012 Act brought into force restrictions on corporate donations and considerable reductions in the maximum amount that a political party or an individual can accept as a political donation.  The donation limit for a political party was reduced from &euro;6,348.69 to &euro;2,500, while for an individual politician or candidate it fell from &euro;2,539.48 to &euro;1,000.  A limit of &euro;200 was placed on donations in cash.  The threshold for the receipt of anonymous donations was reduced to &euro;100.  The donation threshold amount that gives rise to the requirement to open a political donations account was reduced to &euro;100.  Anonymous indirect donations were banned.  The threshold at which political party donations must be reported and published was reduced from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500.<\/p>  <p>  The 2012 Act provides that political parties are required to submit audited annual accounts to the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) for publication.  In line with SIPO guidelines, which came into effect on 1 January 2015, the first set of accounts required to be audited will be in respect of 2015 and must be submitted to SIPO by mid 2016.  This requirement goes beyond the Moriarty Tribunal recommendation by providing that both the income and expenditure of political parties will be reported and open to public scrutiny.

Furthermore, in October 2014, the European Council endorsed a binding EU target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and specified that the target will be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, with the reductions in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the non-ETS sector amounting to 43% and 30% by 2030 compared to 2005, respectively.

Last week, I launched a six week consultation on the development of the National Mitigation Plan and I look forward to receiving input from all interested parties on how we might address the specific challenges ahead and harness the opportunities that arise as Ireland moves towards a low-carbon sustainable economic future.

A range of measures are being taken to support increased housing delivery.  In particular, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015 , which was published on 5 June, is primarily focused on addressing housing supply-related issues with a view to facilitating increased activity in the housing construction sector.

Having regard to the definition of &ldquo;vacant site&rdquo; in the Bill as published, it is proposed that the levy will be applied from 1 January 2019 onwards to vacant sites exceeding 0.1 hectares in area which are located in designated areas identified by a planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.

Given the links between these unlawful activities to organised criminality, the Irish Revenue Commissioners are fully supported in this area by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>Fuel laundering continues to be a serious concern for authorities in both Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Recognising this shared concern a Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, comprising representatives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue Customs, the UK National Crime Agency, the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau has been established to target these activities on an all island basis.  Arising from the work of this Task Force, a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels, operating in both jurisdictions, have been identified and are being specifically targeted for investigation by all law enforcement agencies concerned. <\/p><p>My Department assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent authorities under waste legislation, which is to take the necessary measures, on behalf of the State ,to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by the diesel launderers is disposed of without endangering human or animal health and without harming the environment, in particular without risk to water. <\/p><p>Approximately 1,400 incidents of diesel laundering waste dumping have been dealt with by local authorities to date and my Department has financed the substantial costs associated with such disposal.  The overwhelming majority of the clean-up operations have taken place in counties along the Northern Ireland Border.

Under the European Union (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations.  The maximum allowable value for lead is 10 microgrammes per litre, which came into effect on 25 December 2013. <\/p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with the Drinking Water Regulations.  In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier is required to investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive (HSE), to ensure that the appropriate remedial actions are taken, including the issue of notifications to consumers affected or restriction of the supply.  A case by case approach will be considered by Irish Water, in line with its statutory responsibilities and in recognition of the statutory responsibilities of the HSE and the EPA.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water has informed my Department that, having over recent months replaced the approximate 2 kilometres of water-mains which contained lead, no part of its estimated 60,000 kilometres of distribution system now contains lead.  As part of its metering programme, Irish Water has identified significant numbers of lead service connections between the public mains and the customer stopcock and water meter.  Irish Water is committed to replacing these over time.  The data being collected by Irish Water is being provided to the HSE for assessment and a rolling programme of advising relevant customers who are at risk of having lead pipework has commenced.  If a property owner replaces the lead pipework on their property, Irish Water will also replace the pipework between the watermain and the property boundary. <\/p>  <p>  The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system. Responsibility for replacing lead pipes from the property boundary to the house and within the house therefore rests with the homeowner.  In a joint position paper on lead published by the EPA and HSE in 2013, it is recommended that all lead pipes and plumbing in public and private ownership should be replaced over time. <\/p>  <p>  Last week I announced a National Strategy to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water which has been approved by the Government.  The Strategy was prepared by my Department and the Department of Health in consultation with Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA.  As part of the Strategy I will be establishing a new grant scheme to assist low income households to replace lead pipes in their home.  Funding for the scheme will be finalised in the context of Budget 2016.  It is envisaged that the grant scheme will be administered by local authorities and that the available resources will be prioritised to areas of highest risk.  The terms and conditions of the scheme will be publicised as soon as they are finalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600108#WRXX02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unfinished Housing Developments","counter":1829,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600108#WRXX02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1830,"qnumday":769,"qnumall":"[23367\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600108#WRXX02400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will confirm the person or body responsible for the Ard Dealgan complex in Dundalk in County Louth; the person or body who has taken over the debt associated with the complex; if he is aware that Louth County Council has cited difficulties in ascertaining who is currently responsible for its current issues, despite having served a derelict site notice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

For the purposes of the new programme, there are 28 sub-regional areas in Ireland and 45 separate expressions of interest were received.  A single expression of interest has been received in 17 of the 28 areas and at least 2 expressions of interest have been received in the remaining 11 areas.  In areas where multiple expressions of interest were received, my Department has given an undertaking to facilitate discussions between the relevant entities with a view to engaging all parties and if possible to reach an agreement to develop one coherent local development strategy for their area.  In this regard, my Department commenced meetings recently with a range of entities and these will continue over the coming period.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, I expect that all the expressions of interest will be presented to an Independent Evaluation Committee for assessment and decision by late June.

The haulage industry is seeking a reduction in motor tax for the sector, a change in the basis of taxation from unladen to gross design vehicle weight and the introduction of road user charging.  In relation to the latter two proposals, these are currently being considered and implementation, if recommended, would be for the medium to long-term.  In relation to the first proposal, any changes to rates of motor tax are for consideration in the context of the budget.  Motor tax is payable on a 3, 6 or twelve month basis.  In respect of periods of non-use of a vehicle, the Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013 provides that, where a vehicle is not going to be used in a public place, the vehicle may be declared off the road during the last month of an extant tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use, for a period of between 3 and 12 months.  The Act also provides that an owner can return the vehicle to the road early if circumstances, such as a pick-up in business, require it, by applying for a vehicle licence for the vehicle.  The vehicle licence will commence from the month in which the application to tax the vehicle is made and the end date of the Declaration of Non- Use will be changed to the end of the month before the vehicle licence commences.<\/p>  <p>  The Diesel Rebate Scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600110#WRZZ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":1886,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600110#WRZZ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1887,"qnumday":791,"qnumall":"[23638\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600110#WRZZ00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the number, name and date of Bills initiated in his Department that have been subject to the pre-legislative scrutiny procedure in the Oireachtas.","asker":"992","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1888,"qnumday":793,"qnumall":"[23664\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600110#WRZZ00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the number, name and date of Bills initiated in his Department since September 2013.","asker":"992","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1889,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 791 and 793 together.<\/p><p>The number and name of Bills initiated by my Department since September 2013 is set out in the following table.

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.<\/p><p>My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.<\/p><p>Pobal&rsquo;s management and administrative services for the Scheme included an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014.  The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete.  Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas.  The tender was broken down into 10 regional lots to ensure that SME&rsquo;s were not disadvantaged due to excessively large lot sizes.<\/p><p>It should be noted that there are no legal mandatory standards required for the manufacture of personal alarms.  Many of the existing units comply with the EU standard; newer manufacturers of equipment or the newer more innovative technologies may meet other quality standards e.g. ISO standard.  Under the tender competition, those suppliers that meet the minimum requirement would score the minimum amount of marks available and suppliers that propose products over and above the minimum requirements would be awarded a higher score.<\/p><p>A monitoring services panel was also advertised via eTenders on 6 November 2014.This process will engage a panel of quality checked monitoring suppliers who will outline the costs they charge and the service they provide.  This information will be provided to the community groups and individuals to ensure they can make the best choice in relation to the<font color=\"#1F497D\">ir<\/font>monitoring services supplier.<\/p><p>The use of this panel is voluntary; monitoring costs are not grant-aided and have always been the responsibility of the beneficiary.  The older person will continue to be responsible for choosing the monitoring supplier of their choice and they are free to continue to use their current provider.  Annual monitoring costs (generally between &euro;60 - &euro;80 per annum) are borne by the beneficiary.

The IDG, which is made up of representatives from all relevant Government Departments, is currently working in a coordinated way to ensure that each Department&rsquo;s policy development and implementation fully consider the needs of rural communities.

No provision was made in that legislation to allow a Minister open a case against a media business of their own volition in the absence of a proposed merger.

It also supports the development of renewable electricity which is important for both security of supply and for reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation. The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers. It has been in place since 2001.  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002). The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.<\/p>  <p>  While I fully understand and appreciate concerns about the cost of the PSO levy to all customers, including sports clubs and charities, the development of renewable energy in Ireland, supported by the renewable energy part of the PSO, will enable Ireland to reduce its fossil fuel dependency and vulnerability to rises in fossil fuel prices. The PSO levy is also vital to enable Ireland to meet its 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.<\/p>  <p>  The PSO levy has been relatively high in recent years due to lower wholesale electricity prices. This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover their allowed costs. The lower wholesale electricity price is being driven by lower international gas prices which in turn drives up the PSO levy. However, lower gas and wholesale prices also reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay. In turn, suppliers are in a position to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase. Increased competition in the retail electricity market has led to a number of suppliers reducing their retail prices of late and I welcome these developments.

The statement was particularly important as it required local government planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to have regard to it thereafter. An additional key element of the strategy was that it affirmed the major investment underway in the high voltage electricity transmission system under EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid 25 Programme was the most important such investment in Ireland&rsquo;s transmission system for several generations. The Grid 25 Strategy is designed to put in place a safe, secure and affordable electricity supply throughout Ireland and to help Ireland to achieve its 2020 renewable energy targets. Grid 25 has been reviewed in 2011 and again last year, each taking account of changing technical and economic circumstances. The outcome of the 2014 review was published in March this year in the form of a draft grid development strategy. It states that Ireland&rsquo;s energy transmission needs can be met with reduced new infrastructure build because of new technological developments and updated projections of future electricity demand.<\/p><p>The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.

It is also consistent with the Broadband State Aid Guidelines and the EU&rsquo;s recent Broadband Cost Reduction Directive (2014\/61\/CE).<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, my Department is compiling a register of owners of existing infrastructure that could be used to support the NBP network roll-out, and publishing it on our website.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this register is to provide potential bidders with information on infrastructure which could be used as part of their bid. The register enables bidders to clearly see the type and general location of existing infrastructure which could be re-used but is not designed to be a detailed database of infrastructure. Rather it is a mechanism to facilitate engagement between bidders and infrastructure owners. If bidders are interested in seeking further information on infrastructure owners assets, in terms of exact location, pricing, terms and conditions etc, then they can make contact and seek further information directly with the owners concerned. This may also be relevant in the case of assets that are not within the National Broadband Plan intervention area, but could nevertheless be beneficial to the roll-out of other telecommunication services and services in areas that are being served commercially.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of including state assets, My Department carried out a series of bilateral meetings with semi-State and public sector organisations, the purpose of which was to maximise participation in the register and to discuss the practical arrangements for compiling it. In addition, my Department also met with a number of commercial companies with relevant telecoms infrastructure in rural areas and issued a direct invitation to over 50 companies to register their infrastructure on the register.

In November 2014, I met with, and subsequently wrote to, the Company and during these exchanges again raised the issue of Ministerial consent in respect of the diaspora project. <\/p>  <p>  The Company has informed me that entity known as The Irish International Diaspora Centre Trust is being\u00a0wound up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600116#WRFFF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"question","counter":2119,"qnumday":872,"qnumall":"[23217\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600116#WRFFF01300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the names of the directors of the International Diaspora Centre Company on the date of incorporation with the Companies Office in 2011; the persons who appointed these directors; the changes in directors from 2011 to date in 2015; if he will provide, in tabular form, a breakdown of directors' fees received by these persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":2120,"content":"<p>\u200bI am informed by D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company that the directors of the Irish International Diaspora Centre Trust Ltd. are appointed by the Board of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company.<\/p><p>Since the Trust's establishment in 2011 the directors have been:<\/p><p>-Mr Se&aacute;n Costelloe (former Chair of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company);<\/p><p>-Mr Gerry Dunne (CEO of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company);<\/p><p>-Mr Peter Brennan (director of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company);<\/p><p>-Ms Eithne Scott Lennon (Chair of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company).<\/p><p>I am further informed that no fee or\u00a0remuneration\u00a0has ever been paid to any director of the Irish International Diaspora Centre Trust Ltd. in respect of their directorship.<\/p><p>D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company is in the process of winding\u00a0up the Irish International Diaspora Centre Trust Ltd.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600116#WRFFF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"question","counter":2122,"qnumday":873,"qnumall":"[23218\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600116#WRFFF01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will confirm if the International Diaspora Centre Company has any employees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":2123,"content":"<p>\u200bI am informed by D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company that the Irish International Diaspora Centre Trust Ltd. does not have any employees nor has it ever had any employees.<\/p><p>I am further informed by the Company that the Trust is in the process of being wound-up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600116#WRFFF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"question","counter":2125,"qnumday":874,"qnumall":"[23219\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600116#WRFFF01900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to this Deputy's previous parliamentary questions regarding the outstanding expenses to be repaid by a a former board member (details supplied) to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, and his reply that legal action has been initiated by the harbour company to recover this money, if he will provide the details of the date the plenary summons was served by the harbour company; if the plenary summons was lodged in the High Court; the case number issued by the Courts Service, as these documents are public documents if legal action has been initiated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In addition, I understand that GLAS+ will be available to farmers who have large farm holdings within these priority areas for Hen Harrier. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine intends to bring forward plans for a separate locally-led measure under the Rural Development Programme in the near future and that the Hen Harrier has been identified as requiring further focus under this measure.  I am supportive of this initiative, and staff of my Department will be available to assist the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this regard, as required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600119#WRJJJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Career Breaks","counter":2252,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600119#WRJJJ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":2253,"qnumday":920,"qnumall":"[23398\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600119#WRJJJ03300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will provide, in tabular form, the number of staff in her Department currently on a sabbatical or career break, broken down by zero to six months, six to 12 months, one to two years, two to three years, four to five years, and five years or more; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":2254,"content":"<p>There are currently 9 staff in my Department on career break and the details requested by the Deputy are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Period of Career Break<\/th><th>Number of Staff<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>0 &ndash; 6 months<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6 &ndash; 12 months<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1 &ndash; 2 years<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2 &ndash; 3 years<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4 &ndash; 5\u00a0 years<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 years +<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600119#WRJJJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":2255,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600119#WRJJJ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2256,"qnumday":921,"qnumall":"[23414\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061600119#WRJJJ03600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will provide, in tabular form, by year, the total photography costs for her Department since coming into office, inclusive of the costs incurred from the use of the ministerial allowance; if she will provide the list of occasions for which photographers were booked; the photographers used; the breakdown of costs associated with each occasion a photographer was used; if there is a policy regarding the booking of photographers within her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":2257,"content":"<p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Since my appointment in July 2014 total photography costs for my Department in 2014 were &euro;1,168 and &euro;2,571.44 spent to date in 2015.
