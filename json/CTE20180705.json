He is joined by Ruth Foley, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  We are dealing with the Department of Health and the HSE under the Department of Health appropriation accounts, Vote 38 for 2016 and the HSE financial statements 2017.  However, the committee decided to provide up to one hour at the beginning of the meeting to deal specifically with the cervical cancer crisis issue.  We will proceed with our examination of the financial statements after that.  We will take the routine business of the committee in the afternoon.<\/p><p>There are a number of items relevant to this morning's meeting in correspondence which I am putting on the record so they can be discussed in detail in public.

Next is correspondence No. 1460<b><\/b>from Mr Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, providing his opening statement.  It is noted and published.<\/p><p>Correspondence No. 1427<b><\/b>from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, dated 25 June 2018, provides information on the management of legal costs and open disclosure as requested by the committee on 14 June 2018.  Mr. Breen's correspondence deals with the State Claims Agency management approach to CervicalCheck cancer misdiagnosis litigation; and details including the status of screening and non-screening cancer misdiagnosis claims for cervical cancer, bowel cancer and breast cancer.  We note and publish this.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Correspondence No. 1432<b><\/b>from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE is in respect of Dr. Scally&rsquo;s access to CervicalCheck records.

We have a relevant note on the screen.  We are not having a discussion; it is just by way of information.  It states in respect of the point about CervicalCheck attendees that at this point it is important to advise the committee that Charles O'Hanlon is on sick leave and certified unwell and, therefore, will not be in a position to attend the committee.<\/p><p>In respect of Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, she is employed by Holles Street and indicated that she is no longer with the HSE.  Since our meeting last week we have written to Dr. Flannelly in her course of employment and she sent an email back to the committee, reference 1451, which we note and publish.  Dr. Flannelly was the clinical director of CervicalCheck.  In her email, she thanks the committee for the invitation to appear before it on a voluntary witness basis to address the issues regarding the CervicalCheck programme.  She states that she is at present preparing to meet with Dr. Scally as part of his investigation next week, and that she is currently in the UK where she has work commitments until the middle of next week.  That is now this week.  She goes on to state that she would value the opportunity to help our committee by attending as per our request on a voluntary basis but in view of the above she requests that this be rearranged to a different date.  She states that she will liaise with the clerk in respect of rescheduling it.<\/p><p>I want to put on record that while she is not here today, Dr. Flannelly has given a definite commitment that she is happy to meet with us at a more suitable time.  I think we will have to come back to that.  We will discuss the timing of our meetings as part of our work programme in the afternoon.  We will not set the time now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#C00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>We should ask if she will come in next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018070500002#C00700","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1530777600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We made a request last week for specific individuals.

As of 9 o'clock this morning, how many women have been identified as having been affected?  That figure was at 209.<\/p> <p>  It has been reported that the independent review of the cases of 3,000 women will not be completed on schedule and is only commencing now.  What is the reason for that?  Why has it taken so long?  If there were 300,000 slides per year and it takes five minutes to review each, a team of ten people could carry out the analysis in a few weeks even if each slide is surveyed twice and the women's slide history examined.  Why was there a commitment to complete the review within a timeframe which has not been followed?  Why was information on the delay not made public?  Why is the review only starting now?  It will not be possible for it to form part of the Scally review, which must be completed by the end of August.  The Minister for Health, stated that the final Scally review must be completed by the end of August.  However, these 3,000 slides will not be part of it because of the delay.  Stephen Teap and Vicky Phelan, who gave evidence to the committee, are extremely disappointed and upset this morning that the review of the slides will not form part of the Scally review.  Why was the review committed to on the basis of an unrealistic timeframe?  When will it be completed?  How in the name of God can we have a situation where Dr. Scally must report by the end of August to ensure credibility but this review will not form part of his report because of the delay?  How will his review be complete without that information?  How in the name of God did we end up in this situation?  Who committed to those unrealistic timelines?<\/p> <p>  I have a third question which I had better ask before the Chair cuts me off.  It relates to the legal cases, of which I understand there is a significant number.  I remind the witnesses that the State Claims Agency, SCA, will appear before the committee next week.  As I understand it, the HSE hired a legal firm, the identity of which I know, to draft a protocol for how cytology slides are given to the women affected.  That protocol has been in use for several weeks.  Solicitors for several affected women have gone to court to seek the release of the slides and in such cases the HSE has handed them over without the protocol being followed.  These are urgent cases.  All present know what that means: the women are in difficult health situations.  Why is a protocol needed for the release of slides to which the women are entitled?  Why is it taking so long?  Why can the protocol be bypassed when a woman goes to court and takes on CervicalCheck and it or the SCA is so embarrassed that it hands over the slides?  Some 80 to 90 women have sought their files from CervicalCheck and some have received access thereto.<\/p><p>When it comes to getting their slides they are being blocked by a protocol, which I doubt anyone has heard of up to now.  Given what the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, said in the D&aacute;il and the evidence given to this committee and the Joint Committee on Health, of which I am also a member, why is this protocol necessary?  What is its purpose?  If it can be bypassed in urgent cases why can it not be bypassed in this instance and these slides given to the women and their solicitors immediately?

If a monetary value is attached to non-disclosure in at least one case, it may also be attached in others.

They separated two elements, telling us that the medical files were one matter, while the slides were another.  I have examined the contracts with Quest Diagnostics and MedLab Pathology.  They are similar, if not identical.  Under the heading of \"Storage and Disaster Recovery\" on page 12, the contractor shall at the request of the national screening service forward eligible samples stored by the contractor or on the contractor's behalf to the national screening service or any third party specified by the service in a manner prescribed by it within three working days.  It seems clear from this that the national screening service is in control and ownership of the slides.  Why is there any question of a delay when the contract is clear about the contractors' obligations and the service's rights?<\/p> <p>  On radio in the past half hour, the solicitor for Vicky Phelan stated the HSE was holding up the protocol to agree to the release of slides and that, until this occurred, they could not be reviewed by clinical cytologists.  Is the HSE holding it up and, if so, why?  <\/p> <p>  Someone made reference to an apology, but an apology is hollow if it is not followed through with actions that will give it meaning.  We are being given the runaround on some of our questions.  The contract is clear, but we are not being given clear answers about the protocol.  If it is being held up, any claim about dealing sincerely with people who may have been harmed by the State is hollow.
