That is because we believe it is critically important for our economy and for the ongoing development of British-Irish relations.  It is also our view that the EU itself is stronger and better with the UK as a full and committed member. We must therefore do what we can to help to encourage the UK to remain within the Union.  This means, as a starting point, continuing to work closely with our British partners &ndash; as well as other like-minded States &ndash; on policy issues where we share the same interests and approach.  The British Government and other British political parties have made clear that the achievement of common aims in regard to economic policy &ndash; including the completion of the single market in services, the conclusion of trade negotiations with third countries and a more streamlined approach to EU regulation &ndash; is a high priority in itself and will strengthen the case for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership.  Depending on the outcome of their general election in May, it is possible that the next British Government will make proposals on both how the functioning of the EU could be improved and specific UK concerns addressed.  Ireland will certainly consider any reasonable proposals on their merits, if and when they are presented.  We have a clear shared interest in seeing our Union operate more effectively.  We also recognise &ndash; as the European Council has done &ndash; that the UK has some legitimate concerns that should be addressed.  At the same time, we would not support anything which we think could weaken or otherwise adversely affect the Union.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is monitoring developments in the EU-UK relationship very carefully.  My Department is co-operating with other Departments, especially the Department of the Taoiseach, in this regard.  Our Embassy in London naturally plays a key role in this process and we rely heavily too on the reporting and analysis we receive from our Embassies elsewhere. <\/p>  <p>  We are also, of course, engaging directly with our British colleagues on the question of their EU membership.  I myself had a detailed discussion with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond when he visited Dublin in December.  The subject has arisen as well in informal contacts with other British Ministers and our officials &ndash; in this Department, the Department of the Taoiseach and elsewhere &ndash; are engaging regularly with their counterparts in the UK system.  The UK&rsquo;s place in Europe is also regularly discussed with other EU partners at both political and senior official level.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the nature of the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU is primarily an issue for the British people and we must continue to respect and be sensitive to the democratic process under way there.

Continuing violence and threats have forced almost two million people to flee their homes.  The country&rsquo;s warring parties signed another ceasefire agreement in February following regional talks led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which were supported by the African Union and the European Union.

Some 2.5 million people are facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity.  Malnutrition rates among children have more than doubled.

There has been an increase in tensions in the prison in recent weeks.  This is due in part to the issuing of threats by prisoners against Prison Service officials in a context where a serving prison officer, David Black, was murdered by dissidents in November 2012.  It is also related to recent construction work in Roe House intended to increase the space available to prisoners in the separated regime for association.  However, it appears the well meaning intentions behind the works were not effectively communicated in advance to inmates.   <\/p>  <p>  A protest by a small number of prisoners on 2 February ended with both the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, David Ford, and the Director General of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, Sue McAllister, reporting no injuries to staff or prisoners.  I am aware that some prisoners have said that they were injured during the protest.  Members of the independent assessment team have since met with prisoners and prison management to hear their perspectives on the protest and on how best to take things forward.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the increase in tension, I take some encouragement from renewed calls by both the Northern Ireland Prison Service and prisoner representatives for the full implementation of the stocktake report.  It is important that this work continue with the good will and support of all the relevant stake holders.  The Northern Ireland Prison Service has reiterated its commitment to the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  It would certainly facilitate progress if all threats against those working in the prison administration were lifted.  All such threats are completely unacceptable, and serve only to frustrate the process of improving the atmosphere in the prison.  The independent assessment group continues with their engagement, to encourage the implementation of their recommendations, and would be open to a meeting with the Deputy to discuss on-going concerns.  I have discussed prison issues with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions, most recently on 11 February.  I also met in January with a member of the independent assessment group which completed the stocktake Report of September 2014.  My officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continuously monitor the situation at Maghaberry Prison, including through contact with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Office and officials in the Northern Ireland Prison Service, as well as members of the independent assessment group, and have been keeping me closely informed of developments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Summits","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[8240\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the priorities for Ireland at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit; and the way he will address these matters in the May 2015 meeting here.","asker":"1005","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>We currently face an unprecedented scale of humanitarian need around the world.

Furthermore, Ireland condemns all forms of arbitrary, summary and extrajudicial executions.  <br\/><br\/>In November 2014 Ireland, together with the other EU Member States, co-sponsored the UN General Assembly&rsquo;s resolution on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.  At the core of this resolution are the right to life and the fight against impunity.  Notably, by way of this resolution, the General Assembly expressed its deep concern<i><\/i>about acts that can amount to extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions committed against persons exercising their rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression in all regions of the world, and about killings committed by non-State actors, including terrorist groups and criminal organisations, that may amount to abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law.<br\/><br\/>The strong text of this resolution includes references to killings of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities or because of their sexual orientation or gender identity; killings of persons for reasons related to their activities as human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists or demonstrators; killings of persons affected by terrorism or hostage-taking or living under foreign occupation, racially motivated killings, killings of refugees, internally displaced persons, migrants, street children or members of indigenous communities, killings committed in the name of passion or in the name of honour, and killings committed for discriminatory reasons on any basis.<br\/><br\/>In June 2014, during the 26<sup>th<\/sup>session of the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland co-sponsored the resolution which renewed the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions.

In circumstances where the Court has jurisdiction by virtue of such executions taking place in the territory of a state party or state that has accepted the Court&rsquo;s role, or by the national of such a state, or where the United Nations Security Council has determined that the ICC has jurisdiction, prosecutions may be brought against alleged perpetrators in appropriate circumstances. <br\/><br\/>Let me reassure the Deputy that Ireland is committed to upholding the respect for international law in order to prevent extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions in all circumstances and to working for the complete abolition of the death penalty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Strategy","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA03150"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[8267\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the role his Department and the embassy network are playing regarding the Year of Irish Design 2015, which is aiming to promote and support Irish craft and design at home and abroad.","asker":"1110","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>Irish Design 2015 (ID2015) emerged as an idea from the Global Irish Economic Forum convened by my Department in 2013.

These are monstrous acts beyond comprehension, which must be condemned in the strongest possible terms.  They are also savage attacks on minority communities and on the values of tolerance and pluralism which underpin freedom of religion or belief.  Ireland has repeatedly recalled the duty of States to protect vulnerable minorities in the Middle East, including Christian communities. I have reiterated that call and will be raising this with my EU colleagues at the earliest opportunity. The situation is particularly difficult, of course, in areas where the authority of the state has effectively collapsed.   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities.  We consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including the EU and UN.  I highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014.  I also raised it during my meeting with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.  These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected.  They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  The EU leads resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at both the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and at the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva, of which Ireland is currently a member.  Ireland is an active participant in the negotiation of these resolutions.  In 2014, the EU-led resolutions on freedom of religion or belief were successfully adopted without a vote by the HRC (March 2014) and by the UN General Assembly during its 69th session (December 2014).

The package also contains a timetable for the implementation of key parts of the September Minsk Agreements, which provide the basis for a comprehensive resolution of the crisis.   <\/p>  <p>  The ceasefire came into effect at midnight on 14 February.  The OSCE has reported that it had largely held across most parts of the conflict area, with the notable exception of Debaltseve, a strategically important transport hub linking the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk.  Despite signing the ceasefire agreement, Russian-backed separatists continued a full scale assault on Debaltseve forcing Ukrainian troops to withdraw from the town, which is now in rebel hands.  I strongly condemn the rebel assault on Debaltseve.  It is a major breach of the ceasefire and threatens to undermine the peace deal agreed in Minsk on 12 February. <\/p>  <p>  Having achieved their objective in Debaltseve, it remains to be seen whether the rebels may now take steps to implement the ceasefire and withdraw their heavy weapons.  Russia has a key role to play in this regard given the considerable influence it exercises over the separatists groups.      <\/p>  <p>  Events last weekend, particularly the release of prisoners and the commitment by both sides to begin withdrawing heavy weapons this week, are positive signs. However, there have been worrying reports about shelling near Mariupol city.   <\/p>  <p>  Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Poroshenko, President Putin and their Foreign Ministers remain in telephone contact and have indicated that they will continue to push for implementation of the package of measures agreed in Minsk on 12 February.   <\/p>  <p>  On 17 February, the UN Security Council unanimously called on all parties to immediately cease hostilities and abide by the commitments agreed in Minsk, including facilitating access for the OSCE Mission to enable them to monitor the situation on the ground.  EU High Representative Federica Mogherini has also issued a strong statement to this effect. <\/p>  <p>  I fully support the UN Security Council Resolution and the High Representative&rsquo;s call, which also underlined the need for the agreed withdrawal of heavy weapons.

This means, as a starting point, continuing to work closely with our British partners &ndash; as well as other like-minded States &ndash; on policy issues where we share the same interests and approach.  The British Government and other British political parties have made clear that the achievement of common aims in regard to economic policy &ndash; including the completion of the single market in services, the conclusion of trade negotiations with third countries and a more streamlined approach to EU regulation &ndash; is a high priority in itself and will strengthen the case for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership.  Depending on the outcome of their general election in May, it is possible that the next British Government will make proposals on both how the functioning of the EU could be improved and specific UK concerns addressed.  Ireland will certainly consider any reasonable proposals on their merits, if and when they are presented.  We have a clear shared interest in seeing our Union operate more effectively.  We also recognise &ndash; as the European Council has done &ndash; that the UK has some legitimate concerns that should be addressed.  At the same time, we would not support anything which we think could weaken or otherwise adversely affect the Union.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is monitoring developments in the EU-UK relationship very carefully.

In addition, Taoiseach Enda Kenny T.D., will travel to Washington for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and will meet with President Obama, Vice President Biden and other senior US Administration figures as well as with key Congressional contacts.    <\/p>  <p>  These meetings will provide an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns in regard to the position of the undocumented Irish, to seek further information on the detail of President Obama&rsquo;s executive action and to encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.<\/p>  <p>  While the executive measures announced by President Obama clearly represent real progress, Minister Flanagan and I are well aware that some will not benefit from these new arrangements and the Deputy will also be aware that there are currently legal challenges underway. <\/p>  <p>  During my visit to Washington from 20-21 January, I had a number of meetings with key Republican members of the House.  It provided an opportunity to assess the intentions of the Republican majority in terms of dealing with immigration this year and to convey the Government&rsquo;s ongoing determination to achieve some relief for the undocumented and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.<\/p>  <p>  Our Ambassador and her team in Washington are continuing their ongoing engagement with the US administration on this priority issue for the Government.  We also keep in close contact with the US Ambassador to Ireland and his team at the US Embassy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA00925"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[8238\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will address, at United Nations and European Union levels, the seriousness of the ongoing crisis in South Sudan, the lack of air access to hard-to-reach areas, the real possibility of famine, in the coming weeks, and the lack of political will, to bring about a resolution to the current crises.","asker":"1005","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s question and the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  I share the very serious concern about the situation in South Sudan, which achieved its independence in 2011 but has been in turmoil since the outbreak of conflict in December 2013.  Continuing violence and threats have forced almost two million people to flee their homes.  The country&rsquo;s warring parties signed another ceasefire agreement in February following regional talks led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which were supported by the African Union and the European Union.  However, the current peace remains very fragile and the humanitarian situation is extremely serious.  Reports that 89 young boys were abducted over the weekend in Upper Nile State, for use as child soldiers, are particularly worrying.   <\/p>  <p>  South Sudan remains on the brink of famine, due to insecurity, continuing displacement and reduced food production.  Some 2.5 million people are facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity.  Malnutrition rates among children have more than doubled.   The international community has been working with the United Nations to protect civilians and provide humanitarian relief.  The mandate of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), which provides security and protection for civilians, has been extended to May 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs recently co-hosted a high-level conference on South Sudan at which donors pledged some $600 million in assistance.  Since the outbreak of the conflict at the end of 2013, Ireland has provided almost &euro;11 million for South Sudan, through UN partners and NGOs working to alleviate the suffering of the people of the country and refugees across the region.  We have pledged a further &euro;3 million so far in 2015.  We will continue to monitor the political and humanitarian situation closely, through our Embassies in the region, and in co-operation with our EU partners and the United Nations.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[8278\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to an attempted coup in Venezuela that was foiled and revealed on 12 February 2015; his views on attempted anti-democratic coups in Venezuela; and if he will contact the Venezuelan Government to outline his support for the democratic institutions of the Venezuelan state.","asker":"1037","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":98,"content":"<p>The situation in Venezuela is a matter of great concern.

Since January 2015, eligibility for the lower level of subsidy has been broadened to include young jobseekers (aged 18-24) unemployed for four months or more and persons in a jobseekers allowance transitional arrangement.   The subsidy is paid in monthly instalments over a two year period provided the employment is maintained.

The Act does not accord me as Minister any function in this regard.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are two provisions in the legislation governing the assessment of valuations which result in the issue of valuation certificates, i.e. revaluation and revision. They are dealt with under Parts 5 and 6 of the Valuation Act 2001 respectively. There has been no change in the legislative provisions during this D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Revision of valuation is the mechanism used to maintain local authority valuations lists. It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. By contrast, in a revaluation the entire commercial valuation list for a local authority is brought up-to-date by reference to a specific valuation date. The entire list is published on one date (usually 31 December) and it comes into effect for rating purposes on 1 January the following year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The revaluation of a rating authority area is commenced by the making of a Valuation Order by the Commissioner of Valuation which among other things specifies the publication date of the new valuation list. It is for the Commissioner to set the publication date which would take account of factors such as the number of items to be valued. The Act states that the publication date shall not be more than three years after the date the valuation order is made. In practice the gap between the date the valuation order was signed and the publication date is between 24 and 33 months. Prior to 2011 the gap was between 26 and 33 months. Since 2011 the gap between the order date and the publication date has been between 24 and 33 months. As can be seen from the figures below nearly 2\/3 of the properties revalued have been completed on valuation orders signed in 2011 or later with 1\/3 of properties\u00a0revalued on valuation orders signed between 2005 and 2011.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To-date, revaluations of all local authorities in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick have been completed comprising approximately 49,500 properties, representing approx. 57% of the national rateable valuation base in monetary value terms or 33% in numerical terms. In addition, 13 public utilities representing some of the largest ratepayers in the State have been valued on a national basis. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2011, as part of the national revaluation programme the Valuation Office has issued in excess of 32,000 proposed valuation certificates and 31,482 final valuation certificates, all within the required timelines. The latter are broken down as follows:<\/p>  <p>  Dublin City 20,845<\/p>  <p>  Waterford City &amp;amp; County 3,917<\/p>  <p>  Limerick City &amp;amp; County 6,720<\/p>  <p>  Valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined under Part 6 of the Valuation Act 2001, by reference to the net annual values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. The Act provides for applications for revision to be made to the Commissioner by an occupier, a rating authority, an interest holder in a rateable property or the occupier of another rateable property in that same rating authority area. On receipt of a revision application the Commissioner appoints a revision officer to deal with the application and the Act requires that officer to deal with that application within 6 months of his\/her appointment. <\/p>  <p>  Revision applications are received on an ongoing basis throughout the year and, in so far as reasonably practicable, the statutory timelines provided for in the Valuation Act 2001 are adhered to. While there are always some arrears of revision casework, these are not significant. The vast majority of applications are lodged by local authorities with whom the Valuation Office maintains close liaison, to ensure that revision applications are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and to agreed timelines having regard to the local authority budgetary year. Revision applications relating to new properties and those received from the public are disposed of expeditiously; the Valuation Office aims to deal with the majority of ratepayer revision applications within 3 months of receipt of the application. <\/p>  <p>  During 2014, 3,467 revision applications were received, 4,204 revision applications were dealt with which resulted in 1,804 new records being created and 6,024 valuation certificates being issued in total.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600056#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ombudsman's Remit","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600056#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[8520\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600056#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the Ombudsman's remit extends to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Eirgrid; when this changed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These events show that all States must remain vigilant and attentive to the risks posed by international terrorism. <br\/><br\/>Ireland, like any other democratic country with similar values, is not immune to a threat from international terrorism.  While an attack on Ireland is possible it is not assessed as likely and there is no specific information in relation to a threat to Ireland.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are keeping the level of threat from international terrorism under continuous review in light of ongoing developments and continuing to take all appropriate measures to counteract this threat.  In this they have the full support of the Government.<br\/><br\/>The radicalising affect of online propaganda must also be dealt with and this is a matter which has received direct attention from EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers at our recent meetings.  Indeed, this has been a focus of actions at EU level for a number of years now, particularly in the context of the EU's Strategy for combating radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism and the EU's Internal security strategy.  The Deputy will wish to know that the recent informal meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers focused on the international terrorism and foreign fighters issues.  Ireland along with its European counterparts is seeking to work with all relevant stakeholders to develop further initiatives in this domain.<br\/><br\/>The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary legislation is in place to address terrorist threats.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 has already passed all stages in the Seanad.  It is expected that the Bill will come before the D&aacute;il shortly.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>The Bill, when enacted, will create the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy will appreciate, any response to this issue must be proportionate to the level of the threat and multi-faceted in approach.  In addition to conventional security measures, engagement with minority or at risk communities is an essential element of the response.  In that context, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates a progressive programme of community engagement with minority communities.  The aim of these programmes is to build a sense of inclusiveness amongst minority communities and to address feelings of marginalisation in order to avoid providing  fertile ground for radicalisation and those seeking to radicalise others. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600058#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Title","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600058#WRJ00450"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[8495\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600058#WRJ00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the land registration status in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established as and from 4 November 2006.

The figures published up to Quarter 2 in 2014 indicate a reduction in the overall number of offences recorded in the 12 months to that date.<br\/><br\/>Insofar as burglary offences are concerned, and as I indicated in my remarks as referred to by the Deputy, I am very conscious of the concerns which relate to these crimes and working closely with the Garda Commissioner and other relevant criminal justice agencies to ensure that an effective, whole of system response is in place.  I understand that the general trend is that, having fallen in 2013, there has been an increase in such offences during 2014.<br\/><br\/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are pursuing a range of strategies to tackle this, including the establishment of Burglary Response Units and through operations such as Operation Fiacla and Operation Acer, which are focusing on identifying and targeting the criminal groups who have played a large part in the recent increase.  In addition to these policing responses, I am also carrying out a broader and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries. This includes a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues. Burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime, and I am determined to tackle it on a number of fronts, and through a partnership approach between criminal justice agencies and the community.  <br\/><br\/>In relation to the closure of Garda stations, the Deputy will be aware that the decisions made in 2013 in this regard were the result of a comprehensive operational assessment carried out by the Garda Commissioner, the objective of which was to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible.  In particular, freeing up Garda&iacute; from desk duties has increased the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing and confronting crime.  While the deployment of resources is kept under review at all times by the Garda Commissioner, none of the advice to me suggests that the closure of Garda stations is a significant factor in the recent increase in burglary, or that its reopening would contribute materially to a solution.  Tackling highly mobile gangs involved in burglary will not be helped by reopening Garda stations, as to do so would take Garda&iacute; away from visible front line policing and crime prevention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600058#WRJ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Orders","counter":310,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600058#WRJ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":311,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[8515\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600058#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 319 of 27 January 2015, if she will confirm the identity of each of the five-man team who carried out an eviction in Clane, County Kildare, on 9 January 2015, one of whom indicated to the tenant that he was a garda with powers of arrest and subsequently appeared at the premises driving a vehicle in which the landlord was a passenger; if such practice is in accordance with any particular operational code of conduct or whether civilians are authorised to operate in such a fashion; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":312,"content":"<p>I hope the Deputy will appreciate that I have no official responsibility in relation to the identification of the persons referred to by the Deputy, or in relation to enforcement of court orders in respect of these matters.  <\/p>  <p>  As I previously informed the Deputy, Garda&iacute; attended the address referred to following telephone requests from both the tenant and landlord.

The Courts Service is introducing new arrangements for the payment of fines which will allow payments to be made in a range of outlets across the country, and not just through Courts Service offices.  There are significant changes in information technology required to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments. Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.  <br\/><br\/>It is expected that all the preparations for the new system will be completed by the third quarter of 2015.

according to the most recent snapshot of the prison population taken on 31 January 2015 there were 734 prisoners in custody aged 18-24. <\/p>  <p>I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that records of prisoner participation in vocational training and education programmes are not maintained in such a way as to provide the specific information sought by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  Broad programmes of education are provided which generally follow an adult education approach. Prison education includes a core element of basic education incorporating reading, writing, numeracy and IT literacy. The aim of the Education Service is to deliver a high quality, broad, flexible programme of education that helps prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning. Programmes are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life, including segregation requirements and high levels of prisoner turnover.<\/p>  <p>  Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and a range of other educational agencies.The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the ETBs (220 in the academic year 2014\/15).  Organisations who provide in-reach education roles include Open University, the Samaritans, the Red Cross, Grow, Toe by Toe, Writers and Artists in prison etc. Other courses run through the education centres include pre-release programmes, parenting, hairdressing, Alternatives to Violence etc.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in November 2014, the latest month for which figures are available, 46.3% of the total prisoner population attended education classes during this time. January figures have not been collated yet and in December industrial action by teachers - combined with the holiday period - do not give an accurate representation of prisoner engagement. With regard to Wheatfield, on average 27% of the prisoner population engaged with education services on a daily basis in November 2014. A breakdown by age of those who attended is not available.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.<\/p>  <p>  Prisoners involved in work and training activities may do so with a view to gaining accreditation in a particular area or in order to keep busy during their sentence. Engagement in vocational training can have added benefits in the form of boosting self-confidence, imparting useful practical skills and improving social skills. On any given day, prisoners work in areas such as the laundry, kitchens, horticultural or gardening, industrial cleaning, waste management and picture framing shops where the labour they provide can be of benefit to the effective running of the prison and for which they may or may not receive accreditation.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in November 2014, the latest month for which figures are available for prisoner participation in work and training (accredited and non-accredited), 27.83% of the total prisoner population attended workshop sessions. During this time the workshops were open for approximately 82% average of scheduled opening hours. With regard to Wheatfield In November 27.60% of the prisoner population attended workshop sessions with an average attendance per session of 133.46 prisoners. A breakdown by age of those who attended is not available.<\/p>  <p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600061#WRM01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":374,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[8617\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600062#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of those aged 18 to 20, inclusive, in prison, and those in Wheatfield Place of Detention, who are in basic regime; the number in standard regime; the number in enhanced regime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[8618\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600062#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of those aged 21 to 24, inclusive, in prison, and in Wheatfield Place of Detention, who are in basic regime; the number in standard regime; the number in enhanced regime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":376,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the Incentivised Regimes Policy was introduced on a phased basis across all prisons in 2012 and is now operational in all institutions.  Incentivised Regimes provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour.  The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.<\/p>  <p>  There are three levels of privilege - basic, standard and enhanced and each prison has developed an information booklet on how the scheme operates and specifically on the criteria and privileges associated with each level of regime.<\/p>  <p>  Prisoners on the enhanced regime level are significantly more likely to benefit from temporary release programmes such as Community Return &ndash; where prisoners are released early under Probation Supervision to partake of voluntary work for the benefit of the community &ndash; and\/or transfer to an open centre.  These are significant motivational factors in encouraging prisoners to engage in authorised structured activities and improve general behaviour.  The hope is that these benefits are not just apparent in prisons and that the behavioural change effected will stay with the prisoner on his release.  Experience in other jurisdictions has shown that an incentivised regime structure is a hugely valuable addition to prisons in the context of good order and prisoner compliance.<\/p>  <p>  The standard set of core privileges provided in each prison comprises of different levels of daily gratuity ranging from &euro;0.95 to &euro;2.20, the number and length of visits a prisoner is allowed to receive and the number of telephone calls a prisoner is allowed to make.  Each prison has drawn up a list of privileges available under each regime level.  The list of available privileges is likely to vary between prisons and within different areas of a prison, depending on the operational and infrastructure requirements of each prison.  Examples of other incentives offered include improved accommodation (e.g. move from dormitory accommodation to a single room in an open centre).  In the past, access to facilities such as DVD players, games consoles have been provided.  Prisoners can also gain access to employment opportunities within the prison e.g. kitchens, laundries etc.<\/p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that on 24 February 2015, 18-20 year olds in custody were assigned to the following regime levels: Basic - 27; Standard - 148; and, Enhanced - 72.  On the same date, 21-24 year olds in custody were assigned to the following regime levels: Basic - 58; Standard - 353; and Enhanced - 255.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600062#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[8619\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600062#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of those aged 18 to 20, inclusive, in prison, and in Wheatfield Place of Detention, who have been assaulted while in detention; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[8620\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600062#WRN00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of those aged 21 to 24, inclusive, in prison, and in Wheatfield Place of Detention, who have been assaulted while in detention; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[8621\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600062#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of those aged 18 to 20, inclusive, in prison, and in Wheatfield Place of Detention, who have assaulted a prison officer, other member of prison staff or another prisoner while in detention; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[8622\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600062#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of those aged 21 to 24, inclusive, in prison, and in Wheatfield Place of Detention, who have assaulted a prison officer, other member prison staff or another prisoner while in detention; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":382,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 to 141, inclusive, together.<br\/><br\/>I can advise the Deputy that the information requested is not readily available.

The Bill, as introduced, makes provision for the preparation of an autism strategy and a national framework for addressing the specific needs of adults with autism.  The broad thrust of the Bill was accepted by Government and it was not opposed at Second Stage.  Although the needs of people with autism have received some recognition in recent years, the Bill is seen as contributing to a more enlightened and educated public debate.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the Autism Bill, it is important to note that the Government is already committed under the National Disability Strategy (NDS) to ensuring that people with autism are empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society.  The NDS is driven by this basic but fundamentally important objective and is the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has been examining issues around autism across Government Departments in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA).  This work by the NDA, which has included consultation with families, will be of significant assistance in informing how best to address the needs of people with ASD, so that we can be sure that they are appropriately reflected and included in policies and actions.<\/p>  <p>  The National Disability Strategy Implementation Group has already discussed the findings of the NDA consultation and mapping of services to people with autism.  Further to the recommendations of this exercise, the NDA is now engaging bi-laterally with Departments and agencies to guide the development of actions under the umbrella of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600064#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600064#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[8489\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600064#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients waiting for spinal surgery at Cappagh Hospital, Dublin 11; the measures being taken to combat the waiting time at the hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":435,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

Zoning was appropriate for the proposed development and use.  The decision was unexpected since Dublin City Council (DCC) had issued a notification of its decision to grant planning permission. An Bord Plean&aacute;la's inspector also recommended a grant of planning permission, upholding the DCC decision.  The single reason given for the refusal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la was the loss of informal open space.  This decision will significantly delay the provision of a primary care centre for Finglas south and west.  This project has been approved for funding and the HSE will review the situation to determine what can be done.<\/p>  <p>However, as with all capital programmes, the primary care infrastructure programme which includes this project, must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer.  There is limited funding available for new projects, over the next multi-annual period 2015-2019, given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.  Therefore the reason capital funding is not ring-fenced \/ committed by project is to ensure that the HSE has flexibility to manage within its voted capital allocation in the event that one or more of the hundreds of construction projects underway at any time do not progress as scheduled.  Indenting rather than ring-fencing enables the HSE, to leverage its capital allocation efficiently, so that it delivers the maximum number of priority projects for the funding available.  Nevertheless Finglas south and west remains a priority as it is one of the communities most in need of access to primary care services.    <\/p>  <p>  While the Mellowes Road site was purchased subject to planning, certain costs including professional fees will have been incurred.

The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and was established with a view to improve and standardise the quality of care for patients with rare diseases in Ireland by increasing detection and prevention, facilitating early timely diagnosis, intervention and coordination of care, and increasing awareness, information and support.<\/p>  <p>  This clinical programme will ultimately be a channel for advancing and implementing other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases. <\/p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan.

It is also essential that the OSCE Mission is permitted to freely undertake its important monitoring and verification work in all areas of the conflict region. <\/p>  <p>  The most effective way of ensuring the safety of the civilian population is to stop the violence. On 12 February, an agreement was reached in Minsk on a new peace deal aimed at ending the fighting. The declaration agreed in Minsk by Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Putin and President Poroschenko and the package of measures signed by the parties to the conflict provides for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons in eastern Ukraine.  The package also contains a timetable for the implementation of key parts of the September Minsk Agreements, which provide the basis for a comprehensive resolution of the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  On 17 February, the UN Security Council unanimously called on all parties to immediately cease hostilities and abide by the commitments agreed in Minsk. EU High Representative Federica Mogherini has also issued a strong statement to this effect. I fully support the UN Security Council Resolution and the High Representative&rsquo;s call, which also underlined the need for the agreed withdrawal of heavy weapons. It is critical that all parties honour their commitments to end the fighting and fully support a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600069#WRU01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[8660\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600069#WRU01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he and his EU colleagues, together with the United Nations, can take measures to protect women and girls under threat from the Boko Haram; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":569,"content":"<p>I have strongly condemned the appalling acts of violence being perpetrated in Nigeria and its neighbouring countries by Boko Haram.

Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world. We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental\/civil society organisations. Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015.  We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, the Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.   Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council. The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance. Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011. The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.  Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it. We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015, on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.<\/p>  <p>  The promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms has always been a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. Ireland&rsquo;s new policy on international development, &lsquo;One World One Future&rsquo;, reaffirms the centrality of human rights to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and aid programme, and commits to ensuring that human rights principles and standards are promoted, protected and integrated in all of our development efforts. The Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, addresses the root causes of poverty and exclusion by focussing on the most vulnerable and promoting their participation, representation, and the means to realise their rights, including through investing in the improvement and expansion of essential services, and support to organisations that promote human rights, governance, and democracy in developing countries, including civil society and the UN office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, Irish Aid promotes access to justice and supports the strengthening of government institutions, parliaments, and independent media, and national human rights institutions.    <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments with a view to highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600070#WRV00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":587,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600070#WRV00450"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[8668\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600070#WRV00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the progress being made toward the regularisation of the undocumented Irish in the United States of America; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":589,"content":"<p>Achieving relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US is a priority for the Government in our bilateral relationship with the United States.

In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available. <br\/><br\/>  Special schools are classified as primary schools and are intended to cater for children with special educational needs until they reach the age of 18.

Funding is also provided to the National Learning Network for this purpose. <br\/><br\/>  Young adults with disabilities are eligible to access SOLAS mainstream services. SOLAS also contracts Specialist Training Providers, in locations country-wide, to deliver training courses to people with disabilities who require more intensive support than would be available in non-specialist training provision.  Specialist training offers additional supports to learners which include individualised training and progression plans, literacy and numeracy support, longer training duration, adapted equipment, transport arrangements, enhanced programme content and enhanced trainer\/learner ratio.<br\/><br\/>  The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) scheme also provides a third level admissions scheme for school leavers who have a disability or specific learning difficulty.

While a small number of these staff remain in schools, the schemes are being phased out and have been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme.  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial (and\/or caretaking) services.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how secretarial services are to be obtained.  Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. <br\/><br\/>  Notwithstanding the above, a forum was established under the Towards 2016 Agreement involving my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, IMPACT and SIPTU to examine the factual position in schools regarding the terms and conditions of employment of secretaries (and caretakers) employed using grant funding.  However, it was not possible to progress the forum's agenda beyond the initial fact finding survey, due to the State's budgetary and financial position.  It was agreed that the forum would consider appropriate measures in relation to the rates of pay of school secretaries and caretakers in the event that a review of the Public Service Agreements recommended changes to the benefit of those public servants earning &euro;35,000 or less per annum.  This is currently the priority for the Forum and discussions are ongoing. <br\/><br\/>  Secretaries employed by schools using grant funding are not regarded as public servants except for the purposes of the pay reduction under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No.2) Act 2009, due to the definition of &quot;public servant&quot; used in that Act.  The fact that such staff come within the definition of &quot;public servant&quot; solely for the purposes of the Act does not alter their employment status in any other respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600071#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":612,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600071#WRW00350"},{"type":"question","counter":613,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[8546\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600071#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on correspondence (details supplied) from parents of children with Down's syndrome; her plans to provide children with Down's syndrome with an individualised right to resource teaching hours, outside the general allocation system; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

To this end an ambitious target has been set for the scheme for 2015, with 8,400 households to have their housing needs met though HAP by the end of the year.  &euro;23.2 m has been made available for the scheme in 2015.<br\/><br\/>The delivery of the HAP Programme is being overseen by an Oversight Group co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Social Protection, which includes senior management from local authorities.  A detailed business process design exercise for HAP was undertaken in 2013, which included a preliminary examination of the organisational structure required, including change management issues that may arise. <br\/><br\/>The statutory pilot phase of HAP commenced in September 2014 and is now in effect in the following 7 local authority areas: Cork, Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils, Waterford City and County Council , and Limerick City and County Council.  Significant numbers of households are moving on to the scheme on a weekly basis and this rate of transfer continues to increase each week.  Over 900 households are in receipt of HAP at present across these 7 local authority areas.  Dublin City Council is also part of the statutory HAP pilot with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households, as provided for in the Action Plan to Address Homelessness. Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.<br\/><br\/>In order to provide efficiencies and to test processes in the statutory pilot phase of the scheme, Limerick City and County Council is providing a transactional shared service to the participating local authorities.  Generally, existing staff resources and financial management systems are being utilised to implement HAP in these local authorities. Training on the implementation of the scheme has been provided to the local authorities involved by Limerick City and County Council. <br\/><br\/>To date, the Department has recouped &euro;17,500 to Limerick City and County Council in respect of costs incurred in the utilisation of and amendments to a Customer Relationship Management system, which is used to store landlord and tenant information and manage the implementation of HAP. <br\/><br\/>To take account of the increasing workload being undertaken by Limerick City and County Council in providing the transactional services to the relevant local authorities, my Department has provided sanction to the Council for the public recruitment of 15 additional temporary staff at Clerical Officer level.  This recruitment is taking place on a phased basis as the number of HAP recipients increase.  Sanction has also been provided for two Acting Grade V (Staff Officer &ndash; Team Leader) posts for an initial 12 month period.  Resource requirements for the other local authorities involved in the statutory pilot phase of the scheme are being kept under on-going review by my Department , and by the Oversight Group,in the context of the continued roll-out of the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600071#WRW01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Voting","counter":643,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600071#WRW01850"},{"type":"question","counter":644,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[8479\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600071#WRW01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding persons who are out of the country on a polling day (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":645,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[8681\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600071#WRW02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to expand the provision of postal voting for citizens who find themselves out of the country, at the time of a vote, to allow them to register their vote, by means of post, so they do not lose out on their right to vote, as a result of a holiday, business, or family trip; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":646,"content":"<p><table><tr><th>There is no specific definition of the term &ldquo;derelict building&rdquo; in the Derelict Sites Act 1990.

The CAFE Directive was transposed into Irish legislation by the Air Quality Standards Regulations 201. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the competent authority for the Regulations and the CAFE Directive. These regulations require that Member States reduce exposure to PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>depending on baseline levels in ambient air, and not entailing disproportionate costs. For Ireland the national exposure reduction target (NERT) is 10%, assessed by the EPA using baseline data for the years 2009-11. The required reduction in PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>exposure was calculated based on air quality monitoring carried out by the EPA from 2009 - 2011.  There are multiple sources of fine particulate matter pollution and all are harmful to health. Sources include the following: residential heating&ndash; solid fuels; traffic &ndash; exhaust fumes; industry &ndash; emissions to air, Energy &ndash; emissions to air from power stations and refineries; and agriculture, forestries and fisheries &ndash; emissions to air from mobile farm machinery, fishing vessels.<br\/><br\/>Total emissions of PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>reduced in the decade up to 2011 but, without corrective action, are forecast to rise, in particular in the residential, industry and energy sectors, in the years up to 2020. Meeting the NERT will require a broad strategy across policy areas involving industry, the transport sector, the energy sector and all public authorities. <br\/><br\/>The first step in this process has been taken with the establishment of the NERT working group, which is a body of stakeholders, headed by the EPA, who will work to develop and implement the NERT strategy. One feature of the strategy will be an examination of Ireland&rsquo;s residential heating sources, fuel types and the efficiency of the solid fuel heating systems used in Ireland for residential heating. <br\/><br\/>The complex relationship between a reduction in our carbon footprint and decreasing PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>concentrations needs to be tackled in the plans to implement the NERT for 2020. Emissions of PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>from biomass are expected to increase in the residential, commercial and energy sectors. This will offset the reductions achieved from energy efficiency measures in these sectors and other policy initiatives including the extension of the ban on bituminous coal, and so will require consideration to be given to tackling other high emissions residential solid fuels. The potential for emissions abatement in these sectors will be analysed.<br\/><br\/>It is also important that all relevant facilities in the industry and energy sectors are using Best Available Technology to minimise emissions of PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>to air. Policies encouraging the use of biomass should be reviewed to ensure facilities are directed towards efficient combustion methods and towards those biofuels with the lowest emissions. Energy efficiency should continue to be promoted as the primary method to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600072#WRX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Pollution","counter":676,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600072#WRX01350"},{"type":"question","counter":677,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[8582\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600072#WRX01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on the recent report by the Environmental Protection Agency into air quality here in 2013 and in particular the section of the report addressing future challenges (details supplied), which states that the levels of particulate matter in smaller towns are similar to or higher than those in cities where bituminous coal is banned; the actions that he will take to reduce concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PM (Particulate Matter) 10 and PM 2 in such smaller towns and elsewhere; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":678,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[8586\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600072#WRX01500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on the recent report of the Environmental Protection Agency entitled Air Quality in Ireland 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":679,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 231 and 232 together.   <\/p>  <p>  Air quality monitoring in Ireland is carried out to meet the requirements of EU Directive 2008\/50\/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, also known as the CAFE Directive. The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality. The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network. <\/p>  <p>  The EPA publishes an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive. The most recent report, Air Quality in Ireland 2013 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, was published in October 2014 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2013, compared to the CAFE Directive standards as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health.   <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that downward trends have been identified for many pollutants and that Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality , while noting that Ireland exceeds WHO air quality guideline value s for particulate matter in some areas. Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in areas where the sale of smoky coal is permitted. Because of this, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns are similar or higher than those in cities where smoky coal is banned. To help protect our good air quality, the Irish consumer must become more aware of their choice in home heating fuel and the potential impact that choice can have on air quality in their locality and on human health.   <\/p>  <p>  In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations (S.I. No. 326 of 2012) were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels   . The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones. While my Department keeps the matter under regular review, I have no immediate plans at present to extend the ban to new towns. <\/p>  <p>  Air quality monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply, although there is evidence that smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective. The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas. Similarly, the border with Northern Ireland would present enforcement challenges if a national ban on smoky coal were unilaterally introduced.

Section 24 of the 2009 Act states that the Authority shall be independent in the performance of its functions.<br\/><br\/>The revised Code was approved by the Authority in November 2013 on the recommendation of the Finance Audit and Risk Committee and is available on the website of the BAI.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>The Code contains a number of specific provisions governing matters of conflict of interest. In addition, members of the statutory Authority and Committees are subject to the obligations placed on them by the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Acts, 1995 and 2001.\u00a0Authority and Committee members are also subject to Sections 21 and 22 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which provides for the disclosure of any conflicts of interest. In addition, Section 20 of the Broadcasting Act places duties of accountability to Oireachtas Committees on the Chief Executive, Chairperson of the Authority and the Chairpersons of the Statutory Compliance and Contract Awards Committees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600074#WRZ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":716,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600074#WRZ01000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wild Atlantic Way Project","counter":715,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600074#WRZ00900"},{"type":"question","counter":716,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[8507\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600074#WRZ01000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding Valentia Island, County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":717,"content":"<p>While my Department provides the capital funding for investment in tourism offerings such as the Wild Atlantic Way, it is not directly involved in developing or managing these.\u00a0 The development of the Wild Atlantic Way is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.\u00a0Accordingly\u00a0I have referred the question to the agency for direct reply.\u00a0 Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 days.    \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the route of the Wild Atlantic Way was developed using a collaborative approach and\u00a0regional steering groups were convened to inform route development.
