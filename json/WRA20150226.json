That is because we believe it is critically important for our economy and for the ongoing development of British-Irish relations.  It is also our view that the EU itself is stronger and better with the UK as a full and committed member. We must therefore do what we can to help to encourage the UK to remain within the Union.  This means, as a starting point, continuing to work closely with our British partners &ndash; as well as other like-minded States &ndash; on policy issues where we share the same interests and approach.  The British Government and other British political parties have made clear that the achievement of common aims in regard to economic policy &ndash; including the completion of the single market in services, the conclusion of trade negotiations with third countries and a more streamlined approach to EU regulation &ndash; is a high priority in itself and will strengthen the case for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership.  Depending on the outcome of their general election in May, it is possible that the next British Government will make proposals on both how the functioning of the EU could be improved and specific UK concerns addressed.  Ireland will certainly consider any reasonable proposals on their merits, if and when they are presented.  We have a clear shared interest in seeing our Union operate more effectively.  We also recognise &ndash; as the European Council has done &ndash; that the UK has some legitimate concerns that should be addressed.  At the same time, we would not support anything which we think could weaken or otherwise adversely affect the Union.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is monitoring developments in the EU-UK relationship very carefully.  My Department is co-operating with other Departments, especially the Department of the Taoiseach, in this regard.  Our Embassy in London naturally plays a key role in this process and we rely heavily too on the reporting and analysis we receive from our Embassies elsewhere. <\/p>  <p>  We are also, of course, engaging directly with our British colleagues on the question of their EU membership.  I myself had a detailed discussion with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond when he visited Dublin in December.  The subject has arisen as well in informal contacts with other British Ministers and our officials &ndash; in this Department, the Department of the Taoiseach and elsewhere &ndash; are engaging regularly with their counterparts in the UK system.  The UK&rsquo;s place in Europe is also regularly discussed with other EU partners at both political and senior official level.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the nature of the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU is primarily an issue for the British people and we must continue to respect and be sensitive to the democratic process under way there.

Continuing violence and threats have forced almost two million people to flee their homes.  The country&rsquo;s warring parties signed another ceasefire agreement in February following regional talks led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which were supported by the African Union and the European Union.

Some 2.5 million people are facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity.  Malnutrition rates among children have more than doubled.

There has been an increase in tensions in the prison in recent weeks.  This is due in part to the issuing of threats by prisoners against Prison Service officials in a context where a serving prison officer, David Black, was murdered by dissidents in November 2012.  It is also related to recent construction work in Roe House intended to increase the space available to prisoners in the separated regime for association.  However, it appears the well meaning intentions behind the works were not effectively communicated in advance to inmates.   <\/p>  <p>  A protest by a small number of prisoners on 2 February ended with both the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, David Ford, and the Director General of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, Sue McAllister, reporting no injuries to staff or prisoners.  I am aware that some prisoners have said that they were injured during the protest.  Members of the independent assessment team have since met with prisoners and prison management to hear their perspectives on the protest and on how best to take things forward.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the increase in tension, I take some encouragement from renewed calls by both the Northern Ireland Prison Service and prisoner representatives for the full implementation of the stocktake report.  It is important that this work continue with the good will and support of all the relevant stake holders.  The Northern Ireland Prison Service has reiterated its commitment to the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  It would certainly facilitate progress if all threats against those working in the prison administration were lifted.  All such threats are completely unacceptable, and serve only to frustrate the process of improving the atmosphere in the prison.  The independent assessment group continues with their engagement, to encourage the implementation of their recommendations, and would be open to a meeting with the Deputy to discuss on-going concerns.  I have discussed prison issues with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions, most recently on 11 February.  I also met in January with a member of the independent assessment group which completed the stocktake Report of September 2014.  My officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continuously monitor the situation at Maghaberry Prison, including through contact with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Office and officials in the Northern Ireland Prison Service, as well as members of the independent assessment group, and have been keeping me closely informed of developments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Summits","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[8240\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the priorities for Ireland at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit; and the way he will address these matters in the May 2015 meeting here.","asker":"1005","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>We currently face an unprecedented scale of humanitarian need around the world.

Furthermore, Ireland condemns all forms of arbitrary, summary and extrajudicial executions.  <br\/><br\/>In November 2014 Ireland, together with the other EU Member States, co-sponsored the UN General Assembly&rsquo;s resolution on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.  At the core of this resolution are the right to life and the fight against impunity.  Notably, by way of this resolution, the General Assembly expressed its deep concern<i><\/i>about acts that can amount to extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions committed against persons exercising their rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression in all regions of the world, and about killings committed by non-State actors, including terrorist groups and criminal organisations, that may amount to abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law.<br\/><br\/>The strong text of this resolution includes references to killings of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities or because of their sexual orientation or gender identity; killings of persons for reasons related to their activities as human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists or demonstrators; killings of persons affected by terrorism or hostage-taking or living under foreign occupation, racially motivated killings, killings of refugees, internally displaced persons, migrants, street children or members of indigenous communities, killings committed in the name of passion or in the name of honour, and killings committed for discriminatory reasons on any basis.<br\/><br\/>In June 2014, during the 26<sup>th<\/sup>session of the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland co-sponsored the resolution which renewed the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions.

In circumstances where the Court has jurisdiction by virtue of such executions taking place in the territory of a state party or state that has accepted the Court&rsquo;s role, or by the national of such a state, or where the United Nations Security Council has determined that the ICC has jurisdiction, prosecutions may be brought against alleged perpetrators in appropriate circumstances. <br\/><br\/>Let me reassure the Deputy that Ireland is committed to upholding the respect for international law in order to prevent extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions in all circumstances and to working for the complete abolition of the death penalty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Strategy","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA03150"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[8267\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600050#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the role his Department and the embassy network are playing regarding the Year of Irish Design 2015, which is aiming to promote and support Irish craft and design at home and abroad.","asker":"1110","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>Irish Design 2015 (ID2015) emerged as an idea from the Global Irish Economic Forum convened by my Department in 2013.

These are monstrous acts beyond comprehension, which must be condemned in the strongest possible terms.  They are also savage attacks on minority communities and on the values of tolerance and pluralism which underpin freedom of religion or belief.  Ireland has repeatedly recalled the duty of States to protect vulnerable minorities in the Middle East, including Christian communities. I have reiterated that call and will be raising this with my EU colleagues at the earliest opportunity. The situation is particularly difficult, of course, in areas where the authority of the state has effectively collapsed.   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities.  We consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including the EU and UN.  I highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014.  I also raised it during my meeting with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013.  These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected.  They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  The EU leads resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at both the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and at the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva, of which Ireland is currently a member.  Ireland is an active participant in the negotiation of these resolutions.  In 2014, the EU-led resolutions on freedom of religion or belief were successfully adopted without a vote by the HRC (March 2014) and by the UN General Assembly during its 69th session (December 2014).

The package also contains a timetable for the implementation of key parts of the September Minsk Agreements, which provide the basis for a comprehensive resolution of the crisis.   <\/p>  <p>  The ceasefire came into effect at midnight on 14 February.  The OSCE has reported that it had largely held across most parts of the conflict area, with the notable exception of Debaltseve, a strategically important transport hub linking the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk.  Despite signing the ceasefire agreement, Russian-backed separatists continued a full scale assault on Debaltseve forcing Ukrainian troops to withdraw from the town, which is now in rebel hands.  I strongly condemn the rebel assault on Debaltseve.  It is a major breach of the ceasefire and threatens to undermine the peace deal agreed in Minsk on 12 February. <\/p>  <p>  Having achieved their objective in Debaltseve, it remains to be seen whether the rebels may now take steps to implement the ceasefire and withdraw their heavy weapons.  Russia has a key role to play in this regard given the considerable influence it exercises over the separatists groups.      <\/p>  <p>  Events last weekend, particularly the release of prisoners and the commitment by both sides to begin withdrawing heavy weapons this week, are positive signs. However, there have been worrying reports about shelling near Mariupol city.   <\/p>  <p>  Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Poroshenko, President Putin and their Foreign Ministers remain in telephone contact and have indicated that they will continue to push for implementation of the package of measures agreed in Minsk on 12 February.   <\/p>  <p>  On 17 February, the UN Security Council unanimously called on all parties to immediately cease hostilities and abide by the commitments agreed in Minsk, including facilitating access for the OSCE Mission to enable them to monitor the situation on the ground.

A reform of the Northern Ireland corporation tax rate has the potential to generate benefits on both parts of the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600055#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Stress Tests","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600055#WRF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[8703\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600055#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of additional capital required by PermanentTSB, arising from the recent European Central Bank stress tests; the steps the bank, he and his officials are undertaking to address the shortfall; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>The Comprehensive Assessment Adverse Stress Test result announced in October 2014\u00a0identified a capital shortfall of &euro;855 million.

The Act does not accord me as Minister any function in this regard.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are two provisions in the legislation governing the assessment of valuations which result in the issue of valuation certificates, i.e. revaluation and revision. They are dealt with under Parts 5 and 6 of the Valuation Act 2001 respectively. There has been no change in the legislative provisions during this D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Revision of valuation is the mechanism used to maintain local authority valuations lists. It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. By contrast, in a revaluation the entire commercial valuation list for a local authority is brought up-to-date by reference to a specific valuation date. The entire list is published on one date (usually 31 December) and it comes into effect for rating purposes on 1 January the following year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The revaluation of a rating authority area is commenced by the making of a Valuation Order by the Commissioner of Valuation which among other things specifies the publication date of the new valuation list. It is for the Commissioner to set the publication date which would take account of factors such as the number of items to be valued. The Act states that the publication date shall not be more than three years after the date the valuation order is made. In practice the gap between the date the valuation order was signed and the publication date is between 24 and 33 months. Prior to 2011 the gap was between 26 and 33 months. Since 2011 the gap between the order date and the publication date has been between 24 and 33 months. As can be seen from the figures below nearly 2\/3 of the properties revalued have been completed on valuation orders signed in 2011 or later with 1\/3 of properties\u00a0revalued on valuation orders signed between 2005 and 2011.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To-date, revaluations of all local authorities in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick have been completed comprising approximately 49,500 properties, representing approx. 57% of the national rateable valuation base in monetary value terms or 33% in numerical terms. In addition, 13 public utilities representing some of the largest ratepayers in the State have been valued on a national basis. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2011, as part of the national revaluation programme the Valuation Office has issued in excess of 32,000 proposed valuation certificates and 31,482 final valuation certificates, all within the required timelines. The latter are broken down as follows:<\/p>  <p>  Dublin City 20,845<\/p>  <p>  Waterford City &amp;amp; County 3,917<\/p>  <p>  Limerick City &amp;amp; County 6,720<\/p>  <p>  Valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined under Part 6 of the Valuation Act 2001, by reference to the net annual values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. The Act provides for applications for revision to be made to the Commissioner by an occupier, a rating authority, an interest holder in a rateable property or the occupier of another rateable property in that same rating authority area. On receipt of a revision application the Commissioner appoints a revision officer to deal with the application and the Act requires that officer to deal with that application within 6 months of his\/her appointment. <\/p>  <p>  Revision applications are received on an ongoing basis throughout the year and, in so far as reasonably practicable, the statutory timelines provided for in the Valuation Act 2001 are adhered to. While there are always some arrears of revision casework, these are not significant.

These events show that all States must remain vigilant and attentive to the risks posed by international terrorism. <br\/><br\/>Ireland, like any other democratic country with similar values, is not immune to a threat from international terrorism.  While an attack on Ireland is possible it is not assessed as likely and there is no specific information in relation to a threat to Ireland.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are keeping the level of threat from international terrorism under continuous review in light of ongoing developments and continuing to take all appropriate measures to counteract this threat.  In this they have the full support of the Government.<br\/><br\/>The radicalising affect of online propaganda must also be dealt with and this is a matter which has received direct attention from EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers at our recent meetings.  Indeed, this has been a focus of actions at EU level for a number of years now, particularly in the context of the EU's Strategy for combating radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism and the EU's Internal security strategy.  The Deputy will wish to know that the recent informal meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers focused on the international terrorism and foreign fighters issues.  Ireland along with its European counterparts is seeking to work with all relevant stakeholders to develop further initiatives in this domain.<br\/><br\/>The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary legislation is in place to address terrorist threats.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 has already passed all stages in the Seanad.  It is expected that the Bill will come before the D&aacute;il shortly.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>The Bill, when enacted, will create the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy will appreciate, any response to this issue must be proportionate to the level of the threat and multi-faceted in approach.  In addition to conventional security measures, engagement with minority or at risk communities is an essential element of the response.  In that context, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates a progressive programme of community engagement with minority communities.  The aim of these programmes is to build a sense of inclusiveness amongst minority communities and to address feelings of marginalisation in order to avoid providing  fertile ground for radicalisation and those seeking to radicalise others. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600058#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Title","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600058#WRJ00450"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[8495\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600058#WRJ00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the land registration status in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established as and from 4 November 2006.

The figures published up to Quarter 2 in 2014 indicate a reduction in the overall number of offences recorded in the 12 months to that date.<br\/><br\/>Insofar as burglary offences are concerned, and as I indicated in my remarks as referred to by the Deputy, I am very conscious of the concerns which relate to these crimes and working closely with the Garda Commissioner and other relevant criminal justice agencies to ensure that an effective, whole of system response is in place.  I understand that the general trend is that, having fallen in 2013, there has been an increase in such offences during 2014.<br\/><br\/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are pursuing a range of strategies to tackle this, including the establishment of Burglary Response Units and through operations such as Operation Fiacla and Operation Acer, which are focusing on identifying and targeting the criminal groups who have played a large part in the recent increase.  In addition to these policing responses, I am also carrying out a broader and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries. This includes a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues. Burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime, and I am determined to tackle it on a number of fronts, and through a partnership approach between criminal justice agencies and the community.  <br\/><br\/>In relation to the closure of Garda stations, the Deputy will be aware that the decisions made in 2013 in this regard were the result of a comprehensive operational assessment carried out by the Garda Commissioner, the objective of which was to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible.  In particular, freeing up Garda&iacute; from desk duties has increased the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing and confronting crime.  While the deployment of resources is kept under review at all times by the Garda Commissioner, none of the advice to me suggests that the closure of Garda stations is a significant factor in the recent increase in burglary, or that its reopening would contribute materially to a solution.  Tackling highly mobile gangs involved in burglary will not be helped by reopening Garda stations, as to do so would take Garda&iacute; away from visible front line policing and crime prevention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600058#WRJ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Orders","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600058#WRJ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[8515\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022600058#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 319 of 27 January 2015, if she will confirm the identity of each of the five-man team who carried out an eviction in Clane, County Kildare, on 9 January 2015, one of whom indicated to the tenant that he was a garda with powers of arrest and subsequently appeared at the premises driving a vehicle in which the landlord was a passenger; if such practice is in accordance with any particular operational code of conduct or whether civilians are authorised to operate in such a fashion; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":289,"content":"<p>I hope the Deputy will appreciate that I have no official responsibility in relation to the identification of the persons referred to by the Deputy, or in relation to enforcement of court orders in respect of these matters.  <\/p>  <p>  As I previously informed the Deputy, Garda&iacute; attended the address referred to following telephone requests from both the tenant and landlord.

As well as introducing an option for persons to pay fines by instalment, there are also changes in the way those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, with a range of options available to judges including recovery orders, attachment of earnings, community service and ultimately imprisonment.  <br\/><br\/>Work is ongoing in preparing for the implementation of the Act.

The Courts Service is introducing new arrangements for the payment of fines which will allow payments to be made in a range of outlets across the country, and not just through Courts Service offices.  There are significant changes in information technology required to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments. Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.  <br\/><br\/>It is expected that all the preparations for the new system will be completed by the third quarter of 2015.
