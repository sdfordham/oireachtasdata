The final position will be known in the Autumn.<\/p><p><b>Schools That Lost A Post in 2012\/13 School Year<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Roll No<\/th><th>School Name<\/th><th>Outcome<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>17174E<\/td><td>S N Bhrighde, Cuan, Carlow, Co Carlow<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>06998Q<\/td><td>St Patrick'S Ns, Corlough, Belturbet Post Office, Co Leitrim, Via Co Cavan<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>12099O<\/td><td>Billis N S, New Inn, Ballyjamesduff, Co Cavan<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>17630E<\/td><td>S N Maodhog, Cnoc Brighde, Bailieboro, Co Cavan<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>17633K<\/td><td>S N Eoin Baiste, Ballyvaughan, Via Galway, Co Clare<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>05636A<\/td><td>Dunmanway Model N S, Dunmanway, Co Cork<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>17079K<\/td><td>S N Carraig An Ime, Macroom, Co Cork<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>17281F<\/td><td>Togher N S, Dunmanway, Co Cork<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>17533G<\/td><td>S N Rathain, Mallow, Co Cork<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>18549D<\/td><td>S N Cnoc Na Croighe, Cnoc Na Groighe, Mallow, Co Cork<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>19978I<\/td><td>Maulatrahane Central Ns, Leap, Skibbereen, Co Cork<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>14631O<\/td><td>Scoil Cholmchille, Malin, Lifford, Co Donegal<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>16384K<\/td><td>Sn Arainn Mhor Ii, Arainn Mhor, Co Dhun Na Ngall<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>16819T<\/td><td>S N Gort An Choirce, Leitir Ceanainn, Co Dhun Na Ngall<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>16829W<\/td><td>S N Loch An Iubhair, Anagaire, Leitir Ceanainn, Tir Chonaill<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>18219F<\/td><td>Sn Chonaill, Machaire Chlochair, Bun Beag, Co Dhun Na Ngall<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>18251B<\/td><td>Ayr Hill N S Ramelton, Ramelton, Letterkenny, Co Donegal<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>18286U<\/td><td>S N Na Hacrai, Ailt An Chorrain, Leitirceanainn, Co Dhun Na Ngall<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>19252I<\/td><td>S N Umlach, Carrigart, Co Donegal<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>20144M<\/td><td>Gaelscoil Chois Feabhaill, Gaa, Bun An Phobail, Co Dhun Na Ngall<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>18642Q<\/td><td>S N Naomh Eoin, Tower Road, Clondalkin, Dublin 22<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>10591I<\/td><td>S N An Ard Mhoir, Carna, Conamara, Co Na Gaillimhe<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>10763L<\/td><td>Boston N S, Tubber, Gort, Co Galway<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>11261P<\/td><td>Scoil Mhuire, An Tuairin, Beal An Daingin, Co Na Gaillimhe<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>14377D<\/td><td>S N Cill Conaill, Cill Conaill, Beal Atha Na Sluagh, Co Na Gaillimhe<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>17760R<\/td><td>S N Baile An Leasa, Dunmore, Tuam, Co Galway<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>17922R<\/td><td>Cloghans Hill N S, Tuam, Co Galway<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>18113M<\/td><td>S N Cill Solain, Killasolan, Caltra, Ballinasloe, Co Galway<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>18289D<\/td><td>Scoil Naomh Iosef, Castlehackett, Belclare Tuam, Co Galway<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>19283T<\/td><td>Ballymacward Central Sc, Ballymacward Central Sc, Ballinasloe, Co Galway<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>09938N<\/td><td>Curranes N S, Castleisland, Co Kerry<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>18233W<\/td><td>Scoil Paroisteach, Tralee, Co Kerry<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>18756I<\/td><td>Fibough National School, Caislean Na Mainge, Co Chiarrai<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>19492F<\/td><td>Sn Oilibhear Naofa, Beal Ata Longphuirt, Co Chiarrai<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>19986H<\/td><td>S N Eoin Baiste, Garrai Na Dtor, Liospoil, Co Chiarrai<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>17557U<\/td><td>Scoil Abbain Cillin, Maganey, Athy, Co Kildare<\/td><td>Successful Appeal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>14476F<\/td><td>Wandesforde Mixed N S, Castlecomer, Co Kilkenny<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>18075H<\/td><td>Rathdomhnaigh N S, Rathdowney, Co Laois<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>17558W<\/td><td>S N Rosan, Carrigallen, Co.

For further information on DARE see also www.accesscollege.ie.

This is a normal facet of the management of pupil behaviour. Where used, it will normally form part of a school's response to behaviour and part of student support structures, procedures and practices.<\/p><p>  Some special schools for pupils with severe emotional behavioural disorders, or Autism, where there are a greater number of pupils likely to exhibit distressed behaviour, may use a room which is designated as a safe space for withdrawal purposes, in order to ensure pupil safety and to prevent self-harm or harm to other pupils.<\/p><p>  These rooms are variously described as 'withdrawal rooms', 'time-out rooms', or 'safe spaces'.

Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.<\/p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.<\/p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents and I am not currently in a position to re-examine the scheme.  I again wish to re-iterate that the parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.

On the same day, my German, French and Polish counterparts were in Kiev for discussions with the Government and opposition and we were kept regularly informed during the Council of their efforts to broker an agreement that would help find a negotiated solution to the ongoing crisis there.  The three Foreign Ministers also offered some valuable input into the drafting of the conclusions that were adopted at the end of our meeting.<\/p><p>  Those conclusions, which are available on the Council website, called for an immediate end to the violence, full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right of access to medical assistance, and for urgent independent investigations into human rights violations.  The importance of the International Advisory Panel set up by the Council of Europe was underlined in this regard.<\/p><p>  The Council also called on all sides to engage in an inclusive dialogue to de-escalate the situation and find a lasting political solution that would include constitutional reform, the formation of a new government and the creation of conditions for democratic elections.  It was stressed that the prime responsibility for taking the first step to enable such a dialogue rests with President Yanukovych and the Ukrainian authorities.<\/p><p>  In view of the deteriorating situation, the Council also decided as a matter of urgency to introduce targeted sanctions, including an asset freeze and visa ban against those responsible for human rights violations, violence and use of excessive force.  The EU also agreed to suspend exports licences on equipment that might be used for internal repression.  In my intervention at Council, I recalled that the current crisis began following decisions made about an agreement between the Union and Ukraine and expressed the view that it was only right that the EU should play an active role in finding a solution that is democratic, lasting and fulfils the legitimate aspirations of the Ukrainian people.<\/p><p>  I have, therefore, warmly welcomed publicly the agreement reached in Kiev last Friday which was brokered by the three EU Foreign Ministers mentioned and which contains the central elements that the Council considered essential for such a solution.  I hope that this agreement will help bring an immediate end to the violence and bloodshed.  It is important that there are clear timeframes for fulfilment of the commitments that have been entered into and that it has been witnessed by representatives of the international community, Russia as well as the EU.<\/p><p>  These key elements, the rejection of violence and pursuit of constitutional reform, the formation of an inclusive new government and the creation of conditions for democratic elections, remain valid even after the dramatic developments over the weekend.  We look to those now in power in Ukraine to behave in a responsible manner and to work in an inclusive way to prepare the elections that have been scheduled for May.  For our part, the Council conclusions make clear that the EU offer of political association and economic integration remains on the table and that the EU is ready to support Ukraine in the process of reform to deliver a stable, prosperous and democratic future for its citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD00750"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[9079\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on reports of the deaths of 450 migrant workers from India in Qatar in 2012 and 2013; his further views regarding Qatar's hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup; the bilateral contacts Ireland has with Qatar; if he will express concern and protest about the deaths of these persons to Qatar, FIFA and the UN; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>I am very concerned regarding reports of abuses of migrant workers&rsquo; rights in Qatar, and strongly deplore any such abuses.  Qatar has the highest ratio of migrants to citizens in the world; nearly 88 per cent of the total population are foreign workers, employed largely in construction, services and domestic work.  The presence of large numbers of migrant workers in the Gulf area, especially in construction, is of course a long-standing phenomenon and does not relate solely to the World Cup.<\/p><p>  In November 2013, following an eight day investigative visit to the Emirate, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Fran&ccedil;ois Cr&eacute;peau, urged the Qatari authorities to ensure that its labour laws are reformed so that migrants are granted the right to form and join trade unions, have access to proper grievance procedures, and are granted a minimum wage.  He also called on the Government to review the foreign worker sponsorship system (Kafala) which has been linked to migrant workers&rsquo; abuse.  Under the system, expatriate employees are barred from changing jobs or leaving the country without their sponsor&rsquo;s permission.  Mr. Cr&eacute;peau welcomed some positive legislative developments in the area such as the provision which makes it illegal for sponsors to confiscate passports, and called for effective enforcement of the law.<\/p><p>  I fully support the findings of Mr. Cr&eacute;peau and call on the Qatari Government to continue to cooperate with his office and the UN International Labour Organisation and to implement their recommendations in order to improve the situation of migrant workers and their families in the country.  I believe it is critical that Qatar proves it is making real efforts to improve the protection of the rights of all workers, including construction workers, ahead of the FIFA World Cup scheduled for 2022.  In this regard, I welcome FIFA&rsquo;s promises to demand high standards of workers&rsquo; rights and its recent request for a detailed report on improvements implemented following FIFA President Sepp Blatter&rsquo;s visit to the Emirate last November.<\/p><p>  In relation to the specific issue of the deaths of 455 Indians in Qatar over the course of 2012 and 2013, as recently published by the Indian Embassy in Doha, it should be noted that, according to reports, a spokesman for the Indian Foreign Ministry has stated that the &lsquo;overwhelming number&rsquo; of these deaths were due to natural causes.  There are approximately 500,000 Indians living in the Emirate.  The Indian authorities have stated that the number of Indian deaths in the last five years have remained consistent and are not attributable to any one cause.  The Qatar National Human Rights Committee has called on the Indian Embassy to provide further details on the circumstances of the deaths and I would support this.  My officials will continue to closely monitor the issue.<\/p><p>  More broadly, the promotion and protection of migrant workers rights throughout the world, including in Qatar, will remain a priority for Ireland.  My Department will avail of every appropriate opportunity to raise the issue both bilaterally, through the Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi which is also accredited to Qatar, and through relevant multilateral channels, including through the UN and EU human rights mechanisms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[9502\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will support the Argentine Republic on its legitimate rights on the sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.","asker":"1017","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>The issue to which the Deputy refers concerns the long-running dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom regarding sovereignty over an area that includes the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) as well the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands.

The atrocities perpetrated by the DPRK authorities make chilling reading and expose the brutality of what is described in the report as a totalitarian state &ldquo;which seeks to dominate every aspect of its citizens&rsquo; lives and terrorise them from within&rdquo;.  There is clearly a case to answer and I call on the DPRK authorities to engage with the UN process.  The entire international community has an obligation to the people of the DPRK who have suffered so grievously.<\/p><p>  The Commission will formally present its findings to the United Nations Human Rights Council on 17th March.  The EU and Japan will table a resolution on human rights in DPRK during the March session of the HRC which will seek to take forward the recommendations made by the Commission.  Drafting of the resolution is at a preliminary stage but I can assure you that Ireland will strongly support efforts to ensure follow-up to the recommendations, including those on accountability for human rights violations.

When I addressed the UN General Assembly on 28 September 2013, I pledged Ireland&rsquo;s full support to the efforts of the UN Secretary General in his efforts to lead a global campaign for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender rights.  I also had the honour of addressing the Annual Conference of the International Lesbian and Gay Association of Europe (ILGA-Europe) on 21 October 2012, when I affirmed that LGBTI rights are human rights.<\/p><p>  At the UN, Ireland co-sponsored the landmark Resolution at the Human Rights Council (HRC) on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity in 2011.  As members of the HRC, we will continue to promote the advancement of LGBTI rights, including through the Universal Periodic Review process.  At the EU level, Ireland engaged extensively in the drafting process for the new EU Guidelines on the enjoyment of all human rights by LGBTI persons, which were adopted at the final Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union on 24 June 2013.<\/p><p>  I am deeply concerned by the news that Uganda is enacting legislation to criminalise homosexuality.  I have made it clear, including in direct talks with President Museveni, that the enactment of this legislation would affect our valued relationship with Uganda.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, has engaged actively with the Ugandan Parliament and President Museveni in an effort to halt the regressive and discriminatory Anti-Homosexuality Bill.  It is in clear conflict with Uganda&rsquo;s binding international obligations to uphold human rights.  It is a threat to Uganda&rsquo;s gay community and an affront to all those who value tolerance, respect and dignity of all people.<\/p><p>  I am also concerned at the recent adoption of the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act in Nigeria.  I welcome and fully support the statement of 15 January by the EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, which highlighted the EU&rsquo;s serious concerns with this legislation.  We will continue to urge the Nigerian authorities to reconsider the Act in light of Nigeria&rsquo;s constitutional and international obligations and in the meantime to exercise the utmost restraint in its enforcement.<\/p><p>  Our aid programme is amongst the best in the world and has a clear focus on poverty reduction and on assisting some of the most marginalised people in the developing world.  Good governance and human rights are key elements of our development programme and we provide assistance to civil society organisations promoting human rights and also for Human Rights Commissions tasked with upholding human rights in some of our Partner Countries.  Our aid programme and our international reputation enables us to dialogue directly with Governments on a range of human rights issues.  We also do this in close cooperation with other donor partners.  This maximises our influence in this enormously important area.  We are also ready to take action, as we have done in Uganda, when serious issues of governance arise.  But we also want to ensure that the poorest of the poor are not penalised for the faults of their governments and we seek to look at ways of delivering assistance effectively for the benefit of the poor.  Ireland will continue its efforts internationally to promote human rights, including LGBTI rights, and to give support to organisations and institutions that are active in the human rights field, many of whom are operating in very difficult environments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD01700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[9068\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which legislation is likely to be introduced which might have a bearing on the mis-selling of financial products by financial institutions with particular reference to the need to protect the consumer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[9069\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the alleged mis-selling of financial products has been brought to his attention in respect of the sale of such products to consumers over the past ten years to date; if any particular response is required under existing legislation in such circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 194 together.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank introduced the Consumer Protection Code in 2006 to mitigate against the risk of mis-selling financial products to consumers.  This was further enhanced by the 2012 Consumer Protection Code.  Occasionally, the Central Bank receives individual consumer complaints about mis-selling and these are looked at on case by case basis.  In addition, the Financial Services Ombudsman may make recommendations to the Bank on measures to deal with persistent patterns of complaints.<\/p><p>  In 2009 the then Financial Regulator conducted a four part examination of selected credit institutions, life insurance firms and investment and stockbroking firms in relation to the suitability of investment products sold to older consumers.  A number of issues of concern were identified during this examination such as instances where basic client information such as income and assets\/liabilities were not recorded on the fact finding documentation of firms, not all institutions offer older customers the option of having a third party present at a sales meeting, and in certain cases firms did not give customers any advice on the level of emergency funds that should be maintained to provide for medical or other long term care expenses.<\/p><p>  More recently, the Central Bank of Ireland has been conducting an\u00a0investigation into the sales of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI).  Eleven firms were required to\u00a0review sales\u00a0and, where appropriate, offer a refund to their customers where the PPI sale is found to be in breach of the Consumer Protection Code (the Code) since July 2007.  The aim of this Review is to provide a straight-forward mechanism for the consumer to be redressed where policies were sold in breach of the Code, without any cost to the consumer.  The Review should eliminate the need for consumers who were sold PPI by the firms above since 1 July 2007 to engage third parties or go through a legal process.  The latest\u00a0 information on the PPI review is that the review of the 11 firms is drawing to close and all customers covered by this review have been contacted, with the vast majority of those eligible for a refund, having already received their refunds.  I expect the Central Bank will issue a statement in Q1 when the investigation has been completed to its satisfaction.  If the Deputy is aware of any additional specific issue with mis-selling, I would appreciate if he could provide the relevant details to my Department or directly to the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes Funding","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD01950"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[9104\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 364 of 11 February 2014, the reason the &euro;240 million designated as external source of finance is in fact an equity investment by him, it is not listed under Exchequer or own resources funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[9205\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if &euro;240 million will be allocated from his Department to Irish Water this year; and if he is aware of what this specific allocation will be used to fund.","asker":"1020","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 172 and 200 together.<\/p><p>  Irish Water's costs in the coming years will be funded through a mix of revenue from the domestic and non-domestic sector, third party finance (such as\u00a0the\u00a0Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, EIB, bank lending and capital markets facilities) and State support which may be in the form of both equity and subvention.

There is agreement in principle but with some operational details to be finally sorted by the insurance companies.

Flood cover claims are generally significant and in order to provide such cover, insurance companies would say that they have to be satisfied that the potential for such floods arising is low.  It is a matter for the\u00a0industry\u00a0to set its\u00a0premiums\u00a0and make provisions\u00a0at\u00a0the appropriate\u00a0level to\u00a0ensure\u00a0that\u00a0it can\u00a0cope with\u00a0flood\u00a0and\u00a0subsidence\u00a0issues.  Furthermore, as a matter of course, insurance companies carry out reviews of the risks they are prepared to insure against and sometimes make decisions to discontinue certain types of cover which they consider high risk, such as homes in an area which is prone to subsidence.  Insurance Ireland indicate that 98% of policyholders have household insurance which includes flood cover and the percentage for policyholders with household insurance which include subsidence cover is higher than 98%.<\/p><p>  Government policy in relation to flooding aims to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible.  The Office of Public Works is committed to alleviating the impact of flooding through the provision of defences based on\u00a0a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.  This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016.  Works are completed on a prioritised basis.  Once these works are completed the availability of flood insurance in affected areas would be expected to increase.<\/p><p>  I have no plans at present to introduce legislation relating to flooding insurance.  However, the Deputy will be aware that as part of the response to the recent flooding events, the Department of Finance\u00a0is currently undertaking a review of the availability of flood insurance cover.  When the review is complete, I will examine it and will report to Cabinet on what measures, if any, are needed to improve the availability of flood insurance cover.<\/p><p>  As regards industry initiatives, my colleague, Minister of State Hayes at the Office of Public Works has taken the lead role in discussions with the insurance industry about improving the provision of insurance cover in areas where remedial works are being carried out and OPW is near agreement on a data-sharing platform which will facilitate the transfer of detailed information on completed OPW flood relief schemes on an on-going basis.  This will allow the insurance industry to take into account the flood protection measures when assessing flood risk in localities where such flood measures have been completed.<\/p><p>  While the agreement on the memorandum of understanding with the insurance industry is to be welcomed as a first step, ultimately, there are no plans to introduce legislation in this area and it will be a matter for the insurance companies themselves to decide how they will use the information provided on completed flood defence works but\u00a0they are committing to take the information into account in their assessment of risk and it is to be expected that this will facilitate the provision of flood cover in\u00a0areas that are protected by completed schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Expenditure","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD04350"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[8986\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500056#WRD04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the rates liquidators are permitted to charge the National Asset Management Agency following the tender process for insolvency services that NAMA undertook; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>I am advised by NAMA that it does not appoint liquidators from its insolvency practitioner panels.

This approach was primarily adopted to delay the application of the carbon tax to solid fuel in the residential sector to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower sulphur standards apply.\u00a0 Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011.<\/p><p>  The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels was further postponed in 2012 given the overall tax increases in Budget 2012 including in the standard rate of VAT.  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.\u00a0 It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels. As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed.<\/p><p>  As I was aware of the potential impact on lower income households, I chose not to introduce the carbon tax on solid fuels until after the 2012\/2103 winter period and I opted to introduce the tax in two phases i.e. &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1 May 2013 and a further &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1 May 2014 thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels i.e. at &euro;20 per tonne of CO2.  While tax increases are unpopular, where Member States are under fiscal pressure, it makes sense to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise, in this instance a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.

The German Government has asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities swiftly, in order to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date.<\/p><p>  Officials at my Department with assistance from staff of the NPRF have worked quickly to investigate ways to ensure that the benefit of this cooperation to Irish SMEs can be maximised.<\/p><p>  A small party of my officials travelled to a meeting with their counterparts in Berlin in early December and a week later a similar meeting was held at KfW's headquarters in Frankfurt. Officials from KfW and the German Ministry have also met with the project team from Ireland in Dublin for a further exchange shortly before Christmas. Both sides have been represented at senior management level for each engagement.\u00a0In addition, there have been regular conference calls between the parties since then.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, KfW channel their funding for SMEs in Germany through a system of on-lending using commercial banks in Germany as the distribution mechanism.

This model is similar to the on lending arrangements available to Irish domestic institutions using funds from the European Investment Bank.<\/p><p>  The precise arrangements for the structure, level of funding and distribution options are the subject of the discussions between the relevant officials at present and will have to adhere to EU State Aid considerations.\u00a0 Experience in other countries suggests that any lending facilitated by a state sponsored investment institution like KfW is generally complementary to SME lending already taking place in an economy and can in fact assist in improving both the supply and demand for finance.

However I have instructed my officials to examine the issue fully, in consultation with the Central Bank\u00a0and the Attorney General's office\u00a0with a view to bringing forward a solution if required. <\/p><p>  While work is ongoing in that respect I also am pleased to note that some unregulated firms have already indicated that they\u00a0intend to voluntarily adopt the CCMA in order to manage acquired loans as they believe that following CCMA is in the ultimate\u00a0best interests for both the business\u00a0and their customers.\u00a0I fully expect that\u00a0this would\u00a0also\u00a0be the case in the event that the IBRC\u00a0portfolio was acquired by such organisations.<\/p><p>  It is also\u00a0important to note that in the event that NAMA acquire the IBRC residential mortgage book they will be mindful of their legal obligations and are likely to apply best practice in relation to CCMA, furthermore\u00a0they have confirmed that no borrower will be in any worse a position. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500058#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500058#WRF00450"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[9457\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500058#WRF00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on requesting independent individuals of any of the four major auditing and accounting firms to the main banks before and during the crisis to review the decision of the special liquidator of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation to initiate proceedings against a company (details supplied) for its role in auditing Anglo Irish bank, but not to pursue another company (details supplied) for its role in auditing Irish Nationwide; and if he believes that the second company should be held to account for its perceived auditing failures of the Irish Nationwide accounts.

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<\/p><p>  Under section 15(2)(<i>d<\/i>) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.<\/p><p>  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

The contact details for the EWS is Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency, Block 3, South Dublin County Council, Tallaght, Dublin 24, phone number 01-8738700.

The support will be made available in two phases.<\/p><p>  Phase1: Principal teachers from primary and post-primary schools will attend a 2.5 hr workshop during which the PDST facilitators will mediate the 2013 Anti-Bullying Procedures, review bullying as a behaviour including its characteristics and impact, and provide detailed guidance on the development of an Anti-Bullying Policy within the school. The legal framework will be explored and relevant documents will be referenced. Examples of these include:<\/p><p>- Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools (2013) - Circular 045\/2013<\/p><p>- The Department's Template for Anti-Bullying Policy 2013<\/p><p>- Education Act (1998)<\/p><p>- Equal Status Acts, 2000 to 2004<\/p><p>- Education (Welfare) Act, 2000<\/p><p>- NEWB Developing a Code of Behaviour: Guidelines for Schools 2008<\/p><p>- Child Protection Guidelines and Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools, 2011<\/p><p>  Key to the success of the school's anti-bullying policy is the creation of a positive school culture and climate.

The initial webcast will be broadcast next week for primary schools and for post-primary schools in early March. All support materials are to be made available in both Gaeilge and English.<\/p><p>  Phase 2: During Autumn 2014 the PDST will provide a one-day seminar for principals where the focus will be on prevention and intervention strategies at whole-school level.<\/p><p>  The support provided by the PDST will help ensure schools meet their obligations under the new procedures, in particular, the promotion of the anti-bullying policy among the school community and the measures in place to develop a positive and inclusive climate in the school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500059#WRG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights Issues","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500059#WRG03750"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[9060\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500059#WRG03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to repeal section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act.

These posts were in 173 DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 Schools, 163 post primary schools, 16 rural DEIS schools and 17 non DEIS schools.  Due to conflicting reports of posts being lost in these schools, my Department produced a report on the impact of the withdrawal of these legacy posts from Band 1 and Band 2 Schools.  Following the Government's decision of 21 February 2012 in the matter a number of schools continued to retain disadvantaged legacy posts from previous disadvantage schemes on a year to year basis and only where warranted, based on the enrolment of the previous 30th September.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a range of factors contribute to determining the staffing requirement for individual schools including changes to enrolment and the reforms to the teacher allocation process in 2012. The overall objective of the reforms is to enable the teacher allocation and redeployment process to operate more smoothly and efficiently, to give a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools, give earlier certainty to schools about their staffing allocations and, where possible, simplify and streamline existing processes and give greater autonomy to schools. This also removed the need to directly notify every DEIS school of its staffing levels each year.<\/p><p>  As the teaching allocation to schools, including disadvantage legacy posts, are enrolment-based, this determines whether schools gain or lose teaching posts from year to year. Some schools seemed to be under the impression that the Government decision of February 2012 in relation to legacy posts, implied that they would retain legacy posts, regardless of changes in enrolment. I wish to clarify that legacy posts are retained in schools from year to year, only where warranted, based on the enrolment of the previous 30th September.  It is not my intention to review this decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500060#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Applications","counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500060#WRH01950"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[9118\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500060#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will review the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p>Calculation of reckonable income is set out in Article 22(3) of the Student Grant Scheme 2013.

The level of resources devoted to supporting children with Special Educational Needs has been maintained and increased for this school year. <\/p><p>  The previous Government capped the number of SNA posts at 10,575 in December 2010.  In December 2013, this Government agreed to increase the cap on SNAs by 390, increasing by 170 posts to 10,745 at the end of 2013, and by a further 220 posts to 10,965 at the end of 2014.  These additional posts provided will enable the National Council for Special Education to continue to allocate support to children who need it in order that they may fully participate in and benefit from their education. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my decision last June to authorise the NCSE to maintain the level of resource teaching allocations to be provided for students with special educational needs for the current school year to the 2012\/13 levels.  This decision resulted in the subsequent allocation of an additional 455 posts in October to maintain resource teaching provision at the same levels as last year.<\/p><p>  Provision is therefore being made this year for up to 10,745 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), over 10,700 Learning Support and Resource Teachers. Provision is also being made for over 740 Special Classes attached to mainstream schools at reduced pupil teacher ratios, enhanced capitation for special schools and special classes, and provision for special transport arrangements and assistive technology support. <\/p><p>  The policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided. All schools and all school places are therefore available for children with special educational needs to be enrolled to.  Supports will continue to be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs.  In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.  <\/p><p>  The overall level of investment being provided will ensure that provision can continue to be made to provide for the educational requirements of children with special educational needs, enrolled in all schools, to ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements, for both the current school year and in future school years.  Approximately 15% of the entire budget of my Department &ndash; some &euro;1.3 billion &ndash; was spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs in 2012\/13.  The provision for the 2013\/14 school year is in line with expenditure last year and shows that the overall level of funding for special education has been protected, and increased, despite the ongoing severe financial position.  There has been no reduction in the level of funding to support children with Special Educational needs since this Government came to office. <\/p><p>  The level of investment being provided will ensure that provision can continue to be made to provide for the educational requirements of children with special educational needs, including those with Autism and Aspergers, enrolled in all schools and to ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements. <\/p><p>  In relation to the number of school places available for children with special educational needs throughout the country, and in County Kildare, the policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided.

My Department has supported awareness raising initiatives in relation to tackling bullying.

This leads to an average cycle of maintenance taking place just over once every 5 years.  This work is carried out to ensure that the State's investment in the Arterial Drainage schemes continues to provide the intended benefits.  These schemes were primarily focused on facilitating an increase in agricultural output. In doing this two criteria were considered, namely, the reduction in the frequency of flooding and the increase in drainage outfall thus reducing water logging. The former tends to be the overriding criterion on larger channels while the latter tends to dictate the depth and size of the minor channels.  If maintenance is not carried out then most channels would return over a number of years to their pre-drainage state. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that there are many other rivers and watercourses for which the OPW does not have any maintenance responsibility.  Local Authorities have statutory responsibility for maintenance of rivers and watercourses which form part of Drainage Districts.  For other watercourses falling outside of the OPW and Local Authority areas of responsibility it is private landowners generally that have responsibility for the maintenance of these.<\/p><p>  The attenuation referred to relates to the reduction of the flood peak by storage of the floodwater somewhere where it will do less damage.  To do this, somewhere that is not already flooded has to be flooded or somewhere that is flooded has to be flooded to a greater depth.  On larger channels this option would therefore require that considerable areas of land would have to be flooded to a greater extent in a controlled fashion.  For example, on the Blackwater in Fermoy, 25 square kilometres of land flooded to an extra metre would have been required.  This option is examined on all of our urban flood relief schemes and is only rarely found to form part of the preferred solution, generally where the flows are relatively low and a suitable attenuation area is available. In a rural setting it is almost never beneficial to transfer the flood from one landowner to another.  Another negative that arises with storage solutions is in the area of residual risk.  When an event in excess of the design event is encountered there can be a step change in the effect on the benefiting area when the storage is exhausted and the integrity of the storage area also poses a risk as the excess flood water is stored upstream of the benefiting area.  In contrast, if the design capacity of the drained channel is exceeded it continues to confer benefit and the increase in flood is more gradual.<\/p><p>  It has been suggested that bogs might be used to attenuate the effects of flooding.  A recent (February 2012) study &quot;The Use of Wetlands for Flood Attenuation&quot; carried out by the Aquatic Services Unit, UCC commissioned by An Taisce, stated in its executive summary that &quot;The value of wetlands for flood attenuation is, however, often exaggerated and many wetlands in fact play only a very weak role, if at all, in attenuating floods&quot;.  It further stated that &quot;it (the influence of wetlands in reducing flood peaks) is least for large events, particularly following a long period of prior rainfall, when soil and wetland storage are saturated.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500062#WRK04800","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"question","counter":612,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[9481\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if, in view of the regular instances of flooding, his Department or agencies under his aegis will provide advice or guidance for homeowners on helping defend their homes from flooding and on the various products and services available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":613,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works has developed a website, , which contains practical help and advice for those whose homes or businesses may be at risk of flooding.

The maintenance and upkeep of the National Monuments is a statutory function of the Commissioners of Public Works under National Monuments legislation dating back to the 1930&rsquo;s and is undertaken by experienced conservation staff of the OPW and a network of skilled local direct labour in various locations around the country. Non National Monument sites are maintained as part of the OPW&rsquo;s broader remit for the care and management of the state property portfolio, including this heritage estate. These properties have, in many cases, direct labour force teams located at the site dealing with issues such as grounds management, horticulture \/ arboriculture, security, event management and a range of other tasks.<\/p><p>  In addition to the statutory function relating to the maintenance and upkeep of the National Monuments portfolio, the OPW is also responsible for the presentation of a number of sites to visitors. Currently, full guided visitor services are provided at 70 heritage sites each year; 24 of them presented on a fulltime basis and the remaining 46 on a seasonal basis generally within the period between April and September. Not all of these sites charge admission and a significant number are free entry. In 2013, approx 4.2m visitors were admitted to OPW sites with visitor services and a much greater number, well in excess of 15m for the entire estate, visited the unguided sites within the portfolio. The open public sites in this latter category include such properties as St Stephen's Green and the Phoenix Park in Dublin where there is a considerable public footfall. Some sites (ie: the Dublin Castle complex) have a multi-functional role operating in the case of the castle for example as both a high profile visitor location and a Conference Centre.<\/p><p> Since many of the sites operated by the OPW Heritage Service do not function as commercial concerns as such but rather are operated for the public good as part of the celebration of the nations&rsquo; culture and heritage, the question of turnover does not strictly arise. However, for the purposes of answering the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, I have asked my officials to capture costs relating to those sites where we either maintain a Guide Service operation or alternatively have a workforce located (ie; ground staff, event teams etc) and to set it beside details of gross admission and sales income (where such is actually charged or received) and the overall number of visitors admitted (where such records are maintained on either a paying or non-paying basis). The cost to value equation however is not completely captured by this analysis, since there is a distinct multiplier effect in evidence having regard to both the wider tourism and the general economy which benefits to a significant degree from the availability of this unique tourist and visitor resource. I would also suggest that this analysis does not identify the social and cultural benefits that flow from the presentation of the heritage estate and the very real contribution it makes to our sense of a unique and valuable cultural identity.<\/p><p>  The information in relation to the sites treated within the Heritage estate managed and operated by the OPW is enclosed on the tabular statement. Naturally, if the Deputy has a specific enquiry in mind which I have not addressed in this material, I will be happy to respond if he wishes to contact me directly.<\/p><p><br

Maintenance and upkeep of these National Monuments is a statutory function of the Commissioners of Public Works under National Monuments legislation dating back to the 1930&rsquo;s and is undertaken by experienced OPW architectural conservation staff and a network of skilled local direct labour based at 6 Depot locations around the country. In addition to the statutory function relating to the maintenance and upkeep of the National Monuments portfolio, the OPW is also responsible for the presentation of a number of sites to visitors. Currently, full guided visitor services are provided at 70 heritage sites each year; 24 of them presented on a fulltime basis and the remaining 46 on a seasonal basis generally within the period between April and September. In 2013, approx 4.2m visitors were admitted to these sites and a much greater number, perhaps in excess of 10m, visited the unattended sites within the entire estate.  <\/p><p>  As is apparent from the foregoing, maintenance of the National Monuments portfolio and the delivery of visitor services at even a relatively limited number of heritage sites is a considerable undertaking. Clearly, given the scale of this operation and bearing in mind the difficulties being experienced by the Exchequer in recent times, it has been incumbent on the OPW to examine the heritage portfolio in the same way as every other part of its responsibility and consider whether this service can be delivered more efficiently and with greater economy on behalf of the taxpayer. OPW is therefore considering a range of measures including outsourcing of non-core elements to private sector contractors. There are a range of functions such as maintenance and upkeep of modern visitor buildings for example that need not be performed by skilled National Monuments staff and which should therefore be done by others and arrangements are being made, where appropriate, to ensure that this happens.<\/p><p>  The impact of the various measures that are being considered will be assessed relative to a number of key criteria including more efficient use of scarce skilled staff resources, financial economy and, perhaps most critically, whether there is a potential impact on the statutory function assigned to the Commissioners of Public Works for the maintenance and upkeep of the National Monument portfolio. The measures will also have regard to staff employed by the OPW and none of the initiatives being contemplated currently will involve the displacement of any serving staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value for Money Reviews","counter":640,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL01950"},{"type":"question","counter":641,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[7476\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the extra powers for the Comptroller and Auditor General as committed to in the programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":642,"content":"<p>The commitment for enhanced powers for the Comptroller and Auditor General is being progressed as part of the wider public service reform agenda.

Following receipt of the reports from local authorities the Department submitted a Report to Government on the overall position on storm damage.  Based on this Report the Government decided to allocate up to &euro;70 million funding to repair the damage, of which up to &euro;20 million relates to damage to coastal protection infrastructure.  <\/p><p>  The Office of Public Works wrote on 10 January 2014 to City and County Managers in coastal areas indicating that it will accept applications under the Minor Works Scheme for funding to assist with repairs to built flood defences and coastal protection structures which have been damaged by the recent storms. This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre-storm condition. The specific application form for this entitled Coastal Storm Damage Flooding Questionnaire 2014 is available on www.opw.ie under Flood Risk Management.  Any work for which funding is sought will be carried out by local authorities.  <\/p><p>  The question of the most appropriate form of coastal protection in any location, including rock armour type structures, is a matter for consideration by the relevant local authority in the first instance. In areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage to or loss of economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding,  appropriate and sustainable measures should be identified by local authorities to protect those assets.  Where intervention measures are economically justified on cost benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, these may implemented subject to the availability of resources.  OPW's ongoing Catchment Flood Risk Management (CFRAM) study is addressing flood risk, including coastal flood risk, on a nationwide scale.  Flood maps will be available later this year to include 90 at risk coastal areas and flood risk management plans with preferred options for dealing with flood risk for these areas are to be available in 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL02400","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sick Pay Scheme Reform","counter":647,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL02450"},{"type":"question","counter":648,"qnumday":351,"qnumall":"[9337\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL02500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of the regulations to be brought forward in relation to the new sick leave scheme; when this regulation will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"962","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":649,"content":"<p>The new sick leave scheme is being introduced through Ministerial Regulations which are provided for in the recently enacted Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments)(Amendment) Act 2013.\u00a0 The drafting of these Regulations has been a priority for my Department working closely with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel since the relevant legislation was enacted at the end of last year.\u00a0 The Regulations are currently at an advanced stage of preparation and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":650,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL02650"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[9382\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the State currently claims ownership of Cobh Titanic or has at any stage in the past owned same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":652,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the State Property Act, 1954 deals with the vesting of State\u00a0 ownership\u00a0of property.\u00a0\u00a0If the Deputy will provide my Department with  details of the basis on which he believes it might claim ownership of this facility,\u00a0I will arrange for the matter to be looked into.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform Implementation","counter":653,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL02850"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[9429\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500063#WRL02900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will summarise the recommendations of the public service reform plan; the progress to date in delivering the previous reform plan; if he will identify areas that require particular focus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1011","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":655,"content":"<p>On\u00a014 January, I\u00a0published\u00a0the Government's new Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016. The new Plan outlines the key reform initiatives that will be implemented over the next three years.\u00a0 It also addresses the broader ambition for reform towards 2020.\u00a0 The four key themes running through this new Reform Plan are delivery of improved outcomes; utilisation of the reform dividend; digitalisation and open data; and openness and accountability.<\/p><p>  While maintaining the drive for increased efficiency, this next phase of reform will have a greater focus on the delivery of improved outcomes for service users.\u00a0 This will include greater use of alternative models of service delivery, such as commissioning for specific outcomes,\u00a0and service delivery improvements at sectoral and organisational levels.<\/p><p>  As well as changing how we deliver public services, we will continue to focus on increasing efficiency and productivity.\u00a0 As efficiencies are realised through initiatives such as public procurement reform and shared services, some of the savings made will be re-invested in improved services.\u00a0 This &quot;Reform Dividend&quot; will serve to underpin and help sustain the reform agenda beyond the current fiscal crisis.<\/p><p>  The Public Service must make maximum use of new technologies, digitalisation and open data to deliver services in innovative ways.\u00a0 A new Government ICT Strategy will be published later this year that will address the use of new and emerging technologies, ensuring that eGovernment is designed around real needs and taking steps to improve the take-up of 'digital government'.\u00a0 As part of this new strategy, we are capturing data on the top transactional services on which the citizen engages with the State, which will help inform what further services will be put online.<\/p><p>  The new plan also places a focus on increased openness, transparency and accountability. \u00a0Citizens must be able to clearly see that the Public Service is working fairly in its decision making, in implementing policy and in delivering public services. \u00a0In this context, the political reform programme will deliver greater openness, transparency and accountability to strengthen trust in government and public services and strengthen public governance. \u00a0A particularly important development is the recent publication of a consultation paper focused on options for strengthening Civil Service accountability and performance.<\/p><p>  Last month, I also published a report setting out the considerable progress that has been made in reforming the Public Service since our first Reform Plan was published in 2011.\u00a0 To provide just some examples:<\/p><p>- We are implementing a radical overhaul of our approach to public procurement, with the new Office of Government Procurement targeting savings of &euro;500 million over the next three years;<\/p><p>- Peoplepoint, the Civil Service wide Human Resources and Pensions Shared Services Centre, has been operational since March last year.\u00a0 It now services over 24,000 employees across 19 organisations.\u00a0 When it becomes fully operational in January 2015, it will provide services to 40 organisations with estimated savings of &euro;12.5 million annually;<\/p><p>- An Action Plan to deliver efficiencies in the State's extensive property portfolio is currently being implemented;<\/p><p>- We have issued over 500,000 Public Services Cards.\u00a0 The Cards are currently being used for social welfare payments and the free travel scheme, and we are considering extension of the Card to cover a greater range of services;<\/p><p>- The Office of Government Chief Information Officer has been established within my Department to maximise the potential benefits of digitalisation in delivering services and information;<\/p><p>- The Government services portal -  - now includes quick links to more than 400 information and transaction services;<\/p><p>- A series of public expenditure reforms have been implemented to bring greater structure, scrutiny and openness to budgeting;<\/p><p>- We are making good progress in implementing our programme of political and legislative reform, aimed at enhancing openness, transparency and accountability;

The CEBs support the indigenous micro- enterprise sector (less than ten employees) in the start- up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level. They are the first point of call in terms of advice, direction, training and grant support for anyone who wishes to start a business. Contact details for the CEBs are available on .  CEBs can also refer clients to other appropriate agencies, for example Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>  The CEBs generally only provide grants to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio. Retail enterprises (where franchise opportunities mainly exist) are ineligible for direct financial support from CEBs due to concerns over displacement as grant- assisted projects may simply displace business from other players in the local market.<\/p><p>  However, any start- up can use the CEBs as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start- up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal. Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local CEB.<\/p><p>  Further, anyone interested in availing of franchising as a business option could benefit from participating in the CEB non-financial or &quot;soft&quot; support programmes. All locally trading businesses, including start- ups, can avail of non-financial assistance from their CEB in the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives, etc. Training courses include such topics as start-your-own-business (SYOB), taxation for beginners, internet marketing, ideas generation and negotiation skills. Indeed the SYOB course would cover the key issues in starting a business and would complement the information that would be provided by the franchisor. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the system for delivery of State supports to micro and small enterprises is being reformed and the 35 existing County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) will be dissolved and new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will be created.

It gives rise to a distribution of some &euro;9.5 billion in cash annually.  Some nine hundred thousand (900,000) clients of the Department are paid in this manner, accounting for some fifty per cent (50%) of all welfare payments. On foot of a new contract signed by me a little more than two months ago, the contract for these services will generate sums in excess of &euro;50 million in revenue to An Post in the coming year.  This contract is quite clearly substantial in terms of reach, value and impact.  <\/p><p>  However, cash payments are an inherently expensive means of paying clients.  It costs the Department six and a half times more to issue a payment to a customer in cash than it does by EFT.  Almost sixteen per cent (16%) of the Department&rsquo;s budget for administration is being spent on the costs associated with delivering payments to welfare clients. This approach requires ongoing review.<\/p><p>  Consumer behaviour now shows a very high movement towards online and electronic payments.  Electronic point-of-sale transactions increased by approximately 20% year on year in 2013. The number of point-of-sale terminals in now heading towards 60,000 with approximately one in six of these offering &ldquo;contactless&rdquo; payment facilities. Last year some 300 million transactions were made with payment cards.  Some 21 million journeys were made using Leap cards in 2013. Consumers generally, including the vast majority of our clients, are increasingly adept and willing to adopt electronic payment approaches as a matter of convenience. In keeping with these behavioural shifts, my Department must look for opportunities to keep abreast of societal changes, provide better and more secure customer service, while also continuing to serve those who are more vulnerable in our society.   <\/p><p>  Many of our customers while having a bank account, credit union account or other account in a financial institution which can receive electronic payments are still being paid in cash.  This is a costly choice for us to support, particularly when budgets at a national level remain so constrained.  <\/p><p>  Accordingly, my Department has developed a Payments Strategy. The overall objective of this Strategy, which was approved by the Government last year, is to modernise the Department&rsquo;s payment delivery approach by delivering payments to clients electronically and in a way that facilitates onward e-payments by the client.  In recognising this movement towards the electronic handling of payments, the Strategy lays out a road map for a progressive movement towards increased use of electronic channels in the disbursement of welfare payments. This road map adopts a phased approach to implementation. The progression to electronic payments is a critical element of the wider National Payments Plan aimed at removing the very high levels of cash usage in the Irish economy which will contribute to improved national competitiveness.  The Strategy supports wider Government objectives for increased efficiency in public services and better services to customers that suit changing behaviours, while also increasing levels of financial inclusion among the Department&rsquo;s clients. I must reiterate however that I have consistently confirmed that no customer will be left without a payment simply by virtue of not being able to receive it electronically.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, notably the extent to which it is now a one stop shop where people can pay bills, purchase mobile phone top ups, use the passport application facility, pay local property tax or garda fines, and carry out a range of banking and other financial services.  The Government has stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network in the Programme for Government.  However, I am also aware that the business risks facing An Post cannot be placed solely on the door step of proposed changes to welfare payments. The Deputies may be interested to know that over the past ten years, the number of post office outlets countrywide has fallen by one third.  Over this same period, mostly due to the downturn experienced in the economy generally, the volume of welfare payments routed through the post offices rose by seven per cent (7%).  This increased transaction volume has derived significant additional revenues to An Post and the postmasters.  And still, despite increased transaction numbers, the post offices numbers fell to levels which are now about two thirds of what they were a decade ago.<\/p><p>  Undeniably a loss in the current revenue stream from social welfare payments would impact on An Post. I understand that in anticipation of the increasing use of EFT generally, An Post has prepared and implemented a strategy which aims to address the reality of increased use of electronic payment methods within the economy. On the revenue side, An Post has made significant progress in developing new commercial opportunities with other financial and payments institutions, notably with AIB and Aviva.  New lines of business have been generated such as foreign exchange where An Post now holds 30% of the domestic foreign exchange business. <\/p><p>  I know that my colleague Minister Rabbitte is working closely with the Board of An Post in identifying new retail business opportunities for their network.  He has consistently repeated his support for the continuing modernisation of post office services and has again just last week spoken of the need for them to compete and win new business that brings benefits to postmasters and communities locally. For my part, I was very happy to back that support with the signing of the contract with An Post in December last for a period of two years with the potential to extend the contractual arrangement for a further four years thereafter. It is important that An Post and postmasters alike replicate this success and continue to work together to maintain financial services in local communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500064#WRM02300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":713,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500064#WRM02350"},{"type":"question","counter":714,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[8880\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500064#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of community development officers employed by her Department in tabular form; their location across the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":715,"content":"<p>The total number of Community Development Officers, at the end of January, was 75.

These criteria are designed to ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position, that it provides appropriate training and development experience to the intern, and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the Intern.  In addition a standard agreement must be signed and agreed to by both the intern and the host organisation.  This agreement clearly states the terms of the internship, including the expected working hours, which can range from 30 &ndash; 40 hours (maximum) per week, and the specific learning outcomes the intern can expect to gain over the course of the internship.<\/p><p>  To ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the Department of Social Protection routinely monitors internships.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the use of random monitoring site visits during which discussions are held with both parties to the internship.  In this regard, over 4,400 on-site monitoring visits have been conducted to-date . As part of this process 98% of internships were found to  conform to the requirements of the JobBridge scheme.  Remedial action is taken in cases of non-compliance. <\/p><p>  It is worth noting that participation in the scheme is voluntary and an intern may contact the JobBridge team at any stage of their internship for advice and support.  In addition any individual, whether or not involved in an internship, who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme&rsquo;s criteria or that a host organisation is abusing the scheme may contact the JobBridge team.  All such matters are investigated.<\/p><p>  An independent evaluation conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of interns progress to paid employment within 5 months of completing their internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500064#WRM03100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":725,"content":"<p>Question No. 376 answered with Question No. 371.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Appeals","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500064#WRM03250"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[9002\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500064#WRM03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if an appeal has been registered in the case of a person (details supplied) Dublin 10 in respect of their jobseeker's allowance application; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":728,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 19 February 2014, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.  <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500064#WRM03400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Programmes","counter":729,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500064#WRM03450"},{"type":"question","counter":730,"qnumday":378,"qnumall":"[9023\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500064#WRM03500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the plans for the 2014 community services programme funding for an organisation (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":731,"content":"<p>The community services programme (CSP) is designed to address gaps in service delivery and disadvantage and to ensure that community facilities are utilised.

Some 425 not-for-profit companies and co-operatives shared annual funding of &euro;46m from the programme in 2013.  Contract holders must deliver tangible services that are capable of generating non-public revenues from their operations by way of charging fees, sales and\/or fundraising and other public funds.  The programme is not intended to represent full-funding for any operation.<\/p><p>  Each contract holder is responsible for their own budgets, income, financial and other liabilities.  Contracts are generally offered on a three-year cycle based on a business plan or similar submitted by the company.  Continued funding is subject to satisfactory compliance with the programme&rsquo;s operational requirements, financial position of the company, continued eligibility of the company and service, progress on delivery of the stated objectives in the business plan, and an assessment of a business plan for the following three year contact cycle.  A regular review process is undertaken to ensure compliance with contract obligations, audit issues, continuing capacity of the organisation to manage public funds, the need for and quality of service delivery, sustainability, and value for money.<\/p><p>  A re-contracting process for the period 2014-16 for organisations operating under the Community Services Strand of the programme was undertaken in 2013.  This involved the submission of business plans by contracted organisations.  These business plans and past performance were reviewed by Pobal and the conclusions submitted to the Department for consideration and decision.  The business plan and operations of the company referred to by the Deputy was reviewed under this process.

A wide range of supports and services are presently available to lone parents who lose their entitlement to the OFP payment as a result of the reforms to the OFP scheme.<\/p><p>  In advance of the OFP scheme age reforms in July 2013, I introduced a number of measures aimed at easing the transition of affected lone parents to other social welfare income support payments.  These included the re-rating of existing carer&rsquo;s allowance and family income supplement (FIS) claims and the fast-tracking of new applications for the FIS, carer&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments.<\/p><p>  In addition, last year, in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2013, I introduced the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) transitional arrangement, which caters for OFP recipients who lose their entitlement to the OFP payment, who have a youngest child aged under 14 years, and who are entitled to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment.  These customers are now exempt from the JA criteria that require them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  They can work part-time without restrictions and still receive the JA  payment &ndash; subject to a means test.  They also have access to the Department&rsquo;s activation related supports to enable them to become job-ready and\/or to find employment.  The exemptions from the full JA conditionality will remain in place until a recipient&rsquo;s youngest child reaches the age of 14 years.  At this point, should they continue to claim the JA payment, they will be subjected to the full JA conditionality.<\/p><p>  From an operational perspective, letters were issued to all customers whose claims were due to finish in July, 2013.  Depending on the local circumstances, customers were either invited to information seminars held locally, or to one-to-one meetings, to advise them of their possible entitlements to other social welfare income support payments.

You will be aware that I have introduced a number of legislative changes in recent years to assist both trustees and employers meet these challenges.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 amended section 50 of the Pensions Act to broaden the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme in any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits. Prior to this change, the trustees of a pension scheme could restructure active and deferred scheme member&rsquo;s benefits and post retirement increases in pension benefits. The change to section 50 of the Pensions Act extends the categories of benefits which can be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits to include a portion of pensioner benefits. This change essentially provides for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members. <\/p><p>  Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board. This guidance makes provision for the notification of all scheme members in advance of any application to the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits. In such circumstances, scheme members will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal. The Pensions Board must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits. <\/p><p>  The issue of how these changes might be applied will be a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries. <\/p><p>  In relation to the matter of representation by deferred scheme members in consideration of a change to scheme benefits, this is a matter which needs to be considered in a broader industrial relations context.

As part of this process and to support the Department&rsquo;s activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme and the development of Intreo services nationally, it has been necessary to review the administration of all its services across its remit including the CWS.  The Pathways to Work Programme represents a significant reform in the social welfare system and highlighted the need for the Department to focus its resources on the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance to unemployed people.  The Department is intensifying its level of engagement with the unemployed, in particular, those who are, or become, long-term unemployed.  The new Intreo service offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers, a model which is currently being rolled out across the country. <\/p><p>  Overall, this is resulting in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices, which will provide a full range of services, including the CWS and these will, in general, be available in one location.  Where the community welfare service has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.<\/p><p>  In general, this means that the frequency of available public clinics has increased. Improved phone services have been put in place, allowing in many cases, for customer queries to be processed without having to attend a clinic on a face to face basis.

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as flooding. <\/p><p>The humanitarian assistance scheme, which is income tested, is available to assist people whose homes were damaged by the recent severe weather and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair as a result of the damage.  The objective of the income test is to determine the household&rsquo;s capacity to meet the costs of restoring their home to a habitable condition by considering all household income, including that derived from capital, when determining entitlement to payment. For example, a family consisting of a couple and two children with a gross household income of &euro;70,000 or less will receive 100% of the amount allowable in respect of their application. For each whole &euro;1,000 of household income above the &euro;70,000 the couple will be required to make a personal contribution of 1% toward the amount allowable. The amount allowable in any particular case refers to the amount the officer administering the scheme determines is required to replace essential losses and to make any essential repairs. Further detail on the humanitarian assistance scheme and the income test for single persons and families is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at   .<\/p><p>  In dealing with emergency events of this nature, the Department generally adopts a three stage approach as follows:<\/p><p>  -  Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments (food, clothing and personal items) in the immediate aftermath of the event.  A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially with payments around the country ranging from &euro;100 to &euro;500 depending on family size. The response on the ground to the current flooding had been primarily focused at this stage with immediate payments issuing mainly in respect of food, clothing, toiletries and accommodation.<\/p><p>  -  Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items.  It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known.  In the last week, applications have started to be processed under this phase in Limerick in respect of white goods, furniture, etc. with payments ranging from &euro;2,000 to &euro;4,000.  Payments under this phase are normally processed within 2 to 3 working days of the receipt of a valid application and supporting documentation.<\/p><p>  -  Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required.  It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental\/Agency response.  Works carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting.  Payments under this phase will generally take longer to process as homeowners establish the cost of repair by securing builders&rsquo; estimates and the extent of the loss is verified, usually by a loss assessor, in cases where significant amounts are claimed.<\/p><p>  The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme.  Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted.

The average payment made in 2014 is &euro;508 per claim which in most cases relates to the stage 1 phase of emergency income support. It is envisaged that more substantial payments will be made as the number of applications increase in respect of stages 2 and 3 as outlined above.

The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) is responsible for acquiring and managing the bulk of Ireland&rsquo;s emergency oil stocks. <\/p><p>  Since 2007, in line with IEA and Government policy, NORA has been pursuing a policy of reducing dependency on stock tickets (paper contracts to deliver oil in an emergency) as well as repatriating stocks held abroad to the island of Ireland, subject to value for money considerations. In 2006, 51% of NORA stocks were held in Ireland, 10% were held as physical stocks abroad, while 40% were held as stock tickets. By 2013, the picture had changed dramatically with 73% of NORA emergency stocks held as physical stocks on the island of Ireland and 27% held as physical stocks in other EU Member States under Bilateral Agreements or Memoranda of Understanding, with no requirement for stock tickets.<\/p><p>  By successfully rebalancing its stocks in favour of physical stocks on the island of Ireland, NORA helps ensure that emergency stocks are easily physically accessible and available in an emergency situation. This significantly enhances the security of Irish oil supply and is in line with EU requirements under the new Oil Stocks Directive (2009\/119\/EC). The EU has also encouraged Member States to reduce dependency on stock tickets. <\/p><p>  The stocks included in the &ldquo;Island of Ireland&rdquo; figures above include NORA stocks in Northern Ireland, which amount to approximately 9% of Ireland&rsquo;s emergency stocks. Since 2011, NORA has completed three key storage refurbishment projects at Ringsend (Dublin), Kilroot (Antrim) and Tarbert (Kerry.) These storage developments form a key part of NORA&rsquo;s ongoing plans for the steady rebalancing of stocks from abroad onto the island of Ireland. <\/p><p>NORA has maximised its storage in all available storage facilities in Ireland, and has steadily increased its stockholding to meet its ongoing obligations. NORA is continuing on its quest to develop further storage on the island of Ireland, and a number of options are being considered. This work will continue with a view to identifying and implementing the most beneficial plans for NORA in meeting its obligations in future years and underpinning security of supply.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500066#WRO04300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Gas Leaks","counter":884,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500066#WRO04350"},{"type":"question","counter":885,"qnumday":434,"qnumall":"[9257\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500066#WRO04400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the policies that are in place to deal with domestic gas leaks and their reporting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":886,"content":"<p>The protection of the safety of gas customers, of the public generally and of public property by minimising incidents involving gas is a matter of highest priority for Government. Legislation in place reflects this policy objective and provides the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) with responsibility for regulating the activities of natural gas undertakings and gas installers (both natural gas and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG)) with respect to safety. The CER discharges its safety responsibilities through the implementation of the Gas Safety Framework, which has been in operation since 2008. The CER is currently reviewing the Gas Safety Framework with a view to extending the Framework to provide for LPG safety licensing of LPG Distribution Networks to multiple domestic final customers from the 30<sup>th<\/sup> April 2014 and for LPG incident reporting from the 31<sup>st<\/sup>   March 2014.<\/p><p>Natural Gas undertakings (and LPG Undertakings from the 31<sup>st<\/sup>   March 2014) have statutory responsibilities for the reporting of gas related incidents to the CER. Procedures have been developed by the CER to ensure that all relevant personnel deal with an incident in an effective and approved manner. <\/p><p>  The Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended, confers on the CER specific functions in regard to gas safety. A gas installer is required to be registered as a Registered Gas Installer (RGI) in order to carry out works on domestic type gas appliances, i.e. &lsquo;Gas Works&rsquo;, as defined in the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Gas Works) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 255\/2009) and the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Liquefied Petroleum Gas Works) Regulation 2011 (S.I. 299\/2011). As such it is a legal requirement that any &lsquo;Gas Works&rsquo; carried out in the domestic environment, whether it is the installation, service or repair of a gas appliance, must always be carried out by a RGI. <\/p><p>  The CER's gas safety regime comprises an annual programme of audits and inspection of regulated entities, the investigation of complaints regarding gas installers and an enforcement regime where action is required. <\/p><p>  The CER has legal responsibilities in regard to the Promotion and Public Awareness of gas safety and may direct a gas undertaking to engage in related publicity campaigns. A variety of campaigns have been carried out, including the following:<\/p><p>  -  What to do when a member of the public smells gas, i.e. phone the Bord Gais Networks 24 hour emergency phone line (1850 20 50 50);<\/p><p>  -  Only use a Registered Gas Installer for the installation, repair or servicing of domestic type gas appliances;<\/p><p>  -  Carbon Monoxide awareness campaigns; and<\/p><p>  -  The &quot;Dial Before You Dig&quot; campaign to encourage people to contact Bord Gais Networks prior to undertaking excavation works in order that underground gas pipes are not damaged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500066#WRO04500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadcasting Service Provision","counter":887,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500066#WRO04550"},{"type":"question","counter":888,"qnumday":435,"qnumall":"[9299\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500066#WRO04600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding Saorview; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":889,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Broadcasting Act 2009, RT&Eacute;, through its subsidiary company 2RN, is responsible for the roll-out, coverage and operation of the SAORVIEW digital terrestrial television (DTT) network and I, as Minister, have no function in this matter.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. The regulation of the industry is a matter for ComReg which is independent in the exercise of its functions. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including ComReg&rsquo;s website at   , as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses including those in County Kildare. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>  -  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<\/p><p>  -  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, which I introduced last month, is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband. The Bill will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services in the Irish market.<\/p><p>  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in a number of locations in County Kildare including Newbridge before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputy. <\/p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work continues in my Department in relation to a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500067#WRP00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Generation","counter":900,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500067#WRP00513"},{"type":"question","counter":901,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[9645\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500067#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if the wind farm project in Rhode, County Offaly is in compliance with a national policy framework; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act (No. 2) 2013 provides for the transfer of water services functions from the local authorities to Irish Water. The Act also provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water. The CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. <\/p><p>  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations, 2007, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean. Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. Hard water is not included as a parameter in the quality standards specified in the Regulations, as it does not pose as a threat to human health. The Environmental Protection Agency is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these regulations. <\/p><p>  The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 requires that Irish Water will prepare codes of practice, on a range of matters, including standards in relation to the performance by Irish Water of its functions and billing by Irish Water of persons in respect of water services provided. Irish Water will also be required to prepare a code of practice on any matter considered necessary by the CER. I expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in fulfilling its functions.<\/p><p>  An inter-departmental working group has been established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges.   The group comprises officials from my Department and from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. The terms of reference of the group include identifying groups likely to face affordability issues, examining appropriate mechanisms for addressing affordability issues for these groups and outlining the administrative arrangements required to deliver on the recommended approach.  The group has met seven times to date.  A final report will be submitted for consideration by Government when the group has completed its examination of the issues involved.   No decision has yet been taken on the level of, or the approach to, the free allowance.  However, it is under active consideration, and I would expect to bring proposals to Government shortly.<\/p><p>  The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Water Services (No.2) Act, 2013. The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan and will engage in public consultation on the approach to charges.\u00a0 In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by Government on the funding model for Irish Water, including the funding available for the free allowance and any proposed affordability measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500067#WRP02800","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":932,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500067#WRP02850"},{"type":"question","counter":933,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[8888\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500067#WRP02900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will use his powers under section 9 of the 2000 Planning Act to require the Waterford and Kilkenny councils to deliver an agreed metropolitan area joint plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":934,"content":"<p>Section 9 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides discretionary powers in the first instance to certain planning authorities, with the agreement of one or more planning authorities which are adjoining county councils, to make a single development plan.

Currently, where a person&rsquo;s occupancy commences after the date of the making of the rate, that person, as a subsequent occupier, could be held liable for up to two years arrears of rates if they cannot be recovered from the person with whom the primary liability lies.\u00a0 However, Schedule 2 Part 6 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for a change to rating law which will remove this subsequent occupier liability.   \u00a0 <\/p><p>  It is not the intention in removing subsequent occupier liability to undermine local authorities&rsquo; collection powers and put at risk the collection of rates income. Therefore, section 32 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for all unpaid and outstanding rates liabilities to be discharged prior to the transfer of ownership or other interest in a property (including tenancy) and that this transfer of interest must be notified to the local authority within two weeks of its effect. This measure is intended to strengthen local authority collection powers in this area without causing any additional burden for subsequent occupiers. \u00a0Furthermore, the amendment provides that any rates due by an owner of relevant property and not discharged shall remain a charge on the property.   <\/p><p>  Under these new provisions, should the owner fail to notify the local authority of a change of occupancy, the Act provides that the owner or landlord will become liable for an amount which is equivalent to two years of outstanding liabilities that may have accrued in respect of any previous occupier of the property.\u00a0 Any amount of that charge that remains unpaid by an owner will become a charge on the property for up to 12 years. The imposition of such a charge on the landlord or owner does not transfer any liability that may rest with any previous occupier.   <\/p><p>  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 was signed by the President on 27 January 2014.

Details regarding the review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website <\/p><p>  The period for public submissions has closed and submissions from a variety of interested parties are now under consideration in my Department.   I expect to be in a position to formulate future policy approaches and actions, taking account of the consultation process, in the near future.   <\/p><p>  In 2013, I asked the Housing Agency to conduct a standalone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures. While I have received an initial draft of the review from the Agency a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order to fully assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures. This data collection exercise has been initiated and will inform future actions.   <\/p><p>  Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders. It is accepted that these proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending outcome of the review.   <\/p><p>  I fully recognise that shared ownership home owners, amongst others, have been affected by issues such as unemployment and possible negative equity.  In such cases, borrowers should actively engage with their lenders, whether a commercial financial institution or a local authority, to seek to avail of one of the options available to provide sustainable solutions to distressed mortgages.   <\/p><p>  The mortgage arrears resolution process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities. In cases of acute mortgage distress , homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.   <\/p><p>  On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, the Government launched a Mortgage to Rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012. This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.

In accordance with Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, up to 20% of the dwellings were made available for social housing purposes. As a result some 60 apartments were acquired by Tuath Housing Association at a cost of over &euro;15 million and funded under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme (CLSS). Under the terms of the CLSS Approved Housing Bodies received a grant of up to 100% of the cost of constructing or purchasing accommodation for low-income families. A n annual management and maintenance allowance of &euro;543   is also payable in respect of dwellings occupied by persons drawn from the local authority housing waiting lists. <\/p><p>  I met with the CEO and technical personnel from Tuath last Wednesday and was advised of the design and construction issues which are giving rise to problems in Tuath-owned properties at Gallery Quay. It appears that the external fabric of the building, which consists of a rendered concrete slab with internally skimmed plasterboard on a proprietary steel dry-wall frame, is subject to water ingress. As a result, during wet and windy conditions, water appears to leak through the outer skin and run down the face of the external wall. Seals around windows and doors also appear to permit water ingress. This, in turn, is giving rise to dampness, condensation and mould growth. The problems became more apparent during the recent wet and stormy weather. Not all apartments are subject to water ingress but I understand that up to 12 units are severely affected. <\/p><p>  I understand Tuath&rsquo;s building surveyors are currently carrying out a detailed apartment-by-apartment condition survey of all their units at Gallery Quay and are drawing up a schedule of works to address all latent and inherent defects as soon as possible. I understand the joinery suppliers are also proposing to carry out an on-site inspection and to advise of water ingress around doors and windows. My Department will await the submission of this report and, having considered it, will be happy to engage with Tuath in advancing the optimum solution for remedying the situation. <\/p><p>  My Department is liaising closely with Tuath and Dublin City Council to ascertain the cause of the water ingress and in advancing practical and sustainable refurbishment works to resolve the problem. My Department&rsquo;s Architectural Inspector along with colleagues from the City Council accepted an invitation from Tuath to attend an on-site meeting last Friday with the relevant insurers and to assess the nature and extent of the problem. It will take some time to fully and comprehensively evaluate the cause of the water ingress and to develop and implement appropriate remediation measures. In the interim, Tuath are carrying out palliative repairs to the building fabric in order to deal with the immediate problems caused by water ingress and to prevent further damage to homes in the event of a storm.   <\/p><p>  At this stage, it would appear that the problems affecting the Tuath apartments at Gallery Quay are site-specific and are primarily due to design and workmanship issues. My Department will continue to work closely with Tuath and Dublin City Council to ensure that suitable arrangements are in place to effect the necessary remedial works and that appropriate accommodation is provided for those families who may have to vacate their homes while the refurbishment works are on-going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500068#WRQ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":997,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500068#WRQ02350"},{"type":"question","counter":998,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[9294\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500068#WRQ02400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to initiate a higher standard of inspection of prospective and existing social leasing units to ensure that any build defects are detected and future losses are avoided.","asker":"1022","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":999,"content":"<p>It is already a condition of the social housing leasing scheme that in order for properties to be accepted onto the scheme they must be in compliance with all relevant planning and building regulations.

The new regulations are necessary following the widespread instances of failure by owners, designers and builders to comply with their statutory obligations under the Building Control Act 1990 to design and construct buildings in accordance with the building regulations. These obligations apply to all sectors of the housing market, including the self-build sector. <\/p><p>  The Building Control Act and any regulations thereunder, including S.I. No. 9 of 2014, place no restrictions on whom an owner may assign as a builder. <\/p><p>  The necessity to limit a signatory of the certificate of compliance on completion to a Principal or Director arises in the context of a company only. Where a self-builder is acting on his or her own behalf, there are no agents or intermediaries involved, and the potential for confusion over legal responsibility does not therefore arise. <\/p><p>  In a self-build situation the legal responsibilities of both the owner and the builder will rest with the self-builder. An owner who intends to self-build will, therefore, prior to commencement, notify the building control authority that they are the builder and also sign and lodge the new form of undertaking by the builder. By signing this undertaking they declare that: they will undertake to construct the dwelling in accordance with the design as certified; any persons employed or engaged to undertake any part of the works will be competent; they will cooperate with the inspection plan prepared by the Assigned Certifier; and that they will take all reasonable steps to ensure they will certify the works, in conjunction with the assigned certifier, on completion.<\/p><p>  Details of the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) are currently available on the relevant website, , established by the Construction Industry Federation. The register is a voluntary one at present but the Government is committed to placing it on a statutory footing in 2015. <\/p><p>  The new regulatory requirements were the subject of an extensive public consultation undertaken in April\/May 2012 which resulted in S.I. No. 80 of 2013 being made in March 2013 to come into effect on 1 March 2014. While S.I. No. 9 of 2014 revokes and replaces S.I.

In this regard I am aware that  additional resources have been deployed to support an Operation in the Donegal Division with a particular focus on crimes against the elderly and including intelligence led patrols, checkpoints, intelligence gathering and analysis. This operation is being run in conjunction with the National and Regional Operations Fiacla and Airgead, set up to combat instances of criminality, including burglary and related crimes. Targeted patrolling has been intensified following the recent incidents of burglaries and related crimes, and there is ongoing and excellent liaison between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  As part of operation Fiacla, these methods have been proven to be successful nationally, with several thousand arrests and prosecutions for burglary offences, reflected in the most recent crime figures which show burglary incidents down by more than 10%.  Notwithstanding the recent disturbing incidents, I am also advised that Garda crime figures for burglary and for offences against the person are also down within the specific Donegal area.  I fully appreciate that these statistics will be cold comfort to those who have recently undergone the traumatic experience of being burgled and assaulted, but I feel that it is important to cite this information, to illustrate the success and determination of Garda efforts to reduce these crimes and bring perpetrators to justice.<\/p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also continue to work closely with communities through Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and other organisations to provide expert crime prevention advice and support to communities. The Garda commitment to this approach was underlined in the new guidelines for communities wishing to set up community crime prevention schemes which were launched by the Commissioner and myself last year.  I understand that work is ongoing within the Donegal Division with respect to the establishment and revitalisation where appropriate of a number of Community Alert Schemes, as part of overall crime prevention awareness.<\/p><p>  With regard to funding being made available to set up Community Alert Schemes from money collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau, I can inform the Deputy that all monies collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau are returned to the Exchequer in accordance with relevant legislation.  Such funds are paid into the Government's Central Fund, from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment. While it has, from time to time, been suggested that such monies should be used to fund community projects, the suggestion is considered problematic and raises a number of practical issues on which I have previously advised the House. Therefore, while I appreciate the symbolic value to the Deputy's suggestion, I hope he will accept that there are no proposals to change the existing arrangements concerning the destination of such monies.  <\/p><p>  However, in relation to Community Alert my Department has, for many years, provided funding for the programme which  is operated by  Muintir na T&iacute;re in partnership with the Garda authorities and which supports the operation of  over 1,300 local groups. Funding totalling &euro;152,000 was provided by my Department in 2013 which supports the employment and associated costs of a National Coordinator and Development Officers for the scheme.   The work of Community Alert continues to be highly valued and decisions on the precise level of funding which may be provided by my Department in 2014 will be made as soon as possible in the context of the available resources.<\/p><p>  With regard to funding for alarm systems for elderly persons, the position is that<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>  the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government provides funding for the Senior Alert Scheme.  The aim of the Scheme is to ensure independent living for those over 65 who live alone.  A key element of the Scheme is the provision of funding for a personal monitored alarm and I am aware that Community Alert and other community organisations provide advice and assistance at a local level with respect to applications under the scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500071#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":1167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500071#WRT00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1168,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[9406\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500071#WRT00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total strength of the Garda National Surveillance Unit on an annual basis since its inception; the total budget per annum since its inception; the number of operations conducted per annum since its inception; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1169,"content":"<p>It is the policy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not to comment on any matters relating to the operation of the National Surveillance Unit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500071#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[9412\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500071#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 560, if he will provide a breakdown, per county, of community garda&iacute; that have been in place every year since 2008; if his attention has been drawn to any plans to increase the numbers of community garda&iacute;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I am sure that, on reflection, the Deputy will appreciate that that practice, which has been followed by my predecessors, arises for sound security reasons.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the legislative basis for the carrying out of covert surveillance is the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 while the interception of telecommunications is provided for in the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.  <\/p><p>  From the outset I should clarify that as Minister for Justice and Equality I have no role whatsoever in the operation of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act  2009. Under the 2009 Act, authorisations for intrusive surveillance are granted by a judge of the District Court on application by a superior officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners or the Defence Forces in circumstances which are set out in the Act.<\/p><p>  In relation to interception, the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 provides that an authorisation for interception may only be granted by Ministerial warrant on application from the Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and only for the purposes of the investigation of serious crime or protecting the security of the State. <\/p><p>  I should emphasise, however, that both Acts are subject to independent judicial oversight by Judges of the High Court, designated by the Government for that purpose.  The Designated Judge has complete and unrestricted access to all cases, documents, records, and personnel pertaining to the operation of the relevant legislation.  In addition, each Designated Judge reports to the Taoiseach on an annual basis on the operation of the legislation. These reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Furthermore, both Acts provide for a complaints mechanism whereby an individual who believes that he or she has been subject to surveillance or whose communications have been intercepted may apply to the Complaints Referee, appointed in accordance with the relevant Act, for an investigation into the matter.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I am maintaining the long-standing practice of my predecessors, but I can assure the Deputy, I have never exercised the extensive legal powers I have to interfere in anyway with the work of the categories of persons referred to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500071#WRT02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1188,"content":"<p>Question No. 548 answered with Question No. 538.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations Closures","counter":1189,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500071#WRT03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1190,"qnumday":549,"qnumall":"[9549\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500071#WRT03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Garda station in Rathcormack, County Cork is due to close; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Regulatory system for wood preservative products (such as bituminous products) and treated timber (such as poles used in electrical transmission and telecommunications) in Ireland is based on European legislation for chemicals.

Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, my Department is obliged under EU Regulations to ensure its accuracy.<\/p><p>  Following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal Accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database.  This has resulted in the necessity to adjust parcels of a significant number of applicants, where it was established that some ineligible features had been included. In certain circumstances these adjustments are giving rise to penalties.  A comprehensive review and appeals process has been implemented to ensure that the cases of individual farmers are fully scrutinised.  In the first instance, a farmer, who finds himself or herself in this position, can seek a review of the original decision by Department officials. If they are not happy with the outcome of the review, they can submit an appeal to the <i>Independent LPIS Appeals Committee<\/i>, chaired by Mr Padraig Gibbons.<\/p><p>  The LPIS Review process initiated by my Department consisted on a review of all of the eligible land parcels in the LPIS database, which was declared by farmers under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes.

This means that farmers, who have ineligible land deducted in 2013 as part of this Review, will be protected under the new Regime as their entitlements will be based on the actual eligible land in 2013.  In addition, it also means that farmers, who are contributing to the convergence process by having reductions applied to their entitlements, will not see part of the funds used to make payments on ineligible lands.<\/p><p>  A deliberate decision was taken late last year not to delay payments to those farmers whose payments were due to be subject to reduction following the outcome of the Review; rather, the payments issued with the sums in question deducted, the farmers concerned being then advised of the reductions and the appeals process.

It is by its very nature a complex area &ndash; there are issues about the legal right to claim and there have always been disputes about the grazing of the commonages.  In the vast majority of cases, however, commonage shareholders work well together on a co-operative basis to maintain the commonages in GAEC or where there is under-grazing to return the habitat to GAEC.  My stated intention is to achieve this by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant state agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.  It will not be an easy task but it is achievable if we all work in a co-operative basis.

The implementation of this option in Ireland effectively ring-fences this significant fund for sheep farmers which otherwise would be distributed generally to the value of entitlements held by all farmers. <\/p><p>  As previously noted sheep farmers generally hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. <\/p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have the immediate benefit of an additional &euro;10.3 million in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500073#WRV00800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equine Industry Issues","counter":1310,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500073#WRV00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1311,"qnumday":591,"qnumall":"[9296\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500073#WRV00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the progress there has been in attracting further foreign interests to invest in the thoroughbred and bloodstock sectors here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1312,"content":"<p>Irish bloodstock is held in very high regard internationally. Approximately 14,000 people are employed in the thoroughbred industry in Ireland. The value of the industry is estimated at almost &euro;1.1bn annually and it attracts significant inward investment to the country. <\/p><p>  Irish Thoroughbred Marketing is proving adept at building markets overseas and driving inward investment. I believe there is great potential to grow the international market for Irish bloodstock in new and emerging markets, and to attract further inward investment  .<\/p><p>  I understand from Irish Thoroughbred Marketing that the following are some foreign investments that have been made in the thoroughbred and bloodstock sectors in Ireland in 2013 and to date in 2014:<\/p><p><b>Inward Investment:<\/b><\/p><p>  USA<\/p><p>  - A North American investor purchased an historic estate in Co. Meath, in 2013, with the intention of transforming it from an agricultural farm into a thoroughbred stud farm.<\/p><p>  QATAR <\/p><p>  - A Qatar businessman purchased a prestigious stud in Co. Limerick in 2013.   This investment will maintain employment and also represents an opportunity for further investment in Irish bloodstock as breeding stock is purchased for the farm. <\/p><p>  - At last year&rsquo;s Goffs Orby Sale, Ireland&rsquo;s premier yearling sale, a member of the Qatari ruling family who owns a stud farm in County Limerick invested &euro;2m in the purchase of 15 yearlings.<\/p><p>  - Again at last year&rsquo;s Goffs Orby Sale, another Qatar national invested &euro;2 million in 6 yearlings, purchased through the Irish-based bloodstock agents.  <\/p><p>  During the Ministerial Trade Mission to the Gulf States in 2013, I,  together with, ITM and HRI representatives met with these individuals  to acknowledge their significant investment in Ireland.  <\/p><p>  CHINA<\/p><p>  - In 2013, a leading figure in Chinese racing invested in 10 yearlings at the Goffs Orby sale, for &euro;300,000 in total.  These yearlings remained in Ireland for pre-training and were then dispersed amongst four Irish trainers.  This owner already had two horses in training in Ireland.   <\/p><p>  - In January 2014, a group of Chinese buyers purchased 12 horses for export to China.  These horses will be the first shipment under the new Veterinary Protocol between Ireland and China, which was agreed between my Department and the Chinese Authority AQSIQ in 2013, and allows for the direct export of horses from Ireland to China.  As a result of this Protocol, three further Chinese groups plan to travel to Ireland to purchase horses later this year.  <\/p><p>  SOUTH AMERICA <\/p><p>  - Investment in Irish breeding stock from South American investors topped &euro;1m in 2013, following their purchases at the Goffs November Sale last year.  With an ITM market visit to South America planned in March 2014, the plan is to build on this figure in 2014.<\/p><p>  - So far in 2014, there has been one International bloodstock sale in Ireland &ndash; The Goffs February Mixed Sale.  This sale saw buyers from Libya, India, Russia, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, etc. which helped to boost turnover for the sale by 46% on the previous year.<\/p><p>  - The Aggregate for the total amount of bloodstock sold at public auction in Ireland, in 2012, was &euro;93 million, this figure increased to &euro;133 million in 2013 (representing a 43% increase), with exports to 37 countries. <\/p><p><b>UPCOMING TRADE MISSIONS <\/b><\/p><p>  - In the first quarter of 2014, ITM will undertake Trade Missions to &ndash;

In light of the additional funds now available my Department has, as of 18 February, invited applications for funding from Local Authorities in respect of projects which relate to the repair of public fishery and aquaculture related harbours, piers and slipways damaged in the recent storm events. The closure date for applications is Friday 28 February. This scheme will form an extended part my Department's 2014 capital programme which provides support for the maintenance and development of public piers and harbours on an annual basis. In 2014, priority will be given to projects which relate to the repair of public Fishery and Aquaculture related harbours, piers and slipways damaged in the recent storm events.   <\/p><p>  In addition to the funding to be provided to local authorities, my Department will be moving to repair storm damage to piers, harbours and coastal infrastructure in its direct ownership. This will include moving as quickly as possible to repair the significant storm damage to North Harbour in Cape Clear, West Cork; Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre, County Waterford; the Gun Rock beacon, Inisboffin, County Mayo; the West Cove navigational beacon, County Kerry; and Roonagh Pier, County Mayo. <\/p><p>  In relation to inshore fishermen, a temporary one-off scheme of assistance to these pot fishermen is now available through Bord Iascaigh Mhara, with a closing date of 28 March 2014.  The Scheme is focused on smaller inshore fishermen, with vessels under 15 metres. It provides a set amount of &euro;24 per lobster pot lost or &euro;12 per shrimp pot lost, equivalent to 40% of the replacement cost, and is capped at a maximum of 50 pots for under 12 metre vessels and 100 for under 15 metre vessels.  A fisherman who has lost 100 pots at the replacement cost of approximately &euro;6,000 will receive assistance of a little under &euro;2,500. While I am conscious that some pot fishermen have reported losses of several hundred pots, I believe these are exceptional cases.  The &euro;1.5 million budget for this Scheme will be borne by the existing Vote within my Department and is not additional funding. There is no scope to increase this budget further, so I am emphasising that should applications exceed this budget, the rate of assistance will be reduced, either in terms of the amount of payment per pot or the maximum number of pots, in order to remain within a managed budget.<\/p><p>  The Deputies will agree that these are significant interventions in the current economic circumstances and are a clear indication of this Government's commitment to assisting rural coastal communities and the inshore fishing sector with their recovery from the storms.<\/p><p>  As income from fishing is derived from landings of catch, the amount that can be caught and therefore the income from most fisheries is determined by the EU quotas which are restrictive, and made available under our management arrangements with catch limits set for whitefish each month.   <\/p><p>  The quotas are managed to allow for access to quota for the full twelve months of the year, as far as possible.  The quota uptake figures for January 2014 and for the first part of February are significantly down.  In order that vessel owners and their crews are enabled to compensate as early as possible for these low catch levels, I have agreed with Industry to set allocations for March for a number of the key economic stocks at a higher level than in February.  These increased quotas and fishing opportunities for March will help to re-balance the landings to bring them more into line with planned annual spread of quota uptake.  They can be further adjusted in April to take into account of the low level of landings in the first 6 weeks of the year.  <\/p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has the overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families in the circumstances that have arisen.  Minister Burton&rsquo;s Department runs a number of schemes to support people in circumstances of loss of income. <\/p><p>  Under the Common Fisheries Policy, the proposed Regulation on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will replace the present European Fisheries Fund, and is to cover the period 2014 &ndash; 2020.  While the co-legislators have reached political agreement on the proposed EMFF Regulation, it will not be adopted in law until probably June this year.  My Department is working to prepare a new Operational Programme for the seafood sector under the EMFF.  That Programme is dependent on the progress of the proposed Regulation and so is likely to be finalised towards the end of the year.  There are many potential investments in the proposed EMFF Regulation and Member States are not expected to include all in their operational programmes.  Each member state must make investment choices, having regard to the finite allocation from the EMFF that each Member State will receive.  I am working closely with all stakeholders in making those hard choices between many competing and worthwhile investment priorities.  It is thus premature from both a legal and practical perspective to say at this time how the EMFF may assist fishermen with gear replacement or upgrade.  Having said that, the elimination of discards and reducing the impact on the marine environment of fishing gear are key elements of the new CFP and I am committed to assisting fishermen in adjusting fishing practices to comply with these CFP rules.

This result was subsequently confirmed by means of an examination by a Department Veterinary Inspector and also by means of the appropriate blood test.  Under relevant EU and national legislation designed to eradicate this disease, an animal which discloses a positive result to a TB test must be deemed a reactor and must be removed in a timely manner from the herd.  I might add that the fact that TB lesions were not detected following slaughter of the animal in no way undermines the definitive nature of the above results.   <\/p><p>  The herdowner refused to co-operate with the normal arrangements in place for removal of the reactor on two occasions and also failed to comply with a 7 day statutory notice requiring him to arrange delivery of the animal to a slaughter plant.

As I have stated on a number of occasions it is important to note that complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen in the drafting of the Bill.  A particular challenge has arisen in the attempt to reconcile an adopted person's request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent where consent has not been provided.  My Department is continuing to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues.  One reason for the discussions with the Attorney General is to continue to tease out precisely how this can be done in the context of what I must state is extremely strong legal advice about the constitutional protection of the rights of the natural mother to privacy.  A number of European court cases also have addressed this issue and highly complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen.  I continue to explore how far the Government can go in building into legislation that right of the adopted person to get access to information without breaching the Constitution.  This is the reason it is taking this length of time to draft the Heads of Bill.  I intend to submit the Heads of Bill for Government approval as soon as these issues have been addressed.  <\/p><p>  I am not in a position to give a comprehensive account of the provisions of the proposed legislation until the Heads of Bill have been agreed by Government.  Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration.  The process of sending the Heads of Bill to that Committee will ensure that the provisions of the proposed legislation will be subject to public scrutiny and it is of course open to that Committee to invite and encourage submissions from all interested  parties.  In the meantime I am open to any proposals or suggestions in relation to policy on this matter that assists in achieving as much access as possible in a manner that is legally and constitutionally sound.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500074#WRW02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Funding","counter":1396,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500074#WRW02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1397,"qnumday":621,"qnumall":"[9254\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500074#WRW02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will address the issues experienced by a child care service (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will streamline the continuous changes to grants and schemes to ensure this centre and similar child care centres throughout the country can plan ahead and provide a professional and quality service.

Community childcare services qualify for funding under the CCS programme on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The information provided in the parental declaration forms submitted to my Department is verified by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and the HSE.  This information determines the level of subvention which applies to each individual parent.  The information is gathered during a 'snap shot' week in the month of October.<\/p><p>  Following verification, participating services are provided with a list of qualifying parents and confirmation of the subvention level applied to each parent.  Parents can appeal if they consider that they are entitled to a higher rate of subvention.  The verification and appeals process is necessary so as to ensure that all those applying for support under the programme satisfy the qualifying criteria.  It is only when this process is complete that the final figure to which each service is entitled can be determined.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, the Department has found a high level of inaccuracies in the information submitted and this is a major contributory factor in the delays in finalising the final payment to providers.  It should be noted that my Department does make a number of preliminary payments to participating services prior to the final determination to ensure that services have sufficient funding to enable them to continue to provide the service.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the appeals process for this year is currently being processed at a quick pace and so, it is anticipated that the complete process will be finalised earlier than in previous years.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the ECCE programme, payments can only be made in respect of children who are within the qualifying age range.  When ECCE returns are received in the Department, the PPS numbers are forwarded to the Department of Social Protection in order to verify that the PPS number and the child's date of birth correspond.  When discrepancies arise, childcare services are required to forward documentation confirming the child's details.  Payments, which are backdated where necessary, issue as soon as possible after confirmation of the child's eligibility.  As is the case with the CCS programme, the level of accuracy of the information submitted by participating services has a major impact on the capacity of this Department to determine the final capitation payment to which services are entitled.  It has been necessary to make a small number of administrative changes to the programmes in recent years.  These have resulted from the need to ensure that funding is targeted at those most in need of support and that the considerable public funds committed to these programmes is providing the maximum benefit to the greatest possible number of qualifying children.   <\/p><p>  I would like also to advise the Deputy that in addition to the above programme new strands of childcare support programmes have been introduced to support parents and children in need of childcare supports for social, training or employment reasons.

As a contracting state under the Hague Convention, the Adoption Act 2010 provides that adoptions by Irish prospective adoptive parents may be made subject to Irish and Indian requirements being satisfied in line with relevant laws and the provisions of the Hague Convention. <\/p><p>  It is a matter for contacting states whether they wish to impose restrictions on whether and how intercountry adoptions of citizens of that State may be effected.  In this regard, the Authority advises that there remains a general moratorium by the Indian Central Authority (CARA) on India accepting adoption applications from other countries other than in special circumstances.  The Authority  has recently received an announcement from CARA that India is currently accepting packs from non-resident Indian prospective adoptive parents for the adoption of Indian children (normal category).  This means that India remains closed to non-Indian prospective adoptive parents at this time in respect of its normal categories of children.  The Adoption Authority understands that CARA is accepting applications in respect of special needs children, which includes children over five years of age and sibling groups.  The Authority is currently attempting to establish from CARA a possible time frame for the acceptance of application packs in the 'normal' category from non-Indian nationals. <\/p><p>  The Adoption Authority has advised it is their position that it is necessary to have an Irish registered accredited body to facilitate intercountry adoptions from India in order to safeguard the process for the child and the adoptive parents.  The Authority has two applications for India from Irish agencies which are being considered.  Any accreditation being considered by the Authority can only apply to the Indian Special Needs Programme at this time.  The accreditation of agencies to facilitate adoptions is solely a matter for the Adoption Authority under law.  I have raised with the Adoption Authority the likely timescale of reaching conclusions on these applications and I understand it is intended to finalise the process promptly. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, the Authority advises that it is the policy of CARA to impose the following age limits and age differentials.  Again, they are a matter for the Indian authorities and are not specific to Ireland.<\/p><p>- To adopt a child in the age group of 0-3 years, the maximum composite age of the prospective adoptive parents should be 90 years wherein the individual age of the prospective adoptive parents should not be less than 25 years and not more than 50 years. <\/p><p>- To adopt children above three years of age, the maximum composite age of the PAPs should be 105 years wherein the individual age of the PAPs should not be less than 25 years and not more than 55 years.<\/p><p>- In the case of a single applicant, he or she should not be less than 30 years of age and shall not be above the age of 50 years.  The maximum age shall be 45 years to adopt children in the age group of 0-3 years and 50 years for adopting children above 3 years. <\/p><p>  Updates in relation to intercountry adoption from India are posted on the Authority website when available (www.aai.gov.ie).<\/p><p>  I have arranged to meet a  group in relation to intercountry adoption and arrangements  in the coming week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500074#WRW02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500074#WRW02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1409,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[9379\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500074#WRW02900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the funding available for children's playground facilities; her policy regarding the development of same; the involvement of local authorities in applying for funding and deciding on locations of playgrounds; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family qualify for a medical card. The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Act and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her dependants. The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.<\/p><p>  While there is no legal basis for the HSE to award medical cards on the basis of a specific medical condition, the HSE has, however, discretion to grant a medical card in certain circumstances. If an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds, set out in the national guidelines, the HSE examines for any indication of circumstances (medical or social), which might result in undue financial hardship in the arranging of medical services. Eligibility may be granted on a discretionary basis if these circumstances are such that a person cannot arrange GP services for themselves and their family without undue financial hardship. <\/p><p>  Discretion must be exercised by the HSE but the fundamental provision in the 1970 Act is that a person is assessed on the basis of undue hardship in arranging a GP service, having regard to his or her means. The HSE must, of course, operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card. <\/p><p>  The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation  for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are  terminally ill. These are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. <\/p><p>  With the exception of terminally ill patients, all emergency cards are issued on the basis that the patent is eligible for a medical card on means or undue hardship and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. There are no proposals to change these processes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500075#WRX04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":1501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500075#WRX04050"},{"type":"question","counter":1502,"qnumday":658,"qnumall":"[9124\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500075#WRX04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on a submission (details supplied); if the costs as outlined by a nursing home are within the guidelines of the legislation; if he is satisfied that a patient should be charged &euro;3 per item in regard to delivery of samples and collection of prescriptions; if a person should have to pay for a care assistant at the rate of &euro;10 per hour; if it is correct that a patient has to pay &euro;15 per month for Health Information Quality Authority costs; if the stated payments are applicable if a person was an inpatient since 20 August 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Incontinence wear, where required, is provided free of charge by the HSE to all Nursing Homes Support Scheme residents that possess a Medical Card.<\/p><p>  Part 8 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract with each resident within one month of their admission. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should not be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.<\/p><p>  The HSE is not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.<\/p><p>  All nursing homes must register with the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and comply with the conditions and requirements laid down by HIQA in this context. Fees are payable by operators for initial application for registration, for variation or removal of any conditions of registration, and an annual fee is also payable by each registered provider. <\/p><p>  As stated earlier, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care, for which no additional charges should be levied on residents. As compliance with HIQA requirements, including payment of appropriate fees, is mandatory for all operators providing even these standard components of nursing home care, it is not clear how an additional charge for residents based on standard HIQA fees can be justified. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) negotiates the price for long-term residential care with private nursing home owners on behalf of the State. In the course of its negotiations, the NTPF factors in the fees associated with the registration and inspection of nursing homes as part of the reasonable day to day running costs associated with the provision of long-term residential care services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500075#WRX04200","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500075#WRX04250"},{"type":"question","counter":1505,"qnumday":659,"qnumall":"[9136\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500075#WRX04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1506,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family qualify for a medical card.  The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Act and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her dependants.  The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.<\/p><p>  While there is no legal basis for the HSE to award medical cards on the basis of a specific medical condition, the HSE has, however, discretion to grant a medical card in certain circumstances.  If an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds, set out in the national guidelines, the HSE examines for any indication of circumstances (medical or social), which might result in undue financial hardship in the arranging of medical services.  Eligibility may be granted on a discretionary basis if these circumstances are such that a person cannot arrange GP services for themselves and their family without undue financial hardship. <\/p><p>  Discretion must be exercised by the HSE but the fundamental provision in the 1970 Act is that a person is assessed on the basis of undue hardship in arranging a GP service, having regard to his or her means.  The HSE must, of course, operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.  Medical card applicants or their dependants, affected with primary immunodeficiency conditions, who submit supporting medical reports with an application for a medical card and who do not qualify for a medical card on an assessment of means, have the management of their medical condition considered during the assessment process to determine if the refusal of eligibility would result in undue financial hardship for the applicant or any dependants.<\/p><p>  PCRS management has recently advised me that they have met with a number of health care professionals from Crumlin Children's Hospital who have specific responsibility for the treatment of children with significant primary immune deficiency disorders.  PRCS management clarified the process by which the assessment of medical card applications is undertaken and the granting of eligibility under the Medical Card Scheme.  The health care professionals were briefed on primary care services, available locally, to this cohort of patients under the auspices of other community health schemes and the pathways to access such services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500076#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Availability","counter":1529,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500076#WRY01125"},{"type":"question","counter":1530,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[9250\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500076#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding enabling the self-possession of emergency medications to patients with C1 inhibitor deficiency hereditary angioedema, as is common practice in most European countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1531,"content":"<p>Patients with hereditary angioedema have attacks of swelling that can occur anywhere in the body, such as in the face or limbs, or around the gut, causing discomfort and pain.

For those young people who will require ongoing HSE-funded supports, the HSE has established a National Oversight Group to coordinate a timely response to processing applications for day services and rehabilitative training places. As a result, new arrangements have been put in place for a centralised regional application process. <\/p><p>  The HSE have informed me that they are liaising with disability agencies and the National Council for Special Education to supply the necessary information to parents and students on the new application process.

The next stage in the process will be to identify and agree the supports required for each individual, identify the service providers who have the capacity to respond to those support needs, and agree the allocation of additional resources to support individual placements.

Therefore, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has a dual focus:<\/p><p>- implementing measures to prevent and control HCAIs including those caused by AMR such as MRSA<\/p><p>- implementing specific measures for AMR including  MRSA:<\/p><p>- These are outlined in national guidelines which have been recently updated <\/p><p>- Monitoring infections caused by AMR as outlined later in this response.<\/p><p>  The HSE has implemented a number of national initiatives in this field for many years, including:<\/p><p>- SARI 2001-2010 (The Strategy for the Control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland)  which specifically outlined the national strategy for prevention of AMR and was launched by the Minister of Health in 2001.<\/p><p>- HSE &lsquo; Say No to Infection&rsquo; which focused on both HCAIs and AMR, launched in 2007<\/p><p>- The RCPI &amp;amp; HSE National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR which commenced in late 2010.<\/p><p>  Public reporting of HCAIs and AMR in Irish acute hospitals: <\/p><p>- HCAIs Prevalence Study 2006 and 2012<\/p><p>-  <i>S. aureus <\/i>  bloodstream infection (reported quarterly since 2007) &ndash; this includes public reporting of MRSA rates per hospital<\/p><p>- Alcohol hand rub consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)<\/p><p>- Antibiotic consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)<\/p><p>- Hand hygiene compliance (reported bi-annually since 2011)<\/p><p>  The overall aim of the National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is that every healthcare worker and all parts of the healthcare system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance. Our healthcare systems have processes in place to ensure safe healthcare is reliably delivered irrespective of the healthcare setting.  The programme focuses on getting three basic practices right every time we care for our patients, these are hand hygiene, using antimicrobials appropriately (antimicrobial stewardship) &amp;amp; preventing medical device-related infections i.e., IV lines\/drips, urinary catheters.  If the above three measures are applied consistently and reliably every time healthcare workers care for their patients\/residents\/client then a significant proportion of HCAIs, including that caused by AMR will be prevented. <\/p><p>  While I welcome the reducing trend in reported rates of MRSA in Ireland, MRSA rates are comparably high with other countries.  We must systematically build our actions and processes to continue to reduce the prevalence of MRSA in Ireland. <\/p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's question about the number of deaths that have been linked to MRSA, routine data is not available on deaths from hospital acquired infections (HCAIs). In certain cases such infections may be a contributing factor to a particular death but not the primary cause, hence the difficulty in giving definitive statistics on the issue.<\/p><p>  In December last I launched and endorsed the second National Clinical Guideline, Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus <\/i>  (MRSA).   This National Clinical Guideline provides practical guidance on prevention and control measures for MRSA to improve patient care, minimise patient morbidity and mortality and to help contain healthcare costs.  The guideline has been developed for all healthcare staff involved in the care of patients, residents or clients who may be at risk of or may have MRSA in acute hospitals, obstetrics and neonates, nursing homes\/long stay residential units and the community.  <\/p><p>  I might add that I have ensured that Patient Safety has been made a priority within the HSE's Annual Service Plan through specific measures focused on quality and patient safety including HCAIs, Medication safety and implementation of Early Warning Score systems.  My officials meet the HSE each month on the Service Plan and patient safety is a standing item on that agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500077#WRZ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500077#WRZ02125"},{"type":"question","counter":1619,"qnumday":697,"qnumall":"[8758\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500077#WRZ02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on a matter (details provided) regarding a hip operation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1620,"content":"<p>The management of inpatient and daycase waiting lists for patients awaiting public health care is based on the principle that after urgent and cancer patients are treated, then clinically assessed routine patients should be seen in chronological order (i.e. longest waiter first).<\/p><p>  Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he\/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.<\/p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500077#WRZ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1621,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500077#WRZ02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1622,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[9507\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500077#WRZ02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite a medical card application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1623,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

Any support that the Northern Irish Executive or individual Ministers of the Executive can bring to bear on the UK Government\u00a0to ensure that there is an exemption for the A5\u00a0would of course be welcomed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500078#WRAA03500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme Eligibility","counter":1709,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500078#WRAA03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1710,"qnumday":727,"qnumall":"[8962\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500078#WRAA03600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the assessment criteria that will operate for the current round of the sports capital programme; the manner in which it will be scored; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The effects of wear and tear on a vehicle become more evident as it gets older\u00a0and even a\u00a0vehicle that\u00a0is not driven, or driven\u00a0very little,\u00a0will deteriorate over time with a potential\u00a0impact on safety.<\/p><p>  Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the roadworthiness testing requirements in regard to low mileage cars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500079#WRBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licence Applications","counter":1751,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500079#WRBB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1752,"qnumday":741,"qnumall":"[9358\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500079#WRBB01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the average waiting time for the processing of the new driving licences in each of the new National Driver Licence Service designated centres.","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1753,"content":"<p>The Road Safety Authority (RSA)\u00a0has statutory responsibility for the\u00a0operation of the National Driver Licensing Service.<\/p><p>  I understand from the Authority that applications which are fully in order are being processed in or under twelve days.\u00a0 Cases where the application is not fully in order, and further documentation and\/or contact with the applicant is required, take longer.<\/p><p>  The RSA has advised me that it is on course to have a ten-day turnaround by the end of February, and a five- to eight-day turnaround by the end of March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500079#WRBB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1754,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 742 and 743 answered with Question No. 726.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":1755,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500079#WRBB01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1756,"qnumday":744,"qnumall":"[8806\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022500079#WRBB01900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to link two roads (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1757,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.\u00a0 The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under sections 17 and 19 of the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<\/p><p>  I understand the NRA has allocated in excess of &euro;9.63m in national road grants to Kerry in 2014.
