We are joined by Ms Vicky Phelan, one of the women directly affected by the crisis along with her solicitor, Mr. Cian O'Carroll.  We are also joined by Mr. Stephen Teap, the husband of Irene Teap who has sadly passed away from cervical cancer.  Thank you for agreeing to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts this evening.<\/p> <p>  The committee has already met officials from the Department of Health, the HSE and the State Claims Agency on the matter and we will resume that side of our discussions tomorrow.  For now, we want to hear from the people directly affected by this crisis.  It will be key in terms of making changes to the system used by the HSE to learn from those who have had direct experience of the system.  That is why their evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts is important.  We want to ensure that the women and families who have been directly impacted - they are very much representative of that group - are treated appropriately especially in respect of access to their information.<\/p> <p>  We also, of course, want the cancer screening service to continue and for the population to use it.  Notwithstanding the failures that have been highlighted and which have caused such public anger, it is a valuable part of our public health system.  We welcome the changes that are coming in which will make screening a more accurate exercise.<\/p> <p>  Ms Phelan and Mr. Teap are here today specifically to help the members of the committee deal with the whole question of open disclosure.  That matter has been discussed by the HSE and the State Claims Agency at this committee on several previous occasions.  We know there is a policy position in change.  We have heard from the relevant officials from those institutions in the past and no doubt we will hear from them again.  However, the job of the Committee of Public Accounts is to hear all sides of the story as to how that operates in practice.  Your attendance here today will help us verify what we are hearing from the State institutions on the matter.  That is why your evidence today will be beneficial in bringing about improvements that are ultimately required to be implemented - by legislation if necessary - as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  We are in your hands, Vicky and Stephen.  We are here to hear your story.  We are here substantially in listening mode.  We will have some questions afterwards by way of clarification if you are happy to take them.  We are here to listen respectfully to you.  As everyone knows, we public representatives do a lot of talking, but listening is often a far more important aspect of our job.<\/p> <p>  I will start with you, Vicky.  You might tell us your story in your own words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#C00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526486400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Thank you, Se&aacute;n.  Thank you all for inviting myself and Stephen here today to tell our side of the story.  It is great to be able to have this opportunity for me in particular to set out my experience and to answer any questions you may have at the end of it.  Some of you have already heard my story numerous times at this stage I am sure.  It has been dissected in different parts of the media.  For me today, it is important that you hear my side of the story from me.<\/p> <p>  I will give my timeline and go back to where this all started for me.  In February 2011, I had my son, Darragh.  I had a smear test about eight weeks after I had Darragh.  Up to and before I had my son I had always had smears from when I was old enough to have them, before CervicalCheck came into being in 2008.  I never missed a smear.  I had always had normal smears.  I had never had an abnormal one.  I had never had any LLETZ procedures or colposcopies so I had nothing to worry about in 2011 when I went for my smear after having my son.  My pregnancy with my son went absolutely perfectly.  I had no bleeding - no issues whatsoever.  It was a textbook pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  When I went for my smear at the end of May 2011 with my GP, I had nothing to worry about.  When she rang me four weeks later with the result of that smear and told me that it was normal and that I was not due for another smear for another three years, I was not even worried, to be honest.  I was not expecting the result to be anything but normal.  Then in July 2014 I was first diagnosed with cervical cancer.  I actually went in earlier that year - I was not even called for the smear at that point.  I went to my GP in June 2014, complaining of symptoms.  For me, the symptoms were bleeding in between my periods.  It was nothing major, just very light bleeding, but it happened for three months in a row from March until June.  I gave it three months and I decided I would go to my GP and get it checked out, and ask for my smear a little bit early.  I was not due until October that year apparently when I got the letter but I went in a little bit early just to get it checked out.  I still really did not have any worries but there was something at the back of my mind.  I just thought it was a little bit unusual for me.  I was very lucky.  I am a woman who has always had very regular periods.  My sister would have always had very irregular periods and so she would not have gone with the symptoms I had.<\/p> <p>  My gynaecologist at the time when I was diagnosed told me that the type of symptoms I was complaining about were very minor.  I think that is something that women need to know.  It does not have to be really bad back pain and haemorrhaging that will send you into your doctor for cervical cancer.  I had very mild symptoms and I still got diagnosed, but now I know that my diagnosis goes back prior to 2014.  What made me go to the doctor in the end was that I had a bleed after sex, basically.  That is what made me really think this a little bit more serious than I thought.<\/p> <p>  When I went for my smear in June, I bled after the nurse took the smear and she said that was a bit unusual because it was quite a lot so she marked it urgent and sent it off to the lab.  That particular smear in 2014 went to MedLab in Sandyford.  The result came back four weeks later.  I got a call when I was in work on 2 July from the GP who told me that the result had come in and she wanted to talk to me.  I asked her, \"Can you not talk to me over the phone?  Is it just high-grade changes that involve LLETZ procedure or colposcopy?\"  I kind of pushed her, but she would not say anything really over the phone; she asked me to come in.<\/p> <p>  I went in when I got back after work that week.  She told me that there were very high-grade changes and that she was sending me for an urgent colposcopy so I went for that urgent colposcopy two weeks later on 15 July 2014.  When I had the colposcopy, I went to the colposcopy clinic in Limerick.  Dr. Kevin Hickey is the lead colposcopist there in Limerick.  He checked me and while he was doing the LLETZ procedure - he told me two days later when I got the result that it was cancer - but that day he did not tell me.  Obviously, he had to get the result of the biopsy, but he told me he knew.  He could see the tumour.  I had a 4 cm tumour.<\/p> <p>  He did the LLETZ procedure and took away 3 cm of a tumour that day.  It was a very uncomfortable procedure.  It was not a nice experience for any woman to go through, to be honest, but I did have an inkling that something was wrong before I left his clinic because he asked me if I was finished having children.  At that stage I was 39 and had two kids.  Luckily enough for me I did not want any more children; I was happy with my two.  I said to him, \"Why?  Are you telling me I have cancer?\"  He said, \"No, no, no - I am sending your sample off for a biopsy.  It's just that these changes are very high grade and we would recommend a hysterectomy.\"  He had already booked me in for a hysterectomy at that stage.  I was due to come back on 1 August for a hysterectomy.<\/p> <p>  At that stage alarm bells were ringing and I thought, \"Jesus, is it cancer or is it not?\"  I was waiting for this call.  That was 15 July.  Two days later he rang me.  He had the results of this biopsy and it was cancer.  He said, \"We're going to go ahead with the hysterectomy on 1 August, but in the meantime I'm going to send you for an MRI scan just to be sure there hasn't been any spread outside your cervix.\"  If the cancer is contained within the cervix, a hysterectomy would sort everything out and there would be no need for chemotherapy or radiation.  I went off for my MRI scan a week later on 22 July.<\/p><p>On 29 July, I went to Kevin Hickey for the result and my husband came with me to that appointment.  Dr. Hickey told me that unfortunately the cancer was showing up as having spread outside my cervix.  It was highlighted in two lymph nodes.  He said that at that stage, the hysterectomy was off the table because once it spreads outside the cervix, the cancer is graded much higher.  He was then going to send me for a PET scan to see if it had spread any further and whether they might see small metastases.  I went for my PET scan and that came back.  Luckily enough, at that stage, it was only in two lymph nodes.  However, the treatment plan had changed from a hysterectomy, for which I had planned at that stage, to radical chemotherapy and radiation.  I was then passed to the oncology team and put under a radiation oncologist.  For people who do not have cancer, it is hard to understand.  You have all these oncologists and some people are under radiation oncologists while others are under medical oncologists, depending on the primary treatment.  In my case, I was having radiotherapy five days a week and my primary oncologist was a radiation oncologist, namely, Dr. Lorraine Walsh.  If you are attending primarily for chemotherapy, you have a medical oncologist.  Dr. Lorraine Walsh was my lead oncologist and Dr. Kevin Hickey was the gynaecologist.<\/p><p> I started my treatment at the start of September 2014 and it was five weeks of hell.  That is the only way to describe it.  I was told that type of treatment is not prescribed for everyone.  I am sure Stephen will attest to that as Irene Teap had the same type of treatment.  It is usually prescribed for younger women who can tolerate it.  It is five days a week of radiation and one full day of chemotherapy.  It is all day from 8.30 a.m. until 6.30 p.m. and you are literally green coming out of it.  At the time, I was coming home to two small children.  My son was only three and my daughter was eight.  It was very difficult and I was in bed for two or three days, unable to move and vomiting.  It is a horrible experience and one I would not wish on my worst enemy.  It was very difficult.  On top of the treatment, you have to put up with all of the side effects.  You are very sick and are given tablets to deal with that.  You cannot sleep because you are on steroids to deal with the chemotherapy.  It is a vicious circle.  Luckily, I did not lose my hair.  I like my hair and that was one good thing.  People can call it vanity if they want but it was important to me because my son loved my hair.<\/p><p> It was a horrendous experience.  The worst part of it, which no one really explains, was to come.  I am sure Stephen will say the same.  It was the brachytherapy, which is internal radiation treatment.  After the five weeks of hell, you get a two-week break and they then bring you in for internal radiation treatment called brachytherapy.  They literally insert an applicator up inside you.  They knock you out for this.  It was three times in a week and a half.  There were three epidurals in a week and a half.  They then irradiate whatever is left up there.  Whatever is left inside you is literally melted together.  I have no ovaries, womb or anything at this stage.  It is all melted together.  That is supposed to cure you.  Those two weeks were the worst part of it.  I had my last treatment on my 40th birthday so that was really lovely.  At the end of it, I had an MRI scan.  They leave you alone for a few months to recover and it takes that long.  I had an MRI scan in February 2015, which showed there was no evidence of disease.  I was relieved.  I cannot say I was delighted because I was still sick and in recovery from the effects of the treatment.  I had no evidence of disease and they told me that was great.<\/p><p> The next step was to bring me in every three months for two years because I was very high risk.  I was stage 1B2 in terms of my original diagnosis in 2014, but because it had spread outside the cervix into lymph nodes, I was staged much higher in treatment terms.  One is staged like a stage 3 cancer because once it spreads to the lymphatic system, there is no telling where it is going to go.  They have to keep a very close eye.  I was being seen every three months after I finished my treatment.  One goes between the gynaecologist and the oncologist every three months.  I had complained consistently of back pain after I finished my treatment, however.  Looking back at my medical notes, which we got when I went through my court case, I was glad to see that I was not making this up.  I complained consistently at the appointments of back pain but nobody really took much notice.  They just kept saying it was a normal post-radiation effect.  One trusts the doctors and assumes they know what they are doing and, as such, I believed them.  I got to my two-year timeline and I thought that was good.  They say that if you get past the first two years, you are doing really well.  The next step after that is five years when you are really flying it.  Obviously, I have not got to the five years and am back now with terminal cancer.  I barely got to the four years, to be honest.<\/p><p> When I went back to Kevin Hickey for my check-up in September 2017, I was not feeling any worse than usual.  I was fine and had no reduction in my energy levels.  However, I had this lower back pain.  The previous year, 2016, I booked myself into Barringtons Hospital privately for an ultrasound because I had this tugging sensation in my abdomen.  I thought I had pulled a muscle or something as I was weight-lifting at that stage and trying to get back into exercise.  However, it did not clear up so I went for the ultrasound.  It could not explain the tugging and came back as normal.  As such, I did not think anything of it.  When I went to Kevin Hickey in September, I told him about the usual back pain and this tugging sensation in my abdomen.  I had a pelvic exam, an internal exam, and he did not find anything wrong at that stage.  Everything looked normal as far as he was concerned.  He told me he would send me for a scan just to be sure.  At that stage in September, when I had this meeting, I still did not have cancer.  That is important to bear in mind with what I was told then.<\/p><p> I went for a scan in November and that was when I found out cancer was back.  Once I went through the whole round of MRIs and PET scans, I found out, just after Christmas, that my cancer was back and was literally up my body.  It is in my paraaortic lymph nodes so it is in a chain all around my aorta.  It is touching off all my organs.  Approximately five lymph nodes are forming a 10 cm mass around my aorta.  All of one's vital organs are around there.  Part of it is touching off my kidneys, my lungs and my liver.  As such, I am not a candidate for surgery or radiation.  All they would offer me was palliative chemotherapy.  I went to see my radiation oncologist on 12 January this year and was told the only option open to me was palliative chemotherapy.  No other treatment was available.  If I took the palliative chemotherapy option, I had 12 months and, if I did not, I had six months to live.  I pushed her to find out the timeframes as she was not willingly going to tell me.  That is where I am at the moment with a terminal diagnosis.<\/p><p> I will rewind a bit to that meeting I had with Dr. Hickey in September 2017 when he sent me for the scan to find out what I know now, that I have terminal cancer.  He told me then that he wanted to have a chat with me about the audit the cervical screening programme had carried out.  He told me audits are carried out as a matter of routine when women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  That triggers a check.  When a woman is diagnosed with cervical cancer, CervicalCheck will look at her screening history to see if there was anything which might have been missed.  The smear which diagnosed my cancer was in 2014.  My previous smear was in May 2011, eight weeks after the birth of my son, and I had been told it was normal.  When they retested it, he told me, there was now a query about the smear.  He did not actually say it was cancer at that meeting, he just said there was a query and that I may have had cancer or the starting of cancer, pre-cancer, in 2011.<\/p><p> When I was in with him in September, I was not in a state of mind to take this any further for two reasons.  First, I was cancer-free as far as I was aware.  That changed two months later.  Second, as a family my husband and I had a lot of medical issues to deal with for my daughter who has a congenital disorder.  Last year, in 2017, she had two full tonic-clonic epileptic seizures in school, which came out of nowhere.  It is a result of her congenital toxoplasmosis diagnosis, which led to a reactivation.  Basically, she has a parasite living at the back of her eye.  I was diagnosed when I was pregnant and she was treated for 12 months when she was a baby.  We went through the early intervention programme.<\/p><p>She had a stroke effect on her left-hand side.  We had awful problems with her.  She is basically blind in one eye.  She has 70% vision in the other eye but we thought we had dealt with it.  We were very lucky that she was not brain damaged and that she was not blind.  We were very happy that she was doing really well in school.  All of a sudden this kicked off in 2016 but it is all because of puberty.  She has hit puberty, she is nearly 13.  We went back down the whole rollercoaster of medication for her.  She was now on anti-epileptic medication as well as medication to treat her condition.  She nearly lost her eyesight during the summer of 2017.  We had to take her to Moorfields Eye Hospital in the United Kingdom.  She had to have laser surgery.<\/p><p> I had enough going on at that stage without trying to get my head around knowing that I probably had cancer in 2011 so I did not take it further in September.  When I found out in November I knew at that stage that I was going to have to do something but I waited until I knew what my treatment plan was.  There is all this waiting with scans, going from MRI scans, to PET scans to treatment plans.  When they told me it was terminal I was trying to get my head around it but I was not going to accept a terminal prognosis and went to research other options at that stage.<\/p><p> By the time I went to see the medical oncologist about options for the palliative chemotherapy I had insisted on a biopsy because I wanted to be 100% sure this was the same cancer I had, not a new cancer because the treatment would be different.  On 19 January I was waiting to have my biopsy.  Myself and my mother were sitting in a treatment room waiting for a bed, as you do with the HSE.  We were there for about four hours.  I was very bored.  I had my file because it had been sent up with me from admissions.  I started looking through it.  I still had not made the decision about whether I was going to go further legally about this missed smear.  As I was going through my file I noticed this letter from CervicalCheck and when I read it I could see the smear test date, 24 May 2011.  This is the report that CervicalCheck sent back to my gynaecologist on the review of my smear from 2011.  The original report stated no abnormality detected, NAD.  The review was query squamous cell carcinoma.<\/p><p> At that stage alarm bells started ringing in my head because Mr. Hickey was very vague in September and just said that there was a query, that there may have been a question about me having cancer in 2011 but this was in black and white, quite clear, this is cancer.  I then noticed at the end of the page that this was page 2 of two of this report.  I work in administration so I notice these things even though it is tiny, page 2 of two.  I was sitting there asking my mother \"Jesus, where's page 1?\".  Mam said \"Ah sure it's probably just a cover page.\"  I said, \"Well, yeah, but from who, to who and when was it dated?\" because at that stage I started questioning when this was sent.  When I thought back to the conversation with Mr. Hickey I assumed that the audit had been carried out just that year, in 2017.  I took a photo of that and anything else in my file and straightaway started researching medical negligence solicitors.  I contacted Cian O'Carroll on 30 January, I was in his office and that was the start of me taking my court case.  We requested files then from CervicalCheck and that was the start of all this coming out.<\/p><p> I was not affected by the delay in being told that my cancer went back to 2011 and make no mistake about it, I had cancer in 2011 - it was not pre-cancer, it was cancer.  The misdiagnosis in my case, and I know this is not the case for other women in this audit, has cost me my life.  I have got terminal cancer.  I do not believe I am going to die but at the end of the day I am going to have to fight to live for the rest of my life and go from one treatment option to another until I find something to cure me but I should not be in this position at all, if my cancer had been picked up on that smear where there were plenty of cancer cells, there is no question from the expert cytologist on my legal team.  The person looking at my smear sample either was not competent or did not look at it at all because it was full of cancer.  It is not that there was a small little bit of cancer on the slide, it was full of cancer.  I could have been one of the women, like Irene, Stephen's wife, who was not given the chance to find out and was not given the chance to fight.  Stephen is here on her behalf.  At least I am still here to tell the tale.  That is why I am fighting with everything in my being not only to live but to get to the bottom of this because it is a disgrace that we have been put in this position.<\/p><p> There are three issues, first, open disclosure, which did not happen in my case, too little too late.  Mr. Hickey told me in September 2017 about this audit.  When we got the correspondence back through disclosure we found out that this audit was carried out in October 2014 on my smear.  I was diagnosed in July 2014.  It took a full two years to decide to communicate this to clinicians so it was July 2016 before CervicalCheck communicated my particular case to my gynaecologist.  Then there was 15 months of correspondence between the head of CervicalCheck and my gynaecologist about whose responsibility it was to tell me, 15 months of them deciding \"You tell her\", \"No you tell her\" before he finally told me in September 2017.<\/p><p> People will say it would not have made any difference at that stage because I already had cancer but I know the type of person I am, and Stephen will tell you the same about Irene, I would want to know that.  They should have told me that.  That is my information.  I am the patient.  It is my information that was hidden from me.  I would probably have asked for more scans if I had known \"Jesus hang on a minute here, I don't have cancer only since 2014, in fact it's going back a further three years.\"  We know with cervical cancer the longer you have it the worse your prognosis.  That would have made me be more on top of my gynaecologist and oncologist and look for more scans and maybe it would have been picked up a little sooner and I would not be in this position.  <\/p><p> Patient safety is another issue.  Why were serious errors highlighted by these audits not treated as patient safety incidents?  In the briefing note sent to the Minister with regard to my case before it went to court, Jerome Coffey gave a written opinion to say that my mistake was not a patient safety issue.  I would like to know does Jerome Coffey, who is the head of the National Cancer Control Programme, NCCP, still believe this to be the case now that there are 18 women dead and 209 women involved.  If it is his view is he the appropriate person to be in charge? <\/p><p> The other question I have is who are the senior management team who approved this communication strategy which has come out?  We have seen various iterations of it in the press over the past few days.  Who approved this communications strategy and who decided it was okay not only not to tell the clinicians but not to tell the patients?  Why was the HSE more worried about being sued by the labs, such as Quest, than communicating the information on incorrect or misread smears to patients?  That fills the gap for us, to know that in the two years between my audit and the communication I received from my gynaecologist there was a full 12 months of wrangling between the HSE and one of these labs about disclosing information to clinicians never mind patients.  Where is the open disclosure in this instance?  Who stood over these contracts? <\/p><p> My questions are about open disclosure, patient safety and the labs.  With regard to the labs, who stood over these contracts where patient safety and open disclosure were not considered to be important issues?  When you think of the legal wrangling they were having with these labs where the labs were basically saying their contracts stipulated that the clinicians were not to be told because these were for educational purposes.  The reason my case went to court and I had to give evidence, and it went on for four days, was that the lab was insisting on a confidentiality clause because this was agreed as part of its contract with the HSE.  They are the two big issues I see with the labs.  I want to know who stood over these contracts, if they were reading them.  Patient safety and open disclosure were clearly not included if you read through their stipulations.  How can anyone stand over that and give these people contracts?<\/p><p> I think that is it.<\/p><p>If there anything else I need to say, the big thing for me is patient safety.  I am not interested in revenge.  That is not what I am here for.  I want to see accountability and I would like to see a legacy that this will never happen again to any woman, man or child in this country.  This is not just an issue for women.  This is affecting men and children who are without their wives and their mothers.  I never want to see this happen again.  If I do die, I do not want it to be in vain.  I want to make sure that protocols put in place, that there are sanctions for people who make these mistakes and that they are held accountable.  The HSE should be overhauled, and I mean overhauled from the ground up, so that people are held accountable and that this will never happen again in any shape or form.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Vicky Phelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you Vicky.

Thanks very much for the opportunity to speak to you all today.  I am here representing my late wife, Irene, who died in July last year at the age of 35.  I am going to begin just over two weeks ago when the HSE first contacted me.  It was Tuesday, 1 May, around 2.30 p.m.  I was in work and got a call from a non-clinical adviser from the HSE.  I was advised that Irene was one of the 17 women at the time whose name had come up in the most recent audit.  We now know that is 18.<\/p> <p>  I requested there and then - there is obviously no good time to receive a call like that - a face-to-face meeting.  I said I could not have that conversation over the phone.  I did ask what smear tests were being referred to in respect of this audit and I was told 2013 and 2010.  I asked whether they going back as far as 2010.  The woman on the phone pointed out that she was not a clinical adviser and that I needed to come in and meet a consultant next Thursday night at 7.30 p.m.  <\/p> <p>  I asked on Thursday night why a non-clinical adviser was phoning to tell us this.  Why was it done over the phone?  Why could someone not have called out to my house?  I was told then that a decision had been made that no medical staff were going to make the phone calls because they did not want us asking any questions over the telephone when we received those calls on Tuesday, 1 May.  <\/p> <p>  On Thursday, 3 May, at 7.30 p.m. we arrived in St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork.  I was there with Irene's mum and dad.  We were brought into a waiting room within the hospital.  It was just a standard hospital waiting room.  We were passing women on the way out the doors of St. Finbarr's who were upset.  We were brought into an empty waiting room with vending machines in the corners and a television on and just told to wait there.  A girl walked in with her mum and dad.  I would say if she was 30 that would be a lot.  They sat down behind us.  I was trying to get my head around the fact of whether we were actually being brought in with all of the other victims of this audit.  Surely not, that would have been a bit insensitive.  I turned around to that family and asked were they one of the 205 or 206, as it was at the time.  The mother turned to me and said \"yes, we are.  And you?\".  I said that we were one of the 17.  The daughter of that family just got up then and left the waiting room.  She was clearly upset by that.  <\/p> <p>  We waited there alongside that family for the next half hour.  Then we were brought in to see the consultant.  He was actually the consultant that Irene was referred to on day one.  There was just him, a nurse and Irene's mum and dad.  We sat down.  Irene's file was open on the table with the CervicalCheck audit on it.  The last time I saw that file was 14 July last year, when we were given Irene's terminal diagnosis in hospital.  It was the same bulky file with all of her information in it.  The consultant started reading through the audit with us.  It was like the piece of paper that was shared a minute ago.  He shared with us that were two sides to the page.  On the left-hand side were the smear tests which Irene had done and the results that her GP would have been given.  On the right-hand side of the page were the results from the audit carried out on these two smear tests.  <\/p> <p>  Obviously, Irene was led to believe that both of these smear tests came back clean.  The 2010 test said to call back in three years and the 2013 test said to call back in three to five years' time.  When these were audited, it turned out that the 2010 test had pre-cancerous cells in it.  That was the result from the audit.  I asked what this would have triggered if Irene had got these results on day one.  I was told they would have brought her back in, they would have done a physical examination and would have performed a procedure where they would have burned away the cells.  The chances are that would have been it then.  She would have been told to go and live the rest of her life.  As the consultant pointed out to us, 2013 was the most concerning of the two smear tests because this had the beginnings of cancer.  This was the biggest concern because Irene would have been called in straight away.  She would have gone through treatment.  Again, she could have gone on to live a happy life with us - with me and my two boys.  <\/p> <p>  The question is how did Irene find out she had cancer.  It was not from a screening process.  Irene had two missed opportunities for cancer to be identified in her smear tests.  If it had been identified in either one, she would still be here with us today.  I have heard through different sources and through the media that these smear tests are accurate up to 70% or up to 90%.  They might have 10% inaccuracy.  In Irene's case it was 100% inaccurate.  Two consecutive smear tests were missed and two opportunities to save her life.  <\/p> <p>  On 21 April 2015, Irene gave birth to our youngest boy, Noah.  Soon after that, Irene noticed she was not recovering from childbirth.  She was still bleeding.  About five or six weeks after Noah was born, she went back into Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, for an examination.  She was given some statistic.  I am not sure what it was but it was on the lines of so many women can bleed up to eight weeks and ten weeks after birth.  It was a rarity but did happen.  At eight weeks, Irene was still bleeding.  She went back to the GP and got an appointment to go back in to see a consultant in CUMH and at 12 weeks she went back in.<\/p> <p>  At that stage, her cervix was looked at.  There was nothing wrong with it.  It was going along the lines of maybe Irene had some kind of hormone imbalance and that was why she was not recovering from childbirth.  They were going to write her a prescription to balance her hormones.  Essentially that prescription would have been for the contraceptive pill.  Irene was breastfeeding Noah.  He was 12 weeks old.  Irene knew that this medicine that she had been prescribed would dry up her milk supply and she would be unable to feed Noah.  She refused it straight away.  <\/p> <p>  At 18 weeks, Irene was still bleeding and she went back to her GP.  Her GP referred her back to the CUMH to see the same consultant again.  They decided then to do a dilation and curettage, D and C, procedure because they were thinking that maybe some elements of childbirth still left in her womb might be causing an infection.  They said that if they carried out a D and C that might get rid of the bleeding.  When they were doing the D and C on Irene, the consultant that had seen her at 12 weeks noticed there was a change in her cervix at that point, at 20 weeks.<\/p><p>They took a sample and tested it.  It was then that Irene was diagnosed with cervical cancer.  At this point, we had a five-month-old boy being breast-fed and a two-and-a-half-year-old boy and Irene needed to start that gruelling treatment that Vicky went into detail about - radiotherapy, chemotherapy and brachytherapy at the end - for eight weeks.  As Vicky mentioned, this is a horrible experience - all of it.  The eight weeks of treatment are gruelling.  The medication and steroids - everything you are put on just makes you sick.  It was a very difficult time for all of us but we are fighters.  Irene led the pack and we just got on with it.  When you have two small children, you have to fight this.  At the end of the eight weeks, you have the horrible wait of three months for that scan to review how this treatment has gone.  That brought us up to around February when we had that scan.  In March, we were told the treatment went very well.  When Irene had been diagnosed that previous September, she had been diagnosed with stage 2 cancer and they told us they would be treating for cure.  So when they told us in March that all that was left was scar tissue from the tumour on her cervix, obviously we were delighted with that.  Everything seemed to be working fine.  <\/p><p> During the summer, Irene started to get progressively sick again with back pain and pain down her legs.  It go so bad that she was getting up in the middle of the night to take pain medication and to make up water bottles.  When we went back for our appointment in September 2016, after a couple of weeks of testing, Irene was told that she had secondary liver cancer and tumours in her lungs.  They did not discuss treating for cure at this point.  They never said it was terminal.  They just said we would now be living with cancer, that they had a very aggressive chemotherapy treatment plan, that after that, they had plan B and that after that, they had plan C.  Irene went through this chemotherapy involving one day of chemotherapy and going back every three weeks.  You are floored in the first week of this chemotherapy.  In the second week, you are coming back together and in the third week, you are up and running again.  Then you get slammed again with another dose of this chemotherapy and you are wiped out again.  It is just a continuous cycle for 12 weeks.  After a second dose of chemotherapy, Irene lost all her hair.  She said \"I am now a sick person\" because, as Vicky said, you do not lose your hair the first time and can still blend into the crowd and nobody knows what is going on but this time, as she said, people were giving up their seats for her and opening doors.  You are now sick.  This treatment lasted until January.  We had a scan that said the tumour on her liver was shrinking.  Less than a month later, we had another scan saying it was growing again.  Irene spent every second or third week in hospital in early 2017 - infection after infection after infection - up to the point of 14 July 2017 when they sat us down and said there was no more they could do for us and were stopping all treatment.  When we asked how long we had, they said a few short weeks and that they hoped we would get to the end of the summer.  Irene's only ambition there and then was to see our eldest guy start primary school at the end of August.  Irene only lasted a week and a half later.  She passed away on 26 July.  <\/p><p> The HSE received the audit results on 3 July last year - just over three weeks before Irene died.  It decided there and then that it was not going to share that information with Irene or me.  At that meeting on the evening of Thursday, 3 May, I was told a team of counsel made the conscious decision not to share the information with Irene or me.  They thought she was a bit too sick.  This was 3 July.  She did not get her terminal diagnosis until 14 July.  They did not know if she was going to live for three weeks.  They did not have a clue at that point.  We told him that this was not his decision to make - how dare he?  If he knew Irene at all, he would know that if she had three minutes to live and this information landed across her desk, she would want to know exactly what that was about.  The next morning, 12 hours later, I got another call from this consultant.  He said to me that he gave me misleading information at our meeting the previous night.  He did not do it deliberately but he wanted to correct it.  He said that the counsel - the team of people he met - did not actually tell him not to pass on the information to Irene or me and that they actually said that it was about open disclosure and told him to contact CervicalCheck.  Somewhere within the 12 hours, this consultant was clearly reminded of the company line and made a conscious effort to get in touch with me quickly just to correct exactly what he said.  When I asked him what happened when he did contact CervicalCheck, he said he did not know, which was odd because you would think that would be the first question I was going to ask.  He did not have that information for me.  I politely reminded him that this was a big part of the puzzle and that I wanted to know exactly what conversation he had.  I said that he was told about open disclosure and then told to contact CervicalCheck so I asked the conversation was.  I told him he needed to find this out to which I got the smart response that he would have a look and that he needed to trawl back through 2,000 or 3,000 emails but that he would have a look.  I told him that he had better do that and that I wanted to know that.  He replied that it may have been a verbal communication and that he did not know 100%.  I think we can all take it that I will probably never find out the answer to that question.  That is a problem.  <\/p><p> This lack of open disclosure within the HSE is clearly a problem.  The communication between senior management and consultants is an issue.  Communication between senior management and the Department of Health is an issue.  From what we have learned in the past 24 hours, communication between the Department of Health and the Government is clearly an issue.  While it exists with a fantastic nursing staff and the majority of consultants - I have to give credit to the nursing staff who took really good care of my wife - clearly patient care is diluted up the ladder and the element of protect and deny is introduced.  That is basically what we have seen in the past few weeks when it comes to all of this communication or the lack of communication we are being fed, the lack of communication with Irene, the lack of communication with me and the lack of communication with her GP.  I had to inform Irene's GP that she was one of the 17 women who were audited.  I had to inform Irene's GP about the results of the audit.  Irene's GP is not only her GP but the GP of her three sisters, her mother and father, my two boys and my niece and nephew.  He is the family doctor and he was never consulted about any part of this.  I have copies of the smear tests he performed in his clinic and they could not even give him the audited results of the tests he conducted.  Information was clearly withheld from him and it looks like information was clearly withheld from the Ministers.  We have to take them at their word that they did not receive this information.<\/p><p> It seems that the people in these senior positions who knew about all of these memos in 2016 are the same people in senior positions today who need to be questioned when it comes to these inquiries.  I do not understand how they can sit in these positions while inquiries are ongoing.  We have dead women here.  We have women who have been given terminal diagnoses - death sentences.  We are talking about 209 women, of whom 18 are dead.  We still do not know how many of the rest have a terminal diagnosis, how many are still going through treatment and how many have finished treatment and are lucky enough to be out the other side.  It is how many weeks later and they still cannot give us this information.<\/p><p>We have two people gone but more need to go now.  They need to step aside.  They have to get out of the way so these inquiries can take place.  Right now, they know where all the answers to the questions lie.  They know the places not to look or to keep us away from and they are clearly sitting on this information, preventing us from getting it.  It is obvious that this is going on from the drip-drip feed that Oireachtas Members seem to be getting at these committee meetings.  I welcome the Scally inquiry.  It is important that we have a third party inquiry on this.  He needs to speak to the same people that are sitting in these senior positions who are deliberately covering up information.  If someone knows something about another department and mistakes are being made, and that information is not being passed on, that is a cover-up.  If other people are involved in not sharing that information, they are now part of that cover-up too, yet they all remain in senior positions in the HSE.  That is a huge concern of mine.<\/p><p> Last Thursday, when I left the meeting, I left with nothing.  Nothing was offered.  There were no support services, nothing for me to help my kids through their bereavement.  Oscar was four when his mum died and Noah was two.  They are five and three today.  Ten to 15 years from now, they will be reading all about this in the papers and they will look at what their dad was doing here today.  What is there to help me prepare them for that?  What is there when they see two missed opportunities to save their mother's life?  How do I communicate that with them?<\/p><p> I am one of now 17 families.  There are close to 200 women.  We do not know how many are terminal and how many are going through cancer treatment.  When one is going through that horrible process of treatment for cancer, one's mental attitude towards that treatment is very important.  How do you think these women feel in the last couple of weeks after having these meetings and being told that a few smear tests were missed that could have saved their lives?  Maybe they would not have to go through cancer treatment, maybe they are not terminal and maybe they do not have to die.<\/p><p> On top of that, they have to fight for their life while having to process that information.  When the HSE informed them of this audit, it just sent them back out the door with no support services.  There was absolutely nothing but a \"Goodbye, there you go\".  This is why, from the beginning, I decided to share Irene's story because that is exactly what she would have wanted.  If she got this information three weeks or three minutes before she died, we would all know about that story.  She would have been shouting the same thing that I am shouting.  The support services took almost a week to be put in place from the second I started roaring and shouting about it.  We heard the announcement last Friday of all these support services, which I welcome.  They are great.  The problem is that I still have not heard anything.  I know you have not heard anything.  I do not think anybody has heard anything.  Will this come in for us in 2020 or 2021?  Those support services should have been in place two or three weeks ago when we were sitting with the HSE, and they were not.  It is another example of the lack of patient care within the HSE.<\/p><p> The HSE needs to be reformed, particularly at the senior level.  It needs to start looking at how it is run from the ground up and the staff that are there today, looking after patients.  Patient care needs to be put in the backbone of the HSE, right up to senior management.  Communication is key.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Teap","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526486400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I have not heard anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Vicky Phelan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526486400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I am not interested in open disclosure but am more interested in mandatory disclosure.

Thank you for coming here and sharing your stories with us.  As you know, we had representatives of the HSE and Department before us last week.  We will have more representatives before us tomorrow.  Some of those people that Stephen spoke about that knew about the strategy, the memo and the cover-up which has been referred to, will be here tomorrow.  We will ask the hard questions on your behalf, on Vicky's behalf and all of the women's behalf, and of those husbands and partners who are suffering.<\/p> <p>  Any of you can answer this question but I know that Vicky's solicitor has very publicly said that he believes that there is a cover-up in the main centres relating to the lack of open disclosure, the fact that discretion was given to consultants and, in the cases of women who passed away, the information was not passed on to their next of kin.  We heard Stephen's story.  If Mr. Cian O'Carroll is in a position to address the committee, he might expand on that a bit more with regard to his view of a cover-up and what exactly he meant by that.  He might also, if he can - and Vicky or Stephen can respond to this too - talk to me about how people were selected for audit in the first place.  Given the documentation that emerged yesterday, does Mr. O'Carroll feel there were any discrepancies or issues relating to how people were selected for the audit?<\/p> <p>  I am looking at a questions and answers document that was prepared for the Department and the HSE.  It talks about the 1,120 cases that were part of the audit by December 2015.  It says that 317 cases, which is 28.3% of the total cases, were flagged for further review.  In most, though not all, of these reviewed cases, there may have been an opportunity for earlier intervention.  This includes pre-cancerous cell changes that were not detected.  Those for whom this resulted in a delay in diagnosis of treatment are most likely dead.<\/p><p>I want to ask Stephen if that is what happened to Irene and whether she is in that category.  Vicky, how is that different from your own experience?  You said yours potentially might have been an outlier, or was it that it was an outlier in terms of how your smear test was so badly misread?<\/p><p> In terms of Mr. O'Carroll's work, did he discover any problems with the lab itself?  Vicky put it extremely well, better than anybody could, that the issues are open disclosure and patient safety.  I find it incredible that the HSE and the Department are still saying there are no patient safety issues when we clearly heard what happened in your case.  It is beyond words that they still say that, but you also talked about the labs.  When you talked about the labs being an issue, are you talking about the performance of the labs, issues in relation to the labs and the relationship between the labs possibly preventing information getting to patients because of contractual issues?  Is that the issue?  You might be able to come back on some of those points.<\/p><p> Those are the questions I have.  I will finish by saying that I think everybody admires your bravery and your courage, Vicky, as well as yours, Stephen.  I genuinely wish you both well.  It is sad you have had to come here and tell your story but I think it is worthwhile for us in view of our preparations for tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#H00500","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I welcome Cian, Vicky and Stephen and thank you for taking the time to be here.

I am ashamed that, as the body that is supposed to hold all of these organisations to account, we have all spectacularly failed you, and for that I am personally sorry.  I have two questions, one for each, although you covered it, Stephen.  Normally, we call people \"Mister\" and so on in here but if you do not mind, we can be more informal.  Given the work that is under way, and you did touch on this, you may want to add something in terms of the Scally scoping report.  We also have the indication of a commission of investigation after that and the indication of a peer review, as well as the work of the health committee and this committee.  In terms of accountability, if there are any tangible actions both of you would like to see now, you might expand on that.  Clearly, you have highlighted an awful lot that, as Deputy Cullinane said, will feed into our questioning tomorrow, and we will do that.<\/p> <p>  The other comment is that the principles of care that underpin actions in Ireland are from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists following the report in 2011.  The first of them is that the woman must be at the centre of her own care.  Have you any comment on that, give it is supposed to be principle No. 1?<\/p> <p>  Very finally and quite specifically, and Deputy Cullinane touched on this, you mentioned that MedLab was the lab where your test was.  We know from its confirmation and a statement on Sunday that it subcontracted to a third-party laboratory, and we will be asking on contractual issues about that tomorrow.  I know from speaking to some GPs that all the results coming back to them were signed by an Irish-registered pathologist.  I wondered if there was any information you had as to whether your tests were done on-site there, or were they a part of the backlog situation where MedLab subcontracted this work.  If it was a subcontracted test, were you or your physicians informed of that in your own research through the legal process or otherwise?  If so, is it the case that the Irish-registered pathologist based in Sandyford is transcribing results from another lab and just signing off on them, taking them as correct, or is that person looking under a microscope to say, \"Yes, I concur with that\", and then signing off on them?

We have had the HSE in at this committee routinely on various issues.  Very often, it is about something much more academic and we are trying to understand something and humanise it.  Unfortunately, we tend to get change in this country by people putting themselves forward, putting themselves out there in a way that really should not have to happen.  Whether it is the Garda, the health service or otherwise, that seems to be what is important in terms of triggering public understanding of the failure of our system.  That is why it is so important that you have both gone so public in a situation that is so personal to yourselves.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  I know there are a lot of us here and I do not want to delay you.  One thing jumped out at me, Vicky, in regard to one of the points you made, and that was about the contractual obligation between the HSE and the lab.  Did the contract actually have a requirement for confidentiality?  Were there other things, as in the court, that jumped out to you, and that may well be more nuanced, but that would be helpful for us in exploring how we make changes to the system?  Stephen, I have to say the way you have been told, and the way this has been handled, has compounded the problem or - I should not call it a problem - has compounded the crisis.  The situation where you were brought in and told in such an insensitive way, plus the fact the supports are not there for you, is something of which we have to take very serious note because that is as much to do with the care as everything else that has transpired before this.

It is an emotive term but I think it is fair to say that, from the documentation, you can clearly see there was a co-ordinated and a premeditated plan to deny patients the information, although not in total.  The documentation suggests that it was envisaged that some patients would be told of the audit, albeit quite late in the day.  Nobody was to be told before the middle of 2016 and, at that point, people were to be selected.  It is the criteria for their selection that causes a major problem for disclosure.  We see from the documentation that doctors were told not only could they be selective with their patients, but if the woman had died, they were not to tell her family and it was simply to be put in the file.  That appears in a number of documents and it turns up in the CervicalCheck preprinted leaflet that was sent out to the clinicians telling them how to deal with the audit in July 2016.  More than 120 pages of documents were released yesterday by the Department of Health.<\/p><p>I have not considered them in detail, but I did notice that there is a set of precedent letters towards the back of that bundle which are to be used by CervicalCheck.  Included in that bundle is a letter to clinicians.  The letter includes a line about open disclosure but beside that, in the Microsoft Word format, is a comment which tells the person reading the precedent document that in cases where a woman has died this sentence is to be deleted from the letter and there is to be no reference to open disclosure.  Therefore, we see that there is a thread moving through documents which suggests that there was a premeditated and orchestrated plan to keep this information from patients who had died in particular.<\/p><p> Furthermore, in the correspondence between CervicalCheck's Professor Flannelly and Vicky's consultant gynaecologist, there is a dialogue going on over a period of more than a year - 15 months - in which two clinicians are talking to one another and in which CervicalCheck's clinical director is saying that she does not believe that all these women should be told.  At one point she describes three of the ten patients who were on that list as meeting her clinical criteria for being told, yet we know that all of those women had suffered some degree of delay in the treatment of their cancer.  While I cannot comment in any meaningful way about the degree to which they were all affected by that delay, from the reports of this audit I have seen to date - and the records have been slow in coming through - four out of four women have been significantly affected.  It is reasonable at least to say that doctors looking at those records must have known that there had been a very significant clinical effect on women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cian O'Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Do Vicky or Stephen have any comment on the points made?

I asked the consultant that.  He did not know the answer but, thankfully, there was a nurse in the room who did.  She could only speak on behalf of the clinic in St. Finbarr's.  She explained the process there to me.  Irene did not attend that clinic but it is where the tests for cervical cancer are done.  She said that once a month a list is compiled of the names of all the women who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer and it is sent off to the register.  It is there that the audit process begins.  I asked how long it takes for an audit to take place.

With the memos last week we discovered that this was clearly the case with one of the laboratories in particular.  That answered a question for us because we were wondering why there had been this delay of two years.  My audit was triggered in October 2014 and then in July 2016, almost two years later, CervicalCheck contacted my gynaecologist to inform him that I was one of these cases and that he was to use his judgment on whether to inform me.  It took another 15 months, until September 2017, before he actually did tell me.  We were wondering what the delay had been.  Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly was interviewed on \"Morning Ireland\" and that interview answered one of the questions because she said it took them a while to come up with this communications strategy.  That strategy had to be decided on and we were asking \"Jesus, could that take two years?\"  That was one explanation.  Then when these memos came out last week they showed that the laboratory was thinking about suing the HSE because it did not want the clinicians to know, let alone the patients.  How long did that legal wrangling between the HSE and the laboratory go on for?  My question is where was the patient in all of this?  Nobody really cared about whether the patient should be told.  It was about the legal wrangling between the HSE and the laboratory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Vicky Phelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I have one small point.

Perhaps the committee members could be mindful in their questioning that this can be used as a major distraction.  I cannot speak about Irene's medical records but what happened to Vicky Phelan, and what I have seen in other situations, is that an error occurred in the reading of the original smear which was of an unacceptable magnitude.  While technically it may be correct to call that a false negative, if one simply rests on it as a false negative and a statistical occurrence one closes one's mind to the necessary investigation of the cause of that failure.<\/p> <p>  It would be beneficial for patient safety if there was some questioning of the relevant key witnesses as to why clinical directors and other clinical people involved in CervicalCheck and the Department of Health appeared to have closed their minds to the magnitude of the errors which were coming back to them through the audit.  They were largely doctors and it must have been quite evident to them, from these 209 cases which involved a significant delay in the commencement of treatment, that there might have been someone in those laboratories who was simply incompetent or that there might have been other factors causing this.  The fact that only a month ago a memo from the senior medical people involved in cancer screening in Ireland to the Minister for Health stated that an error of that magnitude in Vicky Phelan's case was not a patient safety incident confirms that they have never investigated the error in her case.

Everybody in Ireland owes thanks to Vicky, Stephen and anyone else who has come out on this issue and explained to us, from where we are, how it has affected them, their families and all those around them.<\/p> <p>  I want to home in on one particular aspect, which I believe Vicky said.  It is the idea that it would not have made any difference.  I keep thinking about her saying that.  Who decides what a difference is?  It may not have made a material difference to the outcome in some cases.  It is difficult to quantify in some cases, although I am not saying in the witnesses' cases, but the fact that something has to have a change in staging for it to have made a difference is getting to the crux of the issue because we are ignoring the feelings and the considerations someone goes through when they have a diagnosis of cancer.  They wonder what could have been if they had noticed something earlier.  Vicky went through her symptoms in great detail, and I thank her for doing that.  It is very difficult  but it is important that we hear the actual detail of what she has gone through.  However, it is important to acknowledge that in terms of families or individuals who have a cancer diagnosis, everyone will meet that news with a different reaction.  The difference does not have to be a stage or a level in terms of how long they have got left.  It is more to do with how they deal with it, and how they deal with it as a couple, in Stephen's case.  It is very difficult for any of us here who have husbands and young children to consider how they would get on without us.  In terms of the future, it must be very difficult for Vicky, with her diagnosis, to consider that it might not be her but those she may leave behind who will have to continue her fight.<\/p> <p>  Vicky mentioned the 12 months of wrangling with the HSE and laboratories.  Like Deputy Kelly, I sit on both the Joint Committee on Health and the Committee of Public Accounts.  So much has come out in the past week but I am almost sure that we were told that period of wrangling occurred between March of 2016 and the summer of 2016 and that was the reason for the line in the memorandum, \"Pause all letters\", or whatever it said.  The justification I heard this morning at the health committee for that period was that this was dealing with that issue, but Vicky has told us she was wrangling with the HSE for 12 months.  I do not want to put her under pressure but it is important because my understanding is that we were led to believe that this was a short period of a few months.  Is it possible for Mr. O'Carroll to find out where that is coming from because it is important for tomorrow's meeting?<\/p> <p>  I am shocked at the way Mr. Teap was treated.  I cannot believe the insensitivity shown in that people were brought into a holding area, for the want of a better term.  We need to find out who in God's name decided in the past few weeks that this was the appropriate way to treat these people.  I suspect it was not anybody with a medical degree, but perhaps I am wrong.<\/p> <p>  What comes to the fore in all of this is that people have a vocation.  They are clinicians first and they see patients before they see data.  We have a serious issue in our health service when somebody like Mr. O'Brien opens an email and decides, without his medical degree, that this is not a significant error.  A committee, and I believe it should probably be the health committee, needs to get to the bottom of who decided that was the framework in which Stephen should be treated.<\/p> <p>  On the magnitude of errors, in Vicky's case, when the audit of the slide was done, it was essentially extensive cancer.  It is becoming more alarming to me, as we find out more information, that the 15%, 20%, 30% or whatever was the acceptable level of false negatives or false positives was not a consideration.  To my mind, we have not seen any evidence that anyone quantified those errors.  Was it a systemic error in a particular laboratory?  It is shocking to me that anyone could look at Vicky Phelan's case in particular and say, \"Okay, we have this false negative.\"  However, it is not really a false negative.  It is active cancer on a slide.  My understanding from the conversation around it is that they would not really need a microscope; it was that obvious.  It seems to me that this would be fundamental to the audit process.  If there was a 30% rate, they would need to make sure that it falls within the category of false negative and that it is not something extra to that.<\/p> <p>  We spoke about the auditing process at the health committee earlier and there seems to be a serious issue with that process.  There seems to be many people in the HSE with the word \"audit\" in their job titles.  One of the fundamental aspects of audit is that one should know what one will do with the results when they are received, and there should be a pathway.  Critical to this is that there was no pathway decided before anything happened, so what was the point of the audit?  It appears the point of the audit was data rather than people.<\/p> <p>  I hate giving round figures because everyone is a person in this but we have a figure of 1,500 and then 1,641 from the cancer registry.  If we combine them we have approximately 3,000.  That is the number of women with a diagnosis which have been audited.  Of those, there are 209 in the first batch - excuse my terminology - and another number in the second batch.  We do not know that number.  In the case of the error on Vicky's smear, it seems obvious to me that an immediate random audit has to start of all of the samples, not just the approximately 3,000 women because all of those have cancer-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#M00700","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526486400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Vicky Phelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>-----but all the people in the system.

My comment relates to what you said earlier about the wrangling period.  My understanding was similar to that of Deputy Kate O'Connell, namely, that that period of disagreement between the labs concluded around May or June 2016.  My understanding - and I will double-check tomorrow - was from the documentation we had received, which said that a meeting was requested between the national screening service and the labs.  After that took place, all legal correspondence ceased.<\/p> <p>  My questions relate to some of the issues that we heard last week and on which I seek your views.  Last week, representatives of the State Claims Agency claimed that they were completely opposed to the non-disclosure agreement which Vicky was being asked to sign.  They said that under no circumstances did the agency support that.  Can Vicky say whether that was communicated to you or your legal team?  Perhaps Cian O'Carroll can answer that.  When did either Vicky or Cian become aware that the State Claims Agency had taken the position that it was completely opposed to the use of a non-disclosure agreement in Vicky's case?<\/p> <p>  What sort of process was there in respect of obtaining documents?  Was co-operation given to Vicky and her legal team up to this week?  Can Cian say what the attitude has been by CervicalCheck towards releasing documentation to people, in his experience?  Is there an open procedure to getting that information or is there still a culture of trying to put obstacles in people's way in terms of getting the documentation to which they are entitled? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#N00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526486400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>To return to Deputy MacSharry's question on MedLab, am I correct that it related to the history of the examination of those slides and where they were examined?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cian O'Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>It had been suggested to me by GPs that no matter where the examinations were done by MedLab, that they were getting results back that were signed by an Irish-registered pathologist.

The Government and the HSE have a duty of care to alleviate women's fear and to do so quickly.  Second, we do not know what the error rate actually is.  There are so many different variations of what it is and we are being told by people who cannot back it up with any type of proof.

We thank them for making the time available to give their accounts.  Stephen said he wondered what Oscar and Noah would think ten years from now when they look back on this and on what their Dad did today.  They will be very proud of what their brave Dad has done in standing up and talking for their Mum in Leinster House.<\/p> <p>  Officialdom has been given a fair crack of the whip in these committee rooms, week in and week out, but I am not sure if people listening are any wiser.  The impact of its decisions, or lack of decisions, is a personal human story that is manifest in the stories of Vicky and Stephen, on behalf of Irene.  Vicky spoke about the appalling breach of trust - on the day of her court case - on the steps of the High Court.  As she has monitored proceedings over the past couple of weeks, has she seen anything that shows a willingness to change on the part of the people who are coming to this committee to answer questions or, as Stephen said, is the protect and deny culture still thriving even up to this point?

Is that fuelling her request for a complete clear-out to allow for an honest appraisal of the situation, rather than protecting an entity?  God knows what they are protecting.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the question Cian posed about the magnitude of the errors.  The discussion has been focused on the lack of communication, but you made an interesting point in terms of focusing on the magnitude of errors and why there is a closed-mind attitude to the latter.  How far do you think that closed-mind attitude permeates the system?  When the Taoiseach was addressed on this matter during Leaders' Questions on 1 May, he said it is just the norm that two pairs or four pairs of eyes miss something like this.  However, as Vicky said, it was not a small amount of cancer but, rather, a slide full of it.

Obviously, the past period of time has been very difficult for them.  I recall a certain individual a number of years ago making the point about another person who had passed away that he had done the State some service.  There is no doubt that Vicky, Stephen and Cian have done the State a great service over the past couple of weeks.  They have become the catalyst for something everybody in this room and many people in Leinster House have been seeking in recent years, namely, reform of the HSE and the health service.  As a result of what they have done I believe we will never again see the same attitude in the future.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise two points arising from the presentations.  One was mentioned by Deputies Cassells and Kelly and I wish to tease it out further.  It is about the same people still being in position as we move on.  I believe there must be accountability not just in the House but across the board.  Vicky, Stephen and Cian will be aware that there are a number of investigations taking place.  We all want to get to the bottom of this issue.  We need to get all the answers.  Would it be better if the five, ten, 20 or whatever number of people are involved were left there to get the answers rather than move them to one side at this stage?  I have no preference regarding the answer to that.<\/p> <p>  Second, Stephen made a point that refers to both him and Vicky.  First, you said it is disappointing that you still have not heard anything about the suite of services and supports that was announced on Friday last.  Do you think there is enough there?  Stephen might have mentioned that there are other issues that could be addressed in the future.  You are both in different situations to a certain extent.

Over the course of this discussion we have got very valuable information that will help us in questioning the other individuals who will be coming before us.  I wish to raise two things very briefly.  First, anyone with a basic knowledge of statistics would know what a false negative is.  However, the chances of an individual getting a slide wrong twice, in two separate tests, are non-existent.  That is what really worries me here; the incompetence.  As you said, were they looked at at all?<\/p> <p>  The second thing concerns the State Claims Agency.  Its representatives said that they were very vociferous, although maybe I am quoting them incorrectly, in their fight against non-disclosure agreements.  Is that a sense that you got from your interaction with them?<\/p> <p>  Finally, everyone is very proud of you both.  I know from watching her interviews that your family has been incredible.

One of the things that really actually enraged me with my case, when it did settle, is this.  I got to a point where they were going to waive the confidentiality clause because they knew I was not going to sign one.  However, what happened in that case was that the HSE was struck out.  It was absolved of all responsibility and did not have to admit any liability, because we were looking for exemplary damages.  The HSE officials knew that if they got caught there would be a rap on the knuckles and they would have to pay for it.  I have a huge issue with this.  I know there was a trade-off, according to what Cian was telling me.  I do not understand the ins and outs of legalities.  However, he will tell you; I really wanted to keep going, to be honest.

In regard to the point that she makes about the HSE, there were two defendants in the case.  There was a negotiation.  There was one fundamental that my wonderful client had set from day 1, which was that there could never be a confidentiality clause.  Eventually, when that was surrendered by the defendant - I thought it was the defendants, until we found out later it was just the laboratory - then a negotiation began.  That was after three days in the High Court.  It was six days after the case had started.  The focus then was on the terms of settlement.  As part of that, the HSE was to be let out of the case.  There was nothing, apparently, to be lost or gained from doing that.  I almost feel I am confessing and apologising to Ms Phelan.  Maybe in hindsight, if we were to go back now, knowing what we know and what has happened, it would be tidier to keep the HSE in it.  The HSE admitted in their defence to a breach of duty in a partial delay of informing Ms Phelan in 15 months of what had happened, which is extraordinary.  A party has been let out of proceedings, and yet it makes an apology, publicly, for the actual liability issue that the proceedings were about.  I do not think I have ever seen that before.

It started with the interview given by Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, then clinical director of CervicalCheck, on \"Morning Ireland\" on 25 or 26 April.  We first got a sense of statistics then, when she explained that there were 1,462 cases that had been looked at.  Of those, a cohort selection of 460-odd cases had been sent for review.  Of that, there were 209 cases - it was about 206 then, but the number has since grown - which involved an error in the reporting, which resulted in a clinically significant delay in the commencement of treatment for the cancer.  That is the crucial bit.  We then found out that there were another 1,500 on the national cancer register, and that brought the total figure of women who had been diagnosed with cervical cancer over the ten-year life of CervicalCheck to date to 3,000.<\/p> <p>  However, the documents that were released last night from the Department of Health include some of the annual reviews and audits which were happening around the CervicalCheck programme.  In the review, the statistics for 2016 show that at that stage they had only audited about 400 cases.  The current figure is somewhere around 462.  That is the figure that Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly gave.  It explains why not everybody is being audited in this report.  It shows that the service categorised cases by the timing within the history of the cancer.  They categorised the timing into six different categories.  For example, among women who had a diagnosis following a previous colposcopy, only most of the cases were reviewed and looked back at.

For the purposes of this statement I will make a few comments on effective rates and also issues relating to concentration and sustainability.  I am sure other topics will arise during the course of the discussion and I hope to be able to offer some insight to members from my work in this area.<\/p> <p>  There is a wide variety of ways of measuring effective rates.  In an overall sense they can be divided into effective rates by company and effective rates by country and within those there are numerous approaches that can be taken.  Aggregate data can be used to estimate effective tax rates on profits in the tax base of a particular country.  Both the Central Statistics Office, CSO,  and the Revenue Commissioners provide aggregate data which provide different, though complementary, approaches to estimating effective corporate tax rates for Ireland.  The institutional sector accounts from the CSO give the net operating surplus of non-financial companies.  Using the corporation tax figures in the same accounts an effective tax rate on net operating surplus can be calculated.  This has averaged 9.7% since 2000.  The effective tax rate on net operating surplus peaked at 11.8% in 2006 and fell during the crisis.  It has been below 8% since 2011 but reached 8.1% in 2016.  Allowing for eligible interest costs would increase the rate and the increased use of losses carried forward likely explains the reduction in the effective rate in recent years.  These losses can be trading losses or unused capital allowances.<\/p> <p>  The aggregate corporation tax statistics produced by the Revenue Commissioners give details of the taxable income of companies and the tax due on that amount.  Taxable income is what is included in the tax base after all deductions have been allowed for, such as trade charges, group relief, losses carried forward and capital allowances.  Recently published figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that for tax returns filed for years ending in 2016 tax due as a share of taxable income was 10%.  The primary reasons this is less than the headline 12.5% rate is because of double tax relief granted for tax paid in other jurisdictions on foreign income included in Ireland's tax base and the existence of the research and development tax credit.  In the absence of those two issues the effective tax rate would be close to the headline rate of 12.5%.<\/p> <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General made an important contribution to this area when it published analysis of effective tax rates of the top 100 companies.  The Comptroller and Auditor General looked at the top 100 ranked by tax due and taxable income.  The analysis by taxable income showed that for most companies the effective rate is very close to the headline rate.  Some 65 companies had effective rates of above 12% and a further 14 had effective rates above 10%.  The analysis provides very strong support for the effectiveness of the 12.5% rate on the taxable income of companies and highlights that most attention should focus on how taxable income is determined.  However, it was not surprising that significant attention was given to the 13 companies who had effective rates of 1% or less.  The Comptroller and Auditor General  made clear that the reasons for these low rates were double tax relief and the R&amp;D tax credit.  The Revenue Commissioners looked at these 13 companies and said that in the absence of double tax relief and the R&amp;D credit the effective tax rate for all 13 of these companies would have been above 12%.<\/p> <p>  Double tax relief arises because of the worldwide nature of Ireland's corporation tax regime.  It is likely that the inclusion of foreign profits in Ireland's corporate income tax base provides little revenue as the tax paid abroad will almost always exceed the tax due in Ireland, particularly with the pooling of foreign tax credits.  It is highly unlikely that companies are paying tax in other jurisdictions to avoid tax in Ireland and it should be noted that the foreign tax paid is excluded from the effective tax rates calculated by the Comptroller and Auditor General  which only looked at the tax due in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Review of Ireland's Corporation Tax Code published last year recommended that Ireland considers moving away from the current worldwide regime to a territorial regime in line with most other OECD countries.  With effective controlled-foreign corporate, CFC, rules this would take previously-taxed foreign income out of Ireland's tax base and eliminate the need for foreign tax credits.  The low effective tax rates reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General due to foreign income would no longer arise.<\/p> <p>  The R&amp;D tax credit is a policy choice that grants a credit equal to 25% of qualifying expenditure.  This means that companies can get tax relief of 37.5 for every 100 of qualifying expenditure they incur.  Spending 100 to avoid 37.5 of tax would not be a viable tax avoidance strategy.  The company will only incur the R&amp;D cost if it feels it will add value and contribute to future profitability.  Of course, the effectiveness and the level of the subsidy should be subject to scrutiny.  If this is R&amp;D spending that would have happened anyway then it is an unnecessary public subsidy.  A previous study by the Department of Finance indicates that 60% of the R&amp;D spending is due to the presence of the R&amp;D tax credit.  So while there is some deadweight loss linked to the R&amp;D spending that would have happened anyway the analysis suggests the R&amp;D credit is increasing activity.<\/p> <p>  It is also worth noting that the level of the credit was set when the federal corporate income tax rate in the United States was 35%.<\/p><p>Ireland would have been competing for research and development activity that would otherwise have happened in the US, with a deduction at 12.5% versus a deduction in the US at a minimum of 35%.  The 25% credit significantly improved Ireland's competitiveness in such an environment.  Recent changes mean that the federal rate is no longer 35% and it may be worth assessing the level of Ireland's research and development credit in light of these changes.  The Comptroller and Auditor General should be encouraged to repeat the analysis undertaken for its 2017 report.  Ideally, this would be done every year but at a minimum it would be useful to see it every two years.  This company-level analysis is an important complement to the aggregate level statistics provided by the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  If the analysis was done on an annual basis, it may be possible to provide some insight into how company effective tax rates vary through time.  It would also be helpful if an aggregate calculation that combined all the data for the top 100 companies was included in the analysis.  The CSO has recently published a set of accounts for what it considers the top 50 companies in its statistics.  The type of analysis undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General would also be useful if changes to Ireland's corporation tax regime are introduced, such as the move to a territorial system or adjustments to the research and development tax credit.<\/p><p> Over the past few years the Revenue Commissioners have published staff reports that have provided important insights into the concentrated nature of Ireland's corporate income tax base.  The Revenue Commissioners are to be commended on the willingness to devote resources to allow this work to be undertaken and on facilitating its publication.  The analysis shows that since 2013, the top ten payers account for around 38% of corporation tax receipts each year.  Although the level of concentration has remained relatively stable, there has been significant volatility within the figures.  For example, receipts from the largest ten payers in 2015 came to &euro;2.8 billion.  In 2017, these same ten companies paid &euro;2.25 billion of corporation tax.  The top ten payers in 2017 paid &euro;3.2 billion compared to the &euro;2.3 billion these ten companies paid in 2015.  Even though the proportion of payments coming from the top ten in 2015 and 2017 are very close, the top ten from 2015 paid &euro;0.5 billion less in corporation tax in 2017, and the top ten in 2017 paid almost &euro;1 billion more than they did in 2015.  At first glance, the aggregates might be relatively stable but there is significant volatility taking place under the bonnet.<\/p><p> The level of concentration by country of ownership should also be noted.  In 2017, the top 100 payers made &euro;5.9 billion of corporation tax payments, equal to 71.5% of the total.  Within this top 100, 51 US companies paid &euro;4.25 billion, UK companies &euro;128 million, Irish companies &euro;370 million, with &euro;1.1 billion coming from companies owned outside these three countries.  It is clear that our receipts are also highly concentrated among US-owned companies.  The Review of Ireland's Corporation Tax Code published last year concluded that: \"Although it is impossible to be definitive and the volatility in receipts will remain the level-shift increase in Corporation Tax receipts seen in 2015 can be expected to be sustainable over the medium term to 2020.\"  Nothing has happened in the interim, either at EU, US or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, levels, that would alter that conclusion.  However, it should be noted that the conclusion was made in the context of the 2016 outturn for corporation tax of &euro;7.3 billion.  It was not known that 2017 receipts would exceed &euro;8 billion and that forecasts would include projections showing receipts reaching &euro;10 billion by 2021.<\/p><p> The concentration and volatility of corporation tax receipts mean that a year when they fall is inevitable.  We should not be surprised, or taken by surprise, when this happens.  In the near term, the reason for the fall is likely to be the inherent volatility which is a feature of our corporation tax receipts, rather than any structural shift or change.  The Review of Ireland's Corporation Tax Code also stated: \"Given this uncertainty we can never be sure of the sources and permanency of such revenues and it would be wise that policy should be suitably cautious in terms of introducing increases in spending or permanent reductions in taxation.\"  I trust that the careful deliberations of this committee on this matter will ensure that the value for such caution will be impressed by the members here on their colleagues in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I thank the committee for the invitation to attend here today.  I look forward to our discussions and hope I can assist with any questions members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coffey for that very interesting presentation and call Deputy McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#D00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Coffey and thank him for the opening statement.

The Revenue Commissioners just look at what happens in Ireland and where the royalty payments go is of no concern to us.  If we introduce these new guidelines, the Revenue Commissioners will have to look at where the payment is made and if the substance of the receiving company justifies the receipt of substantial royalty payments.  If they do not have that substance, the Irish company will not get a deduction for the royalty payments made.  The Irish company could still make it but in an Irish context it would no longer get the deduction.  It is a change that would end these types of strategies.

It is somewhat separate.  It is a choice that Ireland must make.  Very few countries have a worldwide regime and some have moved from worldwide regimes to territorial regimes.  It is about how much of the profit of companies would be placed in a tax base.  For an Irish-resident company, we put its profits, no matter where they are earned, into our tax base.  If those profits are earned in a foreign jurisdiction, they have already been subject to tax and we grant this double tax relief.  The issues of royalties and changes in transfer pricing are slightly separate.<\/p> <p>  One concern is that if we move to a territorial regime, Irish companies might move their profits to lower tax jurisdictions and then bringing them back to Ireland, claiming these as foreign profits.  To prevent that we need what is called controlled foreign corporation rules.  We must look at what is happening in foreign companies and if they have the substance to justify the profit they might earn when those profits come back in.  If it is counted as Irish rather than foreign profit, it would be subject to tax in Ireland.  There are dangers in moving to a territorial regime but we must introduce these controlled foreign company, CFC, rules as part of the EU's anti-tax avoidance directive.  If we introduced strong CFC rules, it would open the option to moving to a territorial regime.<\/p> <p>  If the concern is these low effective tax rates, as highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General, one way to remove them is to remove the foreign income from our tax base.  We are including foreign income, on which tax has already been paid.  There is no indication that these companies, particularly with foreign income, are generating company-wide effective tax rates of 1%.  The Comptroller and Auditor General ignored the tax paid abroad and it just examined tax paid in Ireland.  Taking out that income and removing the need for a foreign tax credit, the effective tax rate calculated would be based on the profit earned in Ireland.  All the evidence from the Comptroller and Auditor General suggests that once taxable income is calculated for Ireland, the 12.5% rate is effective on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#E01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Would that change satisfy European colleagues who seem to be calling for taxes on large digital companies to be paid in their jurisdiction?

This means there is research and development activity of approximately &euro;3.2 billion.  The rules specify this must take place in Ireland.  It is a significant activity.  The Department's analysis suggests that 40% of that would have happened anyway.  Accordingly, 60% of that research and development activity is additional or new, meaning one is looking at around &euro;1.8 billion to &euro;2 billion of activity taking place, which it is argued is the result of the tax credit.  We are offering a tax credit of &euro;800 million to get a &euro;2 billion increase in activity.  One then has to work through to determine who is benefitting from that, the impact on employment, wages, spending in the economy and the Exchequer.

How does one mitigate against the risk?  Do we want these companies to pay less tax?  I assume we would like to get the receipts as long as we can.  However, we should be building into our macro and fiscal policies that these receipts may not be sustainable into the long term.  I am not necessarily sure it is a risk that one wants actively to do something to mitigate.  It should, however, be kept in mind regarding policies elsewhere.  Accordingly, spending on tax changes introduced should have built in some space to allow for corporation tax receipts to change.<\/p> <p>  It is well identified and various bodies have pointed to the concentration of risk.

We find ourselves in a bit of a sweet spot at present when it comes to attracting employment and investment.  I am not necessary sure that from a corporation tax perspective in terms of attracting investment, there is anything particularly we have to change.  We will continue to be in the EU and continue to be one of the closest markets for US companies in that regard, as well as with time zones, language, labour force flexibility etc.  The concerns for attracting companies after Brexit will be different than corporation tax.  For example, ensuring there is sufficient accommodation for people if a company wishes to locate here will be far higher on the agenda than changes to our corporation tax.<\/p> <p>  I recommend the analysis carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General on corporation tax should be repeated.

It is better than arguing on whether it should be 12% or 8%.  Much of that is because of how we calculate taxable income.  People may suggest taxable income which is not calculated as taxable income should be calculated as such and, accordingly, come up with different figures.<\/p> <p>  We know the research and development tax credit has increased tenfold since 2004.  It trebled between 2010 and 2015 and has increased each year up to in excess of &euro;800 million.  We also know that fewer companies are availing of it than were in previous years.

I am aware of the work done by the Department of Finance and I do look at the outturn figures for claims from the Revenue Commissioners.  While it represented a cost of &euro;708 million for 2015, the provisional figures for 2016 show a slight reduction to &euro;674 million.  It is not quite going toward the &euro;1 billion mark which the Deputy might have indicated.  It does seem to have stabilised after the dramatic increases in recent years.  It is somewhere around &euro;700 million.<\/p> <p>  In respect of dead weight loss, the size of the credit itself should not determine the answer.  It should be the proportion and the level of additional activity it is generating.  If a credit has a dead weight loss of 40%, whether the credit costs &euro;20 million or &euro;700 million it still represents a 40% loss with regard to the amount of credit offered.  The scale should not really change that because 60% of the research and development activity is additional and arises as a result of the research and development credit, according the Department of Finance analysis. <\/p> <p>  On the refund element, the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that, in the main, the refunds in the area of research and development tend to arise in the case of smaller companies and Irish companies because to be eligible for a refund, the company's tax bill on its activities must be less than the amount of the research and development credit.  For larger, more established companies that have other activities generating profits the research and development credit reduces their tax liability but it does not drive it down to levels where the refund element would be applicable.  If there was to be a target for the refund element, based on what the Revenue Commissioners is indicating, it seems that it would be on newer, smaller and domestic companies.  The hope is that by undertaking this research and development they will earn profits in the future and that we will be able to recoup the credit through increased tax payments in the future.  The overall cost of the credit itself is quite substantial.<\/p> <p>  I do not have specific answers about what to do.  One could look at capping the amount being claimed by any particular company but then one is, in a sense, penalising scale.  If companies undertaking research and development are engaging in expenditure, hiring staff to undertake the work or incurring costs within the economy, and if we want more of this to happen, I am not sure that putting a cap on it would be a wise thing to do.  <\/p> <p>  It would possibly be worth assessing the level of the credit in light of the US tax changes.  We have a 12.5% rate for trading income.  If companies are going to put costs here, they will only get a deduction worth 12.5%.  This is one of the arguments for the introduction of the credit in the first place.  If they put this cost in the US they would get a deduction at a 35% rate, so the 25% credit added to our 12.5% rate gives a value of 37.5%, which is comparable with what companies would receive in the US.  The US rate has now been reduced significantly from 35% to 21% at the federal level, so it might be worth considering whether we are looking to move research and development activity from the US to here, in which case the level of the credit should be assessed, or whether we are competing with other markets where a 25% credit would still be required.  We would look at the size of the claims being made by individual companies and whether the level of the credit may now be excessive relative to the competitor markets at which we are looking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>On that suggestion in terms of a recommendation on the level of claims, caps and so on, I agree with Mr. Coffey's proposal that we should be doing this annually or at least biennially because there have been dramatic shifts in terms of research and development tax credits in recent years and we need to keep up to speed with them.

Other EU countries have non-compliant patent boxes which apply to all spending and do not follow the modified nexus approach but ours does.  Perhaps it is taking a while for companies to start the activity and to generate the profits.  One can do the research and development but the benefit of the knowledge development box is that one gets a 6.25% effective rate rather than the 12.5% rate.

One thing that has changed since the review was published is US tax reform.  The reform introduced a minimum effective tax rate for foreign intangible income in the US.  Regardless of what tax is paid in others jurisdictions, US companies have to pay a fixed level of tax in the US.  Even if the tax in Ireland were higher, under the new US rules it would not necessarily increase the overall amount of tax these companies are paying.  They would get credit in the US for that.  It could be that the additional tax in Ireland would not have a negative impact on those companies with the assets here previously.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty asked about the domestic-foreign split in the Irish economy.  There is no doubt that foreign multinationals have a major impact on Irish economic statistics and at times, it can be difficult to identify what is happening in the domestic economy.  There is no doubt but that the profitability of Irish companies is lower than the profitability of domestic companies in other EU countries.  That is not to say that their contribution is lower.  Irish companies generate significant employment and significant pay for the economy.  The share of value-added in Irish companies that goes to employees tends to be higher than in other EU countries.  While the profits are lower, the overall outcome can be much the same with more simply going to workers.  However, we are unique and different from an EU perspective given our dependence on foreign companies and the fact that they result in a major skew in our figures.  From an Irish perspective, the figures mask the poor performance and profitability of Irish companies.  Nevertheless, they are generating employment.  We are getting taxes through them, including income tax, PRSI and USC.  In overall terms, we do not collect significant amounts of corporation tax but that is simply because the profits are not generated.  It is for others to suggest why the profits of Irish-owned companies seem far lower than the profits of domestically-owned companies in other countries.  Anyway, the point holds.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty asked about the whole issue of overheating and whether we could in a sense ring-fence corporation tax receipts for housing.  I do not think that would be wise policy.  Any suggestion of ring-fencing does not tend to work too effectively.  If we want to prioritise housing, we should do it within whatever resources we believe are solid and sustainable.  That is where our money should go, rather than creating circles, dancing rings around them and saying that a certain proportion of money is for this, that or the other.  It is clearly the view that we have a housing issue in Ireland.  If we believe additional resources should be devoted to address it, then we should simply do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#H00700","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coffey for his public service.

This is something into which we are beginning to get insight.  The Central Statistics Office has broken down the top 50 foreign-owned companies in its accounts.  We get the impact on the amount of corporation tax they are paying.  One of the tables includes a heading covering other taxes and production paid.  This includes commercial rates, motor tax, the training and employment levy etc.  In 2016, a total of &euro;850 million was generated from the top 50 companies.  The CSO accounts indicate these companies are paying &euro;2.5 billion in corporation tax.  The former figure is a sizable amount.  It may only be a quarter of the corporation tax receipts, but it is close to &euro;1 billion.  These are significant receipts, especially for local authority rates.  I am unsure about commercial water charges but commercial rates are certainly included in the figure.  It is not only a matter of corporation tax.<\/p> <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have examined the other receipts we generate.  They have said that when we look at the total of income tax, PRSI and USC, some &euro;7.3 billion arises from multinationals in Ireland.  We have vast corporation tax receipts and a significant portion of our income tax arises from them.  The figure is close to a quarter of the overall receipts across those three headings.<\/p><p>We do not have a quarter of the employment based in multinational companies but because of the higher levels of pay in them, the proportion of income tax, university social charge, USC, and pay related social insurance, PRSI, arising from them is quite large.  We are getting some insight on that from the figures provided by the various agencies and the concentration in commercial rates and other payments, which may be worth noting.<\/p><p> On the issue of the sustainability of corporation tax and why one would argue that it might not be sustainable, one of the reasons is that we do not know why it happened.  Nobody predicted in 2015 that corporation tax receipts would jump by 66% in one year.  If there is such a  large jump in such tax receipts in one year, the fear is that it could reverse quite quickly.  Quite a wide variety of factors led to that.  I do not believe all those factors are going to unwind in any given year.  There was a timing issue involved but some of those factors could unwind.  We face unknown developments in the future that could cause receipts to change, whether it be US tax reform, which appears to have worked in our favour up to now, changes at OECD level, which again appear to have worked in our favour up to now, and changes at EU level, the most significant of which it now appears are not going to happen.  However, we cannot expect international changes will always work in our favour, but they have up to now.<\/p><p> On the sectors, we collect significant revenues from the information and communications technology, ICT, sector and I would say the broader manufacturing sector, rather than just including the pharmaceutical sector.  That includes computer chips, medical devices and the manufacturing of soft drink concentrate across a wide range of areas.  The financial sector is one that should get attention when considering corporation tax receipts.  It is our second most important sector for receipts of corporation tax, which may be surprising when Irish banks pay and will continue to pay very low levels of corporation tax for a wide variety of reasons.  I imagine much of that tax in the financial sector arises in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, and foreign owned companies.  It would be worth considering the financial sector as one that might need greater scrutiny.  There was &euro;1.8 billion of receipts in the financial sector in 2017.  The companies and the types of activities in which those are based could be footloose, therefore, it would be worth considering what is going on there.<\/p><p> Regarding Irish companies, the Revenue Commissioners do not tell us the breakdown of the companies ranked in the top ten.  Therefore, we do not know the big payers in the top ten companies.  When it comes to the top 100 payers, the Revenue Commissioners have indicated there are some Irish companies among them.  They indicated a figure of fewer than ten.  They have not given us a precise number.  Of the top 100 payers, there are some Irish companies among them.  Fifty-one of those companies are US based.  They far outweigh the Irish presence.  The overall amount of tax paid is quite low.  The top 100 companies paid &euro;5.9 billion in 2017 and the fewer than ten Irish companies included among the top 100 paid &euro;370 million.  The payments of some individual companies would exceed that figure.  Most of the receipts come from foreign companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I have a final question which Mr. Coffey might not expect to be asked and it is not a financial one.

Our corporation tax regime does not seem to bounce around and change to the whims of those companies.  We introduced a 12.5% rate.  We announced it the 1990s, introduced it in the early 2000s and it has been in place ever since.  There have not been significant changes to the underlying system.  There have been some changes and I am sure the large companies and their representative bodies make submissions to the Department of Finance and try to get the ear of the Minister to make various changes, but I am not sure that Irish policy is dancing fully to the beat of the requirements of foreign companies.  The evidence in the planning area, in particular, during the past few weeks, or perhaps months or years, however long that process has been going on, would suggest the influence may not be as large as some would believe.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt we have developed an industrial policy based on attracting foreign companies to Ireland, a key plank of which is taxation but it is not the only plank.  If taxation was the most important element, all those companies would locate in Bermuda where there is no tax, but they are locating in countries like Ireland which has a low corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  However, a country needs to have much more than that to attract such investment.  It needs to have the availability of staff and a reputation to attract the location of these large plants that generate all the commercial rates that the Deputy mentioned.  If they are going to spend hundreds of millions or even billions of euro on these plants, they want them operating and producing the products they want to make.  We have built a reputation over 30 or 40 years for delivering on these projects.  It involves much more than just getting the ear of the Minister.  Rather than focusing on the political side, one of the key actors is IDA Ireland, on the agency side, having an interaction with a company, not necessarily changing things but it is nice for those companies to know there is an agency they can contact and have a contact person within it with which they can deal.  The activity there, as much as changing things in the background, is important.  We can point to the change in the low tax rate but from our perspective, we are benefitting in that we are getting employment and investment.  There is no doubt but that changes have been introduced on foot of proposals made by companies but I do not believe our regime is dancing to the beat of what any particular multinational might be saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coffey for that response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#J00400","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Seamus Coffey and thank him for his presentation.  I wish to raise a few points on which he might elaborate.  Regarding the data in his summary report and this is a question I have asked him previously, is there a genuine comparator available of corporation tax paid and raised?  Is there a genuine comparator available with other countries, particularly countries with regional government structures such as France, Italy, Spain and Germany, where the tax structure tends to be much more complicated than ours, which is the reason it often adds up to a very high rate but there may well be a great deal of regional investment in attracting foreign direct investment?  That is obvious in Italy where they are going out of their way, as Mr. Coffey will be aware, to attract and compete with countries that are attracting social media and related companies, and that is tied into their view of what this levy might be.  Is such a comparator available?<\/p> <p> In terms of the graph on the second page of Mr. Coffey's presentation, I must confess I do not understand it.  I am trying to pick out which country is which.  I know Ireland is the big green one on the bottom of the graph.  I note from that graph and the subsequent table detailing the net operating surplus of the non-financial corporations, bearing in mind what Mr. Coffey said earlier, that in the context of Ireland, for example, Luxembourg, the City of London and a number of other points in Europe have an enormous specialisation in finance capital of a very advanced and varied kind.  Why then, is the financial sector omitted from this chart?  Does that omission lead to some difficulties in terms of what one might call summary data from different countries and how they are rated?  In that context, I wish to make a specific point which I have raised previously.<\/p><p>We have an unique situation where very significant parts of the financial sector, particularly the larger banks, lots of other financial institutions and a good part of the property development and construction sectors have significant loses being carried forward from the crash.  The Revenue Commissioners gave me figures two years ago which the Committee of Public Accounts has been using again recently.  The same figures were given to this committee by the then assistant Revenue Commissioner at that time.  These figures from Revenue show that highly significant amounts of losses were carried forward.  That means for those companies such as Bank of Ireland and AIB - just to pick the well known ones - as well as lots of others, that effectively there will be no tax payable by choice by some of the largest banks, and construction and property firms as well, for a long number of years.  Let us bear in mind, a previous response that essentially this is a timing difference as opposed necessarily to a tax levying difference.  In the here and now AIB and Bank of Ireland between them will have well over a billion euro in profit which otherwise would be taxable.  Effectively from all the data I have seen, they are going to be able to choose whether they pay any corporation tax.  Many people would understand this to be a scandal.  I do understand the technical answer that this is a timing issue.<\/p><p> This is part of the loss of reputation of Ireland in terms of fairness of tax, in that somebody on PAYE has no choice about when he or she pays tax.  It is levied on such people's income as it arises, whereas these banks can put off the evil day for a very long time.  Does Mr. Coffey think this is damaging to the reputation of Ireland in terms of the current debates and discussions on tax?  That is why I think a minimum effective tax rate, particularly in respect of financial services companies, is appropriate.  I note Mr. Coffey's comments about the minimum effective rates.  However some companies are paying nothing and will be paying nothing for a long time.  Will Mr. Coffey share his views on that?<\/p><p> I was going to ask him about when the proposed tax changes by President Trump will come into effect?  Mr. Coffey may be able to send some more information on that to the secretariat of the committee.<\/p><p> Arising from their work, do Mr. Coffey or his group have information on the number of disputed assessments against some of the major corporations?  I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister for Finance on the issue.  There seems to be very limited auditing of some of these companies.  From the graphs provided, one gets the impression that certain sectors are in a different position for reasons of complexity or just the sheer size of them.  Is that the case?

I do not expect an immediate response to my final question but it would be interesting if the committee could have an overview of what Mr. Coffey believes are the key variables that will arise cross-Border in the context of Brexit.

If one looks at the level of corporation tax that is being collected - in the case of Ireland we can make a comparison for 2016 - in that year corporation tax is approximately &euro;1,600 on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis.  For every person resident in the country, &euro;1,600 of corporation tax was paid and one can say that 80% of the tax came from multinationals and so on.  If one were to look at large countries such as Germany or France, they collected &euro;1,000 and &euro;900 in corporation tax<i>per capita<\/i>; respectively.  Even though we may have a lower rate and we may look at the variety of reasons we collect so much, we are collecting more on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis.  The chart is trying to highlight some of the issues around the effective tax rates.  It is not necessarily a matter of identifying the individual countries but on the naming of the countries, they are ranked by their outturns for the last year for which we have data, which is 2016.  One can see the countries up towards the top would have the highest effective rates and the countries towards the bottom would have the lowest, with Ireland being right down at the bottom.<br\/><br\/>The reason the financial sector is omitted is that much of the focus tends to be on the non-financial corporations, that is, the traditional companies which were set up under foreign direct investment rules such as manufacturing and ICT companies.  A similar analysis can be done for financial corporations but for issues of brevity, the financial sector was omitted and the graph shows the effective tax rate on the profits of non-financial companies and the fact that the rate has fallen in Ireland.  I think that is linked to another question posed by Deputy Burton as to why are the economic statistics showing the effective tax rate in Ireland to be 8%?  It may not be a surprise that it fell in 2008 and 2009, but I think we might have expected it to rise as the economy has recovered and some of the losses have washed out of the system.  It is clear that in some instances these losses are not washing out of the system.  One of the reasons could be the scale of the losses incurred in 2008 and 2009 in respect of financial companies and second, the continued accumulation of losses through a variety of reasons.  It might not necessarily be trading losses, but it could be losses generated by unused capital allowances, so that companies have deductions larger than their income and those deductions could be capital allowances or it could be down to the treatment of capital spending.  One could have what we term accelerated capital allowances, where the tax depreciation might exceed the real depreciation of the asset and one area where that might arise is in relation to aircraft leasing and the treatment of the capital expenditure on the acquisition of aircraft for leasing.  As for the financial companies themselves and the level of losses, I am not sure I would use such emotive terms as the Deputy has about the companies not paying tax.  I think the use of losses carried forward would be a pretty standard feature across all tax jurisdictions, such as capital allowances for intangibles.  One could look at putting a cap on the amount that could be used in any one year to establish the minimum effective tax rate and rather than being able to offset 100% of one's income, so that even though one might be generating substantial profits, the use of losses carried forward can offset any tax liability that may fall due.  One could limit that to 75% or 80%.  That would not be changing the amount of losses that can be used but it would be extending the losses over a particular period and one would be generating some tax revenue in any particular year.  An alternative proposal would be to have a time cut-off so that if one has not used the losses within a specified period, they can no longer be carried forward.  I am not sure whether that is in place.  It is an option.<\/p><p>Some countries do have them in the sense that the cap on the amount can be used in any given year.  From a public perception, it can be difficult to get across that much of it is illusory because we do own the banks.  The losses carried forward are an asset on their balance sheets such that if we do sell our stake in the banks, we will receive a higher price for them.  If the asset is reduced or removed, the price received will be lower.  While there may be an outcry about the lack of tax being paid, it will show up in Government revenue one way or the other.  There is no doubt that changes could be made to alter the way this looks.  There is also the banking levy which is applied across all banks, according to their size, and it is generating some revenue.  I imagine that if there were to be changes to the way losses were used, one consequence could be the removal of the banking levy such that what we might gain on the corporation tax side might be lost on the banking levy side and we could definitely use the price to be gained if we chose to sell the assets.  These are choices that are available, but the consequences would have to be worked through.<\/p><p> The settlement has been made on some of the correlative adjustments.  I am not necessarily sure I would argue Revenue is settling in favour of companies.  Generally, what happens is that profits and tax being paid in Ireland are being claimed by another country, but the claim comes through the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>The Revenue Commissioners appear to be putting up their hands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#L00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526475600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>We have paid.

He is correct that our EU contributions are based on gross outcome.  Figures from the Revenue Commissioners suggest the net income is nil such that the additional corporation tax is nil in the years for which we have data.  On pricing, Irish legislation requires companies to value assets at the market price.  This should be linked with the profit generated by them.  The assets are generated initially by the US tax code that allows companies to divide their profits into foreign and domestic for US tax purposes.  Up to now, the foreign profits had been declared on sandy beaches in the Caribbean but changes in Ireland and coming down the track internationally are limiting companies' ability to do this, rightly so.  Therefore, companies are moving assets to where they have substance.<\/p> <p>  The price should reflect the profits being generated.  For the early years, the capital allowance available and profit generated are similar, which suggests the pricing is reasonably accurate.  In other words, the valuation is reflective of the profit being generated.  If there was a mismatch such that the capital allowance being claimed was much larger than the profit being generated, it would suggest there was a problem and companies would be able to claim capital allowances long into the future if an excess price was being applied to them.  The fact that they are close means that in the future if the companies become even more successful and generate even more profits, the capital allowance will remain fixed.  It is based on the initial expenditure outlay to purchase the asset, in respect of which a company may claim an amount each year.  If the profits increase, a company cannot bump up its claim for a capital allowance because the allowance is fixed based on the type of depreciation chosen.  Also, the capital allowances will run out at some point.  <\/p> <p>  I share some of the Deputy's concerns, but the legislation does require an asset to be valued at the market price.

I thank Mr. Coffey for the graph which is very helpful in getting to the heart of matters.  Even if I do not always agree with his interpretation of the facts, I thank him for setting them out.  For me, the big issue is the spectacular rise in gross trading profits we have witnessed in recent years and which doubled between 2011 and 2015.  To me, the dirty big secret of the Irish economic story is the spectacular rise in profits during many of the years when the country was on its knees and crippled by austerity.<\/p><p>We have been calling for a minimum effective corporation tax rate at least since 2012 because of the enormous gap between gross trading profits and corporation tax yield.  When the revenue figure of &euro;6 billion is compared to &euro;144 million paid in corporation tax, it equates to a tax rate of 4.5% approximately, not 10% or 12.5%.  Even if it is put against net trading income, the figure is approximately 6.5%.  That is the effective rate and a huge proportion of the yield is being paid by a small number of companies that pay an effective rate that is much lower.  Is it not clear when one considers the allowances that permit them to write down their taxable income that they find loopholes and exploit them?  Capital allowances for intangible assets jumped between 2014 and 2015 from &euro;18 billion to &euro;46 billion.  The Government creates the loophole and they jump in as part of a massive tax evasion scam.  Similarly, deductions in trade charges jumped from &euro;16 billion to &euro;23 billion.  That presumably is intergroup transactions between subsidiaries of the same corporations.  Then we have the research and development tax relief mentioned by Mr. Coffey.  Are they not just bloody big loopholes that need to be closed through having an effective rate because companies will always exploit them?  No matter what adjustments or tweaking the State manages to make after the fact, unless there is an effective rate, they will always be one step ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#L02500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526475600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I agree that is where the focus should be.  At times, we get caught up in looking at the impact of various minor issues, but, as the Deputy said, towards the top of the table, once one starts with gross profits and examines the tax adjustments made, the sums involved are huge, particularly for capital allowances.  The provisional figures Revenue has for 2016 show another jump relative to the figures for 2015.  The figure of &euro;46 billion for 2015 could be close to &euro;60 billion for 2016 when the final figure is published.  It has indicated that it might move in that direction and the issue should be explored.  <\/p> <p>  Are we unique in what we offer in Ireland?  Why do the claims and sums seem to be so large relative to the size of the economy?  When it comes to intangible assets, our regime is similar to that in place in other countries.  As part of the review, I examined the regimes elsewhere and at a top line level, they are similar.  The common consolidated corporate tax base proposal covers intangible assets and seems to mirror the provisions set out in the tax code.  There must be something different in the Irish regime that is attracting companies here on such a scale.  Other countries do not see the bringing onshore of intangible assets that Ireland is seeing, including assets worth hundreds of billions of euro and transactions that exceed GDP.  That does not happen in other countries.  We must try to understand why this is happening.  There could be benign reasons.  The OECD process is all about aligning profit with substance and it may be that companies have the substance here and are moving their intangible assets here in order that the profits linked with the assets are also linked with the substance or the Irish regime could have an unusually attractive feature that is not obvious to me following a top line analysis.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned trade charges.  We should consider changes to trade charges and royalty payments and, in particular, update our transfer pricing rules.  In many cases, royalty payments are going to Caribbean islands where the companies do not have substance.  In the next few years we should update our transfer pricing rules and eliminate the ability to use them as a deduction for Irish tax purposes if the payments are made to warm sandy beaches.  That should be done by the end of 2020.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to capital allowances and made a point about the prices being set.  While legislation requires a market price to be used, we should consider extending transfer pricing legislation to capital transactions.  Currently, transfer pricing only applies to trading transactions where one is buying goods or a service from somebody.  Equally, it should apply when an asset is being bought.  While implicitly there is a requirement to use the market price, it should be explicitly applied in legislation to all capital transactions.  That would perhaps offer us the opportunity to examine these large amounts and ascertain whether they are appropriate or companies are exploiting existing legislation.  That is where the focus should be.  We cannot be definitive regarding the level of exploitation, but the size of the figures indicates that they are worthy of examination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Coffey using technical language to describe my general accusation against corporations as being tax evaders, but he is saying in a nice way that we need to examine this issue.

Historically, it has not lasted; therefore, that makes Ireland vulnerable.  The need for us to develop the domestic economy and ensure a sustainable economic and industrial base is critical.

He said that they employ approximately 250,000 people directly and another 100,000 indirectly through logistics and other services like catering.  Apart from the corporation tax receipts, there are other benefits to be gained from US companies locating here.  Overall, FDI based employment has been hugely beneficial for this country.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty raised the issue of funding for housing infrastructure earlier.  Money is being allocated for that.  There is no need to ring-fence funding because it has already been allocated.  The local authorities have just published their targets and money is being allocated to specific areas.  In some cases, development will begin as soon as the design and tender appraisals are completed.  Under the Project Ireland 2040 plan, for the first time we will link a spatial plan with an investment plan.  We want to see regional growth, with 75% of new jobs being created in the regions rather than in Dublin.  We want to continue to be competitive as an island.  In that context, does Mr. Coffey have any concerns or worries?  Are there areas to which he would direct funding immediately?  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Coffey has already responded to questions raised about research and development and tangible tax so I will not go back over those areas.  He spoke of the sustainability of corporation tax receipts in the medium term but what are his predictions after that?  I have read most of the reports he has produced and have a number of podcasts by him which I listen back to on a regular basis.  He has the type of voice that is easy to listen to, which is beneficial.  <\/p> <p>  There has been huge investment across our public sector.  However, there are deficits in particular sectors and additional funding will be required for front-line staff in education and other sectors.  That funding is being made available because everyone agrees that education underpins equality.  However, we must recognise that the fiscal rules determine how we deal with windfall taxes or new tax revenues.  Decisions that we make in the context of any budget must be based on income that sustainable and not one-off in nature.  Mr. Coffey has said that sustainability is not an issue in the medium term but what are his predictions beyond that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#N00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Mr. Coffey must get out his crystal ball now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#N00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526475600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>The Deputy has raised a number of points.  In terms of the regional employment issue, while we are seeing an increased dispersal of employment, I would caution that it is measured on where the person lives rather than where the job is created.  A person could be living in one region but working in another.  The increases in employment around the country, from the south west to the west, the Border and the south east regions would suggest that we are seeing a spread.  However, if we have a large amount of employment being created in regions close to Dublin, it could simply be an issue of commuting.  That said, I take the point that there has been an improvement in the regional spread of employment in recent years.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of sustainability and the presence of companies in Ireland, the fear is not so much that the companies will leave.  I agree with Deputy Bailey that many of them are embedded here.  The real issue relates to the tax base and the amount of tax being collected, which increased very rapidly in 2015 without an accompanying increase in substance or employment.  We saw a huge rise in gross profits, to which Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett referred; that seemed to happen very rapidly.  That element of it could be subject to a reversal but the employment itself does seem to be quite embedded.  We are talking about industries which spend substantial amounts on their plant and their operations in Ireland.  Some of them, like Google, may be somewhat footloose in that their staff may require no more than a good computer and a desk but in the manufacturing sector, companies are spending hundreds of millions, if not billions of euro on plant that simply will not be moved.  <\/p> <p>  The contribution of US companies to Ireland is significant.  We strongly outperform our EU partners in attracting investment from US companies.  In terms of their contribution here, US companies pay their staff &euro;6 billion a year and spend another &euro;4 billion on indirect employees who supply goods and services to them.  The tangible investment they make in terms of building things in Ireland, rather than the intangible investment from which we do not really benefit, amounts to between &euro;3 billion and &euro;3.5 billion per annum.  On top of that, we have the corporation taxes they pay which look like topping between &euro;4.5 and &euro;4 billion per year.  Apart from corporation taxes, as Deputy Lahart mentioned, they also pay rates, the national employment levy and other taxes that arise from their presence here.  All told, we are looking at a figure that is not far off &euro;20 billion every year, which is a huge contribution to the Irish economy.  It is a risk to be so dependent on a small group of companies but I am not sure that it is a risk I would be seeking to mitigate.  Rather, I would be looking to develop other sectors.  Long may we receive &euro;20 billion a year from a group of companies that are choosing to operate in Ireland.  While it does bring concerns that they might leave, the primary concern would be about the tax base, which is mobile.  If proposals at EU level to shift the tax base from the country of production to the country of consumption through the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, CCCTB, were implemented, the tax contributions of these companies would drop quite dramatically although the employment would not move as quickly.<\/p><p>We have built up a reputation over 30 or 40 years of delivering on large projects for these companies and other countries cannot replicate that reputation overnight.  The risk to companies leaving is probably over the medium to long term; I do not see that arising.<\/p><p> On the investments we are making and the choices, as mentioned earlier I think housing is a significant issue.  If these companies are going to choose to come to Ireland they need somewhere for their staff to live.  We have not got this right in decades.  We either have too much activity going on or, as in recent years, too little activity.  We hope to get that back to a happy medium and see a pickup in activity over the coming years.  That is obviously an issue that arises on the list.  Tax is not enough to get a company to move investment to a country.  It is probably in the top ten.  It might not even be in the top five, but it is there.  Companies need the infrastructure and the available staff.  If the staff have nowhere to live the companies will not come.<\/p><p> Education is a key issue.  Coming from that sector, I recognise that we have done well in developing Irish talent for companies in the manufacturing sector.  The ICT sector has been successful in attracting staff in from abroad.  There may be a disconnect between what is happening in those two sectors.  Given the employment here, that money is working through the economy.<\/p><p> It is hard to make predictions.  I think the investment is reasonably solid.  There were risks with the US tax changes, particularly some that were mooted 18 months or two years ago.  There was talk about a destination-based cashflow tax, an import duty, whereby if a company makes something in Ireland and sells it back into the US, a tax would be due on that product going back into the US.  We are a huge supplier of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, soft drink concentrate and a wide range of other products that are manufactured in Ireland for export back to the US.  If that destination-based cashflow tax had been introduced, it would have had severe implications for those companies' operations in Ireland.  It would have become much more attractive for them to make those products in the US and avoid that import duty.  That did not materialise when the tax reforms landed on us in December and most of the changes seem to have been relatively benign from an Irish perspective.<\/p><p> I see the CT holding up for a while.  We seem to be a in a sweet spot when it comes to investment, employment and tax.  We cannot expect it to continue forever.  We seem to have tailwinds at our back in a wide variety of areas and we should be prepared that those winds will not always be pushing us along.  That is not to say I expect things to crash or fall.  However, the improvements have been so large in the past couple of years that we cannot expect those improvements to continue and we should be cautions in that regard.  An outright reversal of many of these factors is unlikely, but we cannot bank on these continuing to increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>May I ask a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#O00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I am going to ask a few questions if the Deputy does not mind.<\/p> <p>  Following up on that last point, we should certainly be prudent in how we project future rises.  We should be prudent in how we make expenditure commitment.  I was in business for 20 years before my election to this House.  Everybody knows that companies make profits in some years and do not in others.  We cannot rely on the guaranteed nature of taxation yield from companies' profits.  The same applies to almost every other tax head.  Our concern seems to be disproportionately focused on this particular tax head.  I do not see the potential for the types of leaps in growth we have had since 2015.  Like Mr. Coffey, I do not see anything to indicate a catastrophic fall-off in the foreseeable future.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Coffey has referred to this 2015 leap and keeps being polite about it.  There is almost an inference that it is not due to real profits.  I ask him to outline why we had that leap?  Is it the tax situation coming to benefit us?  Is there an element of international economic growth?  There was obviously a reason for it on which most people can speculate.  At the heart of it I would like to get Mr. Coffey's breakdown of it.  Based on his answer, where is the vulnerability for it to fall away?  Is it economic downturn, tax change or what is it?<\/p> <p>  I have a real problem at times with the discussion on this matter.  Mr. Coffey can tell me if I am wrong on this.  Ireland is a very small country with a tiny population.  We have very few large Irish companies.  If we had Irish companies of sufficient scale and nature to generate the types of profits to yield substantial corporation tax, they would have to be multinational and would operate almost entirely outside their home base.  There would be very little difference between the behaviour of an Irish company in that bracket and a multinational - as we call them - operating here.  There is one very large aviation company.  There is one very long-standing Irish multinational in various strands of construction, business and whatever.  If we changed regime in the morning, they would be as likely to move as any foreign direct investment company.  Do we focus too much on whether it comes from outside or whether it is Irish?  The reality is there is continuity because of - Mr. Coffey alluded to it - a very stable and simple corporation tax policy that encourages these companies to stay here.  We also have by and large a very stable political system that enables them to stay here.  That is the key driver.  I do not think this emphasis on inward investment versus Irish makes a lot of sense to me.<\/p> <p>  I return to a comment from another Deputy.  Surely it would cause more reputational damage to Ireland in the tax area if we were to abolish the long-standing practice of dealing with a company's losses just because we did not like the sectoral area in which that company operated and had a chip on our shoulder about it.  For many SMEs, carrying forward losses is a well-known principle.  There would be grave reputational damage if we changed that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#O00300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526475600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked why I keep focusing on 2015.  The prime reason for focusing on it is that we had a 6% rise in the corporation tax yield in just one year.  The corporation tax yield can be volatile, but that increase was unprecedented here and probably internationally without any policy change.  The Chairman spoke about the stability of our regime.  We did not change our regime wholly in 2015 leading to that huge surge in receipts.<\/p> <p>  There were a number of factors.  The improvement in the domestic economy led to more corporation tax being paid by Irish companies.  Companies that had losses in 2014 did not have losses in 2015.  There was an increase in corporation tax paid on capital transactions.  Most companies pay their capital gains tax through corporation tax.  It appears as a corporation tax payment.  Outside of, I think, profits on development land, all profits on capital transactions appear through corporation tax.  However, these only tended to add a couple of hundred of million euro to what was a &euro;2.3 billion increase.<\/p> <p>  The OECD BEPS project may have had a role particularly for the multinational companies.  With the introduction of country-by-country reporting and beginning to collect data from 2015-16 some companies may have adjusted the previous practices which would have been in line with what was required legislatively.  As we have seen over recent years, companies that get themselves in the spotlight for tax purposes can find it hard to get themselves out of it.  It may have been that companies were being proactive rather than reactive in trying to do something that helps prevent them being in the headlines.  It might have been that certain activities were moved to Ireland resulting in greater taxes being paid without an impact on employment or investment.  The fear would be that if it is possible to have increased profits and increased tax payments seemingly happen on a very quick basis, those things could be reversed.<\/p><p>In 2015 and 2016, the fear was that it could have been a quick reversal.  Here we are, however, in the middle of 2018 and the &euro;6.9 billion collected in 2015 became &euro;7.3 billion in 2016 and &euro;8.2 billion in 2017.  Not only have they not been reversed, they have actually increased.  The warnings about a quick reversal have not materialised to date.  We have just seen the receipts continue to rise.  The focus tends to be on it because it was a level shift and lots of things happened in 2015 that sparked much attention.  Our GDP surged as well.  We had the famous 26% growth.  Following that conversation with Deputy Boyd Barrett, I would not necessarily link those.  We had an increase in GDP and the emphasis there should be on the first word - the gross part of GDP.  That might not necessarily have led to increases in tax payments.<\/p><p> Some of those factors, however, that happened in 2015 might unwind but they may not all unwind at the same time.  I refer to links to Irish companies, and their improved profits, the reduction in the number of companies claiming losses, the increase in tax related to capital transactions and various other things that all seem to have happened together in 2015.

It happened due to a G8 meeting of large countries, including France and Germany, that were under budgetary pressure and looking for increased revenue.  They said the rules for the taxation of international companies had to change and let us get somebody to do something about it.  They got the OECD to do something about it and that has been done through the BEPS project.  Now, the question of who won from that project is being looked at.  Thus far, Ireland has been a significant winner.  There could be a second round of BEPS and it may look to see what factors caused Ireland to win and whether it could be changed again?<\/p> <p>  On Irish companies, the profits of some of those previously mentioned would not be wholly part of the Irish tax base.  A company in the construction sector will have tax due where the construction activity happens.  The airline industry is slightly different.  When it comes to domestic flights, the tax due on those profits is due in the country in which the domestic flight occurred.  If the flights are international, however - and it does not matter from what country they originate - the tax will be due in the country where that company is resident.  If a company flies from England to France or Germany, and that company is resident in Ireland, then that company's profits will form part of the Irish tax base.  They are an important part of the Irish corporation tax base.  Ryanair, for example, makes &euro;1 billion in profits per annum.  I do not know how much of that is in the Irish tax base but much of it is.  <\/p> <p>  It is dwarfed by the scale of profits that the multinationals are making here but it is significant.  When we talk about Irish companies, we are not referring so much to Irish multinationals and their operations abroad - it  more the SME and the pure domestic sector.  I refer to trying to make those companies more successful and from an exporting point of view in particular.  We may perhaps have drawbacks that have limited our ability to expand our exporting base.  On losses, the treatment is well established around the world.  I am not sure of the reputational damage but there is nothing unusual about using losses for companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018051600002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1526475600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I am afraid I must finish the meeting as we have another committee - of which I am a part - coming into this room in 15 minutes time.

Even in Ireland, perhaps because of the choice of employment available, things like part-time employment are beginning to fall, whereas full-time employment is increasing.

I am not sure we can change the international way that the film sector has moved in recent decades by altering the tax structures.  I agree that precarious employment is worth considering.

It was nice to meet him a couple of days ago.  I am delighted to be here.  It is always an honour to be invited to speak to this committee.  My colleague and I are delighted to contribute to the committee's debate on implementing Ireland's climate change strategy.<\/p> <p>  To be brief, I want to focus on two issues in our opening address, but we are happy to take questions on any issues arising.  First, I will make a few comments about the national mitigation plan.  Second, I want to talk about how we can meet Ireland's climate objectives by reducing income taxes.  Reducing income taxes is something that I know politicians often like to do, so I hope that if I talk about the opportunities for reducing income taxes, that might capture the committee's attention.  <\/p> <p>  As members will know, the Government's climate strategy envisages that we will exceed our climate targets for 2030 by between 87 and 113 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.  It could actually be more than that, because of how rapidly the economy is growing and how quickly the dairy sector is expanding.  An analysis of the draft mitigation plan that the institute produced last year made a number of observations.  First, we said that the plan makes no provision whatsoever for the cost that failing to meet the obligation might impose on the Exchequer.  Second, the plan did not assess the dramatic overshoot and what implications that will have for the key sectors individually.  Third, there was no analysis of the relationship between strategies for individual sectors, for example, Foodwise 2025 and our carbon budget.  Finally, very few new measures were brought forward in the national mitigation plan.  <\/p> <p>  There have also been a number of critical developments since this plan was published.  On the positive side is the national development plan, which made a number of highly ambitious commitments to climate investment.  On the negative side, the Department of Finance produced an estimate which suggested that the Exchequer would be liable to &euro;600 million per annum in total compliance costs by 2021 if we fail to take action.  That is &euro;600 million euro per annum between 2021 and 2030.  Lastly, Ireland's climate target for 2030 was finally agreed by the European Parliament on 17 April 2018.  On the basis of these three developments and the shortfall or the shortcomings we identified in the original national mitigation plan, the first point we want to make is that it may be time for a new national mitigation plan already.  If the plan is to spend billions of euro of taxpayers' money to buy compliance instead of decarbonising at home, this should be made explicit in the plan. <\/p> <p>  The second point I wanted to make concerns how we can address climate change by reducing labour taxes.  The national mitigation plan promised in 2018 that Government would provide an examination of the impact of the carbon tax.  I want to state that between 2008 and 2016 the share of labour taxes as a proportion of overall taxation rose from 31% to 36%.  This has damaging impacts.  Obviously it reduces the incentive to work, it damages economic competitiveness and it reduces the growth potential of the economy.  The biggest opportunity for immediate climate action is to reduce these income taxes.  In our written statement we illustrate several ways that this could be achieved - through modification to the universal social charge, USC, or the 20% or 40% income tax rate.  Before I come to the catch, I note that this would yield &euro;500 per annum to every taxpayer in the country.  The catch is that we would need to increase the carbon tax by &euro;50 per person, and that would offset the overall reduction in tax take to labour taxes.  Taxing bad things like environmentally destructive pollution makes sense, especially when we get to alleviate the burden on hardworking families at the same time.  <\/p> <p>  Increasing the carbon tax in this manner gives householders choices.  It encourages short-term and long-term behavioural change.  Electric vehicles and hybrids are going to become much more attractive, because petrol and diesel will be pricier by about 13 cents per litre.  Many commuters have options to avail of public transport, walking and cycling, but of course not all commuters have options of those kinds.  Many people are locked into car-dependent lifestyles and would need to use some of their tax windfall to pay for additional transport costs, at least until the time comes to purchase a new vehicle.  <\/p> <p>  Another area of concern is home heating.  An electric heat pump or a wood-burning stove will suddenly seem like a great deal.  The incentive to invest in a retrofit, which many families are considering already, will become a greater priority, and thriving new economic sectors will arise to meet those needs.  A bale of briquettes and a bag of coal are going to be more expensive, so wood-based solid fuel heating products will take up more and more shelf space in stores over time.  If the tax can be accompanied by low-interest loans to help householders make deep retrofit investments, all the better.  In fact, I think this would be very important.  <\/p> <p>  It is obviously essential to ensure that the impacts are managed carefully for the most vulnerable in society.  Increasing welfare payments and fuel allowances can offset the negative impacts for the elderly, the unwell and the unemployed.  We often hear that there are no solutions to climate change from the Government.  While an increased carbon tax is certainly not a silver bullet and it would not solve all our problems, it would be a good start.  It makes every other measure that we need to achieve easier to achieve.  It makes the Government expenditure required for things like subsidies for heat pumps or home retrofit lower because fuel costs will be more expensive, so these measures are more attractive by themselves.  Practically every single climate expert in the world who might testify to this committee would say that an increase in the carbon tax is not a silver bullet, but it has to be at the absolute core of a coherent national climate strategy.  What we need now is not more analysis but some focus on implementation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joseph Curtin"},{"type":"speech","time":1526479200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Our second presentation is from Tr&oacute;caire.

In our contribution, we will look at the global context of climate impacts and climate action in which the national mitigation plan is set.  We will then conclude with a few concrete recommendations to the committee.  I will be handing over to Ms Cliona Sharkey for those recommendations.<\/p> <p>  Globally, climate impacts are already at crisis levels.  In Ireland, Europe and elsewhere in the rich world we are becoming increasingly aware of our vulnerability to extreme and erratic weather.  Poor countries, however, which have contributed least to the problem and have the least capacity to cope, are being hit first and hardest.  In countries where agriculture is the major source of food and income for people living in poverty, the situation is devastating.  Today in Ethiopia alone, almost 8 million people are in need of food aid as a result of persistently poor rains compounding the drought of 2016 and 2017.  That is more than the entire population of the island of Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  Drought is not a new phenomenon in east Africa, but we are seeing drought spread to areas that were not affected in the past, and we are seeing the gap between droughts decreasing, with long-term development work needing to give way to cyclical humanitarian response.  Families are unable to recover before the next drought hits, resulting in a downward spiral of poverty, hunger and vulnerability.  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, given the stock of carbon now in the atmosphere and current emission pathways, the impacts are set to manifest increasingly over the next decade and increase thereafter.  Tr&oacute;caire and other organisations will continue to support communities to increase their resilience to climate shocks and to provide humanitarian relief each time it is needed.  However, there is a limit to what efforts of this kind can do.  Delivery on the commitments made in the Paris Agreement to limit warming to 1.5 &deg;C above pre-industrial levels and holding it well below 2 &deg;C at most is absolutely essential if we are to avoid further climate impacts to which these communities, and indeed our own societies, cannot adapt.<\/p><p>In this context, it is critical to ask whether the national mitigation plan, NMP, pursuing a transition in line with the temperature limits Ireland signed up to as part of the Paris Agreement.  The answer is \"No\".  Regrettably, while we can debate the details of the NMP and its implementation, unless we acknowledge and address this fundamental issue, we are undermining the hard-won progress of the Paris Agreement and we are tacitly accepting the significant additional impacts associated with rise of 2o Celsius or more and all of the human, environmental, economic and political risks that this will entail globally and for our own society.<\/p><p> Importantly, moreover, it is also clear that since the adoption of the Paris Agreement that the EU's collective emission reduction ambition, like that of all individual countries, will need to increase if it is to be brought into line with the temperature limits set out in the agreement.  The pathway that is implicitly set out for Ireland in the NMP is one of minimal reductions over the next decade, followed by an increase in reductions in the period coming after 2030.  In their in-depth report on global emissions UN scientists, who are part of the UN environmental programme, are warning us that unless we increase action and ambition in the short term, delivery of the temperature limits set out in the Paris Agreement will become virtually impossible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Garvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":322,"content":"<p>Thankfully, in recent months, thanks to the political leadership from a number of EU member states, the European Council has requested the European Commission to produce a new EU long-term climate strategy in accordance with the Paris Agreement.  Let us be in no doubt that this is the beginning of a necessary process to increase the EU&rsquo;s collective ambition.  In this context, it is also worth recalling that the Paris Agreement itself contains a so-called ratchet mechanism, which requires all parties to regularly increase their ambition and action.  Ireland&rsquo;s obligations to reduce emissions are only going in one direction and the pressure to increase short-term ambition is set to increase.<\/p> <p>  On another positive note, energy system modellers in UCC have recently published a study on options for bringing Ireland&rsquo;s energy system transition into line with a global pathway aligned with the Paris Agreement.  Critically, they highlight that short-term national mitigation ambition needs to increase to play this role in meeting the Paris Agreement goals.  Based on their modelling of Ireland&rsquo;s energy system, they conclude that this is possible and can be done at significant cost, but while continuing to grow the economy.  Importantly, like the EPA, they also highlight that delay makes the transition challenge all the greater and increases costs.  While no one model can or should give us all the answers, their work, like that of others, clearly indicates that there is a need for significantly greater ambition if Ireland is to do its fair share to contribute to deliver on the Paris Agreement and that this greater ambition is possible.<\/p> <p>  The Paris Agreement was a diplomatic triumph and a testimony to what political leadership can do.  National and international experts are telling us that, while difficult, a Paris-aligned transition is possible, including here in Ireland.  Political leadership is what will decide whether we remain on the path we are on or whether we will join those who are increasing their ambition by embracing head on the challenges and opportunities of the inevitable transition, which is in all our interests, and out of respect to those for whom we know climate change impacts are already too much.<\/p> <p>  I mention the recommendations we would like to leave with the committee.  Looking at the national mitigation plan, we propose action 1 which is to publish an updated analysis on transition pathway scenarios to 2050.  We urge the committee to write to the Minister to ask him to ensure that the terms of reference for the commissioning of this analysis explicitly request only scenarios that are aligned with the Paris Agreement and can be justified as Ireland's fair share of a global effort to deliver on this agreement.  This is to ensure that we do not have a repeat of the current situation with the national mitigation plan as it stands.<\/p> <p>  We are also sincerely grateful to all the parties and all elected representatives who are championing and supporting Bills that seek to increase climate policy ambition in Ireland over the past year, including the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill, and we urge the committee to see all of these Bills through to enactment as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  The report and recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly provide a clear and highly legitimate basis for near-term policy developments that can increase ambition beyond that contained in the NMP in the short term.  We urge the committee to establish a workplan as soon as possible to consider and provide a report to the Oireachtas on the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly&rsquo;s recommendations on climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Cliona Sharkey"},{"type":"speech","time":1526479200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Sharkey.

We are delighted to have this opportunity to present our views on the NMP and in particular the energy aspects of that plan.  I will read the opening statement and my colleague, Mr. Bill Sadlier, a senior investment manager at NTR plc, will take any questions members of the committee may have.<\/p> <p>  At this stage of their work, members do not need reminding about the urgency of taking meaningful action to avoid the full impacts of climate change or the fact that Ireland is well behind its targets.  Our over-arching observation of the NMP is that<\/p> <p>similar to the renewable energy supply scheme, RESS, consultation document, it lacks a sufficient level of urgency or ambition.  We appreciate the broad nature of the plan and the difficulty with co-ordinating the inputs from a wide range of stakeholders, so we not here to criticise the Department but to offer assistance from the significant weight and resources our membership base holds.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, the narrative around renewable energy continues to suggest that the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy will involve a net cost increase to the consumer.  We previously presented analysis conducted by Baringa that outlined how we could achieve a greater proportion of renewable electricity combined with the right flexible technologies without increasing electricity costs.  To achieve this, it is important to have the correct blend of renewable technologies, including onshore and offshore wind, solar photo voltaic, PV, and bioenergy.  In the areas of heat and transportation, increased electrification is certain but there will also have to be developments in biogas, hydrogen and district heating.<\/p> <p>  The scale of the task at hand is easily under-estimated, therefore it is essential that all the resources available to the State, including the semi-State companies, are properly co-ordinated and targeted to achieve the best outcome in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction.<\/p> <p>  Having reviewed the transcript from this committee&rsquo;s meeting of 24 April, it is appalling, but not surprising, that we, as a State, are now resorting to buying compliance with our 2020 targets through the use of statistical transfers despite Ireland having far better renewable energy resources than the majority of member states.  It is not that long ago that 2020 seemed some distance into the future and perhaps that explains the lack of urgency in the past.  Our real fear and the fear of our membership is that 2050 is the new 2020 and that the lack of urgency will be allowed to prevail.  This simply cannot be allowed to happen.<\/p> <p>  The overall framework of activity involving the NMP also includes the national development plan, NDP, and more recently the preparation of a national energy and climate plan, NECP.  RECAP is firmly of the belief that the NECP is the most important document that we should now collectively focus on.  It is due to be drafted by the end of this year and in some respects is our final chance to get the level of ambition and urgency right, as it will guide our activities out to 2030 and beyond.<\/p> <p>  We calculate that we need to treble our rate of deployment of renewable energy if we are to optimise the energy transition.  Around the globe we are increasingly seeing renewable energy projects being delivered with little or no subsidy but this is happening only in jurisdictions where there is a clear and ambitious vision for renewable energy that is articulated publicly and State and industry work together to remove barriers and lower the costs associated with project development.  This is the model that we must follow.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, we wish to offer, on behalf of RECAP, to work with the Department, which is the main co-ordinating body for climate action, to prepare and implement an ambitious vision with a programme of activities that will allow the quickest and least-cost transition to a 100% renewable energy future which we know to be technically feasible.  In doing so, we will stimulate employment and economic activity in rural Ireland while protecting and enhancing the natural environment.<\/p> <p>  We recognise the resource constraints within the Department so RECAP is willing to provide the secretariat for this working group which would undertake to provide regular reports to this committee.  The scope of the group would be agreed with the Department and its purpose would be to provide a more efficient channel through which the vast knowledge or RECAP members can be made available to there Department in its efforts to accelerate climate action and to ensure that the NECP seizes on the great opportunity that we are now presented with.<\/p> <p>  Progress on renewable energy cannot continue to be stifled either by the erroneous notion that more renewable equals greater costs or by targets imposed on the State but by the opportunity for Ireland to have lower energy costs with a lower carbon impact and for renewable energy to become a key Irish export in the near future.

We have provided a detailed written submission, so in these opening remarks I will confine myself to the national mitigation plan's overriding objectives and overall fitness for purpose.<\/p> <p>  We agree with the quite trenchant criticisms of the plan that have been expressed by the Climate Change Advisory Council but we would prefer to be even more plain speaking about it.  It is our view that the national mitigation plan, as currently constituted, is so fundamentally flawed that it should actually be withdrawn and reformulated in its entirety.  This process could be integrated with the preparation of the national energy and climate plans, NECPs, that are required this year anyway.  We think they should be formally integrated together in recognition that the current plan is not fit for purpose.  The underlying basis of the plan - and our colleagues in Tr&oacute;caire have already referred to this - is the quantitative climate mitigation targets adopted originally in the national policy position of 2014.  We are particularly concerned that these self-adopted national targets are now clearly inadequate and obsolete.  It is widely agreed that the current collective commitments expressed by the parties to the Paris Agreement fall far short of what is required to meet that agreement's temperature goals.  As a good faith participant in the agreement, it is therefore essential that the mitigation targets in the Irish national policy should be urgently updated to reflect this new reality.  Concretely, we propose, as applies to carbon dioxide in particular - and there are different nuances to different greenhouse gases - that the national target should be expressed quantitatively as a limit on our national \"fair share\" of the global carbon budget, as it is called.  This basically sets a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide we as a nation will ever emit at any time into the future, a fixed limit within which we guarantee we will live.  We will have exited completely from fossil fuels by that time.  Just such an approach has recently been proposed by the European Parliament for adoption at European level as part of the governance regulation.<\/p> <p>  Based on our own assessment of the scale and urgency of action that this now implies, we suggest that the required rate of mitigation, that is, the rate at which carbon dioxide emissions in particular must be reduced year on year, is now an absolute minimum of 6% per year and, to take proper regard of equity, global justice and a prudential approach to the uncertainties in climate change, should probably be closer to 12% per year.  A very rapid exit is now required.  This fundamentally changes the way one would approach the matter and the steps one would take, and we need to be clear about that.  This would absolutely require wide social understanding, acceptance and co-operation.  We think the model of the Citizens' Assembly can be scaled up as part of the national dialogue or otherwise, and many lessons can be learned from that.  We are very heartened by the response from the citizens in the Citizens' Assembly, and we commend that to the committee as a model.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, we really are pleased and delighted that the committee is engaging with the national mitigation plan and with this issue and holding hearings on it.  If there is anything further we can do at any stage to support that, we would be delighted to do so.  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan, now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Barry McMullin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>It is almost a year since the national mitigation plan was published.  Our analysis at the time was that is was \"more an \"action promise\" than an action plan\" and simply did not contain enough measures to cut pollution.  This verdict has been confirmed by the critique of the Climate Change Advisory Council, which said the plan needed new and extra measures to be fit for purpose, and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, when it presented its analysis of our rising emissions.  Even more recently, the European Commission country report on Ireland for 2018, published in March as part of the semester process, stated: \"As [the plan] stands ... it offers few specific new mitigation measures.\"  The EPA is due to release new projections in about two weeks time.  Given the current state of its methodology and Irish policy, it is very likely the projections will project even more increases in Irish emissions.  As members know, the Taoiseach himself said that Ireland is a laggard on climate action and that he is not proud of our record.  For us, given everything the committee has heard, the obvious conclusion is that the current national mitigation plan simply is not fit for purpose and needs to be scrapped and replaced.<\/p> <p>  There a number of ways this can be formally triggered.  The Minister himself can trigger a revision or a replacement of the mitigation plan on foot of the latest periodic review of the climate council, under Section 4(5) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  This is specifically provided for.  The Minister has called the plan a living document and has said it will keep changing.  The council says new measures are required.  The prudent course of action, then, is for the Minister to formally trigger a revision.  This could be integrated with the national energy and climate plan that is now required.  The second way is that the D&aacute;il could call for the mitigation plan to be replaced.  I think all opposition parties represented on this committee voted for such an amendment to the climate Bill that would have required the mitigation plan to be voted on by the D&aacute;il because it is so important and because of its five-year duration.  Of course, there is nothing to stop the D&aacute;il organising itself to have such a debate and such a vote to call on the Minister to revise the plan.  A third way is that the Government could decide it needs to revise the plan on the basis of the evidence, of the landmark Citizens' Assembly report and of the need for the national energy and climate plan under the Paris Agreement's EU's plans to implement that.<\/p> <p>  What can the committee do now?  We think it should write to the Minister asking him to trigger the revision of the mitigation plan on foot of the critiques of the climate council and the Citizens' Assembly.  We call on the parties that are represented on this committee to organise time for a D&aacute;il debate to that effect.  Specifically, it is also about the Citizens' Assembly report, which is to the Oireachtas and not just the Government.  As members know, we wrote Stop Climate Chaos to both the business committee and to this committee saying it is really up to the Oireachtas to ensure that that report is treated with the same seriousness as the Oireachtas treated the report from the assembly on the eighth amendment and that some kind of dedicated committee needs to be put in place to ensure that happens in as timely a fashion as possible.  We look forward to hearing the committee's plans for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526479200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>To briefly come in on that last point, we are conscious of that correspondence and those items are under consideration  I am sure Mr. Coghlan will be glad to hear.

I saw another frightening figure last week: the move from 400 parts per million to 410 parts per million had occurred in just five years, whereas the move from 390 parts per million to 400 parts per million took six years and the move from 380 parts per million to 390 parts per million took seven years.  In other words, there is an accelerating concentration of carbon in the atmosphere, and that is there for thousands of years, no matter what we do.  It is scary that, as I think John Gibbons said yesterday, the clock is ticking more loudly every day when one looks at the effects of this that we are already seeing on the natural world.  I mention this just as a backdrop.  The work the witnesses are all doing in Tr&oacute;caire, Friends of the Earth, the Irish Environmental Network, the International Energy Agency, IEA, and others is really important in raising this issue in the public discourse.  There is an urgency to this.<\/p> <p>  In respect of some of the comments that have been made, I will briefly ask specific questions concerning the recommendations, starting with Mr. Joseph Curtin.  The main recommendation in his presentation is for a carbon tax, not, as he says, as the silver bullet, but as a key measure.  I would not rule that out, but would Mr. Curtin not agree that the scale of change required, given what Professor McMullin has said we want, is complete system change rather than marginal change?  It is interesting that the Department was before the committee two weeks ago pretty much advocating carbon taxes as one of the main tools it is now considering.  However, the difficulty is that carbon taxes give marginal change rather than system change.  For example, I do not think the issue as to whether we move to electric vehicles and so on will be determined that much by whether 13 cent is put on the price of diesel.  Thirteen cent has been put on the price of petrol in the past two years with no effect, it seems to me, in terms of system change in our transport system.<\/p><p>The switch to a low-carbon transport system and all the benefits that would come from it require State decisions around investment in the charging network.  It is a regulatory issue.  If the State is saying that from 2030 we will have no more new combustion engines, let us regulate that.  I do not disagree that it is one of the components but I fear that the over-reliance on carbon tax allows the State to step back from the decision to say, \"we do not have to do anything, we can just put on a carbon tax and, hey shazzam, the market will deliver\".  This is just one fear I wanted to raise.<\/p><p> With regard to Tr&oacute;caire - and I pick this one example from a whole range of points that have been made here today - I very much agree that one of the things we should start with is an acknowledgement that our current level of ambition is not sufficient.  It has a fatal flaw.  By stating there will be an 80% reduction in our emissions by 2050, it allows every sector off the hook because each sector is saying that it will be the 20%, it will be the sector that does not have to act and it will then point the finger at every other sector.  This is happening in our system.  Has the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, done any assessment of this, or can it refer an assessment to the committee?  If Ireland is to abide by, and ratchet up to, its commitments to the Paris Agreement when it kicks in, what is the scientific analysis of what our targets should be?  Does the IIEA have a figure in mind of what the Paris Agreement is likely to mean, given that talks on the agreement are ongoing?<\/p><p> I agree with Mr. O'Carroll that the narrative that renewable energy will cost us is fatally flawed.  I also agree that the scale of our ambitions should be to treble rates of renewable energy.  If we look at 2030, as opposed to 2050, does Renewable Energy Consumers and Producers, RECAP, have an outline of what this would mean in each of the main renewable energy categories such as offshore wind, onshore wind, rooftop solar, field solar, geothermal and so on?  Does RECAP have a recommended figure for 2030 on how many megawatts or gigawatts of each would be needed?<\/p><p> Professor McMullin spoke about the need to reduce our rates of CO2 emissions.  In his brief comment, the professor concentrated on CO2 and did not look at methane, nitrous oxide or other greenhouse gas emissions.  I am concerned about the proposal, as set out here, on the quantitative fair share of global carbon budget.  How is land use included in that proposal?  What is being done on land use climate related emissions?<\/p><p> Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan's analysis is absolutely correct - as are others I have heard here - regarding the new national climate and energy plan.  I understand that this plan will be the new plan because it will automatically trigger an amendment to the national mitigation plan.  The national climate and energy plan will become the new plan, it will be accepted as the national plan and the national mitigation plan will, effectively, be redundant.  Perhaps the witnesses will let us know if they have a different view on this.  I understand that this plan covers not just energy; it is about land use and other areas.  As the Vice Chairman said, this committee's responsibility is to respond to the Citizens' Assembly report and to use the review in a very productive way to influence how the new national climate and energy plan is framed in the next six months.<\/p><p> I will finish on a slightly frightening note about the acceleration of climate greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  The real fear is that it comes at a time when actual emissions are not rising.  They are rising because of global growth but it appears that the natural system's capability to absorb what we put in must be starting to break down.  This accounts for the faster rise in concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere than is being admitted.  The ability of land and sea banks to store the carbon now seems to have reached a frightening point where the natural systems that have so far protected us from the effects are gone.  This is why the challenge and the sense of urgency are all the more real.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#G00800","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526479200,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I am not sure what particular order witnesses would like to respond to the questions.

No other country in Europe can believe that this is the case in Ireland.  When we consider the countries that have achieved systems change, for example home heating systems in Sweden, it has a much higher carbon tax than the level I propose.  A carbon tax makes every incentive that needs to be given to decarbonise the economy more attractive.  I am not disregarding the need for other measures and carbon tax is not a silver bullet.  I am a strong believer in the need for a whole range of measures.  Government cannot just come forward with a carbon tax, wash its hands and say that it is mission accomplished.  Carbon tax has to be at the core of a climate strategy, but it is only one aspect.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ryan referred to electric vehicles.  Ireland was out of the blocks quickly on electric vehicles when Deputy Ryan was the Minister for the Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Since then, however, Ireland has made no progress in putting in place an effective charging network for electric vehicles.  A carbon tax will not solve that problem.  It will not solve every problem but it is an essential component of an effective climate strategy, and it is something we can do immediately in budget 2019.

He queried the emphasis on carbon dioxide.  I said that in the case of carbon dioxide, we thought it should be done this way, but that was not intended to suggest that there is no issue, particularly with methane and nitrous oxide.  We need broad action on all of them.  The question of how to balance action on different pollutants is scientifically complex and I will not go into all the details here.  In essence, however, carbon dioxide trumps everything else.  If we do not get the carbon dioxide issue under control, it does not matter what we do with methane and nitrous oxide.  There is a hierarchy of action here.  We absolutely must act in respect of carbon dioxide.  Acting effectively on methane and nitrous oxide buys us a little extra time, not a lot, to deal with carbon dioxide.  It is time measured in a few years or decades, not time in terms of centuries.  However, we need action on all climate pollutants, not just carbon dioxide.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the analysis of what the targets should be and what would be Paris alignment, it is a complex area.  Coincidentally, I will be presenting at a conference next week on this subject, wearing my academic hat, as part of an EPA-funded project.  A paper on that will be submitted for publication shortly and I will be delighted to share it with the committee as soon as it is fit to read.  In essence, however, and getting slightly quantitative for a moment, in order to come up with a specific limit on how much carbon dioxide a particular country should permit itself - the structure of the Paris Agreement is bottom up - there is a scientific element and there is an ethical and value element.  It is not a scientific answer.  It depends.  How much does one value other people who are not living here?  How much does one value future generations?  How much does one value the natural environment?  These are ethical issues, so one cannot get a single scientific answer to that.  However, one can set an overarching limit.<\/p> <p>  I will given my personal perspective on that.  Taking what I regard as an absolutely minimal interpretation of global equity and a minimum deference to equity, which is basically to allocate every person living today in the world an equal share of the remaining carbon budget, and taking seriously the precautionary principle, which says that in view of scientific uncertainty one should act now on the basis of the conservative view of the science, and given the minimal interpretation of the Paris Agreement, which says we need to keep temperature rise definitely below 2&deg;C over the pre-industrial, putting all of that together, one comes up with a remaining carbon dioxide budget for Ireland of roughly 400 megatonnes.  This includes land use.  It is net carbon dioxide from fossil energy, agriculture and carbon dioxide sequestered in land use, if there is any.  That 400 megatonnes compares to current annual emissions in excess of 40 megatonnes.  Basically, it is less than ten years.  That is a minimal interpretation of all the things I mentioned.<\/p> <p>  Before we get into the ethical issues, I will quote David Roberts, an online environmental journalist, who said in the last week, \"the chances of us overdoing it - trying too hard, spending too much money, reducing emissions too much or too fast - are effectively nil.\"  There is no risk that we will do too much.  Wearing my An Taisce affiliation hat, our impression in An Taisce - this is not unique to Ireland but it is particularly noticeable here - is that we seem to have a fixation on the risk that we will do too much, spend too much and overreact.  From a scientific point of view, that ship has sailed.  There is no possibility that we will overreact.  Setting really strong targets for ourselves is a good faith contribution to the international agreement with which we have engaged.  It is a collective action problem.  We need support from our friends in Europe and globally.  We have invested a huge diplomatic effort in the national interest around Brexit, but the threat of climate change puts Brexit in the penny place.  We should be mobilising as much diplomatic effort as we can internationally, but we can only do that with any credibility if our diplomats can go abroad and say that we as a small nation - a rich nation but not very rich in certain senses - with very limited natural resources are doing our bit and this is how we are doing it.  If we can say that, we can have influence on the European and global stages.  However, if we cannot say that, we are contaminating and undermining international action and that will be bad for every other country in the world as well as ourselves.  It is simply bad for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Barry McMullin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I will address some of the Acting Chairman's questions and Bill Sadlier will speak on the 2030 targets.  It is worth drawing the attention of the committee to work that has been carried out by Stanford University called the Solutions Project.  It has identified the pathway to 100% renewable energy for 139 countries around the globe, including Ireland.  It has quantified some of the high level benefits of achieving the 100% renewable energy target.  In terms of jobs, it identified the creation of 35,500 new permanent jobs to achieve 100% renewable energy, and it defines a permanent job as a job that will exist for more than 40 years.  Leaving aside all the benefits from the job creation and the investment, it has quantified the health benefits alone as in excess of &euro;10 billion per annum by lowering and removing air pollution resulting from fossil fuels.  All of that can be achieved with no extra cost to the consumer.  It is worth making the point that if there was a technology company in Palo Alto that provided us with an opportunity to create 35,500 permanent jobs and benefits in that order, every politician in the land would, quite rightly, have a pathway beaten to the door of that company.  That is the scale of the opportunity we have.  We wish to move away from talking about costs.  The move to 100% renewable energy is a massive opportunity.  Even outside the economic benefits it has huge social and environmental benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Carroll"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>As part of our RESS submission, we modelled the impact of various technologies for the consumer cost and the cost of electricity.  One is looking at approximately 7 GW of additional renewable energy by 2030.  To put that in context, we will have 3.7 GW of renewable energy at the end of this year.  It has taken us approximately 20 years to get to where we are now.  We have another 12 years to treble that.  It is a significant leap forward from where we are today.  We took the low carbon living scenario and the consumer action profile from EirGrid and we modelled the impact of electricity prices with those technologies.  To answer the Deputy's question, they would cut across a number of larger scale renewable energy projects from onshore wind, offshore wind, ground mounted PV, rooftop PV to flexible behind the meter demand response, storage and more interconnection.  It was to look at how we can stand behind a low cost, zero-impact cost to the consumer and a reduction in electricity prices.  If one starts the roll-out of an additional 7 GW of additional renewable energy on top of the 3.7 GW we have today, it is a very positive story.  However, and this refers back to what Joe O'Carroll said in his opening statement, that is a tremendous gap for us to bridge.<\/p> <p>  The Department needs to embrace RECAP's offer in terms of delivering that.  It is trying to deliver renewable energy and to incentivise people to invest but there are issues with planning, which was seen most recently with the Apple case.

Thankfully, the Commission said \"No\" because that is not the template required under the draft governance directive.  However, the Government's second plan appears to be to send some poor civil servant off into a corner to write this in the dark without thinking of the Paris Agreement and other obligations and without publicly consulting other stakeholders.  Apart from not being in the spirit of the Paris accord and the energy White Paper which refers to a societal transformation and putting communities and citizens at the centre, that would be a huge missed opportunity.  That is why it is important that we at least formally agree that this should be a revision of the NMP because under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, revising the NMP requires specific consultation and input from appropriate stakeholders.

We can carry on as we are otherwise.<\/p> <p>  There could be a correlation between a reduction in income tax and increased carbon tax, and changes in habit and behaviour.  The big concern about that relates to low income households.  If somebody is earning less than &euro;24,000 a year, they are not in an income tax bracket while the majority of pensioners and all those on disability allowance, for example, do not pay income tax.  Part of the solution in this respect is to retrofit their homes but they often are in the coldest and hardest to heat homes.  Unless it was front-loaded, I do not see how an income tax reduction would work.  It should be borne in mind that half of the workers in the State who get up early in the morning, according to the Taoiseach, earn less than &euro;28,000.  There is another cohort on social welfare or whose earnings are less than the minimum wage of approximately &euro;19,000.  Tax reductions would also have to be front-loaded for retrofitting their homes.  The retrofitting will be deep because many of them are in the oldest of houses.  How will that dichotomy be resolved?  If it is not, a huge section of the population will be driven into fuel poverty, which nobody wants.  I agree that the tax code will have to change.  All the witnesses can respond to that question.<\/p> <p>  I said in this room and in the D&aacute;il four years ago when we took the climate action Bill that the lack of binding sectoral targets in the legislation would be a fatal flaw.  Do the witnesses feel binding targets are needed at this stage?  The projected increase in agricultural emissions is between 4% and 5% over the next 18 months while it is between 10% and 12% for transport emissions in comparison to 2015.  The projection for the non-ETS sector is between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels whereas the minimum target reduction should be 20% by 2020.  Given that we are way off the targets at this point, how do we achieve acceptance of the need for binding sectoral targets?<\/p> <p>  RECAP addressed the energy mix going forward and Mr. Sadlier might like to elaborate.  He mentioned Stanford University research and it is useful to reference that.  Currently, I can go home and plug in my electric car but the power I am using to charge the battery could be generated by coal, peat or a nuclear plant.  We have to change the sources of power quickly.  What is the ideal energy mix over the next two or three years?  What are the main obstacles and opportunities in this regard?  I agree with Mr. Sadlier that the conversation should be about the opportunity and not about there being a problem  The conversation needs to be turned on its head.  What are the immediate steps the State needs to take to make progress over the next two or three years?  I agree with everyone that the State's record is shameful.  Some of us predicted this.  When the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 was going through, I said that we would hit a carbon cliff and now there is a high one in front of us with no planning done to address it.

I agree completely with the Acting Chairman that we do not just need to deal with climate change but that we also need a system change.  In her presentation Ms Sharkey spoke about global climate impacts being at crisis levels.  She has pointed out that in the rich world we are becoming increasingly aware of our vulnerability to extreme weather conditions, but the poor countries that contributed least to climate change and that have the least institutional, financial and technological capacity to cope are being hit first and the hardest.  Is there any way by which we can measure how inequality impacts within rich countries in the context of climate change?  We must look at this issue in a global way because not everyone in the developed world is responsible for the problem.  It is the case that not everyone in the developed world is refusing to take responsibility for the developing world; rather, it is a tiny percentage - the rich - who are responsible for most of the problem.  Is there any way by which we can measure it?

I agree with them and welcome their strong statement.  I ask them to comment on how we could use the possibility of our facing fines of &euro;17 million per year for failing to reach our targets as an argument in favour of spending money now to deliver renewable energy resources.  Not spending money on the public transport system, to retrofit homes and on other initiatives is a shocking waste of time in the context of the survival of the planet, especially if it means that we will end up spending large sums in fines.

We have to strike a balance.  Effectively, we are close to full employment.  A few days ago approximately 800 permits were permitted for non-EU nationals to come to work in Ireland.  That is a wonderful development for them and the country.  It is part of our responsibilities, as legislators and leaders, to balance the need to have people working and accommodate more people coming into the country with the need to deal with the very real issue of climate change.  I am not for one moment suggesting we do not deal with the issue; nor am I disputing the science or the importance of the targets set.  However, a balance must be struck in the achievement of those targets in the context of the impact on real people.  I know that the classic response is that we will replace the jobs lost with others in the alternative energy sector, but there is a process involved in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There is no point in members of the committee lauding everything the delegates have said.  We must stress-test what has been presented to us as much as we can, even though we may come at it without scientific qualifications.  On the presentation made by Tr&oacute;caire, one of the classic arguments made by people involved in the agriculture sector is that if we curb our levels of food production to minimise transport or methane gas emissions, for example, forests in the developing world which are important in dealing with global warming will have to be cut down to replace the food not produced here.  Furthermore, replacement food would have to be imported, which would give rise to huge transport costs and thus increased emissions.  How do the delegates respond on the balance that needs to be struck?  I note what the representatives of Tr&oacute;caire have said about the horror of what is happening in the developing world.  I am interested in how we can strike a balance in that context.<\/p> <p>  The community in County Cavan from whence I come has taken to wind energy generation with huge enthusiasm.  It is one of the few communities where there has not been a negative reaction to or a popular protest against the development of wind farms.  There has been no example of NIMBYism.  Ironically, many of the people who engage in NIMBYism would also be among the first to say we need to deal with carbon emissions and the impact of global warming.  The reason my community took to wind energy generation so well was the leasing arrangements with the small farmers on whose land the wind turbines were located.  The leases are a source of income for them and have made an enormous difference.  Community inputs are also important.  <\/p> <p>  The classic argument being made against wind energy generation is that it is inordinately expensive and heavily subsidised.  I would like the delegates, specifically those from RECAP, to comment on or refute that argument, if possible.  I do not believe it and believe it is important to develop the wind energy sector further.<\/p><p>Microgeneration of wind energy has significant and unexploited potential for individual householders.

The outcome of those will be important.<\/p> <p>  On renewable energy targets, the governance regulation specifies sectoral trajectories for heating and cooling, electricity and the transport sector will have to be included in the plans.  It specifically mentions sectoral targets as an option in greenhouse gas reductions and energy efficiency.  Once those sectoral targets are set, if set within the energy and climate plans, the Commission will then hold Ireland to those targets and they would have to be included in the periodic reports to the Commission.<\/p> <p>  The issue of fines was raised.  Ireland is likely to miss its binding renewable energy target under the 2020 renewable energy directive.  If we see fines as a penalty payment that is imposed by the European Court of Justice following an action pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, they are quite an unlikely option.  The average time in environmental cases for a fine to be handed down by the European Court of Justice is about four years.  It is interesting to note, and is connected to the ongoing trilateral negotiations, that the Commission proposal sets the 2020 target as a binding baseline share.  Article 27 of the proposed governance regulation specifies that if a state does not maintain that baseline, under the Commission proposal, it would be required to contribute to a financing platform administered by the Commission.  Those funds would then be used for investment in renewable energy projects throughout Europe, which means the fines will be invested in renewable energy in any case.  The way in which the contribution will be calculated will be up to the Commission but the projects may be in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Max Muenchmeyer"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":366,"content":"<p>On Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's question on inequality, we know that the richest 10% of people contribute 50% of global emissions, while in all countries, rich and poor, it is the poorest who are most impacted, such as in the case of Hurricane Katrina or the heatwave in Europe several years ago.  We need a global transition that is equitable as well as equitable transitions within countries.

Agriculture and land use are responsible for 30% of global emissions.  To stay within the 2 &deg;C limit requires tackling this on a global level.  The great thing about the Paris Agreement is that it covers all countries, rich and poor, big and small, that have signed up to its goals.  Therefore, all countries, whether big or small, rich or poor, have obligations under the agreement.  Ireland needs to concern itself with doing its fair share to meet those objectives, including in the area of agricultural emissions, rather than pleading special cases for particular sectors.

By doing our fair share, leading by example through diplomacy and encouraging and supporting other countries to do their fair share, we will get there collectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Garvey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Deputy Stanley spoke of a carbon cliff, but what it really comes down to is action and accountability.

They are useful and insightful.<\/p> <p>  There has been extended discussion around the taxation system and the possible measures under it.  I am not a tax expert but the distributional implications are very important.  Deputy Stanley is rightly drawing attention to that.  Everything we do in the areas of subsidies or taxes has implications for that and we need a joined-up view of how those things play out.  There are other innovative instruments which we have not attempted to use yet, such as the universal basic income or having taxes on certain activities tied to distribution on a population-wide basis.  These could be among the issues we might examine.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith asked about scaling up the lessons from the Citizens' Assembly and trying to get wide societal engagement.<\/p><p>The Citizens' Assembly has demonstrated it can be very effective in engaging a representative set of citizens with access to independent reputable advice, but where they are in charge of the process and get to determine what they discuss, how they discuss it and what questions get asked, and where there is genuine dialogue as opposed to lectures from experts, which do not work.  How does one scale it up?  One has to spend money.  By comparison with the other measures we are talking about, however, this is cheap.  We have seen this week in the context of the citizens' dialogue the announcement of the first really substantive event.  It is a regional event in Athlone in the midlands later in the summer.  That is well and good but that is a region that covers perhaps one third of the country.  What we need is something that reaches down virtually into every parish in the country and that gives access to people throughout the country on an extended basis, over a year or 18 months.  Perhaps ten times the resources that are currently being contemplated are needed.<\/p><p> In terms of overall national expenditure, what we are talking about is trivial.  We are talking a low number of millions of euro over a two-year period.  The idea that we would not be willing to spend money on a device to engage the entirety of our society in something that will affect us, future generations and the rest of the world for decades to come is extraordinary.  We need to talk about investing the very modest amount of money required to have the staff, in the order of approximately 50, and to engage in administration, training and the hosting of hundreds of events over 18 months or two years.  In each case, one is talking not only about relying on people volunteering to participate, because that was not the Citizens' Assembly model.  On a town, city or county basis, one can use the Citizens' Assembly model of identifying a random stratified group of representative people and invite them.  Of course, they will not all come but one can back off from that.  That is a much better way of getting representative participation than relying on the interest of volunteers, as with the first regional meeting.  Bearing in mind the lessons from the Citizens' Assembly on how to engage, make engagement bilateral and have access to expert advice, all these things can be scaled up.  Admittedly it costs money but the costs are utterly modest by comparison with the scale of what we are talking about and the opportunity to engage our entire society in what is a fundamental generational challenge.  I do not believe we should quibble over that.<\/p><p> Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith asked about the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill and the climate emergency Bill.  We support both.  In both cases, the fundamental physical reality is that we have already available to us on a global basis far more fossil fuels than we can safely use.  We must engage in limiting that, both upstream and downstream.  There is no point in operating just on the consumption side; one might as well do it on the supply side as well.  The Bills speak to that.  We support both of them.<\/p><p> A question was asked by Senator Joe O'Reilly on balancing economic development, particularly in respect of jobs, and the transition.  He is absolutely right.  We very strongly support the need to consider distributional effects, just transition and the inequity within our country, quite aside from the inequity internationally.  There are ideas that need to be put into operation.  They cover tradeable energy quotas, the fair flying tax and initiatives that tie actions to the activities that are disproportionately responsible for emissions.  There are ideas but we just need the will and collective social discussion, through a scaled-up Citizens' Assembly process, to implement them.<\/p><p> I cannot comment on the technical specifics of the North&ndash;South interconnector.  The committee would have to get EirGrid representatives in to explain that.<\/p><p> With regard to education and training, I come from the education sector.  We would love to do more but we need the societal buy-in.  In this regard, I must refer again to the scaled-up Citizens' Assembly process.  There is no widespread cultural perception in Ireland that there is a major challenge with which we all need to engage, not in terms of replacing light bulbs but in terms of engaging in collective societally agreed and largely political action.  Everybody needs to be engaged, however.  Greater educational opportunities, among many other goods, would flow from that if we got it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Barry McMullin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>On the issue of carbon tax, Deputy Stanley's good question on how one ensures any rise in that tax is not regressive in practice, and Deputy Eamon Ryan's question on how we prevent it from being the only thing we do, I am much taken by Mr. Curtin's proposal that we ramp it up and use the income constructively but I am very aware of the risk Deputy Eamon Ryan alerted us to, namely, that it might be the only thing the Government does and that it will stand back after doing it.  My experience is that while it is a useful signal, people actually respond to the subsidies and a congestion charge, for example, rather than a road tax or an increase in diesel charges.  They responded to the plastic bag tax.  They respond to initiatives that are smaller and more tangible.<br\/><br\/>I accept Mr. Curtin's analysis that every scheme gains more traction if there is a basic price of carbon underlying it than is higher than we have now.  The debate on progressive and regressive measures is very important, however.  It is worth remembering that when the carbon tax was introduced in budget 2010, VAT was reduced at the same time.  The Government did not make much of that but it was a case of one regressive indirect tax being increased and one being reduced, roughly to the same annual level.  There was not much communication or championing of that as a revenue-neutral way of avoiding socially regressive impacts.  I agree that if we were to proceed in this regard now, we would have to be careful about the people in lower income tax brackets and, potentially, those outside the tax net altogether.<br\/><br\/>We should ring-fence some of the money and not just say we will do so.  It was said in 2010 but, with the recession, it was not done.  It has to be ring-fenced.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance do not like hypothecation but we need to ring-fence the money for some sort of transition fund.<br\/><br\/>There is a radical proposal, floated in the United States, to give some of the money back as part of a tax and dividend system.  If one takes all the tax in and gives it all back <i>per capita<\/i>as a direct dividend, in practice lower-income households do not use as much of the windfall because they have lower overall pollution even though they spend a higher proportion of their income on polluting activities.  They would actually get a cash transfer from the state.  It becomes more than equitable and has a progressive impact.  It is certainly worth considering.  Perhaps half could be done by dividend and half by putting money in a ring-fenced fund.  I am not sure we should be reducing our taxes right now given where we are in the economic cycle.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of binding sectoral targets, I have never been of the opinion, throughout the eight years of the climate law campaign, that we needed to have such targets in law.  I believe we would be okay with a system more like that in the United Kingdom, where what is legally binding is the overall envelope for a five-year period.  We currently have no domestic legally binding target.  Our political target, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050, is underwritten by the law but not actually in the law.  In the United Kingdom, one has to come before the Parliament every five years with a carbon budget not just for the next five years but for the next 20 years.  This results in a political, democratic negotiation on what departments and sectors are to receive in the budget.  It might be difficult to put the sectoral number into law but if one puts the carbon budget number into law through a revised climate Bill, it is really powerful.  It has worked in the United Kingdom to induce a debate not on whether we act but how we share the effort between the various sectors.<br\/><br\/>On the energy mix, I was asked about electric vehicles.<\/p><p>I was searching for the numbers there, and I have found them.  Based on figures from 2016, even with the current mix, an electric vehicle will average about 70 g of carbon dioxide per kilometre, whereas with a combustion engine the average output was 118 g per kilometre in 2016.  Even now, it is much better to use an electric vehicle that is charged by plugging in.  Obviously that will get better the more we decarbonise the grid, which of course we must do. <\/p><p> Absolutely, I think the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill 2016 and the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2017 are hugely significant, as much for their symbolic value and their message about where Ireland is going-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526479200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I refer to the Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#S00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Yes, I will come on to that.

If I understood correctly, he was concerned about the issue of balancing job creation and job loss.  All the evidence from all the economists that we hear from is that overall, the transition will create jobs.  Second, it is worth noting that the International Trade Union Confederation now repeats all the time that there are no jobs on a dead planet.  The choice is not between keeping the jobs we have now and the risk of losing some, it is about creating sustainable jobs for the future.<\/p> <p>  The sector that Senator O'Reilly did not mention but may be on his mind is the peat sector.  There is no alternative other than some sort of just transition task force.  Any time a US company announces it is closing down its factory in Ireland we have a task force overnight.  The Industrial Development Authority, IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Solas and all the agencies knock their heads together to find a use for the factory and jobs for the workers.  It will be ten years next month since the Government was first advised, not by us environmentalists but by its advisers, that it was time to close the peat stations and stop burning peat for electricity.  If we had set up a just transition commission then, we would be fine.  We now need to do it in a two-year timescale to close the peat stations in 2020.  There needs to be community development support and just transition support, not just for training but for the development of those areas.<\/p> <p>  Briefly, Deputy Stanley raised the issue of micro-generation.  To address the issue of societal buy-in, I think it is possible to engage people in dialogues and get them thinking, but it is much easier to get them engaged in something practical.  I want every school in the country to have solar panels on its roof, so that schools can sell the electricity they do not use back to the grid, save money on their energy bills and invest that in educational activities.  That is what would really get communities to buy into this and engage in this.  This also applies to farm buildings, community halls and parish halls.  We do not just need the grant system that the Minister is proposing to pilot from this summer, of which we have not yet seen evidence.  We need a price, a payment for solar energy.  It was not in the strategy for renewable energy.  They say they are interested in it in the Department.  It is overwhelmingly what experts advise and what the public wants.  If we do that, then we have a real chance to actually practically engage people in something from which they can build their interest and their engagement in the transition we all want to see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526479200,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I ask the various organisations here to look at those two Bills.

I am joined by Mr. Paul Shortt from the Department and by Dr. Ciara McMahon and Dr. Miche&aacute;l Lehane, from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Government has been aware since 2009 of the UK's plans to build nuclear power stations at sites judged as potentially suitable.  The UK Government identified up to eight locations for the construction of new nuclear power plants by 2025, five of which are on the Irish Sea coast and the remaining three are on the east coast.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has been recognised for some time by the UK as a stakeholder in any nuclear development proposal.  When the UK initially decided to embark on plans to build a new fleet of power stations, Ireland was one of the stakeholders consulted as part of that process.  Following strategic level environmental assessments, the UK concluded in 2009 that there would be no likely significant transboundary effects for Ireland arising from the new build programme.  The assessments showed that while in the event of a significant unintended release of radioactive emissions, for example, as a result of a major accident, there would be a possibility of transboundary effects the probability of such an event was rated as extremely low due to the robustness of the regulatory regime.<\/p> <p>  This assessment was considered by the then Department of the Environment, under the technical advice of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, prior to its merger with the EPA, and it was determined that there was no reason to contradict the conclusion that there were not likely to be significant transboundary effects.  These matters were conveyed to the Government in a memo dated 17 January 2011 and the decision arising was that the existing bilateral engagement supported by ongoing contact at regulator level was the most effective mechanism through which to raise and seek to have Irish concerns addressed.  This was conveyed to the UK Government in a letter from the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to his counterpart on 24 January 2011.  This letter further states that having regard to these considerations, the Government of Ireland is of the view that the appropriate and most productive way forward would be to avail of the aforementioned mechanisms of consultation rather than to seek a formal transboundary consultation.  This proposed way forward was accepted by the UK and remains the adopted position.  It should be noted that under the EURATOM treaty, the UK was required to satisfy the European Commission that the development at Hinkley would not result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another member state.  In this context a Commission opinion, issued in February 2012, considered that in normal operating conditions, discharges of liquid and gaseous radioactive effluents were not likely to result in exposure of the population of another member state.<\/p> <p>  The Government then asked the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, to prepare a report on the potential radiological implications for Ireland from the proposed suite of new plants.  A principal finding of this report is that the routine operation of the proposed nuclear power plants will have no measurable impact on Ireland or the Irish marine environment.  This report continues to inform Irish engagement on the UK new nuclear build programme.  The Irish established position is that while we are not a nuclear energy producing country, we acknowledge the right of states to determine their own energy mix but we expect that where a state chooses to develop a nuclear power industry, this will be done in line with the highest international standards with respect to safety and environmental protection.<\/p> <p>  In terms of current engagement and recent development, there are now twice yearly meetings of the UK-Ireland contact group on radiological matters.  This forum has been existence for a number of years.  The meetings are attended by representatives from central Departments of both the UK and Irish Governments and their respective colleagues from the regulatory and environmental protection agencies.  As part of the process of engagement between the two Governments, officials from Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and radiological experts from the EPA have visited numerous UK nuclear related sites in recent years, including Hinkley Point and Sellafield.  What we gain through this process is access to the UK experts and an opportunity to visit the various sites.  The issue of the UK new build programme is a standing agenda item at these meetings and arising from these discussions a letter was received from the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in December 2016 concerning the UN Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context - generally referred to as the Espoo Convention.  In this letter, the UK reiterated its view that the development at Hinkley was not likely to cause a significant adverse impact on the environment of another state and that, therefore, the UK was not required to undertake trans-boundary consultation.  It further stated that following a recommendation from the Espoo committee, the UK was seeking our opinion as to whether notification would be useful at the current stage for the development at Hinkley Point C.  The Department responded by letter dated 2 March that such notification would be useful and set out the basis for this view and adding that having the opportunity to formally comment on the UK new build programme is extremely valuable in allaying public concerns in relation to the programme.  <\/p> <p>  The new build programme and specifically Espoo related matters were discussed at the meeting of the UK-Ireland group on 27 April, following which, on 28 July 2017, a further letter was received from the UK by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government - the lead department in relation to Espoo - in which the UK stated that while it maintained its position that it did not breach the Espoo Convention, it recognised the value of constructive engagement and in that spirit it was providing an opportunity to comment on the current environmental information in relation to potential transboundary impacts.  The letter further stated that if likely significant adverse transboundary effects are identified on the basis of scientific evidence, it would then look at how the regulatory regime might address any identified effects.  A consultation process was then initiated by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government through the local authority network and this process was recently completed.<\/p> <p>  On emergency preparedness, in the unlikely event that there is an accidental discharge from a nuclear power plant in the UK, the Irish regulatory authorities are well primed to deal with such an eventuality.  The UK and Ireland have agreed and developed an early-warning notification system to alert Irish authorities of any problems in nuclear facilities in the UK.  This system is regularly tested and discussed through the UK-Ireland contact group to ensure that it remains robust and fit for purpose.  Ireland has also developed a detailed national emergency plan for nuclear and radiological accidents, NEPNA, to make provision for preparedness and response to nuclear and radiological emergencies taking place both inside and outside the State.  Officials from Irish Departments and agencies who will have a role in the event of such an emergency take part in international exercises to evaluate and improve our response arrangements and capabilities with regard to nuclear and radiological emergencies.  <\/p> <p>  In 2017, Ireland participated in a large-scale exercise held by the International Atomic Energy Agency to test our operational arrangements of the convention on early notification of a nuclear accident.  The outcomes from this Convex exercise will inform an update to NEPNA which will then be established on a statutory basis to ensure that Ireland's preparedness and responses to nuclear and radiological emergencies remains first rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#T00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McDonald"},{"type":"speech","time":1526479200,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McDonald and I invite Dr. Lehane to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#T00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to attend this meeting to assist it with its deliberations.  I am joined by Dr Ciara McMahon who was lead author of the 2013 report on the potential radiological implications for Ireland of the proposed nuclear power plants in the UK.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is an independent statutory body with a wide range of responsibilities.  Since 2014, it also has responsibilities in regard to radiological protection, following its merger with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  One of these roles is to monitor scientific and technical developments abroad in regard to nuclear installations and to provide advice to the Government on the implications for Ireland.  Some specific areas of work in the EPA over the past number of years include the review of the new nuclear build plans in the UK, the provision of technical support at meetings of the UK-Ireland contact group on radiological matters and the preparation of national reports and reviews to the convention of nuclear safety.  The EPA also carries out an annual programme to monitor radioactivity in air, food and water.<\/p><p>The EPA's monitoring of the environment confirms that while the levels of artificial radioactivity in the Irish environment are detectable, they are low and do not pose a risk to the human health of the Irish population.  <\/p><p> The EPA has several key roles under the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents, including: maintaining arrangements for early warning and operation of an on-call duty officer system; maintaining the national radiation monitoring network; maintaining a national laboratory for the measurement of levels of radioactivity in the environment and food; and providing advice to the national emergency co-ordination group and Departments on possible protective actions to minimise radiation doses to the Irish population.  Undertaking hazard assessments is a key element of emergency preparedness.<\/p><p> In 2010 the RPII was asked to carry out an assessment of the potential radiological impacts of the new nuclear power plants in the UK.  That was published in 2013.  One of its conclusions was that the routine discharges from the proposed nuclear power plant would be of no radiological significance for people living in Ireland.  The assessment also considered the potential for severe nuclear accidents and five potential accident scenarios were assessed with probabilities ranging from 1:50,000 to 1:33 million chances per year.  The impact of each scenario was modelled for a reference location on the east coast of Ireland over timescales ranging from 48 hours to one year after a release.  Apart from the amount of radioactivity release weather was felt to be the most significant factor.  Ninety per cent of the time, during the 48 hours after a potential accident scenario, radioactivity was not transported by wind over the reference location.  On those occasions when the wind was blowing the radioactivity directly towards Ireland, the predicted levels of contamination and radiation doses varied significantly.  Where the chance of an accident was estimated to be 1 in 50,000, the impact on Ireland was predicted to be relatively small.  The radioactivity levels would not be high enough to warrant short-term measures but food controls and-or temporary agricultural protective actions would be required for a period of days to weeks following the accident.<\/p><p> On the other end of the scale, for the least probable but most severe accident studied, short-term measures, such as sheltering, may be warranted in the immediate aftermath of the accident to reduce exposure of the population.  Food controls and protective actions would be required for many and protective actions would be required for many years to reduce radiation doses from consumption of contaminated food.  While these controls have been shown to be very effective in controlling radioactivity levels in foods for sale, they do have significant socio-economic implications and costs.  This was also subject to an assessment by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, in a subsequent study.<\/p><p> Dr. McMahon is the lead author and I can provide additional information and answer any questions on these matters, if the committee wants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Miche&aacute;l Lehane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526479200,"counter":390,"content":"<p>What specifically resulted from the EPA's reports on radioactivity in those parts of the Irish Sea close to Sellafield?  Dr. Lehane referred to the commission and said the results showed that the population of another state was not likely to be harmed by exposure.  What is the effect under normal operating conditions?  An accident may not happen under normal operating conditions but under abnormal ones.<\/p> <p>  I am not a scientist but I have been to a nuclear plant and am aware of some of the issues surrounding storage of nuclear waste.  There are major concerns because nuclear waste cannot be wished away and we cannot hope it will go away.  It will be with us for thousands of years.  With the construction of eight new plants, in addition to the ones already there, in the three foreign countries, England, Scotland and Wales, which are on an island with a fairly small land mass, there will be a huge volume of nuclear waste in Britain.  Some of the plants are getting old, for example, Torness will probably be decommissioned within the next five or ten years.  Perhaps the Department and the EPA could give a concise answer to each of those three questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#U00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Since the early 1980s the EPA, and previously the RPII, have monitored sea water sediment, shellfish and fish, looking for artificial radioactivity mainly as a result of discharges from Sellafield.  It is not a nuclear power plant.  It is a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant and because of the difference in those operations its discharges of radioactivity into the environment are much larger.  That is partly why people have difficulty understanding that new nuclear power plants may not lead to large increases in radioactivity going into the environment.  It all comes down to whether fuel is reprocessed or not.  Reprocessing leads to larger discharges to the environment.<\/p> <p>  We can measure the radioactivity in the environment as a result of the Sellafield discharges.  What we are measuring comes mainly from discharges in the 1970s and 1980s when they were much higher.  Much of what was discharged ended up in the seabed sediments just off the coast of Sellafield and there were muddy sediments just off the coast of Louth too.  It got trapped in the sediment there but now because the discharges are lower at Sellafield it is starting to come back up into the water.<\/p> <p>  We measure radioactivity that has been there since the 1970s and 1980s.  Even if discharges stopped completely tomorrow we would probably continue to measure around the same levels of radioactive caesium and plutonium in the sea water, sediments and shellfish and so on.  The levels are extremely low.  If we add what we are exposed to from all sources of radiation in the environment, including radon, medical exposures and so on, what we are actually exposed to from Sellafield, Chernobyl, Fukushima plus nuclear weapons testing, represents less than 1% of our overall radiation dose.  That is for an average member of the public.  For somebody who has high levels of radon in his or her home or workplace the percentage coming from Sellafield and Chernobyl, etc., will be even smaller.  <\/p> <p>  In response to the question about what normal operations means, when a nuclear power plant is operating there are discharges to the environment.  They are much lower than those from a reprocessing plant but there are ongoing discharges to air and water.  As five of the plants will possibly be on the Irish Sea coast we assessed the discharges and what the radiation doses would be.  These are routine releases from the 60 to 70 year plant life.  We worked with Met &Eacute;ireann to get data on the weather patterns for the past 21 years and used that to model what would happen over the next 60 years of operation of the plants for discharges to air.  We also studied average sea currents and worked with the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, which has experts in sea modelling to assess the maximum discharges that could occur at nuclear power plants.<\/p> <p>  We had to make assumptions because these plants have not been built yet but we had information on what the UK regulators were considering as the maximum amount that could be discharged to air and water.  We also had information on what similar, older plants would currently release into the environment in Europe and the world.  We used all that data to examine the radiation doses that would occur over 60 to 70 years.  The radiation dose we get currently is approximately 4,000 microsieverts per year, this would increase by less than one additional microsievert.  We would not be able to measure that above what we get at the moment.  That led to the conclusion that for the routine releases, excluding any emergency occurring, the radiological impact would be insignificant.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciara McMahon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>In response to the question of storage, there has been some discussion about geological disposal facilities, GDFs, and how the UK would manage the waste coming from the nuclear industry.

At this stage they are of a very general nature, and are appropriate to an internal UK audience.<\/p><p>At present there are no proposals to site one of these geological disposal facilities on the island of Ireland.  Following a number of unsuccessful attempts to identify a long-term facility, the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills launched a consultation paper on how better to engage and represent communities across England and Northern Ireland in any future process to consider siting a geological disposal facility.  The consultation paper notes that the process to identify and select a site for one of these facilities requires detailed technical work that would be estimated to take somewhere between 15 years to 20 years.  That is the sort of timescale we are looking at.<\/p><p> Even if a community proposal won public support in Northern Ireland, we are talking about a long-term game here.

It is unfortunate that we are so limited.  It is probably unlikely that Hinkley Point will ever get built because it is so uneconomic.  If it is built and there is an accident, what sorts of timelines will apply?  How much notice would we have to react to an unplanned release from Hinkley Point?  As I understand it, the main recommendation is to shelter behind closed doors from immediate weather or atmospheric conditions such as rain or wind.  What are the timelines that are likely to apply in these circumstances?  Even though we had a week's notice of recent weather events such as Hurricane Ophelia and Storm Emma, we saw how significantly difficult it was to organise ourselves.  We would not have any notice of this.  What are the timelines for getting shelter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#X02300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I will take that question.  We have looked at a range of accidents.  Sheltering was not required in the case of most of the accidents we have looked at, including some very severe accidents.<\/p><p>The important things would be food controls and agriculture protection actions in order to prevent long-term health risks like cancers.  We wanted to look at cases such as Fukushima, where there was a release to the environment combined with unfavourable weather, with winds coming quickly from the east with a lot of rain as the plume arrived.  It is best practice to measure the maximal impact when developing nuclear plans.  We worked with Met &Eacute;ireann to identify weather patterns over a 21-year period and we found about six days in that 21-year period when such unfavourable weather conditions existed.  At those times, it might be appropriate to advise people to stay indoors.  Even if they did not stay indoors, however, they would not get a radiation dose that would be of immediate concern.  It would be above safe levels during the passage of the plume and we would advise people to stay indoors for maybe 24 or 48 hours.  Even if people were camping outdoors, however, the predicted radiation dose would be roughly 14 mSv, which is higher than the annual recommended does but, as a once-off, is not an immediate health concern.  Radiation workers can receive up to 20 mSv per year for every year of their working lives so we are not talking about a dangerous level of radiation.<\/p><p> The timelines all depend on what is initiated but with Fukushima there was a tsunami power was very quickly lost.  For 48 hours there were significant releases to the environment.  The journey of any radioactivity across the Irish Sea would take a few days.  Once the release started, it would be a number of hours before any action would be expected in respect of the public.  The action would be to recommend people who wanted to minimise the radiation dose to stay indoors.  If nothing was done and we continued with our lives completely as normal, 90% of the effects would be on food from people's gardens or food which was 100% locally produced.  That does not have to happen.  We have worked with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Food Safety Authority to make sure that there are plans in place to ensure all food on sale after a nuclear accident would be safe to eat.  That would reduce the radiation people get to much lower levels and we would not expect an increase in cancers provided the necessary actions were taken.  We have worked with stakeholder groups, including representatives from the Irish Farmers Association, with retailer groups and with food and feed bodies to make them aware of what we are doing and they have given us feedback.  We know what is technically feasible but they want to know what would work in the Irish situation.<\/p><p> The Irish national emergency plan for nuclear accidents was subject to an international peer review at the end of 2015.  It was found to be a good plan and well integrated into overall planning in the State.  We learned from events such as Storm Emma, Storm Ophelia and the dioxins crisis.  Thankfully, nuclear accidents are rare but we have a feedback mechanism so that we learn from such events and our practice was identified as something other countries should emulate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#X02400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciara McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526479200,"counter":440,"content":"<p>The hit could be taken by the food industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018051600002#Y00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526479200,"counter":441,"content":"<p>That is where the costs come in.

I am aware of its continuing interest in the issue and happy to provide whatever information I can and follow up with responses to questions in due course.  I will provide an outline of the background to personal assistant services and the policy context in which they operate.  I will also provide some detail on the nature and level of services being provided.<\/p> <p>  The term \"personal assistance user\" refers to a person with a disability choosing a personal assistant of their choice to aid him or her in everyday tasks and negotiating environmental, transport and other social barriers.  However, all people with a disability do not want or require personal assistance but all people with a disability, including those who use or wish to use personal assistants, want to exercise choice, control and self-determination over their own lives.  Government policy is to integrate services for people with disabilities with mainstream services, where possible.  While the resources for the provision of assisted living services available are substantial, they are finite.  The independent living philosophy underpinning the personal assistant service concurs with the approach that people with a disability should be empowered to live independently.  The philosophy of independent living espouses living like everyone else, having the right to self-determination, to exert control over one&rsquo;s life, to have opportunities to make decisions and take responsibility and to pursue activities of one&rsquo;s own choosing, regardless of disability.<\/p> <p>  The role of a personal assistant is to assist a person with a disability to maximise his or her independence through supporting him or her to live in integrated settings and access community facilities.  The personal assistant works on a one to one basis in the home and\/or in the community with a person with a physical or sensory disability.  A vital element of this personalised support is the full involvement of the individual service user in planning and agreeing the type of support and the times it is provided for him or her.  Supporting independent living must enhance the person&rsquo;s control over his or her own life. <\/p> <p>  Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states people with disabilities should live where they wish and with whom they wish; that they should enjoy a range of community support services, including personal assistance; that they should enjoy community life and its opportunities on an equal basis to non-disabled people and that they should not be subject to isolation or segregation.  The Department of Health and the HSE acknowledge the role of personal assistant services in supporting a person with a disability to realise the entitlements set out in Article 19.<\/p> <p>  Personal assistant services are accessed through an application process or referrals from public health nurses or other community-based staff.  Individuals' needs are evaluated against the criteria for prioritisation for the particular services and decisions are then made on the allocation of resources.  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with the prioritisation criteria and the level of resources available.  While the resources available for the provision of personal assistant services are substantial, they are finite.  Services are provided for those most in need in the context of the available resources and with consideration given to the other support services provided for the individual.  In the normal course of service delivery there will be ongoing reviews throughout the year to ensure that, if needs change, the service provided will address this change within the available resources.  An individual&rsquo;s personal assistant hours may be adjusted following a service review where service demand can result in one individual&rsquo;s service being reduced to address the priority needs of others with disabilities within the community.<\/p> <p>  Personal assistant services are, in the main, provided through a range of voluntary service providers.  Some 80% of specialised disability services are delivered through non-statutory sector service providers.<\/p> <p>  In the 2016 census 643,131 people self-declared that they had a disability.  Approximately 10% access specialist disability services consistent with their needs.<\/p><p>Therefore, many do not require specialist disability services.  The Department of Health and the HSE are committed to protecting the level of personal assistant, PA, services available to persons with disabilities.  Year on year from 2013, the HSE has consistently increased the number of hours available to people with disabilities.  In 2013, 1.29 million PA service hours were delivered to 2,057 people.  In 2015, 1.48 million service hours were delivered to 2,369 people.  In 2017, 1.51 million service hours were delivered to 2,470 people.  This represents an additional 100,000 hours in excess of the targeted number for that year.<\/p><p> The level of service delivered is varied to ensure that each client&rsquo;s needs are reflected; therefore there is no average agreed number of PA hours per person.  While many individuals are adequately provided for by their current level of support, it is recognised that many would benefit from more support hours.  The number of PA service hours delivered in 2017, broken down by number of hours per week per individual is as follows: 1,097 people received one to five hours per week, while six to ten hours, 11 to 20 hours, 21 to 40 hours, 41 to 60 hours and 60 hours or more were delivered to 570 people, 419 people, 241 people, 67 people and 65 people, respectively.  The need for increased services is acknowledged by the Department of Health and the HSE.  The HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to identified need in line with the available budget.<\/p><p> Transforming Lives is the programme of reform under way to realise the overarching vision for disability services, namely, \"to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported, as far as possible, to participate to their full potential in economic and social life, and have access to a range of quality personal social support and services to enhance their quality of life and well-being.\"  The national steering committee of Transforming Lives has agreed an outcomes framework following consultation with people with disabilities.  This framework will help the HSE in identifying what outcomes are being achieved by individual services and what further actions are needed across the disability services as a whole.<\/p><p> The role of PA services, as outlined, is an important element in meeting the objectives of a number of key policy directions such as the approach outlined in the congregated settings report and the new directions report.  As noted in the research, it is essential that there is co-ordination between Departments and Government agencies to provide a holistic approach across society to ensure full inclusion and self-determination for people with disabilities.  However, all publicly funded services must adhere to employment legislation and appropriate health and safety training must be in place to protect both the service user and the employee.  Garda clearance is also essential in ensuring the safeguarding of individuals.  Given the move away from congregated settings towards a community-based and inclusive model of service provision, it is believed that the demand for PA and support services will increase significantly over time.  The Department of Health and the HSE are committed to further developing the model in order that there is a consistency of approach and to ensure that the principle of self-direction is universally understood and applied.  The HSE disability services team at a national level will lead a process to achieve this in consultation with service users and service providers. <\/p><p> I hope that this information is of assistance to the members of the committee.  Myself and Ms Marion Meany, my colleague from the HSE, will be happy to answer any further questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018051600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Patsy Carr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Carr and invite Mr. Collumb to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018051600002#D00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526473800,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be invited here today to speak on personal assistant services to individuals with disabilities.  Not so long ago, others would have been invited to speak on my behalf and to give their opinions on my life and the service I receive.<\/p> <p>  What is a personal assistant service and what does it mean to me?  Personal assistant services allow people with disabilities to engage in everyday activities similarly to our non-disabled counterparts.  The job of a personal assistant is not just to assist with our care needs like eating, dressing and household duties but also involves assisting with daily activities at work, school, or college and provides people with disabilities a full, meaningful position in the community.<\/p> <p>  On the international approach to personal assistant services, the right to live independently and to be included in the community is set out in Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which we have recently signed up.  State bodies are obliged to put into effect measures to facilitate this right by ensuring that people with disabilities have access to a range of home services and other community supports, like personal assistant services, so as to be supported to live independently in the community.  <\/p> <p>  On the distinction between PA services and other services, there are some key characteristics of a PA service that make it different from traditional care services to people with disabilities.  First, the service user or the leader is the customer or employer.  They choose who works for them and the working schedule of that individual.  The service users customise the service around themselves.  The funding follows the person and not the service provider.  The person with the disability is not a passive recipient of the service but is engaged fully in the decision making process.  This is a key characteristic of any quality personal assistant service.  <\/p> <p>  In recent times, we have seen a move towards direct payments as a support method for people with disabilities.  Currently a draft report on the personal assistance package is before the Minister of State with responsibility for disability services.  This will hopefully provide more choice and control for people with disabilities and their personal assistance packages.  We in the &Aacute;iseanna Taca&iacute;ochta movement have also moved towards a personal assistant model.  We commissioned NUI Galway to carry out a report on how our model is working.  Some of its recommendations are highlighted in our presentation.  The report shows the positive outcomes when people have choice and control over their own funding and their personal assistance packages.  The key recommendations from this report are that every person with a disability in Ireland should be afforded the opportunity to direct his or her own personal assistant service and there should be a single assessment tool to evaluate each individual's right to a personal assistance package.  As movement from one CHO area to another has been very difficult and bureaucratic, this should be improved and finally, personal assistance packages and funding should be extended to providing aids and appliances for ourselves to live more independently.<\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms Eileen Daly, who will explain further how personal assistance packages have made our lives much easier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018051600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Owen Collumb"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526473800,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today.  I am going to speak about what I feel the future of the personal assistant service should look like and why I feel it is the best way forward.  For me, the key difference that a personal assistant service makes to my quality of life and that of my peers is that it expands beyond everyday care tasks.  While providing me with essential services such as personal care is absolutely essential because I cannot physically do it for myself, a PA service allows us to participate as equal citizens in society.<\/p><p>To put it crudely, my personal assistant is an extension of me and my arms and legs.  She empowers and enables me to carry out those tasks I cannot physically do.  As a person with a disability, having control of my budget and the knowledge and understanding of from where money comes and how it can be spent and the fact that I am responsible for paying my staff is liberating and empowering, although it assumes a certain level of responsibility.  Not everybody wants this or can deal with it, but for those of us who do, it is the way forward.  It expands my quality of life beyond the home and enabled me to take up education and go to university before pursuing a number of postgraduate studies.  Thankfully, it also allowed me to take up employment.  I have many personal assistant hours, but without them, my full participation in society would not be possible.  I work every day in the further and higher education sector.  Therefore, I work to ensure people with disabilities and others are given equal access to education in their day to day- lives.  Part of it involves assisting them to progress to employment.<\/p><p> I refer to the different policies and legislative measures in place.  The one that comes to mind is the comprehensive employment strategy.  Many people need a personal assistant to access employment.  Some do not, but a range of supports could be made available.  Some are available such as assistive technology and so on, but when some people with disabilities leave education, they cannot take up employment because they do not have the supports they need.  If they had access to a personal assistant service, it would allow them to take up part-time or full-time employment, if they wished.  That would have a knock-on effect on the Exchequer and the economy, which would be a win-win.  Personal assistants are employed and pay taxes; I am employed and pay tax, which removes me from the benefits trap.  If this opportunity was afforded to others, many of them would take it to enter employment.  However, it is also important to remember the needs of families.  Direct payments allow families to have more autonomy and control over the way they manage their budgets for children and young people with disabilities.  People's needs change throughout their lives.  The needs of a child differ from those of a teenager and evolve in adulthood.  It is paramount to have a personal assistant service from the point of view of accountability and transparency and measures need to be built in to ensure this is upheld.  Flexibility is required.  Research to which Mr. Collumb alluded shows that when people with disabilities and their families are given ownership and control of their own budgets, it is more economical for everyone and has many benefits for society as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018051600002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526473800,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to contribute.  I will deal briefly with the lived experience of having personal assistants.  I have a team of four personal assistants working with me and they assist with everything daily.  Previously I attended UCD to pursue a master's degree.  I had a team of personal assistants while I was doing so.  <\/p> <p>  It is important to note the difference between personal assistants and carers and home helps.  Personal assistants assist people.  They do not have to care for me, worry about me or look after my needs.  I interviewed my personal assistants and then employed them.  Three of them have been with me for ten years, while the other guy has been with me for five and a half years.  It is important for me to engage in daily activities.  For example, having completed the master's degree in UCD, I found a job as a disability officer in the Institute of Technology Tallaght.  I have been working there for 12 years and on a regular day get up at 6.30 a.m. to go to work.  I am one of those who gets up early to go to work.  My personal assistant stays overnight and washes and dresses me and does everything everyone else takes for granted.  I head to work at 8 a.m.  I live on the Merrion Road and on average it takes an hour to get to Tallaght.  The new personal assistant comes in at 8 a.m., drives me to work in my van and stays with me all day.  As Ms Daly said, without my personal assistant, I would not be able to carry out my role as a disability officer in the Institute of Technology Tallaght.  He assists all day in driving, preparing food, writing notes and so on, but I am still doing my job; he is there solely to assist.  He drives me home in the evening when another personal assistant comes to prepare dinner.  I then have some quality time for myself.  For example, I go on the laptop just like everyone else, but I need a person to assist me, say, to get me a drink.  If I need something, that personal assistant has to be there for me, as otherwise I would be unable to do anything because of my physical disability which is a form of spinal muscular atrophy.<\/p> <p>  I do not get up early at the weekend to go to work, but I engage in social activities.  I go out to meet friends.  My personal assistant drives me back and forth and, thankfully, I do not have to worry about public transport because I have my own van.  I am glad that I do not have to rely on public transport.  It all combines to give me a normal quality of life, just like everyone else.  The personal assistants know exactly what they have to do.  They know that they to not have to care for me and so on.  They are told this at the beginning during the interview process and are worth it.  That is why the personal assistant service is one of the most important issues.  People hear about personal assistants and wonder what they do.<\/p><p>They are not quite sure what a PA really is.  People often assume that my PA is my carer, but that is not the case.  I understand that people do not realise there is a difference.  When people refer to my PA as my carer, I explain to them what my PA does.  I explain that I have employed him myself on foot of an entire process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018051600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garry Toner","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526473800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for giving us all an opportunity to highlight the important role of PA services in supporting independent choices for people with disabilities.  The Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, is a national representative umbrella organisation with over 120 member organisations.  It works to make Ireland a fairer place for people with disabilities.  It is tough to follow the three preceding speakers because what I am going to talk about is really dry.  I will build on some of the ideas introduced by our colleagues from the Department and the HSE.  We are talking about the policy side, but the most important point we need to make relates to the power of the lived experience.  I stress that for many people with disabilities, PA services are critical if they are to be able to live independent lives of their own choosing in their own communities.<\/p> <p>  We have to appreciate that the term \"personal assistant\" is ill-defined and sometimes poorly understood by those inside and outside the disability sector.  It is exhausting for users and advocates of the service to have to continually redefine and explain what constitutes a PA service.  Recent DFI research has illuminated the fact that the general public cannot understand why an average person with a disability would need a PA service.  People tend to conflate the concept of a PA service with the role of a CEO.  They are very confused.  We have to take that slippage on board and try to expose it.<\/p> <p>  We contend that there is a poor understanding of the definition and delivery of PA services within the disability sector.  The kind of slippage to which I have referred is also found within the sector.  The understanding of PA can deliver from HSE or CHO area to HSE or CHO area.  Obviously, some people understand clearly that by providing a PA to a person, or by supporting the provision of a PA to him or her, such a person can be enabled to participate in his or her local community, attend university, attend social events and be employed, etc.  My colleagues have illuminated the benefits of PA services.  We must acknowledge that the significant slippage which happens with PA services often takes place between the role of PAs, home supports and so on.  We need to pay some consideration to the slippage between service types because it makes it difficult for us to qualify the true needs or requirements of a person from his or her PA service or home support service.  When a person gets a limited home support service but it gets tagged as a PA service, the conflation of the two can confuse the outcomes and the outputs that are achieved through this process.  This can often mean that people get a service which is not appropriate to their needs.  A person who requires a PA may be provided with an inhouse PA who is basically a home support, and then that gets conflated.  We need to understand the impact this kind of slippage has on the real lives of people with disabilities who depend on PA services.<\/p> <p>  The DFI would strongly argue that a well-resourced, person-centred responsive PA service must be understood as the cornerstone of any community services programme that supports people with disabilities.  It is important for us to remember that most people with disabilities do not live in congregated settings and do not depend on day services.  They are people like my colleagues who are present - they are in their own homes or in supported accommodation in the community and are doing their best to participate as equals in their communities.  The role of PA services is critical in that regard.  They need PA services to enable and empower them to continue to live as others do.<\/p> <p>  We suggest that when the committee is beginning to consider how the concept of PA services should be defined, it should take the time to consider Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which defines the true value of what a PA service is.  I suggest that the committee should use this as its guiding principle when it is considering what constitutes good PA services.  While I do not want to labour the point, I must say that this is not an alien concept to us.  It is well articulated in domestic policy.  The role of PAs is covered in the national disability strategy implementation plan, the Transforming Lives programme and the value for money report.  We have all bought into and accepted the key role played by PA services, but I think we need to look at the delivery of the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018051600002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. McCarthy to conclude so that members will have enough time to ask their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018051600002#F00300","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526473800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I will summarise what we are saying here today.  It is important to emphasise that we are looking for an appropriate funding stream to enhance the capacity of PA services.  Our colleagues in the Irish Wheelchair Association have estimated that the provision of 500,000 extra hours would enable almost 500 people to receive an additional 20 hours of assistance per week.  This has been costed at &euro;12.5 million, which is not a huge amount given that the total budget for disability services is &euro;1.7 billion.  The DFI is asking the committee to pay attention to the critical systems and systemic changes that are required to make the PA service a robust one.  We are seeking a common or shared definition of \"PA services\" across the system - in health, education or employment - so that the role of such services can be better understood.  We are calling for the introduction of a standardised assessment process that would create the right to access PA services across sectors like health, education and employment.<\/p> <p>  We are also asking the committee to pay attention to the huge anomalies in the data, which I have not had a chance to include in this presentation.  Much of our information on unmet need is out of date and does not truly quantify the level of need that exists.  I encourage the committee to consider how best to invest in data-gathering that enables us to truly plan for the delivery and enhancement of services.<\/p> <p>  The final point I would like to make is that greater investment will require greater oversight.  There is a need to ensure, as part of the oversight process, that the independence which is a critical part of the governance of PA services, and enables people to live lives that include risk-taking as part of daily life, is not snuffed out.  I have set out our key points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2018051600002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>All the presentations have been fantastic.

It is important to point out that when people feel that they have voice and are important and can contribute, it reduces the pressure on all the services, ranging from acute hospital services to the closed spaces or the congregated settings to mental health and psychiatric services.  It has a knock-on, ripple effect on everything.  A quality personal assistant service is needed.  It is not all about me, doing what I do.

The UN special rapporteur expressed a particular interest in the issue of child protection in the context of Ireland's ratification of the optional protocol to the Convention of the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and pornography and the Lanzarote Convention as well as child protection in the context of children's institutions, the Roma community and exceptions to 18 as the legal age for marriage, past illegal adoptions and children's rights in general.

I thank the Acting Chairman and  members for this opportunity to address them on the topic of childhood obesity.  The Teaching Council is the statutory professional standards body for teaching in Ireland.  We are responsible for promoting and regulating the profession of teaching under the Teaching Council Acts 2001 to 2015.<\/p> <p>  Research shows that obesity is a significant issue of concern for us in Ireland but we need to see it as one aspect of the overall health and well-being of children, young people and of us all.  Education has a vital role to play in this process but it cannot do so in isolation from other areas of public health and public policy.  It has taken time for the issue to reach these levels of concern and it will take time, along with co-ordinated and concerted effort, to reverse this trend in a long-lasting and sustainable way.<\/p> <p>  What do we know about the link between mental health and weight?  Professor Jim Lucey described it as a situation where poor mental health is both a consequence of, and contributor to, the problem of excessive weight.  In other words, they are closely interlinked.  It would seem prudent, therefore, not to seek to address one in isolation from the other.<\/p><p> In terms of the responsibility of teachers from a Teaching Council point of view, section 4.4 of the code of the professional conduct for teachers, which was prepared and published by the council, states, \"Teachers should: apply their knowledge and experience in facilitating pupils&rsquo;\/students&rsquo; holistic development.\"  Facilitation implies that teachers have an important role and responsibility in supporting learners in their holistic development, but that cannot supplant the responsibility which others have in the lives of those young people, namely, families, parents, the wider community, medical and health professionals, and young people themselves.  The council's criteria and guidelines for programmes of initial teacher education state, \"In all areas of study there should be provision for: - students' personal and social development, having regard to teachers' pastoral role.\"<\/p><p> The establishment of the Wellbeing for Teachers and Learners Group is an important development in terms of the need to address the overall well-being needs of all members of the school community at the same time.  Obesity is a challenge for the adult population every bit as much as it is for children and young people.  The Wellbeing for Teachers and Learners Group was established by the Irish Primary Principals' Network, IPPN, the National Association for Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, the Ombudsman for Children, the National Parents Council Primary and the Teaching Council.<\/p><p> In terms of the key message the Teaching Council wants to give to the committee, we are of the view that we need to tackle the problem of childhood obesity but this must be done as part of a holistic approach to the overall health and well-being of children, young people and adults.  Education has a vital role to play in that endeavour.<\/p><p> Teachers, as the leaders of learning in education, have a key role to play in ensuring that education plays its part in supporting individual and community well-being, but that role cannot be fulfilled sustainably in isolation from all the other professionals who work in this area.  Each of us has a responsibility in this area and each one of us can do a lot but we can do so much more when we work effectively together.  We know that is true from the experience of the Wellbeing for Teachers and Learners Group, which has demonstrated what can be achieved when all members of the school community work together to support each other's well-being.  The key point, therefore, in the context of tackling childhood obesity is to understand in the first instance that it is but one aspect of the overall well-being of the school-going population.  It is, in effect, a whole-of-person issue.  Such an issue calls for a whole-of-system response.  We need to join the dots.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Ruairc and invite Mr. Browne to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#D00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":559,"content":"<p>The National Parents Council Post Primary, NPCpp, is grateful to the joint committee for the opportunity to make this opening statement on behalf of parents of students attending post-primary schools.  We believe that to address this matter we must act on a societal basis and that Government agencies, educators, families and communities must work together to educate children, their parents and the society we live in.  We must teach an understanding of the dangers of obesity and how we can move towards addressing these issues to effectively deal with this very real problem.<\/p> <p>  One statistic that springs to mind from Professor O'Shea's research, which relates to socioeconomic disadvantage, is that 12% of three year olds in socially deprived areas are obese, while 4% of three year olds in better off areas are obese.  There is a massive disparity by the age of three.  We know that consumption of sugar sweetened drinks, SSDs, is associated with obesity and we believe that well designed taxes can be effective in discouraging consumption of these drinks.<\/p> <p>  Last year the childhood obesity surveillance initiative, COSI, was published.  It was carried out by the HSE in conjunction with the national surveillance centre at UCD.  The findings indicated that we still have a significant way to go in creating environments in homes, schools and communities where every child has the potential to grow and develop healthily from birth into adulthood.  I will highlight three of the ten steps identified by the HSE.  They are: the reformulation of food products to reduce sugar, fat and salt levels; reducing exposure to marketing and promotion of foods high in fat, salt and sugar along with fiscal measures such as the sugar tax and; increasing access to free drinking water in schools.<\/p> <p>  Looking to the future, we believe that, together with the necessary steps to curtail the consumption of problem foods and beverages we must educate society by working together towards a common goal.  We suggest that schools and community venues can host informative parents' evenings to educate parents on how to reduce the use of sugar and problem foods in the home.  That would help parents to make better choices in the home which would hopefully guide their children in turn to make better decisions when eating during the day.  Tackling childhood obesity on a united front will, we feel, be most successful in guiding children and parents to make better choices.<\/p> <p>  Serious consideration should be given to a ban on vending machines that contain problem foods and snacks in schools and public places where children congregate.  At the very least in these areas, problem snacks in vending machines should be replaced with healthier options.  All schools should provide healthy options in their school canteen or tuck shop.<\/p> <p>  More physical activity after school and in free time should be encouraged and catered for.  Adults in our communities should lead by example.  We should avoid the car and walk to school in the mornings, where safe to do so, or head out for a family cycle in the evenings or at weekends.  Facilities to pursue such outdoor exercise must be made available in all communities.  We should strive to ensure that we assist educators to inform and encourage children and families to follow healthier lifestyles.  We need to provide advice on healthier lunches and menus at school and home, education aids and sessions for children and parents about nutrition, facilities and infrastructure for exercise and encouragement towards physical activity as a social and family entertainment option.<\/p> <p>  What we do in homes, schools and communities to build healthy habits for all children and families is vital to our efforts to prevent childhood obesity.  These are the critical habits that will help those children who are a healthy weight now to stay a healthy weight and those who are overweight or obese to achieve a healthier weight as they grow and develop.<\/p> <p>  Stigmatisation is something we must take into account.  We must bear in mind that children are sensitive beings.  It is important that guidance and advice on obesity and healthy living is understanding and caring.  Those on which NPCpp are focussed are also young adults and we must be careful, therefore, not to just dictate.  We must involve children and their parents in the process.  Leading by example will be more useful than enforcement at this age.  Care should be taken to ensure that any obesity prevention work that is carried out in schools and society does not stigmatise overweight children or introduce children to thoughts of negative body image.  The focus should be on the health of the children and not their weight.<\/p> <p>  Although the focus of the NPCpp is on post-primary students, we suggest that the root of the obesity problem may often begin in earlier years.  We believe that the best solution can be achieved through a holistic plan being put in place to assist educators, families and communities to address this serious issue together.  The NCPpp believe that existing green spaces, parks and playing fields must be preserved for leisure purposes and not closed or sold by agencies or Departments for non-leisure purposes.  All schools must have physical education, PE, facilities and all classes must be timetabled for PE each week.<\/p> <p>  We suggest that the use of state healthcare and education resources in the battle against obesity would be advisable and productive.  Prevention is better than cure.  We should focus on the health of children from an early age with funds being invested in health education at preschool and primary schools as well as post-primary facilities.  That would change lifestyle and health in Ireland for the better.  The NPCpp is keen to play its part in the development of a plan and strategy towards a healthier society in which children can live and learn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Geoffrey Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Browne very much for his presentation.

Obesity is considered to have reached epidemic proportions in both adult and child populations in recent decades.  According to figures provided by Growing Up in Ireland, 19% of children aged three years are overweight and 6% are obese indicating a strong need for early intervention well before children begin school when obesity levels reach one in every four.  Furthermore, four out of five children in the Republic of Ireland do not meet the recommended Government physical activity guidelines of at least 60 minutes per day.<\/p> <p>  Primary teachers endeavour to create a healthy environment in schools and encourage children to make healthy lifestyle choices around diet and physical activity.  PE and social personal and health education, SPHE, both form key parts of the primary curriculum by means of which teachers seek to educate pupils about healthy lifestyle choices and behaviours.  A minimum of one hour of PE a week is recommended for all primary school pupils although many primary schools do not have the facilities and equipment to implement fully the PE programme as outlined in the curriculum.  A commitment by the Government is required to ensure that all schools are provided with both indoor and outdoor PE facilities so that the programme can be implemented in full.<\/p><p>Despite the under-resourcing, schools are committed to the promotion of healthy lifestyle choices for pupils through policies such as healthy lunches, although the success of such policies depends on parental co-operation.  Schools also engage with a range of innovative whole-school initiatives with a view to encouraging a positive and healthy school culture.  Some examples include walk on Wednesday, WOW; cycle on Wednesday, COW, active flag; active week; and walking bus to name but a few.  The INTO cautions, however, that the escalating workload in schools makes ongoing engagement with the various initiatives challenging.<br\/><br\/>The few schools that are fortunate enough to have kitchen facilities also store and disseminate healthy snacks to pupils through initiatives such as Food Dudes.  The INTO believes that it is regrettable that more schools do not have kitchen facilities particularly in disadvantaged settings where pupils are provided with breakfast clubs and school meals.<br\/><br\/>There is no doubt that schools have a very important role to play in tackling obesity, but schools do not operate in isolation.  Children are very much influenced by behaviours and practices that prevail in their home environment and the broader community.  Schools are only one of several layers of the environment that affect children&rsquo;s behaviour.  It is important that policymakers break the cycle of focusing solely on schools to reduce the childhood obesity epidemic.  Different approaches are needed that consider broader influences from the family, community, media and the food industry.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, a study in the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>suggests that relying solely on school-based programmes aimed at preventing obesity in children is unlikely to have much impact on the childhood obesity epidemic.  The study provided children with a year of extra physical activity sessions as well as a healthy eating programme and cookery workshops involving their parents.  It concluded that while school is an important setting for supporting healthy lifestyles, wider influences such as families, local communities and the food industry may have a greater effect.  It is also important that further legislation be enacted to control and curb advertising of junk food.  Tackling childhood obesity is a public health priority demanding a cross-sectoral approach.  Continuing with isolated educational preventive approaches can never hope to greatly impact on the obesity epidemic.<br\/><br\/>It is important to highlight that primary schools can contribute to children&rsquo;s understanding of the importance of creating healthy environments and leading an active life.  Schools alone, however, cannot solve or prevent the problem of obesity.  A co-ordinated action, including a number of Departments, parents, schools, community-based organisations and healthcare providers, will be required in order to support families, address food poverty and to tackle the many factors contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s obesity problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McCafferty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":563,"content":"<p>The TUI would like to thank the committee for this opportunity to make a submission on the topic of tackling childhood obesity.<\/p> <p>  The health of young people is a critical matter for society as a whole as well as for the health and education sectors.  In this regard, childhood obesity is a serious problem as children in Ireland are in the upper range of being overweight according to a study by NCD Risk Factor Collaboration.  It is clear from the same study that the problem in Ireland is growing rapidly with a nine-fold to ten-fold increase in the number of children in Ireland classified as overweight since 1975.<\/p> <p>  Safefood Ireland estimates that one in four children in Ireland is either overweight or obese.  The rate of obesity internationally in 17 year olds is approximately 20%.  Frighteningly, a quarter of three year olds in Ireland are overweight or obese.  Obesity is clearly linked to multiple other health difficulties and to changes over time in lifestyle.  However, it is important to make a number of key points on the respective roles of the health and education sectors and of society as a whole.<\/p> <p>  There appears to be a significant correlation between childhood obesity and the increasingly sedentary, isolated and online recreational patterns of children.  These patterns cannot be addressed or modified solely by or through the education system.  All of Irish society has a responsibility to react to this public health problem.  The Growing Up in Ireland study, for example, found that &ldquo;online time was significantly higher among 17\/18-year-olds who were overweight or obese.&rdquo;  Safefood Ireland notes that the average amount of time spent by preschool children watching television each day is 2.2 hours and that the proportion of students walking to school has halved since 1981.  The behaviours reflected in these findings have their origins in the home.  Therefore, in the first instance, parents have an overarching responsibility to safeguard their children&rsquo;s health and well-being by way of intervening positively to modify these behaviours.<\/p> <p>  Schools, of course, also have a responsibility, for example, by delivering the appropriate PE programme to all students.  That programme can serve a very useful role as part of society&rsquo;s response to the childhood obesity problem.  Safefood Ireland recommends that children engage in 60 minutes of physical activity per day.  Some, but not all, of this can take place in the school setting.  Schools need to be able to access appropriate physical education facilities in order to support a structured PE programme.  Regrettably, far too many schools do not have access to adequate PE facilities.  Furthermore, many schools are concerned about a litigious culture in Irish society.  Logical but regrettable responses to that litigious culture include schools being so concerned about accidents in the schoolyard that some have instigated limitations on students&rsquo; physical activities, such as running in the schoolyard.<\/p> <p>  Fear also creates a societal climate that hinders physical activity for children.  For example, children organising their own play appears to have become a rarity.  Furthermore, many parents are concerned about allowing their children to play unsupervised in the street.  Society must also examine the fact that obesity in some instances constitutes an eating disorder that is symptomatic of an underlying problem regarding greatly diminished self-esteem.  It is therefore possibly a mental health issue as well as a physical health one.<\/p> <p>  A recent radio broadcast in Ireland suggested that a response to childhood obesity would be for schools to regularly weigh children and that teachers may be better placed than doctors to tell parents that their child is obese.  The TUI finds that suggestion extraordinary and bizarre.  Evidence shows that schools regularly weighing children can lead to further self-esteem issues for those children.<\/p> <p>  Issues such as eating disorders or self-esteem require schools to be able to call on the necessary support services.  It is unfortunate that career guidance services, for example, have been reduced over the last decade.  The recent partial restoration is welcome but full restoration of the service is required.  Schools also need to be in a position to call upon other support services but, unfortunately, those services have also been under significant pressure recently, despite the best efforts of the staff involved.  In the event of a student presenting with an eating disorder, the guidance counsellor will work with the student but also refer the matter to the relevant general practitioner.  This work and referral would take considerable time out of the guidance allocation and the follow-up also takes considerable time.<\/p> <p>  There are legitimate concerns about the limited participation of students in senior cycle of post primary in PE.  On occasion, examination subjects have been prioritised and PE provision has been desultory.  This limitation must be tackled as there is evidence that those who fall away from physical activity at this crucial time may develop patterns of inactivity that have lifelong and detrimental health consequences.  School culture needs to be informed by a concern for health-promoting physical activity.<\/p> <p>  Schools have responsibilities in the area of health education and they carry out their responsibilities to the very best of their abilities, not just in specific curricular programmes like social, personal and health education, SPHE, and PE but also through a whole-school approach to healthy living.  However, parents, guardians and families clearly have the primary responsibility in fostering values and practices relating to health.  Indeed, Article 42 the Constitution cites the family unit as the \"primary educator\".<\/p> <p>  The TUI again thanks the committee for this opportunity to make a submission and we would of course welcome any questions members may have.  The problem of childhood obesity is of deep concern to the TUI and its members.  Schools have an important role to play in the area but responsibilities also fall to parents, communities, the health system and a number of Departments.  The great American educationalist Larry Cuban once said that when society gets an itch schools get scratched.  Schools have responsibilities but so too does society.  Schools are neither the cause of all societal problems nor the solution to all of society&rsquo;s ills. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":564,"content":"<p>It is a bit difficult to follow all those very comprehensive and insightful presentations.  My approach will look at second level schools and what we regard as institutional issues that need to be addressed in the contribution of schools to tackling childhood obesity.<\/p><p> I hardly need add to the analysis that has already been presented to the committee that schools are just one part of a social project to address this issue.  It is a privilege to be here.  We have appeared before the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on many occasions in recent months.  One of the messages that is coming through from the stakeholders in education involves the complexity of the issues facing young people.  We are not so sure if schools are now the only institution in society that can manage it.  The committee is getting that message today.  I laughed when Mr. Duffy referred to the idea of schools weighing children.  This originated in Great Britain.  It shows the way complex social issues such as childhood obesity and public health issues can receive a very opportunistic political response which says that teachers should weight kids and that this will suddenly address the issues.  That type of response is not in the Irish tradition, thank God, but we should be very wary of it.<\/p><p> To return to the focus of my presentation, one analysis we need to do regarding childhood obesity is that it is a public health issue.  We have voluminous evidence in the Irish context of the relationship between socioeconomic status and health status.  We also have significant evidence from home, the EU and the OECD regarding the extent of relative poverty in Ireland and the way children are disproportionately affected, so we have this complex relationship between socioeconomic status, opportunities and child well-being, including physical health.  This shows the complexity of the issue.  However, the good news is that interventions do work and work particularly well for poorer children.  It is always important to be realistic when we critique systems.  Yes, interventions work and work best for poorer children but they also work best when they are introduced early and consistently.<\/p><p> From a second-level point of view, one of the very disturbing findings from the 2013 landmark ESRI research on physical activity among young people was that at primary level, students demonstrate pretty good patterns of recommended activity but this drops massively at second level.  We really need to look a bit further at why this is happening.  The ESRI research in 2013, and later in 2015 and 2017, found that 90% of schools are not providing the recommended two hours per week of physical education.  The research asked the schools why this was the case.  The reasons were that 64% of schools said they did not have space or facilities, which is a really significant issue which I will discuss in a moment, while 23% of schools said they did not provide the recommended two hours because of staffing issues - they did not have enough staff.  The issue of supervision of students opting out of PE also arose regarding the question of who was going to supervise them.  Finally, an issue arose with which we are all very familiar, namely, the academic nature of our curriculum.  A total of 21% of schools said that curriculum choices meant that they did not give the time.  The 2015 Lifeskills survey found that only 32% of schools had healthy eating policies.  A total of 27% of schools had vending machines.  I am not saying this to criticise schools - that is not my job - I am saying it to give some of the facts.  A total 27% of schools said they had vending machines.  It is a huge income stream for schools.  While we may have very good policies, etc., we also have the hard reality that schools need income streams.<\/p><p> The other point I would make is that the current framework for health promotion in schools dates from the 1990s and really needs to be reviewed at this stage.  Since then, we have had the 2013 guidelines for second-level mental health and the well-being programme in the junior cycle curriculum in 2015 so we now see huge fragmentation of policy.  There needs to be a coherence in policy.  We need to bring these policies together.  One of the things we say in second-level education is that everybody wants the whole school approach but without being cynical, quite frequently, the whole school approach ends up being everybody's business and nobody's responsibility.  Who is actually going to drive this, evaluate it and make sure it happens?  Of course, the ASTI will make the point that the impact of austerity on our schools has been corrosive with regard to leadership structures in schools.  We found repeatedly in our research that what is happening in the absence of leadership structures is that everything is devolving to the classroom teacher so it is nobody's responsibility.  Classroom teachers teach French or science.  They do not necessarily have the skills or ambition to engage in these broader projects.  It is a matter of achieving this balance between what I would call the policy and the implementation gap.  We need to look at the institutional factors that are keeping that gap wide in our system.<\/p><p> I would make two recommendations to this committee that could be brought into the policy space.  First, we have some fantastic new school buildings.  We have amazing canteens and fantastic PE facilities - not just the gym and football pitches.  The new PE syllabus for the leaving certificate, which can examined as a leaving certificate subject, has a range of sports and activities such as track events, volleyball, all sorts of ball games with rackets and proper gym facilities rather than just a PE hall because many young people are into the gym and being fit.  Our new schools are models in this regard but the sad fact is that most of our schools are pretty old institutions with poor infrastructure.  I suggest that the Department of Education and Skills needs to conduct an audit of the actual state of facilities for PE, sports and games in schools, particularly older schools, so that we have evidence for policy.  Again, I come back to this policy implementation gap and rhetoric.  At the end of the day, rhetoric really cheeses people off.  As legislators and scrutineers of the Estimates and the budget, members need to start looking at capital expenditure budget for schools and what is actually going into improving facilities that will lead to better capacity in schools with regard to physical activity, etc.  There is a lot more to say but we need to hear from the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":566,"content":"<p>Any submissions or opening statements made by the witnesses to the committee this morning will be published on the committee website after this meeting.

From speaking to teachers anecdotally, there seems to be a flip side to PE.  Obviously, I take on board the point that facilities might not be there but there seems to be a push back relating to some culture or subculture regarding the lack of interaction with PE on the part of students.<\/p><p>Have any studies been done on the reason for that?  What I am hearing is anecdotal evidence from friends of mine who are teachers and other people I meet in schools when I visit them.  Is that coming from a culture of electronics, games and telephones or is it something more systematic?  Is it a subculture or is it some sort of psychological effect?  I am not saying that is a blanket situation but it seems that, more than ever, a certain cohort is pushing back against it and making excuses such as forgetting the gear and so on.  Why is it making excuses?  Is it to do with insecurity around body image, fashion or whatever?  I do not know.  I am just speaking anecdotally on that.<\/p><p> The third issue I want to raise concerns supervised or structured play, particularly in primary school.  There is a certain age at which children are not allowed run around or whatever.  I am probably being simplistic in terms of the role.  I do not work in the area but I would like to get the witnesses' thoughts on that because that could be extremely restrictive in terms of children's development, risk taking, seeing what it is like to play with a ball and all those life skills one learns as a child.  I do not have any qualification in that area.  I started out as a teacher many years ago.

Ms Leydon spoke about the gathering of the information.  I attended the BT Young Scientist &amp;amp; Technology Exhibition two years ago in which students from my local school, Portumna community school, participated.  They had done that scope of research into the facilities that were available in both urban and rural areas and had the breakdown on that.  We might bring them in before the committee to let us see that breakdown because they have done the heavy lifting, so to speak.  They did that research in transition year, TY.  They took a serious interest in it.  They wanted more physical education and decided to find out the barriers that were holding back girls and boys from doing it.  The point Ms Leydon made earlier is a valuable one.  I invite her to answer the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#G00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I will be brief as there is a good deal of expertise on this side of the table.  There is a good deal of research on the gender issue.  That research is not new; it goes back 20 years or more.  Unfortunately, gender is such a complex social issue that things do not change rapidly with it.  The Deputy is quite right that one of the areas affecting this is body image.  It comes back also to the physical spaces.  Most schools do not have showering facilities.  I refer to the fetish of body image now for our young people and girls.  We have spoken in other committees about the sexualisation and commercialisation of adolescence and childhood, therefore, body image is critical.  That is the reason the role of educators, who are very professional people in working with young people, is equally critical.  We need research but, more to the point, we need to be able to facilitate teachers to address those issues.  How do we do that?  We have good continuing professional development, CPD, and good school policies.  It is like good architecture.  When we have good architecture, good things happen.  When we have good facilities such as changing rooms and mirrors to allow students put on the bit of make-up they are allowed to wear in school, it is much easier for girls to be enthusiastic.<\/p> <p>  In terms of teachers weighing students, I always say at international level that we are lucky in Ireland that our politicians do not take slick approaches to education policy.  I refer to the idea in Britain that teachers would weigh a child.  If I may be personal, I went to Weight Watchers once and it was a horrible experience because I had to stand up on a scales, someone weighed me and internally made a judgment about me.  Can one imagine doing that to young people in front of their peers?  At least the Weight Watchers person had some capacity to give me advice.  What teacher will advise a young person on lifestyle?  We all know that eating is not just about hunger.  It is about many other issues.  I would call that, and no insult to the former UK Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, as a \"Govian\" approach to education which we should resist with every effort here.<\/p> <p>  On the audit of physical education, PE, facilities, the new PE syllabus is exciting.  Principals and teachers have come to me and said that they would love to have taken part in the pilot project but they did not have the range of physical facilities to ensure they could do the different strands.  That is an area where legislators can make a significant impact because this is quite simple.  If schools do not have them in their own situation they should at least be in a position to share those of other schools.  That is the dimension of policy we have to examine.  We need to start sharing expensive resources within our school sector.  I will conclude to allow my colleagues a chance to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their insightful questions.  I want to make two main points.  On the idea of boys being fitter than girls or more interested in certain sports, a good deal of research indicates that boys, particularly teenage boys, are more interested in contact sports than girls.  What is interesting in the survey that is happening now, as I am sure the members are aware, is that two new specifications for the leaving certificate were finalised recently.  One is a non-examination framework for students who have been doing PE and the other is an examination subject of PE.  What is particularly interesting in the context of Deputy Mitchell's question is that both allow a good deal of flexibility about the type of sports and physical activities that are done as part of those specifications.  It is possible then for schools to be able to tailor what they do to the interests of the students concerned within the context of the facilities that are available to the school.  For example, if it was a single sex school, it could be tailored to the interests of the students concerned, within reason.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the flip side to PE, I agree with Deputy Neville that there are issues around the interaction.  If I may digress briefly, Professor Emer Smyth tells a very good story of when she was doing some research into how students found the curriculum.  She was interviewing some students who were studying home economics, which in the context of obesity is a serious and important matter.  She asked a group of examination students what they were doing in home economics and they told her they were studying how to make mayonnaise but they asked why they needed to know how to make mayonnaise because it is not-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Mr. Duffy.

That is the reason PE sometimes ends up suffering, so to speak.<\/p> <p>  What is interesting in that context is that the revised junior cycle, and particularly the well-being aspect of that cycle, may go a considerable way towards dealing with some of those issues.  One factor within the revised junior cycle that will be particularly helpful is the 300 to 400 hours of well-being of which 200 hours are for PE.  It was always the intention that schools would provide 200 hours of PE but it has always been very difficult for schools to do that.  The well-being programme is at least giving schools the opportunity to be able to do that but I have to throw in the proviso that that is assuming the facilities are available to the school in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Mitchell for her questions.  To come back to the point about weighing children in primary school, we are already hearing increasing evidence from our teachers about anxiety in very young children and the impact of self-esteem issues and mental health in general, including test anxiety.  That is almost a physical test for children so we would have grave concerns about that.  We also believe it would be outside the professional remit of the role of the teacher.  It is becoming a case of off-loading the work of other professionals on to teachers, which is happening more frequently.  We have a good deal of concern about the damage that practice might have on the unique relationship between a teacher and their pupils.<\/p> <p>  Mention was made of girls resisting the high impact sports in PE.  We are lucky in Ireland that we have a broad and holistic curriculum.<\/p><p>That includes the physical education, PE, curriculum where there is much variety such as aquatics, athletics and dance movement - it is not just games.  In saying that, the NCCA is reviewing the primary school curriculum.  Our current curriculum was developed in 1999, making it one of the oldest curriculums in Ireland.  The INTO welcomes a review of the PE curriculum and looking at more ways for it to appeal to girls.  <\/p><p> Pupils absenting themselves from PE and from sport was also mentioned.  That is a challenge and I imagine even more so in post primary.  The INTO respects that parents have the right to withdraw their child from any aspect of the curriculum.  It is not something we encourage as teachers for many reasons.  It creates significant logistical challenges for schools at a local level when parents withdraw their children.  Who will supervise that child when he or she does not partake in PE?  <\/p><p> On facilities and infrastructure, and limitations on recreational grounds in school, we see that happening more and more and particularly in city schools.  Recreational spaces are becoming ever more limited.  It is not a widespread practice but we have heard anecdotal evidence of no running policies in school yards.  We are operating, unfortunately, in a culture of litigation and boards of management are very exposed as a consequence.  Nobody agrees with it.  The Department of Education and Skills may need to look at something like a minimal recreational space with every school.  This comes back to property prices as well.  Schools are selling their recreational spaces for funding, which is regrettable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McCafferty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I will address a couple of points.  Ultimately, the National Parents Council is not looking to move its responsibility on to other agencies but we advocate that there has to be a combined effort here from all the stakeholders.  It has been mentioned that fewer children are walking and cycling to school and it is for obvious reasons.  I come from in the countryside in Donegal and there are no cycle routes and there is much more traffic on the roads.  It is not safe in many instances for children to walk or cycle to school.<br\/><br\/>On play at school, I almost lament back to my days in school.  We got to play in school at break times and lunchtimes - we could climb trees and fall on one's hunkers.  I understand because of the risk of litigation now why schools limit that type of activity.  All we are doing, however, is creating an environment for our children where the visibility of and access to activities of a physical nature is being continually eroded.  I will not start on the impact that gaming and electronic devices are have had on our young people.<br\/><br\/>I come to the question from Deputy Mitchell in respect of the weighing of children.  We have not surveyed parents on this but before I give my answer I will refer back to a recent article in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  It was in my report but I did not read it out.  The article was on how the Dutch are tackling childhood obesity.  It refers to how one of the ways it is being approached is by having children screened by local government once a year.  Their weight and height are measured confidentially.  Bar the statistics, I do not really see any added benefit.  It is almost akin to when a person goes to the doctor and he and or she is told that a few pounds could be lost.  People realise that before they go into the doctor in the first place.  It is the same perhaps with our children.  We definitely would not advocate schools weighing children;  perhaps health centres might, with professionals there who can issue good advice on healthy living habits to children and parents.<br\/><br\/>There was also a question on whether parents would attend informative education seminars on healthy living and eating.  I believe they would but with the caveats that the training would need to be delivered by qualified dieticians and people in that area and also that the timing of training would not between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., when most parents are either working or tied up in other activities.  All too often we see these types of events geared towards - dare I say it - the people providing the information.  It suits their timeframes rather than the intended audience.  <br\/><br\/>I refer to fast food outlets.  In Professor O'Shea's report, interestingly, he also noted that in areas of socio-economic disadvantage the ratio of healthy food outlets and supermarkets to fast food outlets is skewed towards the latter.  We need to be mindful of the change in lifestyles and simple economics.  It is often cheaper and more convenient to run to the local chipper.  Parents are dropping kids off at 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., particularly in the cities, and maybe not getting home until 8. p.m.  We can tackle that through education and maybe through work environments providing a better work-life balance for parents.

I want to focus on Deputy Mitchell's question on the weighing of children.  Counterintuitively, if not counterproductively, it goes to the heart of the matter.  We are responsible for a register of 100,000 teachers across primary, post primary and further education.  We have a governing board and a Teaching Council which represents nearly all stakeholders in education.  I am pointing those facts out because by default we take a whole-of-system response across education.<\/p> <p>  We would recoil at a human level from the suggestion that children be weighed in schools.  There is a sense that it is a no-no.  From a more objective policy response, it would miss the wood for one tree - it would miss the overall issue.  Ms McCafferty referred to the risk of other professionals being seen to offload their work onto teachers.  If anything, teachers want to connect better with other professionals.  They do not want to take on their work and the other professions do not want to offload it either.  They want to understand better the perspectives that the other professionals bring to bear in the interests of children and young people.  Teachers care - they care deeply about the children and people in their care.  They understand also that they have a professional remit in this space that needs to be very carefully watched.  <\/p> <p>  As we said in our opening submission, it is a whole-of-person issue that requires a whole-of-system response.  Ms Leydon mentioned in the opening statement the importance of policy consistency given the source of the suggestion in the first place was in England, where there is not a teaching council.  Policy consistency has been an interesting issue, to put it mildly.  One of the reasons a Teaching Council was established in Ireland was to try to support greater policy consistency so that there is less back and forth and people know where they stand - teachers and students alike.  We would be against that suggestion for the reasons I have outlined.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":583,"content":"<p>Deputy Neville wants to come in again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#H00400","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I have a quick question.  I am going to brainstorm a bit, if the committee will indulge me.  I am going back to 2008 or 2009, if I remember correctly, and the advent of Wii technology.  Can people remember Wii technology and computer games?  I do not know if anyone does but someone may.  The smart phone is taking everything over and it is leading to people not interacting, engaging or becoming physically active.  Wii technology, however, came out in 2008 or 2009 and this was the silver bullet to address anybody who may not have been into sport - he or she could interact with computers physically.  It was done for a number of years but it seems to have dropped off the radar, perhaps because the advent of the smart phone has made it redundant.<\/p><p>Have there been any studies around using this technology given that children and young people are so interactive in using it?  I heard on the radio two or three days ago about how some people are talking about making the sport of playing computer games an Olympic sport.  There is a vast industry around it.  People come to watch others play sporting computer games on the television.  This subculture is emerging throughout the globe.<\/p><p> Have there been any studies around bringing back or using Wii technology?  Instead of taking the view that all electronics are bad, we could ask how to take and use the language and manipulate it to get what we want.  One thing struck me about Wii technology when we worked with it in university.  We used it for music.  It was possible to make music with Wii technology through using the movement of our hands.  The same thing could apply to children at school, especially those who may not be interested in, or may not think they are interested in, combat sports.  It may be a way of generating interest.  Have any studies been done in this area?  It is simply a brainstorm question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#H00500","speaker":"1328","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I actually know all about the Wii as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#J00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>It is old now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#J00300","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":588,"content":"<p>It is.

Given the advance of artificial intelligence and correct use of heuristics and so on, I foresee no technical limitation.  I have observed my children at home.  They range from eight to 18 years of age - I have three in between those brackets.  They sit and talk to their friends using the technology but they are not active while using it.  The only parts getting exercise are their thumbs and perhaps their index fingers.  Ironically, all the technology includes apps to measure how many steps a person walks in a day, yet they are almost part of the cause of our difficulties and lack of physical exercise.<\/p> <p>  I am not aware of the studies Deputy Neville asked about.  September will see the introduction of computer science as a senior cycle elective subject.  Part of the curriculum includes artificial intelligence and the impact technology has on society as a whole.  There is more money to be made by technology companies in having us sitting rather than exercising.

It would be useful for the committee to look at the work of the Physical Education Association of Ireland.  The website is <i>www.peai.ie<\/i>.  The association is a fantastic professional teacher body and it has done amazing work.  It has a vast evidence base on good practices, etc.  The most recent conference did a great deal of work on the technology dimension.  It would possibly be useful for committee members to invite the association before the committee.<br\/><br\/>I am taking a materialist approach to this.  While technology may enhance the enjoyment of physical education in schools, research demonstrates that schools are not providing the two hours required per week.  That is primarily because of space and facilities and secondly because of staffing.  These are capital investment issues since schools do not have the space or teachers to do this work.  A school might have one physical education hall for 900 pupils.  How can a school manage that?  It simply does not happen.<br\/><br\/>I agree that we should be positive about technology in terms of how it can enhance the learning experience.  It can also make teaching more creative and exciting and more in tune with the culture of young people.  However, unless we provide the infrastructure and the institutional environment, we are only going to waste money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Moira Leydon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Deputy Neville is right to say technology does not have to be the enemy.

If there is a curriculum review in primary schools, we will have to see how we bring that in.  I will offer an anecdote from my classroom days.  We used YouTube for yoga in the classroom.  There was no way I could compete with the animated movement of the children.  They were so enthused and engaged and the technology allowed us to do it in the classroom.<\/p> <p>  I wish to bring one statistic to the attention of the committee.  Many schools do not have PE halls, especially primary schools.  This is evident where I come from in Donegal.  An INTO study found that 80% of schools, especially in rural Ireland, do not have PE halls.

It comes back to schools having rules about no running in the yard because the surface of the yard is in such an unfit state that it could be a hazard for children tripping, etc.  It all comes back to funding.  There is certainly a need for an up-to-date audit on school facilities.  It comes down to the inability to operate during inclement weather in Ireland.

This runs on from Deputy Neville's question and I will direct it toward Mr. Duffy.  How can parents and educators work together to minimise sedentary behaviour in young people?<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Ms Leydon on a matter mentioned in her presentation.  Can she explain what a leadership post would involve and what responsibilities the post would have? How should we frame a policy document that would require an equally robust implementation framework?  Do the deputations understand my question?  There is little value in having a great policy or framework if it is not implemented properly.  We have to look at the structures that we will be putting in place.  If we do not weigh and measure and operate with flexibility around children, how will we ever get a real approach to this?<\/p><p>This needs to be done through early intervention.  It should be happening in preschools.  We were talking about it happening in our health centres.  The reason some commentators use the whole idea of weighing and measuring flexibility when taking measurements is that there would then be a proper framework for addressing the problem.  Where do the witnesses think such interventions would be best positioned?  Would they welcome professionals coming into schools to do this or would it would be better carried out in public health centres?  It has to be addressed somewhere along the line because we have an epidemic and we need to gather the data and research.  I am not advocating for this to be done in schools but asking about the elephant in the room.  When I refer to measuring I am talking about children's flexibility, which affects their ability to participate in sport.  Sometimes children feel that they are not able to run properly, which holds them back from doing a particular form of sporting activity.  While they may feel they are no good at anything, they may have a condition.  They might be growing so quickly that their tendons have not caught up, which holds them back in respect of running.  I refer to that sort of idea.  <\/p><p> Where do the witnesses think such an initiative would be best positioned?  Perhaps that is a question for Mr. Browne.  It is hard for teachers or those advocating in this area to answer.  I would love to see where it could sit because we will need to start gathering the data.  We cannot just gather data on the basis of one school here and one school there or one location here and another location there.  We have to have a broad sweep in order to gather the data.  If Professor O'Shea and his team are to do their job and do it well, they have to start gathering data and getting results.  We must have benchmarks to identify whether we are making improvements.  Where do we start gathering the data?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#J01200","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>On the Acting Chair's question about parents and educators working together, there are some very interesting and useful ways in which that can happen.  In regard to the whole issue of healthy lifestyles, which might include physical education, PE, healthy eating and general activity and anything from walking to school to what one eats, there are some useful areas to consider, particularly in the context of a whole-school approach.  It is about the board of management devising policies that are practical for both parties and the wider school community also getting involved.  I already mentioned the implementation of well-being.  That is not only part of the curriculum but its implementation is also a matter for the board of management of the school.  The board can give support on that issue.<\/p> <p>  It has not been possible for many schools to provide the 200 hours for PE they ideally should provide, not only for reasons relating to facilities but also because of a lack of teachers and timetabling issues in some cases.  The well-being measure takes that to another level.  It is about the board of management working together with all the stakeholders involved, including the local community, county councils, teachers, parents and, in the case of many of our schools, the education and training boards, ETBs, to ensure 200 hours of physical education and a qualified PE teacher are available.  In many schools, particularly the larger ones, two or three qualified PE teachers may be required.  In many such schools only one PE teacher has been available thus far.  <\/p> <p>  As I am sure the committee is aware, the demographics of post-primary education over the next few years will be very interesting.  Between now and 2025, when we will hit the peak, we are looking at somewhere in the region of 50,000 to 60,000 extra students.  It depends on which demographic model one looks at.  Approximately 50,000 to 60,000 extra students will come into the post-primary system in the next few years.  That gives us an opportunity in terms of teacher recruitment but, as I am sure the committee is aware, there are serious issues around teacher supply.  Much of that relates to pay for new entrants, which has been an issue since 2011.  The board of management and the whole school can work together on that issue.<\/p> <p>  The board and all the stakeholders involved - parents, educators and so on - can work together to lobby for extra facilities, whether in the school, the local community or, ideally, both.  They can also work together to promote healthy lifestyles generally, which includes healthy lifestyles in the school.  As my colleague from the National Parents Council Post Primary stated, there is an issue with vending machines and, more precisely, what is being sold in them.  It is also about ensuring physical education is available and students can take up valuable programmes such as home economics to learn about healthy eating.  It is about schools being able to provide the PE programme at leaving certificate, whether under the non-examination framework or as an examination subject, and promoting sport to students.  <\/p> <p>  It is also about the role of extra-curricular activities in schools.  In many cases, extra-curricular activities are supported not only by teachers but also by parents who often do a great deal of valuable work in supporting teams.  It is about making sure that students and children feel supported when taking part in extra-curricular activities and that schools, through both the educators running the teams and the parents who often provide valuable support, are provided with the opportunities to engage in extra-curricular activities.  It is not only about the teams.  It is also about the students who enjoy playing sports but may not be very good at them.  In my own case, I loved playing sports but I was dreadful at all of them.  My parents consistently gave me the message that playing sport was important and that if I enjoyed sport, I should do it regardless of whether I was captain of the team, because there was no chance of me making the team, never mind being captain of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I will make a point on the earlier discussion about vending machines.  Some of my colleagues stated these machines are an income stream in schools.  I would extend that to beyond schools.  Ironically, we also see them in swimming pools, gymnasiums and so on.  I often think they are the most popular machine in some gyms.  They are an income stream even outside schools.  They certainly should not be in public pools.  The first thing someone buys after swimming should not be a fizzy drink and bar of chocolate.  We could look at those but I fully understand that they are income streams.<br\/><br\/>On schools and parents working together, this is already the case.  Most schools, both at primary and post-primary level, have parents' associations <i>in situ.<\/i>On providing training about healthy eating and so on, the National Parents Council Post Primary would be delighted to act as a funnel or to organise such training for parents' associations across the country, many of which we represent.  I should include the caveat that this would be subject to resources being made available by the relevant Departments.<br\/><br\/>To return to the thorny issue of weighing children, which was raised by the Acting Chairman, in this day and age children are intelligent, as are some adults, although maybe not myself.  I do not see why we could not weigh children at home and feed that information into a secure online extranet.  It is not exactly rocket science to weigh oneself and see what height one is.  That would remove a certain amount of the stigma.  Obviously, consultations would be required in cases where professional advice is needed, but if the purpose was purely to see the state of the nation, we could throw together a website which people could log in to and enter their vital statistics.  Thinking outside of the box and holistically, there are ways of doing that.  However, I would again advise caution in respect of schools carrying out this function.  As I noted in my opening statement, we need to be mindful of stigmatising children.  We need to advocate that this is about their well-being and health.  From what I can remember of the relationships and sexuality education class - although I do not remember what it was called back then - I was cracking up down the back afterwards and asking what the boys thought of it.  Children talk at school and we need to be mindful of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Geoffrey Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":600,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#K00400","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>The Acting Chair raised an important point.  The goal of any activities, actions or policies emerging from the deliberations of the committee, or of policy more broadly, in respect of data is to get sufficiently reliable data to ensure that policies are informed by evidence and will have the impact they are designed to have.  It is clear from the presentations this morning that we certainly have sufficient data to know that we have a problem in Ireland.  Ms Leydon referred to the voluminous research on social and physical health.<\/p><p>We have sufficient data to also know there is a possible risk of overstating the extent of the problem.  The statistics I have received from Professor Donal O'Shea indicate 12% of group five socio-economic children are obese.  I know 12% is 12% too many but 88% are not obese.  There is certainly a risk of over-focusing on physical weight as the issue to the exclusion of all others.  As Professor Jim Lucey stated in his research, mental health is both a contributor to and a consequence of excessive weight.  There is almost a vicious circle aspect to it.<\/p><p> Before we start gathering additional data, we need to be quite clear as a society as to what we are trying to achieve.  Schools have plenty of experience of professionals coming in from the outside, such as psychologists, speech therapists and dentists.  This will be nothing new to them as such.  In its document on promoting a healthy school, the HSE highlighted two key facets of successful intervention in this space, namely, collaboration and integration.  Teachers want to collaborate with other professionals.  Rather than crossing professional boundaries inappropriately, they need to ascertain what are their responsibilities and what are the needs and then to focus on that.  That has to be the key element.  We can get the data but we need to look at the data we have already and build on that in collaboration with each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018051600002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":603,"content":"<p>When one has a whole-school approach to any phenomenon, whether it is to guidance which is a statutory function, or to health promotion, one needs teams, collaboration and integration.  One needs someone to lead that team.  One needs a person to say this is where our school is at in terms of health promotion and that we have five key areas to sustain, promote and get students engaged in.  That does not happen unless one has a team.  Leadership in this dimension is about having enough leadership positions in our schools where one can lead the programme.<br\/><br\/>Having adequate leadership leads to a sense of ownership.  I coined the phrase earlier, &ldquo;everybody's business, nobody's responsibility&rdquo;.  That is serious because if no one feels responsible, it does not happen.  Leadership teams, however, are responsible and accountable.<br\/><br\/>The other area is benchmarking and the Acting Chairman was absolutely right to use those words.  We have policy but we need to know what is happening.  It might sound heretical for a teachers' union to say we possibly need another evaluation model.  We do not have any evaluation model which looks at the way the health promoting school programme is implemented.<b><\/b>We have many evaluations for subjects, programmes and a new model for child safeguarding.  Given the Acting Chairman's statement about an epidemic and critical social challenges, do we now need to look at a framework for evaluating how schools are managing with the health promoting schools programme?  It is important to add that that evaluation in schools is aimed at school improvement.  It is not aimed at blaming them.  That is how one benchmarks.  For example, how is pastoral care done?  Is there a canteen in the school?  Many kids do not eat breakfast for social reasons.  The chipper is a far nicer prospect than a mundane sandwich in a school canteen.<br\/><br\/>Leadership is about taking ownership.  We need to know what is happening.  Accordingly, we need to look at evaluation and good benchmarks.  The Minister for Education and Skills has introduced an excellence fund in the Action Plan for Education, the purpose of which is getting activities going around key educational objectives.

I am deputy director general in charge of strategy and planning for the HSE.  I am very grateful for the invitation to attend this meeting of the Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care.  I am joined today by three colleagues.  Mr. Pat Healy is national director for community strategy and planning.  To my left is Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, national director for community operations, and to Ms O'Connor's left is Mr. Jim Ryan, who is head of operations within mental health.<br\/><br\/>I am very pleased to appear before the committee today to speak to members about the future of mental healthcare and, more specifically, the structures that have changed within the HSE in recent months.  I will begin by giving an overview of those changes that have taken place since 1 January.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>We have a reform programme within the HSE, which is focused on how we work and the structures we work within.  As part of building a better health service, the HSE is implementing changes to the way in which we are organised, particularly in the context of the appointments last summer of John Conaghan as chief operating officer and of me as chief strategy and planning officer.  More recently, in April 2018, Dr. Colm Henry took up the role of interim chief clinical officer and we, as three senior managers within the HSE, are now working in a triumvirate manner in line with the new ways of working we are seeking to take forward as an organisation.<br\/><br\/>With effect from the beginning of January, the roles of a number of existing HSE national directors have changed to facilitate the separation of those activities relating primarily to strategy and planning from those relating primarily to operations and delivery.  In this regard, Anne O&rsquo;Connor is now responsible for the delivery side of the house in terms of her role as community operations and Pat Healy is responsible for community strategy and planning.  Dr. Philip Dodd remains in his role as national clinical lead for mental health services.<br\/><br\/>These and other changes have been signalled for some time in the context of the journey to transform the way in which we deliver services in order to build a better health service and strengthen governance and accountability arrangements.  This is fully in line with Government policy and the recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which refers clearly to the need for the HSE to be re-orientated to a more strategic, leaner national centre.<br\/><br\/>Since the establishment of the mental health division in 2013, there have been tangible service improvements for patients and clients with an increase in the percentage of funding going towards mental health from the overall health budget.  Since 2013, mental health expenditure has increased by 22% from &euro;709 million to &euro;867 million.  I assure members that all funding allocated to mental health by Government is being spent on mental health services.<br\/><br\/>In recent years, there has been an increased recognition of the need for an integrated approach to the design and delivery of health services to people with mental illness and other co-morbid illnesses.  The organisational changes now being implemented within the HSE are designed to build on successes to date through a separate, though integrated, approach to strategic planning, operational oversight and the delivery of mental health services.  Having developed a strong delivery system through the introduction of community healthcare organisations and hospital groups, it is important that the role of the centre within the HSE changes to one which supports and enables the delivery of services as opposed to actually being involved in the day-to-day delivery of those services.<br\/><br\/>In her role as head of community operations, Anne O&rsquo;Connor is supported by a dedicated operational lead for mental health who is with us today, Jim Ryan, working closely with a dedicated planner for mental health, John Meehan, from community services strategy and planning, that is, on Pat Healy's side of things.  In addition, these specialists and their teams will work alongside a number of other teams and networks with a focus on integration.  The establishment of the chief clinical officer role within the HSE also brings an additional clinical focus on mental health, working closely with both my side of the house on strategy and John Conaghan's side of the house on operations.<br\/><br\/>Mental health services in Ireland are integrated with primary care, acute hospitals, services for older people, services for people with disabilities and a wide range of community partners.  Services are provided in a number of different settings including health centres, day hospitals, inpatient units and sometimes in the user&rsquo;s own home.  Over 90% of mental health needs can be successfully treated within a primary care setting, with less than 10% being required to be referred to a specialist community based mental health team.  Of this number, approximately 1% are offered inpatient care, with nine out of ten of those admissions being voluntary.<br\/><br\/>Regionally, the nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, have responsibility for the delivery of community healthcare services within their respective geographical patches.  While the chief officer of the CHO has overall responsibility within each organisation, the head of service for mental health, in conjunction with the executive clinical director, is responsible for the delivery of mental health services across the respective CHO areas.<\/p><p>As members will be aware, forensic mental health services operate on a national basis.<\/p><p> These organisational changes are intended to achieve the following benefits: an appropriate organisational focus within the HSE centre on strategy and planning and oversight of operational delivery; strong and visible clinical leadership at the most senior level; robust planning arrangements including assessment of needs, inequalities, outcomes and access to services; a more structured approach to the identification of issues with a clear focus on the development and implementation of plans for improvement informed by service user experience and best practice; effective integration of services at national, regional and local levels; and robust performance management and service improvement arrangements across the system.<\/p><p> In relation to service users, the organisation changes are intended to achieve improved access to services, improved flow through services from mental health to primary care or to acute hospitals and returning to the community and more consistent support to service users to ensure they receive the right service, at the right time, in the right place, by the right team.<\/p><p> To conclude, I highlight the point that complex system-wide change, such as the type that I have outlined, will take time to complete and it is vital that we maintain stability during the transition phase.  Notwithstanding the changes under way, there is a firm commitment within the HSE to the ongoing delivery and development of mental health services for all age groups. <\/p><p>I look forward to answering any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":615,"content":"<p>The committee are aware that this structure was already in place and it is not new and that similar structures to the one outlined were in place prior to 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#D00200","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526473800,"counter":616,"content":"<p>May I clarify something?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>If Mr. Sullivan does not mind, we will hear from the committee first.

With the greatest respect, I think I speak for many members when I express my disappointment and frustration.  I understand that Mr. Sullivan was invited to this committee on 17 April and we received a submission yesterday, less than 24 hours before the meeting.  Before my election to the Oireachtas, I ran a student council with second level students and they knew that the agenda and submissions to the meeting came in a week earlier, and they were children aged 12 to 18 years.  That is deeply frustrating.  I was watching out for the submission over the last five days as I wanted to study it and I do not think the three page document that we received is good enough.  Within the three pages, as Deputy Rabbitte has noted, there is nothing into which one can sink one's teeth.  There are phrases such as \"maintain stability during the transition\", it tells us that over 90% of mental health needs can be successfully treated in primary care, when from previous meetings we know that we only have 37 general practitioners in Kilkenny, 41 in Kildare, 38 and Longford and there is a crisis in this area.  I do not think that it is acceptable.<\/p> <p>  Given previous evidence that dedicated resources are needed within mental health to drive forward policy, will Mr. Sullivan explain why the decision has been taken to remove the national director for mental health?<\/p> <p>  In his submission, Mr. Sullivan pointed to an increase of 22% in mental health expenditure since 2013.  That read to me like the kind of answer the Minister would give to me in response to a parliamentary question or something I would see in a Government party manifesto.  Where is that money going?  Over the course of this committee's work, we have heard of the huge numbers of staffing positions being unfilled, how people remain on practically indefinite waiting lists and it was reported yesterday that in just one month, there was a 10% increase of young people waiting for services for over a year.  If there has been an increase in funding over five years, I would like to know where it is going and, more importantly, the reason it is not being felt by service users.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Sullivan stated there have been tangible results from the increased spending.  What are they?  Who will have the authority to set priorities for the mental health expenditure across the country?  <\/p> <p> How will the structural changes address the issues in recruitment retention and pay, as well as the lack of resources and poor working conditions?  It is no good saying that we have increased spending and changed HSE structures when we do not have the front-line staff to provide care.  Who in the HSE will provide the dedicated leadership on delivering and improving mental health services?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Sullivan stated that the \"changes now being implemented within the HSE are designed to build on successes to date\".  Will he list some of those successes?  We have 2,500 children waiting for their first mental health appointment.  The child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, continue to operate at just 50% of recommended staffing levels.  A recent report found that some third level education institutes have indicated a 41% increase in students seeking counselling over the past three years.  There is now a six-month waiting list for counselling services in many institutions.  When he speaks of successes to date, Mr. Sullivan will find many service users are not experiencing successes.<\/p> <p>  Last year, the Sl&aacute;intecare report recommended that 10% of the overall health budget be spent on mental health, the 12 year old A Vision for Change document recommended 8.24%, yet currently we are at 6%.  Is 10% achievable?  When can we reach 10%.  Should we aim higher?  What will the HSE do to secure this budgetary allocation?  Whose responsibility is it to get us up to best practice standards of 10%?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#D00500","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I think that the Deputy has thrown out a few questions.

I apologise if the statement was not as comprehensive as the Deputy had hoped.  It is only the second such committee which I have personally attended.

If after the meeting, more information is required, I will be happy to forward it on if it is helpful.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why the decision was made to restructure.  I will rehearse again what the restructuring looks like, and I might have a chance later to revisit the question of its timing.  The organisation has restructured at the highest level in having clinical, operations delivery and strategy and planning arms.  It is commonly reported and felt by staff in the organisation that one of our challenges is too great a focus on day-to-day delivery of services and fire fighting and not enough focus on medium and long-term planning, prioritisation, needs assessment, identification of inequalities and so on.  Notwithstanding that John Meehan and I came into posts last summer, which was the beginning of the new arrangements, the structural changes that have been put in place at the start of this year with Ms O'Connor and Mr. Healy moving into their respective roles was entirely consistent with that.  It is to retain absolutely priority in the needs of mental health service users and making sure that we respond to those needs, as well as the needs of other users, but to recognise that that is a very broad agenda and that it might be helpful, certainly as we transition towards an arrangement where greater power is devolved to the provider organisations, to have a clear focus on the strategy and planning side of things and a clear focus on the delivery side of things.

On the committee's interim report which was mentioned by the Chairman, mental health services are not delivered in a bubble.  There is huge reliance on primary care services in meeting the bulk of needs of mental health patients.  When we ran services up and down, it became difficult to plan for the silos being run to actually work out the opportunities to provide more seamless care for patients.  We now have a structure in place that allows for that path in the oversight of all community services, everything from primary care services through to mental health and older persons' and disability services on the planning and strategy side of things.  Ms O'Connor has responsibility in working with Mr. Ryan and others for making sure services are delivered.  As I mentioned, Dr. Philip Dodd is solely involved on the mental health service line, given his particular professional background.  We have and will continue to have a very clear focus on mental health services, but we will have a really clear focus on understanding the needs of patients and making sure we will put in place appropriate evidence-based services to respond to their needs.

In Portumna the day hospital is considering changing its structure at present whereby a patient will get a visitation for half an hour once a week.  That is why I want to know how the money is being spent in the community.  It appears to me that we are doing a great deal of box ticking here, but where is the money going back into the community?

I would like to have a breakdown of how money is being spent in the community.<\/p> <p>  While we might be putting in place many valuable services that are really needed, there are many dependent people in the community who need reassurances that their day hospital or day house will not close, because that is the message people in the community are getting.

I had a number of questions but we will have to reverse back to the start.  I do not know if the witnesses are aware that a motion on the duty of candour was discussed in the Chamber last night.  It was about accountability, responsibility and transparency in the system and particularly in the HSE.<\/p><p>Listening to Deputies Neville and Rabbitte and a number of other speakers, it is like - and I have said this before - emptying the Red Sea with a bucket with no ass on it.  Every time we come in here to ask questions, we do not get answers.  I will go right back to the start.  If this is something new that is supposed to change, as we have heard the Chairman say already, it is something old that changed to something new and that is back to something old again.<br\/><br\/>I will go back to what we call a duty of candour: responsibility, accountability, where the buck stops and whose name is at the end of the docket.  My questions are very simple, and I would like if the witnesses could give me names in response because this is very important and they are the persons to whom we need to talk.  First, who appointed them?  I do not want to hear the Department of A, B, C or D; I need a name.  Were these positions advertised?  I need transparency on that.  Was there an interview process?  Were there decreases or increases in salaries or anything like that?  Who carried out the whole process from start to finish?  That is one little group of questions.<br\/><br\/>Going back to what Deputy Neville said a while ago about accountability and transparency and where the money is being spent on new services, I am sure the witnesses are right, but we are not seeing it at the front.  Two weeks ago tomorrow I was in Clonmel.  There were 300 people at the meeting, and to hear the stories of non-existent mental health services would absolutely break one's heart and soul.  A 60 year old man has to find his own way from Clonmel to Kilkenny.  While his paperwork - his own documents, his own life story - are being taxied from Clonmel to Kilkenny, he finds his own way.  Once he was released from Kilkenny, he had to thumb his way back home.  There is certainly something wrong when it comes to services.  That is only one point.  Mothers are revoking their sons' bail because the poor young fellas are safer in jail than being left out in Tipperary as the services are not there.  It is not about who said what; the most important thing is that people around this country are really suffering.  I am trying to be as polite and diplomatic about this as I can.  As for the knock-on effect on each person and family of this, they are not statistics.  They are human beings.  I cannot reiterate this enough.  There are schools where it is now normal for kids to hear every four to five weeks of another parent of a child dying by suicide.  It is not the children.<br\/><br\/>There is a line in a recent reply Dr. Shari McDaid of Mental Health Reform received from Tony O'Brien about restructuring the establishment of the mental health division.  Can any of the witnesses explain what the former head of the board meant when he said this?<\/p><blockquote>Having developed a strong delivery system through the introduction of Community Healthcare Organisations and Hospital Groups, it is important that the role of the centre changes to one which supports and enables the delivery of services as opposed to actually delivering services.<\/blockquote><p>This does not mention improvements or outcomes.  It certainly does not mention patients.  The point I am trying to make about this is that if we need to do something right, we must start right.  This is not a personal attack on any of the witnesses.  If they could answer those questions, I would be very happy.  In the last paragraph on page 2 of Mr. O'Sullivan's opening statement, it states &quot;to build a better health service and to strengthen governance and accountability in the service&quot;.  I am not being disrespectful, but the majority of speakers that have spoken before me are not getting any answers.  All I am getting is frustration.  When it comes to figures and moneys, the increase in expenditure on mental health since 2013 is from &euro;709 million to &euro;867 million.  If one were to do the maths, between 2013 and 2018, it is an increase of &euro;1.32 million a year.  Is that an overall increase within the mental health services or is that &euro;1.32 million over the whole health service, after which the mental health section is pulled in?  I am fairly confident in one of the CHOs from one of the budget reports that we did get that &euro;447,000 was spent on taxi services in one area last year.  There is no accountability, and &euro;447,000 is a lot of money.  I understand files can be transferred but, Janey Mac, it can surely be done some other way.  It seems to be about spending money to make money for someone else.  There is no such thing as spending money on the patients for a better outcome to save society stress and cost.  Do the witnesses understand where I am coming from?  I am frustrated.  I would be very happy if they could answer my questions.  I will be very disappointed if they cannot because, to be totally and brutally honest with them, if we cannot have accountability and transparency here, we are absolutely wasting our time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#G03500","speaker":"1279","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":778,"content":"<p>If Mr. Sullivan is relatively new, is he the appropriate person to answer Deputy Buckley's questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#H00200","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526473800,"counter":779,"content":"<p>I believe I am.

Sometimes we just cannot give straightforward answers to the questions asked because there is no straightforward answer to them.  However, it would be wrong for him to assume that this is us trying to be clever or obtuse or to talk around the subject.  We are not.  Equally, it would be wrong for him to think we do not absolutely, categorically have patients at the absolute centre of all we do.  Sometimes there is a risk with conversations like these that we get lost in the undergrowth of very small detail and miss some of the bigger picture.  The bigger picture is the point I made earlier.  The question is whether &euro;15 billion is enough to provide the health and social care services that the population of Ireland wants and needs.  I am too soon in the job to reach a definitive view on that.  I see areas where there is definitive pressures within the system.  Doctor numbers are definitely light in Ireland compared to elsewhere in Europe.  I am not sure at present whether &euro;15 billion is enough.  Even if we park that as an issue, I think the proportion of spend on specialist mental health services is too low within that overall side of things.  The manifestation of this is that within particular areas of service - and CAMHS is a key one, clearly, but there are others as well - the extent of patient need exceeds our capacity to respond to that need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":788,"content":"<p>I beg Mr. Sullivan's pardon.

I am not happy about that being the position.  I suggest it might be a fruitful course of action to ask if the committee is satisfied that we are doing everything we can with the resources we have to maximise capacity to respond to that need or not.  I do not doubt there are opportunities to spend money differently or for the staff we have to be more productive than is sometimes the case.  Will that, in one leap, bring child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, capacity to the demand for CAMHS such that patients, as they should, have timely access to high quality services across the country?  It will not.  There are not enough resources in CAMHS to provide the timely access that is required.  We can all spend a long time working out whose fault that is and whether expenditure of &euro;400,000 on taxis fixes that.  We will have a more productive discussion, hopefully one that the committee will be less frustrated by, if we take it up a couple of levels.  If those fundamentals are not right and the &euro;15 billion is not where it needs to be, or the subset of resources directed to specialist and non-specialist needs of mental health patients is not where it needs to be, aside from all the wider societal factors that are driving those needs, then it does not matter how I or other witnesses respond to the committee's questions.  It does not matter what finance information systems we have because it is still cutting a problem.  We just have a better understanding that it is a problem as opposed to fixing it at source.

We need to invest in young people's mental health in schools, communities, primary care and all the other areas we talked about to improve that.  CAMHS will never be able to cope with the demand that is coming its way unless we get involved earlier in stopping that flow.  It is about all of the things the EU task force looked at, including building resilience among young people in Ireland.  That needs investment.  The conversation on mental health and young people has to start there.<\/p> <p>  We have to focus our specialist services on people who really need them.  None of us is happy that we have so many referrals coming to CAMHS.  When we look at them recently, we found that up to 40% of referrals are not really for children who need CAMHS.  These are children who are being referred to CAMHS because we do not have other options available.  That is why we are investing in psychology and primary care and looking at how we work with other funded agencies such as Jigsaw and SpunOut to see how we can change the conversation around mental health.  We will not meet the needs of our sickest young people if we are trying to manage this massive demand that is inappropriate for a service of that kind.  CAMHS is a specialist secondary mental health service.  It should not become a catch-all for any young person with a mental health difficulty and none of us would want our children to attend a psychiatrist and specialist mental health service just because there is nothing else.  That is a really important conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":797,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  I wish Mr. Sullivan all the best in his role.  It is my intention to work with him to try to improve services and to be of assistance by pointing out system failures.  I have no doubt about the commitment of any of the witnesses to their roles.  Sometimes, capacity and the sheer volume of what needs to be done makes it difficult.<\/p> <p>  On recruitment, the lack of a sufficient number of staff across every CAMHS team was pointed out to us.  Very few teams are at full capacity and in many of them two or three key roles have still not been filled.  For example, if a psychiatrist is not appointed, then everything further down the chain slips.  Referrals continue to be made upwards but the person who makes the key decision is not in place.  Every part of the team is key but if there is not a full team, it is very difficult to make progress and clear the waiting list.  I believe there is an issue with the recruitment agency in the HSE, the national recruitment service, NRS.  Work needs to be done to improve the operation of the NRS to ensure staff are at least in place and full teams are operating to try to clear the backlogs.<\/p> <p>  Does what the witnesses have laid out in the statement coincide with what they would call a clinical care pathway for any child or adult with mental health issues?  For me, dealing with people, that is what I would like.  If a parent comes in with a child who is having difficulties accessing the services, I would like a flow chart showing that care starts with the general practitioner, GP, and setting out where the person goes from there, and so on up the line.

We hope the GP would know which services are available locally.  The problem we have - this was correctly pointed out by Deputy Brassil - is that teams are not fully staffed and we do not have enough teams.  The child and adolescent mental health services operate at a little over 50% of what A Vision for Change set out.  We are not going to have the gold-star CAMHS using that model.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to the fact that in Ireland we have a way of working that is tricky.  Our policy says that every young person should have a named consultant.  There may be a view that this ties us up in knots sometimes because the consultant has to be involved in every child's care.  What happens if a child does not have a consultant?  Other team members might be available.  Our system is not similar to that in the UK, where it is not about having a named consultant.

One thing we have done relates to putting standard operating procedures in place for our CAMHS teams.  I can send on the link to the Deputy.  Essentially, the website shows the pathway of care for a young person from the GP.  It not only refers to what happens in CAMHS but also sets out the alternatives available to the young person and the family in advance of going to the CAMHS team.<br\/><br\/>One other thing may be of value.  On Monday, we launched a series of videos to outline the pathway for young people who are attending CAMHS.  The <i>yourmentalhealth.ie<\/i>website contains a link to 16 videos that have been produced between the HSE and <i>SpunOut.ie<\/i>to give a description using plain simple English of what a person can expect when attending CAMHS, what he or she can do in advance of attending CAMHS and if the person is on a waiting list.  We have done this with the involvement of young people as well as parental involvement.  I recommend the site for any committee member, Deputy or Senator.  It would be useful to look at it because it is a simple and easy way for people to understand what they can expect.  I believe that will prove beneficial.  The standard operating procedure is helpful from the point of view of explaining what CAMHS does and does not do.

One challenge is to look at that.  As recently as this morning we had a meeting to look at how we can create a different approach.  We are keen to build on some of the work we have done with the approach around youth.  Again, the conversation is around youth mental health rather than simply CAMHS and that is relevant.

It is frustrating because they can finish up but find it difficult to get back to the place where they were treated and got well the previous time.  Work needs to be done to look at how people who have had previous history and a different starting point can return.  CAMHS has experience.  This is what I find when dealing with constituents.

I realise it comes across that we are trying to score points and so on but it is not about that.  We are simply trying to get greater understanding.  Many of us believe the system is broken and needs to be fixed.  What we are trying to do is come up with avenues to get there.  We need to work together in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The last speaker referred to frustration with the structure of the system.  I believe that frustration is shared by all of us.  Part of the difficulty is that we build a relationship with a person in a particular area and then the person is moved.  Simple things like trying to get through by telephone or email can be difficult when the number or the email address changes and so on.  These are simple things.<\/p> <p>  We seldom get cases where everything is going great.  The members of the deputation know all of this.  No one comes to our offices with a simple question.  We get the problem cases or those who do not fit in and so on.  At some stage I would like to hear more.  The HSE representatives have referred to improved access to services, more consistent support of service users and so on.  I would like to hear the more on this at some stage.  I am unsure whether they will have time to elaborate today but that is one conversation we need to have.  What improvements will materialise?<\/p> <p>  I imagine some simple things could be fixed.  I will offer an example since examples are probably the best way to illustrate the point.  I was dealing with a woman who has two teenage children in services.  She has never got respite when the two teenagers were in at the same time.  She can only get respite when one is in, so she does not really get any respite.  Is something like that difficult to fix?  I am unsure if the HSE representatives have ever come across something like that.  It should not happen in that way.  An appropriate remedy would transform the life of that woman.  That is only one case.<\/p> <p>  Access to services is another area that needs attention.  We come across children in need of speech and language therapy.  One person was waiting three years for speech and language therapy and another three years for grommets.  We are discussing the mental health of the child and parents.  If a family is waiting that long for the services it has a major impact on the children.  Are these children seen as a priority for the HSE?  I am looking to hear from the HSE representatives today rather leaving on a sour note of them-and-us.  Clearly the structure is not working at the moment and a new structure will be in place.  What are the priorities of the HSE in the next 12 months?  Can we bring back the deputation in 12 months' time &ndash; provided the committee still exists &ndash; to hear what has and has not worked?  That would be helpful for us, especially for people at home who are watching.  They are probably screaming at the television asking why we did not ask this or that question.  People want to know.  They hope the system will change for the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#K01100","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526473800,"counter":810,"content":"<p>The first part the question was around user engagement.  That has been a priority for us.  We actually carried out listening exercises with over 2,000 people in 2014 to find out what service users and their families wanted from our mental health services.  We went to approximately 28 locations nationally.  The feedback was clear.  It was about service users being more involved and having a greater say in their services.  With that in mind we established a reference group to look how we could hear the voice of service users.  This can be tricky.  We cannot simply pick someone to be the voice of service users.  We looked at how to develop a structured approach to service user engagement.  From all of that, we appointed Liam Hennessy, who is the national head of mental health engagement.  He heads up a function to look at how we work with service users and their families.  Then, we moved to appoint a head of engagement in each of the nine community healthcare organisations.  Mr. Hennessy sits on the mental health management team.  The heads in the local areas sit on the mental health management team.  Their job is to ensure that service users are at the centre of everything that goes on.  There is no quick fix to all of this.  It is taking time and it will continue to take time.<\/p><p>What we know now is that if we have service users sitting at all those tables and as part of all of those discussions and we look at everything through a recovery lens, we have a much better chance of meeting the needs of what people want and what is meaningful for them.  We also moved from that into employing peer support workers, which is the first time that has happened in Ireland.  These are people with lived experience of mental health who now work and are employed by the mental health services.  They work with other members of multidisciplinary teams to support people in their recovery.  All of those things are being viewed very positively.  We have very positive feedback from service users around that.  We are rolling that out.  To date, we have 28 peer support workers in the country and the number is growing.<\/p><p> I could not agree more with what was said about our approach to children in general.  There will be an impact on the mental health and educational achievements of any child waiting for speech and language therapy or other service.  Within the disability space we are looking at how we can improve services for children who have disabilities and other conditions through the development of children's disability networks.  We have a very exciting initiative that we are progressing with the Department of Education and Skills around the employment of in-school therapists in one part of the country.  We are employing speech and language therapists and occupational therapists to work in schools with teachers, looking very much at the early intervention piece.<\/p><p> There is a number of initiatives across the disability space that will complement our work because as we know the reality in mental health services is that many children present for CAMHS who have had experience of speech and language difficulties as well.  There is an overlap there.  We also have the assessment of need process in disabilities as well.  All of those are fairly joined up and our challenge is to look at how we can address what is often a very significant waiting list for children to receive services and there really is a demand capacity issue.  We just do not have enough to meet the demand that is now emerging in various parts of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":812,"content":"<p>I hope that information is helpful to Deputy Crowe.

He was before the committee previously when we started this process.  He was at some of the first meetings.  I also wish Mr. Healy well in his new role as national director with responsibility for community strategy and planning.  All the witnesses have an unenviable task ahead of them in the very important work they need to do.<\/p> <p>  I will try to avoid repeating questions that have already been asked.  In his opening statement, Mr. Sullivan referred to tangible service improvements.  We appreciate that more funding has been provided but at 6.4% it is far less than it should be.  I understand that 11% is the guideline generally worldwide.  Could Mr. Sullivan outline the exact tangible service improvements to which he refers?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Sullivan also spoke about the fact that there was too much focus on day-to-day activities and that the model is being changed.  He said we need to focus on long-term planning and change.  I agree with the need for long-term planning in mental health provision but we cannot take the focus off day-to-day operations, which is every bit as important.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Sullivan also spoke about integration with primary care services.  I agree with that approach.  In a previous meeting we learned that in an ideal world counselling services would be available in a primary care setting, but that does not happen in many areas.  I agree there should be integration but I fear we are a long way from it, and while we are waiting to get to that stage there will be some gaps.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Connor mentioned that we need to look outside of CAMHS and at working with the other groups that are there at a community level such as Jigsaw.  There is no Jigsaw service in my county but we are anxiously awaiting one.  Other such community groups that are in Kildare include SpunOut and Hope (D) which are doing really good work.  I agree that the intervention needs to be at that level.  I welcome what Mr. Ryan said about the videos and CAMHS.  I look forward to watching the videos and pointing people in that direction.  Parents and schools contact all members and they feel the elusive CAMHS is the answer to all their problems and it is not.  We know that is the case.  It has worked well for some but many people experience a lot of frustration in accessing CAMHS.  It would be helpful if there was more clarity about what it can and cannot do and what other extra supports are available.<\/p> <p>  I have a specific question on the restructuring.  We were given evidence previously that dedicated resources are needed within mental health to drive policy.  I read Mr. Tony O'Brien's letter on the restructure but it makes no sense to me to remove the national director for mental health.  We must have somebody within the HSE to provide dedicated leadership on delivering and improving mental health services around the country.  At a national level who is going to deal with the delivery of mental health services and who will have the authority to consider the different priorities and give direction to the various community healthcare organisations, CHOs?  I expect Mr. Ryan currently has that responsibility but I might be wrong in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made previously to the dedicated and separate national mental health budget.  There is a fear that if the direct authority goes from a national director then the budget would also go and the setting of priorities and expenditure across the country would be affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#L00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526473800,"counter":814,"content":"<p>There are a lot of points in there.  A couple of points related to the restructuring.  One point was about the potential benefit of focusing on a longer term strategy with a loss of focus on day-to-day issues.  I do not think the centre should be other than by exception focusing on day-to-day issues.  I think that that rightly should be sitting out with the community health organisations and with the acute hospital groups and only by exception when they have not resolved them should they be escalated.  A point was made earlier about the respite discussion, for example.  In a situation where there is adequate respite capacity that clearly is a discussion that should be happening at local level between the local delivery teams within the CHO and the relevant families, parents, patients and so on.  It is not a thing that we should be trying to run ahead of those responsible.  That is why I focused on the HSE's central role.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the focus on mental health, I will come back to what I described earlier.  Before the creation of my role within the organisation and then in turn the role of Mr. Healy working with me and then Ms O'Connor working with Mr. John Connaghan, there was not that overview of the wider picture in terms of health and social care funding and within that funding the specific priorities for a whole range of services.  The focus there needs to be in mental health and in other areas on upstream investment to avoid the need to access CAMHS at all, as Ms O&rsquo;Connor said.  We were just looking up and down the individual silos.  I genuinely believe there will be huge benefit in terms of how we plan and prioritise health and social care services as a result of this split.  If I did not believe that I would not be here in this role.  Having said that, if we turn this into just the creation of three new silos from the five or six that we had before that would be just daft, so we have to continue to work together.  We recognise that the primacy for strategy and planning work within mental health and more generally will sit with me, Mr. Healy, and others.  The primacy for ensuring that what we identify within plans is delivered will sit with Ms O'Connor and colleagues, but clearly we are not developing those plans and strategies in isolation from them.  We will work in an integrated way.  We have been and we are now.  That is why we are here today in the way that we are.  We will continue to do that.  We still have the clinical lead that was mentioned earlier in response to a previous question.  We all feed across to each other.  He is giving mental health input into both my side of the house and to Mr. John Connaghan's side of the house on the operational side of things.  I genuinely believe huge benefits can be secured from this structure.<\/p><p>That is provided we approach it in the right way and do not create a new set of silos to replace the old ones we have.  There is nothing in the time I have had the privilege of in working with Ms O'Connor, Mr. Healy, Mr. Ryan and others that gives me any sense that would be the case.  I come back to the point I made earlier that it is all about patients and clients at the end of the day.  We need to do the very best we can within the resources we have.  Sometimes we wander into spaces where we assume there is a failing within the system but the resourcing of the system is so far away from what it needs to be.  We mentioned the 10% figure earlier and 10% of &euro;15 billion is &euro;1.5 billion.  That assumes &euro;15 billion is the right figure.  In a world where resourcing for specialist mental health is hundreds of millions of euro away from what is needed if we were to get to the 10% figure, it is not surprising we have some of our difficulties.  We need to address those difficulties not just by investing at the end point of the problem in CAMHS and so on, and it involves all the upstream services we mentioned.<\/p><p> I am not here today to lobby for extra resources for health at all but I ask for a degree of realism around where we find ourselves today in the journey in which we are on and the priority we will continue to give to mental health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":816,"content":"<p>Before getting to Deputy Neville, I ask again how we can ask for more funding when we still do not know how money is being spent.

Let us call it out.  It is not as if everything in the system is perfect either.  We have started to turn that over here.  I do not want it to go out that this is just about resources.  There are systems failures happening as well and we must try to identify and fix them together.  That is the reason for the robust questioning.<\/p> <p>  We need to know about the financing so we know where we are to spend the money.  When I walk into the office of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and ask him or anybody else how much is being spent on specialties, I should be able to get the figure.  In the private sector a button can be pushed and a report can be run in order to get such figures.  It is a massive frustration on our side, particularly when we see the likes of the childcare service rolling out a new information technology system.  It is a massive bugbear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#M00700","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":822,"content":"<p>There can be no response to that really as we will have to wait on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#M00800","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526473800,"counter":823,"content":"<p>We can certainly arrange a further briefing if that is helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526473800,"counter":824,"content":"<p>What are the figures for the clinical and non-clinical staff in the HSE mental health services?

Earlier we spoke about early intervention.  The last resource is CAMHS so every other intervention is before that.  We are nearly six months into the new budget so what portion of the new mental health funding allocated by the Minister in that budget has been spent on other than existing resources?  What is being spent on new projects?  The money was specifically for new projects.<\/p> <p>  CAMHS is an acute service.  We spoke about other services and the witness mentioned Jigsaw, which does phenomenal work.  The Galway Youth Counselling Service made an application to the HSE for funding to extend services into Gort and Ballinasloe.  The service is currently provided in Tuam and Loughrea but these people want to extend it across the county base and into Connemara.  It would cost &euro;112,000.  This developed from Comhairle na n&Oacute;g four years ago.  The service has psychologists who give talk therapy to a minimum of 200 children across the county.  These kids are referred from schools and Tusla.  It provides for children going from sixth class to first, second and third year.  There is a gap in the system where there is anxiety and stress arising from transition.  We can all relate to it.  Six weeks of such support bridges the gap.  The service made an application and it seems it was fortunate to get &euro;15,000.  The service will close at the end of June.<\/p> <p>  This is an identified service with associated statistics.  Everything has a data basis, including age profiles, schools and demographic needs.  It is a clearly identified new service that can support existing services within the HSE.  I wonder how many more of them we are missing throughout the county that are providing a fantastic service, with accredited and qualified people providing support to schools.  It is helping 200 kids and if the service is not there next year, they will go on a waiting list somewhere, blocking the system.  Those kids do not need to be in any system but they need help in transition.  This is why I ask how the new allocation of funding in the budget is being spent.<\/p> <p>  It is in the community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  I have a letter from Mr. Charlie Meehan in my CHO refusing the full amount of funding.  The HSE confirmed it was supportive of the group but indicated that, unfortunately, in 2018 mental health services were hugely oversubscribed with respect to section 39 applications.  It was not in a position to increase funding to the group.  I am not disputing those facts but with the extra allocation of funding given this year, I would have hoped we could have supported 200 kids in Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018051600002#M01100","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526473800,"counter":826,"content":"<p>I do not know the particular agency but the Deputy mentioned a few issues.<\/p><p>With regard to funding I believe we answered a parliamentary question on the allocation and spend in 2017.  Our 2018 funding has not really been spent yet.  Generally it is mid-year before we start spending that year's allocation and we are still working off 2017 funding, if that makes sense.  The funding from 2016 and 2017 is going into the opening of new acute units, the enhancement of the acute units in Limerick, Galway and Drogheda, and into a high observation unit in Kerry.  Acute care is at the upper end of costs.  The combined cost in 2017 for those was &euro;4.6 million.<\/p><p> In 2017, &euro;3 million was allocated to primary care-based mental health supports such as assistant psychologists.  These assistant psychologists in primary care are now employed.  They are not there long enough to know the impact they are having on the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, side of the house.<\/p><p> We have enhanced the Jigsaw funding and we have improved patient safety by looking at additional posts, especially in some of our more acute units.  We are doing a lot of work in our forensic services looking at prison in-reach.  We have the largest capital project ever in mental health in Ireland advancing very quickly in Portrane, which is the new forensic hospital.<\/p><p> We have developed our eating disorders services with a number of teams, adult and CAMHS, for eating disorders.  There are all of these different services, including peer support, and part of the challenge is that when one refers to &euro;20 million or &euro;35 million it sounds like an awful lot of money but when one considers the nine CHOs and the specialties in CAMHS, general adult and psychiatry in older life and some of the more marginalised groups such as people who are homeless, Travellers, forensic services - which is also high-cost - the funding goes quickly.  We must balance this out to try to raise all the boats.<\/p><p> Parts of the State are very highly resourced and when we consider the average funding across the State, and I hate to break it to the Deputy that CHO 2 is actually quite well funded compared with a lot of the other areas.  There are other areas that have never had a psychiatric institution and do not have the pot of gold that some areas have, not that it is enough now.  However, areas such as Kildare, for example, come from a different place.<\/p><p> That is our challenge.  We cannot turn off services.

I would like at the outset to recall the bravery of Vicky Phelan, Ms Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, and the loved ones of other women who have come forward in recent days.  Their testimony and willingness to speak publicly about deeply personal matters has raised very serious questions.  These questions related to how the health service engages with individuals when things go wrong and the fact that the audit results for these women were not conveyed as they should have been.<\/p> <p>  The CervicalCheck programme was established to help prevent cervical cancer.  Before it was introduced, we were not making any impact on cervical cancer but following its introduction we are seeing a steady reduction each year.  However, every time a cervical cancer is not prevented, it is a tragedy.  That is compounded when women who have been diagnosed with cancer are not properly informed of the results of a subsequent audit.  I would like to acknowledge the powerful and deeply generous nature of the advice that is given when women who have had such painful experiences encourage others to continue to participate in the programme in the interest of their health.<\/p> <p>  These powerful testimonies place on all of us a responsibility to act to address weaknesses while sustaining the national cervical cancer screening programme in the interest of current and future generations of Irishwomen.  The Department is committed to discharging its particular responsibility to take the necessary steps, in association with the HSE, health professionals and others, to restore the trust of women in the CervicalCheck programme and, indeed, our health service more generally. <\/p> <p>  Last week, the Government commissioned a leading UK expert, Dr. Gabriel Scally, to conduct an inquiry to establish the facts and to review all aspects of CervicalCheck.  We are determined to do everything we can to assist Dr. Scally in his inquiries so that we can all find out what happened and why it happened, to make sure that we have a robust cancer screening programme for women, and so lessons are learned for the future.<\/p> <p>  The focus, however, needs to be on the women most affected as well as the CervicalCheck programme.  On Friday last, the Government agreed a comprehensive package of health and social care measures to support the 209 women and their families who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer and whose audit result differed from their original smear test.  The Government has committed to ensuring that these women and their families are supported to the fullest extent possible.<\/p> <p>  The health and social care measures include a discretionary medical card for every woman affected, or her next of kin in cases where the woman has sadly died, so that they can avail of health services, including medicines provided under the medical card scheme, free of charge; out-of-pocket medical costs incurred, including the cost of any medicines that have been prescribed by their treating clinician; primary care supports, including counselling, for the women affected, and also counselling services for the immediate family members of these women, including bereavement counselling where needed; and other health and social care supports, including travel costs and childminding.<\/p> <p>  An international clinical expert review panel is also being established as part of the Government&rsquo;s investigation into CervicalCheck.  The main purpose of the panel is to provide women with facts and independent expert assessment of those facts.  The panel&rsquo;s findings will also contribute to the overall independent assessment of the quality of the CervicalCheck programme.<\/p> <p>  The review will consider all cases of invasive cervical cancer in Ireland since CervicalCheck was established.  Women who developed cancer and who were screened by CervicalCheck will be identified and their screening histories will be examined.  The expert panel will review the cases of those women who had previous screening tests prior to their diagnosis and undertake a re-examination of cytology tests.  Where the expert panel opinion of cytology results differs from the original results provided by CervicalCheck, the panel will endeavour to determine, wherever possible, any failures to prevent cancer or to intervene at an earlier stage and will prepare individual reports for those affected, setting out the facts and their expert and independent assessment.<\/p> <p>  The Government has also announced that the State Claims Agency is advancing a new initiative aimed at expediting the resolution of the nine outstanding legal cases in a sensitive manner, utilising mediation wherever possible.  In addition, last week the Minister for Health received Government approval to provide in law for mandatory open disclosure, through the forthcoming patient safety Bill, in respect of serious patient safety incidents.  The Bill will also provide for mandatory reporting of these serious events to the appropriate regulatory authority, such as HIQA.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, the Department published records relating to the CervicalCheck clinical audit.  The information submitted by the HSE in regard to this audit in 2016 provided the Department with an understanding that this was a retrospective clinical audit undertaken for quality assurance and learning purposes and that CervicalCheck had a clear objective to provide results to consultants in order to allow for direct communication with the women concerned.  Both clinical audit and the communication of the results of clinical audit to women were seen by the Department to be very worthy and valuable undertakings by the CervicalCheck programme.  Clinical audit is an important means by which standards are maintained and advances made in healthcare.<\/p> <p>  I believe a reasonable approach was taken by the Department at the time based upon the information available to it.  There are two ways of looking at issues, one based upon the information available at the time and the other based on hindsight.  Of course, had the subsequent widespread non-disclosure been escalated by CervicalCheck within the HSE and raised with the Department, this would have triggered major concern and a much different attitude.  Based upon the information we had, however, we viewed the initiative taken to communicate audit findings to women in a positive light.<\/p> <p>  The widespread and still unfolding distress caused by the non-disclosure of the clinical audit results to the women concerned demands serious reflection, however.  The Scally inquiry provides us with a mechanism to achieve an objective basis for introducing improvements, where these can be identified.  The Department has at this stage publicly committed to engaging with the HSE on a full review of the implementation of its open disclosure policy.  <\/p> <p>  As I have mentioned, the Government has approved the drafting of a patient safety Bill by the Department.  This Bill will provide a mechanism to develop and introduce standards relating to clinical audit so as to ensure that open disclosure, including roles and responsibilities for such disclosure, are fully addressed in advance of the commencement of an audit.  As the CervicalCheck experience shows, it is important to anticipate the issues that will arise for the disclosure of clinical audit findings before commencing the process.  The clinical audit standards to be introduced under the patient safety Bill should also entail a responsibility to record the fact that open disclosure has taken place.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to the recommendations produced by the Scally inquiry.  The inquiry will produce an interim report at the start of June and a final report by the end of June.  The Department will be subject to this inquiry and will be scrutinised by it, but the committee can be assured we will provide full support and co-operation and address any learning and recommendations as a matter of priority.<\/p> <p>  With the agreement of the Chairman, I will ask Dr. Tony Holohan to make some remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":932,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Breslin.

I cannot recall a time in those years when patients were gripped by such widespread fear and concern as they are now.  Of course, given the nature of the events that have unfolded in recent weeks, the fear and concern are entirely understandable, but it has been difficult to get real facts, which people can trust, into the public domain and hence into public understanding.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute in this regard this morning.<\/p> <p>  We know things went wrong.  It is true that lessons must be learned but it is important that we be clear about what actually came to light.  Arising from the publicity following the Vicky Phelan court case, questions arose as to whether other patients might be in a similar situation.  Had Vicky Phelan not highlighted her case, we might not have become aware that other women had not had the findings of the CervicalCheck clinical audit disclosed to them by their clinicians.  We therefore owe a debt of gratitude to Vicky Phelan.  <\/p> <p>  It has become clear since the case that the non-disclosure of clinical audit findings was widespread.  It has also become clear that the issue of disclosure was the subject of dispute among some elements of the relevant clinical community.  I can provide assurance that the Department was not aware of these issues until this controversy arose, towards the end of April.  We have since had the opportunity to engage directly with a view to understanding, directing and investigating what happened.  <\/p> <p>  Let me be clear on what we knew in 2016.  First, no Minister was advised.  Second, the decision not to escalate was a fair and reasonable decision based on the information available to the Department at the time.<\/p><p>It was reasonable because the information provided in the briefing notes provided by the HSE to the Department was evidence of ongoing improvement to how the service was being delivered, rather than the identification of problems that might require escalation to Ministers.  The HSE has confirmed, and will confirm, that no systems of escalation within its organisation in relation to the implementation of the audit programme were activated.<\/p><p> In respect of CervicalCheck, it is important to point out how much has been achieved in recent years.  Before 2008 in this country we had a disorganised arrangement of random screening were random women were getting too many smears and many others were not getting any smears at all.  On an annual basis, we were doing more smears in the country at that time than we do currently.  Smears were being examined in a wide range of laboratories, many of which were too small and not fit for purpose.  There were no quality assurance arrangements in place and there were very long turnaround times for reporting of smear results.  In 2008, the population-based programme which invites patients to come forward to their GPs for smears was established with those smears being sent to accredited laboratories and appropriate follow-up in colposcopy services.  Prior to 2008, cervical cancer incidents were rising but we know that the impact since 2008 has been a 7% annualised reduction after 2010 in the incidence of cervical cancer, a clear impact of the programme.<\/p><p> Let me turn briefly to open disclosure.  It is important, given some of the debate that has taken place, that we make the position of the Department clear.  The Department does not and never has regarded open disclosure as optional.  Open disclosure should happen in the right way, in every circumstance in which it is indicated.  Patients simply must be informed.  I know that this can be a challenge for the medical profession but professionals in this country are rising to that challenge.  Our legislative approach is to encourage doctors to do the right thing in circumstances where disclosure is required.  We know from international evidence that one of the reasons that disclosure does not always happen in the right way or at all is that doctors may fear the medico-legal consequences.  We have directly addressed this fear through the voluntary disclosure legislation, the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017.  The regulations are to be signed within the coming weeks.  That legislation provides that if doctors disclose appropriately, they will not contribute further to any legal risks they may have.  That is intended to create a so-called safe space to encourage people to do the right thing.  <\/p><p> That is not to say that we do not see a role for mandatory open disclosure, so a stepped approach is required.  Therefore, following many months of work, we have secured Government approval for the patient safety Bill to introduce mandatory open disclosure for a specified list of serious reportable events.  This is in line with the UK duty of candour.  However, it goes further in that it is not just an obligation on organisations, as with the duty of candour in the UK, rather it is an obligation on doctors to disclose.  Thus, the commitment to open disclosure in this country could be regarded as exceeding - when we have enacted that legislation - that which is placed on doctors in the UK.  <\/p><p> It is really important that I am clear that we absolutely recognise that at the centre of this are tragic cases.  We are fully sensitive to that.  I want to engage, and the Department would wish to engage, directly with the individuals involved in these cases, as we have done in the past in other situations, to ensure we fully understand their perspectives and fully engage them in the process of further policy development and oversight so that we can ensure that any lessons that can be derived here can be properly applied to improvements in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":935,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to attend this meeting.  Several issues have already been covered by Mr. Breslin and Dr. Holohan so I will truncate my opening statement accordingly.<\/p> <p>  First, I would like to acknowledge and apologise for the confusion and alarm which has been created in relation to the CervicalCheck programme as a result of the failure to communicate with the women affected.  This failure has ultimately impacted on every female in Ireland, their families, their spouses and their children.  Irrespective of the original, well-intentioned undertaking by the CervicalCheck programme to conduct an audit of invasive cervical cancers and communicate the results to the patients affected, the organisation - in that respect both CervicalCheck and the HSE - has failed by any measure. <\/p> <p>  I sincerely apologise on behalf of the HSE and CervicalCheck to the women and their families who have been directly affected by what has happened and to all the women of Ireland who have been understandably frightened and concerned by what they have read and heard.  We must learn lessons from what has happened.  I assure the committee and especially the women of Ireland that I am determined that we will take on board these lessons.  Together with my colleagues, we will work to bring about the changes needed with a view to ensuring that this does not happen again.  The CervicalCheck programme is vital to women's health and we must clearly understand the mistakes that have been made and how we can learn from these and restore confidence in this life-saving public health programme.<\/p> <p>  In the short time that I have been interim director general, less than three days, I have asked for a full record search and a full chronology of events to be compiled.  That exercise is now under way.  The HSE last week provided three separate briefing notes at short notice to the Committee on Public Accounts, PAC, and we have also submitted them to this committee for information.  Regrettably, there was not sufficient opportunity at the PAC meeting last week to provide appropriate context and interpretation of the three briefing notes.  I have therefore brought colleagues to this committee who will be prepared to answer any questions of detail on these notes.  The full record search has allowed three further briefing notes relating to the audit process.  These briefing notes are provided to the committee here.  It is fair to say that the language in all of the briefing notes is very functional and somewhat lacking in empathy for the women who were to be communicated with. <\/p> <p>  I have submitted an information note to the committee regarding the briefings that were submitted to PAC together with other information.  In relation to the three specific briefings given to PAC last week, and which we have also copied to this committee, the context for the briefing given in March 2016 to the national director, health and well-being, HSE, the former director general of the HSE, and to the Department of Health was to raise awareness of the audit process that CervicalCheck was engaged in and the initial outcomes and next steps of that process.  The intent of the CervicalCheck programme was that all treating clinicians would be given individual audit findings for their patients so that these could be in turn communicated to the women concerned, in line with guidelines at that time.<\/p> <p>  A key element within the March 2016 briefing was the assurance it gave that there was no systemic quality issues of concern with the programme.  This is the most important element of an audit from a cancer prevention and effectiveness perspective, namely, to provide assurance that there is nothing systematically happening in the screening programme and its operations that would lead to it operating outside of internationally acceptable quality parameters, for example, European guidelines. <\/p> <p>  The process involved sending audit results to treating clinicians in order that these results could be communicated to the women concerned.  The CervicalCheck programme had commenced sending letters to treating clinicians in February 2016.  All individuals briefed expected that women affected would be receiving information from their treating clinicians on the result of the audit findings pertinent to their case. <\/p> <p>  The subject matter of the March 2016 briefing was to provide a snapshot of the process to date and to escalate a particular issue at hand.  This issue concerned one laboratory, Quest Diagnostics, that challenged the CervicalCheck programme communications process with treating clinicians and invoked a dispute resolution process, as part of that contract.  I have been advised that this is why \"pause all letters\" was listed as a next step in the briefing.  It was imperative that CervicalCheck and the National Screening Service resolved this issue quickly so as to ensure it had solid legal footing to continue with its work in sending audit findings to treating clinicians for onward disclosure to the women concerned, within the guidelines set out. <\/p> <p>  The thinking at that time was that if CervicalCheck were to continue sending letters, without that assurance that it had legal cover to do so, it could have created subsequent legal issues for the operation of the CervicalCheck programme, in addition to potential risks for any women seeking redress where the laboratory could claim its legal rights and entitlements were infringed by the process.  This is why \"await advice from solicitors\" was one of the next steps in the briefing note from March 2016.<\/p> <p>  CervicalCheck was supported in resolving the dispute with Quest Diagnostics and the process of issuing letters to treating clinicians recommenced in June 2016.  During the time it took to resolve the dispute, CervicalCheck was preparing individual letters for each patient case history to send to treating clinicians.  The March 2016 briefing note states that \"There is now a batch [or] accumulation of clinical audit case reports that have been completed\".  It was understood by those that were briefed that these case reports needed to be converted into individual letters in relation to each patient concerned.<\/p><p>The correspondence demonstrates that this work was happening at this time.  This correspondence will be made available to the scoping inquiry.<\/p><p> CervicalCheck explained in the briefings how the audit and communications process was complex, multi-layered and resource intensive.  They made clear to those being briefed that each communication needed to be specific to the individual and checked and rechecked for accuracy relating to the specifics of each patient, and that the logistics of sending out these communications needed to be carefully thought out so as to mitigate any risks relating to the manner, mode, content and logistics of the communication.  This is, therefore, why \"decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks\" is set out as a next step in the briefing note.  It is important to note that CervicalCheck issued the majority of the correspondence concerned during July and August 2016, with approximately 200 letters according to the July 2016 briefing notes.<\/p><p> We need to be realistic in our assessment of the communication process.  The CervicalCheck programme did not close out the issues that were subsequently encountered regarding the breakdown in the process of treating clinicians discussing those audit findings with their patients.  Indeed, it is not clear to me that the staff within the programme were aware of the scale of the difficulty in terms of the proportion of women who had not been communicated with.  I can confirm at this point that the screening service is concluding an agreement with the faculty of pathology to provide guidance and direction for the screening programme.  This will help us to provide the necessary clarity as we move forward.<\/p><p> It is also important that we look at some key facts.  Most women&rsquo;s smear test results are accurately reported.  Every year, more than 250,000 smears are undertaken.  For women who have received a normal result, the chance of going on to have cervical cancer by their next smear test three years later is less than 1%.  Since 2008, the CervicalCheck programme has provided some 3 million screenings to over 1 million women.  The programme has detected over 50,000 high-grade pre-cancerous changes in women, therefore reducing their risk of cervical cancer by 90%.  These were women without any symptoms who, without that screening programme, would not have known that they had pre-cancerous changes.  Latest figures show that the incidence of cancer in Ireland reduced by 7% in the period 2010 to 2015, which is welcome.<\/p><p> I want to take this opportunity to say a few words briefly in defence of our national audit programme.  The process of clinical audit is about measuring the quality of care against relevant standards and best professional practice.  It encompasses the requirement to identify any factors causing sub-optimal delivery of care, either at an individual patient level or more widely, and allows the necessary remedial actions to be identified and taken.  In light of the controversy over the CervicalCheck audit process, we must ensure that healthcare professionals are not discouraged from taking part in clinical audit.  Fostering an open culture which supports clinicians and encourages learning must be part of our ethos.<\/p><p> I should also say a few words on accountability.  To me, accountability is the obligation for an organisation or individual to account for its, his or her activities, accept responsibility for them, and disclose the results in a transparent manner.  As interim director general, it might also be useful to outline how I see myself discharging my duties against the obligation to be accountable to the Minister and more generally.  As part of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013, which established the directorate as the governing body of the HSE, the directorate is accountable to the Minister for the performance of its functions and those of the HSE.  As the interim director general, I account to the Minister on behalf of the directorate through the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  It is important that we, therefore, foster a culture of openness, transparency and both personal and organisational accountability in doing so.<\/p><p> The process and procedures for how the CervicalCheck programme intended to communicate the results of the audit to patients was developed at that time with the best of intentions, with a view to ensuring that women would receive the results of the audit, consistent with policy and best practice as set out in the 2015 open disclosure national policy, and informed by wider best practice for the disclosure of cancer screening audit results.  The failure here, which was a collective failure, was on ensuring effective follow through on these good intentions.  While the results of the audit were communicated to the relevant clinicians, the arrangements thereafter broke down.  The outcome was that a large proportion of women were not told about either the audit itself or the results for them as individuals.  The impact of this failure has been profound for every woman affected and for their families.  It has also undoubtedly caused significant levels of fear and anxiety for the wider population of women living in Ireland and it has, sadly, undermined public confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.<\/p><p> I will conclude with four pledges.  We will move swiftly and with compassion to provide effective support packages to the women and families who require support.  As outlined by the Secretary General, we will do this with the minimum of fuss and bureaucracy and with empathy.  We will fully, openly and transparently co-operate with the Scally inquiry and any subsequent inquiries.  If there is a requirement to hold individuals to account on a personal basis, we will do so.  In this respect, the Scally inquiry and subsequent inquiries will be important for the independence of their views and to allow due process and fair procedures to be followed.  We will learn lessons from recent weeks, not least the ability to say sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":937,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Connaghan.  The way we will conduct the meeting this morning is we will offer each member of the committee 12 minutes to ask and receive answers to questions and I ask them to observe the time limit, if possible.  Those who are not members of the committee will be allocated five minutes to ask questions and have them answered.  With this in mind, I will begin.<\/p> <p>  I have number of questions which I would like Mr. Connaghan to answer.  Why was the information on the false negatives identified in the audit not brought to the attention of the secretary general of the HSE and the Minister for Health at the time, in regard to open disclosure?  Why was it not escalated up the line?  Where is the information regarding the number of false negatives identified from the various laboratories?  We requested last week that we would get information on the quality of the reporting of each laboratory, but we still have not received that information.  Why was open disclosure posing such a great difficulty in 2016 when it was already HSE policy in 2013?  What was the issue that inhibited open disclosure?<\/p> <p>  I believe it was the responsibility of the CervicalCheck programme to make information available to patients.  I do not think it was the responsibility of the treating clinicians.  I would like Mr. Connaghan's comments on this because it was the CervicalCheck programme that took the smears, and I believe they were the appropriate people to contact patients and pass the information down the line.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the documents we received yesterday, in document No. 5 there is a table of cervical cancer cases notified to the National Cancer Registry in Ireland and another table of the cancers identified by CervicalCheck.  Up to 2013, some 1,853 cancers were notified to the cancer registry yet the CervicalCheck screening programme had only 808.  Did that not trigger alarm bells, that there was a growing disparity between the figures?  Perhaps Mr. Connaghan will comment on this.<\/p> <p>  Was there any withholding of information over the period up to now, from women who specifically asked for information on their previous smears but were denied access to that information?  Are there any issues in relation to cytology, other than the false negatives, that have led to delayed diagnosis and delayed treatment in the CervicalCheck programme, in other words, in the process of recall, getting appointments and access to colposcopy?  Why is the proposed introduction of HPV testing of smears being delayed until November of this year?  Surely that test could be introduced sooner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#J00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":938,"content":"<p>I will call on some of my colleagues because the Chairman has raised issues that precede my time in Ireland and my time as interim director general, and which are probably best answered by them.<\/p><p>I call on Dr. Peter McKenna to make some comments on the false negatives, the quality of reporting in laboratories and the questions raised about cytology and HPV.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":940,"content":"<p>The false negatives will come out when we look at the 209 cases to see which laboratories were responsible.

I would explain that it happened in so many instances, that it was unusual and again that I was very sorry.  What would happen in that hypothetical example would be current and the error I would be disclosing was mine.  The question of an audit is quite different.

There is literally no reference to telling the woman anything.  For the avoidance of doubt, if anyone is unsure about what it is people are angry about, it is that impression that has been given that information was deliberately withheld.  We can get into a conversation about whether that information was material to a woman's health and well-being, but it was information that certainly could and should have been shared, and by my reading of it, any policy of open disclosure should have encouraged that information to be shared with the woman herself.  Dr. Holohan is signing off on these letters.  They explicitly exclude telling women.  They simply say \"ensure that the correspondence is added to [her] medical records\" and, \"If open disclosure is indicated [very much optional here] please follow the local hospital guidelines\", unless of course she has passed away, in which case just stick a note on her file.  That is the sort of stuff that makes people very angry.  Dr. Holohan might advise us on those letters and when he signed off on them.  It does not look like open disclosure to me, but perhaps he has an alternative view.<\/p> <p>  Around the same time as these letters were circulating, Dr. Holohan sent an email to Ms Conroy on the memo.  In it he said they should have a chat about this.  Does Dr. Holohan have any recollection of that?  Was it a formal meeting?  What would they have been discussing at that time?  It strikes me that Dr. Holohan has come here to talk to us, in hindsight, about all he knows, but the truth is that he and his colleagues knew more than the women themselves.  That information was available to him and his colleagues.  It is not fair for people who would have had sight of these memos from February 2016 to pretend they are surprised at the revelations now.

It is shocking to me that that sort of information would not have been escalated to the level of a Minister.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure I am satisfied with the explanation Dr. Holohan gave because it is clear when these memos are read through that the women are hardly mentioned at all but the media features.  Dr. Holohan and his colleagues were getting themselves ready for some class of a media storm.  He would have seen the Minister in the D&aacute;il two weeks ago.  The Minister was not pleased at being handed information just as he walked in the door, and I do not think anybody would be in those circumstances.  This information was known to Dr. Holohan in February 2016 because he would have had sight of those memos, so it is not fair of him to pretend it is coming as a surprise to him now.  On the process of escalation, it defies belief that it would not have been escalated to the level of a Minister, but maybe Dr. Holohan can explain his involvement in those template letters, because clearly they were sent to him for his own information.

It is a prerequisite to being able to record incidents.  What we need to be able to move to then, as we strengthen our implementation around open disclosure, is that system capturing the fact of open disclosure when adverse events have occurred.  In dealing with adverse events, it is important to point out that the open disclosure policy relates to adverse events and it is correct to say that not every false negative is necessarily an adverse event.  Some judgment is required on that and the letters provide those flexibilities.  Those are templates that have to provide for any eventuality.

When this was first brought to my attention in February 2016, all of those briefings detailed that there was an accumulation of case reviews that had been completed.  A decision was made the previous year to ensure that this information was given to women.  A process was put in place to figure out the best way to do that.  As Dr. McKenna mentioned and in relation to the Chair's question on who the best person to give this information was, they considered all those things.  They looked at the open disclosure policy and the guidance for the disclosure of audit findings for cancer screening programmes to come up with a process that would support this.  I have got emails from the screening programme stating that the programme has information on women's screening history that may be of benefit to her and we believe it should be disclosed.<\/p> <p>  The issue that they brought to my attention in February and March was the fact that they felt that some of the laboratories had queries once they found out that they were issuing letters to treating consultants so that the information could be given to patients.  They were concerned, they escalated it to me and I supported them to resolve it so that those letters could continue to be given.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly's questions on the interpretation in relation to the letters are very fair.  The questions on whether the open disclosure policy was appropriate at the time are very fair, especially in hindsight, but they were looking at what the policies were in other jurisdictions on this type of disclosure in these circumstances.  Their intent was that the information would go out.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Deputy O'Reilly's specific question on the letters, it is fair to say that these are templates.  What that means is that every letter is individualised to the case, so when it says \"if open disclosure is required\" that is also a template letter for women who are getting the results of audit findings where there is no discordance between the cytology.  Open disclosure would be required if there is a discordance.  It is true that within the provisions here they have left space for clinical judgment.  That needs to be reviewed and we need to look at it.  In speaking to Professor Flannelly who was running the programme at that time and meeting individual women, and it can be seen in the first memo that she meets women, talks to people who are getting these results, and she is talking to consultants and so forth, my understanding was that there would be circumstances where it would not be advisable to tell a lady something like that, for example, if the person was close to passing away.<\/p><p>That absolutely has to be looked at, in terms of what kind of guidance can be given to clinicians in the context of wanting to be fully open and disclose this information, and some of the challenges there might be from a clinical perspective.  It has to be reviewed in hindsight, but it is really important to say that those carrying out the programme, at all times, wanted the information to get into the hands of these women, and expected that it would.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>It is funny, because the information did not get into their hands.

I can provide that by copy to the committee.  There were a number of other mini-competitions within that framework.  The framework agreement provided for a number of laboratories, and the mini-competition was effectively a mini-competition within that for the supply of laboratories.

There is also a quality assurance group within the programme that looks at that area, including international expertise to support it from outside the Republic of Ireland.

I have still not been told.  That is unacceptable.  I needed that information today.  I asked for it on 3 May, long before the Scally investigation ever existed.  Why have I not been given that information?  It is a matter of sending an email to 14 people and telling them they have 24 hours to answer a simple question; when did they know about this audit?

In the briefing note the Deputy has, from October 2016, it is made very clear that the process we were engaged in over the period had concluded and that the historical letters had been sent to consulting clinicians.  It is very clear within the memo that the programme was engaging colposcopists with treating clinicians to support the process of open disclosure and that they would be issuing letters at a pace of approximately four to six every month as they started to conclude reviews that were coming in.  At that point, they were also hearing about cases that were coming through, which was always the intent.  In carrying out this audit process and in sharing this information with women, the reason they were flagging the media piece was because we always knew that, once women had information, they would have absolutely every right to seek legal advice and legal address if they so chose.  Therefore, we were expecting cases to come through.  What I was not expecting, and what we were all not expecting, was that women would not be told.<\/p> <p>  After October 2016, I received a management report every month from the screening service stating the audit process was going well and that improvements were being made to the programme.

Second, the first they heard of the clinical audit was when they got notification from CervicalCheck to advise them.  I have reliable information informing me that, in one case, the person was advised there were adverse findings in the reviews of the smears of ten of his patients.  The information all arrived in to him on the one day and he was asked to inform the patients.  I want the delegates to clarify whether the clinicians at the front line in the 15 centres around the country were aware of the clinical audit before it started.  Why were they not involved in the process and kept up to date as it developed?  According to my information, the first involvement of the clinicians was when they were notified of the results of the clinical audit in respect of their patients.<\/p> <p>  There is information from February and March of 2016 that went out in June.  There was then ongoing communication regarding who should advise the patients.  My information is that there was a meeting on 1 September 2017 with the clinicians.  There was a quite robust debate about the issue.  Therefore, the issue was still not resolved on 1 September 2017 in respect of informing the patients or the backup support being provided to the clinicians.

They had developed a guidance note for them and Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly herself was directly engaging with consultants as they called up, as well as patients.  That was my understanding at the time.<\/p> <p>  It was not brought to my attention that there were difficulties at that stage.  I would have known that it was an evolving process.  They would have said that this is very challenging and that all the international evidence suggests that this type of disclosure is very challenging.  They would have said, while the treating clinicians were the most appropriate people to do it and that was well-established, it was not an easy thing to do.  They would have described research studies which would have shown the types of fears around this type of thing.  There were actively engaging with that.  They stated in October that this would continue.  As I mentioned already to Deputy Kelly, there was no escalation or no early risk detection communicated on that not happening in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#R00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":1118,"content":"<p>If one looks at the letters exchanged between Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly and Kevin Hickey, however, they highlighted that there were concerns.

The updates we had from the HSE were updates that gave us assurance that the process was taking place over a number of months and that the HSE was problem-solving when issues arose to get through them.  It completed that process around late summer or so in 2016.  I am aware that a clinical audit of that nature is not a common thing in screening programmes internationally.  That is a positive development.  I knew that open disclosure arrangements in respect of those findings would be even less common.  These are features that would have added to the value and the standing of our screening programme in international terms and we saw them as good developments.  There was nothing in that in a broad sense of risk, problem or concern being escalated to us as part of all of that which would be the subject of disclosure.  That was the information we had at the time.  Clearly there were gaps in the system.<\/p> <p>  It is very clear to see in retrospect that if the arrangement had been in place to have absolute clarity tied down before the commencement of feeding back of those findings with regard to whose job it was, what precisely was going to be fed back by way of a clear open disclosure policy for the service and a clear feedback loop to tell the centre, in this case the screening programme, then this might not have happened.  There is clear learning in respect of all of those things.  Without getting ahead of where Dr. Scally will take us in terms of findings, at a minimum we can see these are developments that will enhance the screening programmes.  The patient safety Bill, which the Minister brought to Cabinet last week, will give the Minister powers to essentially set guidelines for clinical audit that would ensure that when clinical audits are started - of this nature or elsewhere - that in advance of commencement those guidelines would be crystal clear on the question of responsibility for feedback to patients and on the question of feedback to the centre so there is verification the open disclosure has happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#V00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":1208,"content":"<p>I accept Dr. Holohan's word on what he is saying but if I had been Minister for Health at the time I would have been very disappointed and I would be wondering about the whole system.

We operate on the basis that as much as we can we try to manage and resolve issues if they are things we can manage and resolve and we have a system for that.  I will not tell the Deputy it is a perfect system.  I will and would like to say it is a system that is getting better and better.  For example, we have a patient safety protocol that has been in development and improvement between us and the HSE which captures the kind of information we really need to have when patient safety incidents arise so we are able to discriminate between those circumstances that we really need to be concerned about and where, as the Secretary General said earlier, we need to step in.  There was evidence of that at the time.  There were areas where we were stepping in with regard to other areas.  In respect of this particular one, I understand the Deputy's question.

I would like to restore confidence in the cervical smear process and our ability to furnish the committee and to get the right people in front of it that it wants to see.  Those are my immediate priorities.  In terms of mid-term priorities, implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report will figure quite highly.  I can see many benefits in it.  I come from a system which has geo-aligned health authorities with funding provided on a weighted capitation basis and devolved authority to a lower level.  I think that is good because with devolved authority comes more power but also more responsibility.  That is good and we should do it.<\/p> <p>  I have a particular interest in encouraging the growth of clinical directorates at local level, both in hospitals and community healthcare organisations.  That is where decision making and power are moved nearer to the front line by investing clinicians with a degree of budget responsibility.  I am a particular fan of it and have operated it very successfully in other jurisdictions.  <\/p> <p>  Another objective of mine is to ensure the values we must observe in terms of the principles of public life - transparency, openness and personal and organisational accountability - are also quite up on my agenda.  Last but not least, one of the interests I had in applying for the job of deputy director general of operations was related to trying to improve the performance of the health system in Ireland, from elective, emergency and scheduled care points of view and to transform what we were doing in changing the model of care to a better one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#W01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":1223,"content":"<p>I wish Mr. Connaghan the best of luck in performing his role.  Many members of the committee were members of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  When we hear Mr. Connaghan talk about geo-alignment and clinicians in directorship roles, many of us get very excited about that prospect.  In particular, Deputy Bernard J. Durkan is very excited about geo-alignment.  I genuinely wish Mr. Connaghan the best of luck in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Professor Scally's letter that was put into the public domain yesterday.  As a member of the committee, the people concerned have been before us since after 10 a.m.  Obviously, there is value in the conversation.  In no way am I trying to shut down any conversation about the CervicalCheck scandal, or whatever we want to call it, but, as indicated by Mr. Breslin in his exchange with Deputy Alan Kelly, there are only 24 hours in the day.  He was answering calls late last Thursday night.  When we are questioning whether people are on holidays and so on, the committee might take on a responsibility to perhaps pause for a moment and let people in the Department and the HSE work with Professor Scally who is very well qualified.  I have heard nobody criticise him in his role or his level of competence.  It is not as if we have been told that this issue will be referred to in 2020.  We have been told it will be referred back by the end of June.  I understand the preliminary report is due to be presented in a couple of weeks.  While I understand the value for the public and committee members in extracting information, I wonder about the material impact of such sessions in the overall investigation.  I also think that discussing the issue in this forum at this time may be contributing to a lack of confidence in the smear programme which, as we all know from the evidence, has actually saved lives since its introduction.  This is my own view.  Perhaps we might discuss it when all of the contributions to the committee have concluded.  I support what Professor Scally said in his letter.  Perhaps we might pause and reflect on the issue until the interim report comes out.  <\/p> <p>  I want to focus on auditing.  My understanding is a fundamental principle of auditing involves what one does with the information when one receives it.  Mr. Connaghan will be very familiar with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence from his time in the United Kingdom.  It is also used as the standard for many of us in our practice.  At the heart of clinical audit is clinical governance.  It involves reviewing notes and, fundamentally, seeking ways to serve the patient better.  That is what appears to have been lost.<\/p><p>I am asking about the person who was responsible for designing the audit process.  Dr. O'Keeffe referred to the process that was set up.  It seems very strange that when the audit process started, what would be done with the information when it was received was not considered.  How did that happen in the clinical audit process?  Who is responsible for not designing the process correctly?  Perhaps whoever answers the question will state whether a similar non-ideal audit process is happening in, perhaps, BreastCheck and BowelScreen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#W01400","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":1225,"content":"<p>I will start with a couple of remarks on the purpose of clinical audit and will then turn to colleagues who might be able to best tackle some of the detail.  Clinical audit is the systematic review and evaluation of current practice against research-based standards with a view to improving clinical care for service users.  That is the objective.  Colleagues might correct me on this but one of the primary objectives in conducting the audit on cervical cytology was to feed back into the training of those who were interpreting those results, as well as furnishing the women concerned with the results of those audits.  There is a dual purpose, based on my understanding.

It was established in 2008 and 2010, it was decided that it would be audited.  I understand that the programme was governed through an independent statutory agency at the outset and then, during the period of austerity, was merged into the HSE, into the national cancer control programme.  In 2010, it started the audit.  When the open disclosure guidelines were initially published, the service reflected on the information that it had and decided that this information would be of benefit for patients.  It is of benefit for patients anyway because those involved in the service are trying to improve all elements of the care pathway, from the letters that they issue if there is no one at the address or to general practitioners, GPs.  There are many parts of the cervical screening process that could fail.  The audit looks at all of those processes.  It is of huge benefit to patients in identifying any problems.  It is important to note that with this particular audit, the cervical screening service has stated that there are no systemic issues of note and that the programme is working well.  The open disclosure element, with regard to making a decision that the information on individual patients' reviews is of benefit to patients, was the right decision to make in 2010.  It will be interesting to finally hear Dr. Scally's findings on this with regard to the journey.  It has clearly been a process that has been evolving.  Whether those decision-making points many years ago were the right decisions, that is, to continue with the process approach rather than making finite decisions that we would stop all the cases that we reviewed up to that point and only do open disclosure prospectively, the service committed to ensuring, in the decision that it made, that the information it had would benefit all patients who had been diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer and had a history of screening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":1227,"content":"<p>My question is whether the process was flawed from the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#X00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":1228,"content":"<p>One could say that it was.

On such a committee, one would have had, as well as colleagues and service users, an ethicist.  A core principle for successful work is that one does not impose a duty on somebody who is not represented in one's protocol.

The first clinical audit that was endorsed through that mechanism was the trauma audit last year, which directly informed the trauma strategy that was approved by Government as a consequence.

It is the case, however, that if there were issues or concerns arising within CervicalCheck, and I say \"if\" because the only person who can really give us that answer fully is not here today, because the person who engaged with those consulting clinicians in the main was Professor Flannelly herself, then either she felt it was being dealt with or it was not escalated as an issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#Y00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":1258,"content":"<p>To set the context, I would like to comment briefly about the response to the whole tragic controversy.  While I understand the pressures that are on the system since the controversy broke, I would like to highlight one particular case that really brings home the anguish and worry of women across the country, and that is the case of Jacinta Doyle.  She is a Wexford woman and mother of two who had a smear in 2011 which did not flag any issues but, in 2012, when she presented to her doctor with chronic back pain, she was referred for a scan - which she had to pay for privately, incidentally - and that is when her diagnosis was made.  My concern is the ongoing firefighting approach we have seen since the controversy broke.  This lady spent 12 days trying to get answers as to where she goes next.  She initially called the helpline on 28 April but got no response.  She then called on 3 May but got no response.  She then contacted CervicalCheck via a Facebook post on 7 May.  It was only on 10 May that she was told her original smear was tested in the US and that this lab was no longer used.<\/p><p>That constant drip-feed of these stories we hear in the media is not reassuring to the women of Ireland.  Furthermore, from a general practice point of view, it is only really in the past few days that we have got any clear direction in order to provide the free smear programme, which GPs are more than happy to do.  While it is clear that, for patients with medical cards, we can use an STC, or special-type claim, and put the medical card number on it, for private patients I understand we are instructed to use the patient's PPS number.  Can the witnesses clarify if there is a breach of data protection, as I understand there may be some issue in this regard?<\/p><p>Second, Dr. Holohan stated in his submission:<\/p><blockquote>It has become clear since the case that the non-disclosure of clinical audit findings was widespread.  It has also become clear that the issue of disclosure was the subject of dispute among some elements of the relevant clinical community.  I can provide assurance that the Department was not aware of these issues until this controversy arose...<\/blockquote> <p>It is very difficult for people watching this today to understand or believe how this could be the case.  I would like an answer as to how the Department was not aware of this until the controversy broke.  Really and truly, the women of Ireland need reassurance about this.  While I am not suggesting Dr. Holohan is misinforming the committee, it is very difficult for people to understand this.<\/p><p>Dr. Holohan said he has been chief medical officer for the last ten years and he has escalated many issues to various Ministers, be it Ms Harney or Deputy Martin, over the years.  He has a long-standing history of doing this, which is to be welcomed.

In terms of the response, I acknowledge the scale of what has happened and of trying to put a cohesive response in place.  The screening programme is a relatively small service.  CervicalCheck has just over 30 staff, which includes managing and running the service day to day.  The helpline was effectively inundated in those first number of days with a very low response rate.  To date, there have been over 17,800 calls as of our report last night.  A total of 14,290 of those have been responded to.  This still leaves a very significant number.  As I think I explained at one committee meeting last week, I do not want to go over old ground but in simple terms, we set up four call centres to try to deal with this.  One is in Cork, which takes the initial calls.  Typically, it is able to handle 25% to 30% of the calls at the first point of contact from the women who are concerned.  All of the others are requesting callback from a clinician.  That is one of the key issues for us at the moment in terms of making enough clinical staff available to deal with the responses.  We triage those calls into a number of categories.  One is where a woman has a normal smear history so the call is taken to Limerick where the centre is based and they go on to the system to pull down the information for that woman so it is not actually just a phone call and a conversation.  It involves looking at their full clinical history so that we can then determine who is best placed to talk to that woman about the concerns she expressed.  If the woman has a normal smear history, our call centre in Waterford or public health take that call.  If there is an abnormal smear history, there are two centres in Dublin and Limerick, which we try to resource to take those calls.  The final category are people who have had a cancer history or colposcopy.  We have put a model in place for the hospitals where the women contact them directly.  It is fair to say that there is significant stress and strain in that model.  Obviously, we had to put it in very quickly.  We brought in some expertise around call centre management but it is after the act.  One would certainly not be doing this in the normal course of events.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the case mentioned by the Senator-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":1263,"content":"<p>This lady had a history of cervical cancer and she still had to have three contacts with the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#Z00500","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":1264,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

It came to me through a different source and I have asked for an arrangement to be put in place for her this morning.  We are taking them chronologically so that people are waiting for the shortest period of time possible but in terms of clinical resources, we are pulling the resources from the hospitals.  That is where the clinical staff are based.  The screening service itself has a very small pool of clinical staff who can answer those questions.  The cancer screening programme is also supporting it.  We are looking from all the agencies - those that are contracted and those that are not.  We have looked at cross-Border options.  We have tried to ensure that no stone is left unturned to maximise that.  We have made some progress but I accept that it is still an extensive delay for some people in getting through.  Our priority is to look at those women who have had a history first.  These women are being prioritised with the hospitals, which are working through those cases this week.

All of this stuff makes really interesting reading in the documentation provided so far.  The reason for this is that one can see a clear escalation in terms of the number of cases and what people were thinking along the way.  If we go to the March 2016 briefing note, we see the logging of cases.  Work is under way by the State Claims Agency to extend the architecture of the national incident management system to facilitate logging of incident cases for screening programmes.

There was a process CervicalCheck had started to instigate.  A laboratory suggesting CervicalCheck should not be sending letters to treating clinicians threatened the process.  In that context, I received a presentation the day before the first meeting, which for the record was in February.  I received a presentation from Professor Flannelly on the audit.  Although there are many other meetings I do not particularly remember, I remember a lot about the particular meeting because it was new information.  I remember initially feeling a sense of concern about the audit as to whether it was throwing up any factor or issue with the integrity of the screening programme.  I satisfied myself that it was not and was happy with that.  We addressed the issue with the laboratory and it was going to continue to engage, although that became a little more problematic in March, as can be seen from the briefings.<\/p> <p>  I also genuinely remember Professor Flannelly talking about the case from the perspective of what we should do as part of it.  CervicalCheck was certainly conscious to alert me to the fact that it was engaging in this and that it intended for patients to receive their information  I actually remember Professor Flannelly telling me that CervicalCheck would be providing the lady with all of the information on advice received from its solicitor.  I remember saying at the time that there was no need to wait for the solicitor and that the person could be given the information.  However, CervicalCheck was very conscious that, because it was engaging in the process with the intent that women would receive the information and knew that it clearly would result in cases, it wanted to ensure it could protect the totality of the programme.  It knew that cases would come up in carrying out the audit.  <\/p> <p>  From my perspective as a national director, it was very important to ensure there was nothing else within the findings of the audit that was troubling or concerning and that we had a safe programme.  We do have a very safe programme.  What is being found through the audit is within all of the normal parameters.  While I absolutely accept the criticism that the briefings are very process oriented and not personal, the conversations are personal.  There was a personal conversation about the difficulties in having that conversation.  However, as can be seen in the February briefing, there was a statement to the effect that this is what CervicalCheck did and that Professor Flannelly would meet patients, which she went on to do.  That is what happened at the first briefing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#DD00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":1436,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Keeffe for answering the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#DD00700","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":1437,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked me about Mr. Patrick Lynch and Mr. Liam Woods.

The advice I gave reflected on a review and examination of the international evidence which showed that, although it was almost counterintuitive, it was the case that mandatory open disclosure in all circumstances carried with it risks in the sense that it, first, sometimes conferred a view among medical practitioners that the risk of medical legal actions was increased, which could make them less likely and less willing to make such disclosures.  If it is applied as written in all situations, as opposed to being targeted at the most serious cases, as we plan to do, it will unnecessarily bureaucratise the reporting and potentially lead to mandatory disclosure.<\/p> <p>  The reality is culture is what is important as opposed to law.  The law may say something, but, frankly, doctors do not tend to look to it for guidance in conducting clinical practice.  Something in the law might lead to more box ticking style reporting.  We want to encourage the safe space and support the culture of open disclosure in its development by ensuring that when something goes wrong which is the reality and a feature of everyday clinical practice because the sciences, people and technologies are not perfect, the first thing that is done is that, rather than withdrawing from patients, as we have seen happen in some patient safety instances, doctors, nurses and other senior staff will metaphorically put their arms around the patients and support them through understanding.  That is a relationship that is built over time; it is not a single event.  Putting something in legislation on its own will not deliver that culture.  <\/p> <p>  The view is that the combination of mandatory reporting, where appropriate, and voluntary support by giving doctors assurance that protection will be available in wider circumstances if they come forward and do the right thing in the so-called safe space will lead to and support more a culture of open disclosure.  We will have standards for how that open disclosure should be done, recorded and so on.  The science on it, so to speak, is not absolute.  These are judgments.  There is not a huge body of international evidence in that regard, but it tends to point in that direction.  There are other areas of social science and so on where these questions also play out.  The extent of mandatory reporting can sometimes actually drive down reporting, increase fear on the part of those reporting and so on.  <\/p> <p>  That was the reason for the advice which the Oireachtas committee reflected in its report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#DD01800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":1448,"content":"<p>Is it possible to see the advice provided in 2015?

In the communication system, either up or down the line, the chain of command did not operate.  The communication that should have taken place never did.  This will be repeated time and again.

Some 10,666 women had requested callbacks from a clinician as of yesterday.  The number of women who have yet to receive one is now 3,562.  As to when this will be closed out, I note that at the moment there has not been a significant drop in call volume.  Effectively we have to plan on the basis of two things.  One is that we will have to plan to continue with this for a certain period, until people have a certain level of satisfaction.  Then the call volume may drop.  Second, I note that the CervicalCheck helpline was always there, but it had a different purpose.  It was intended to facilitate and advise.  My view is that in light of this we will have to strengthen it beyond the current week so that it provides greater assurance to women.  Moreover, the people manning the line will have to be clinical staff.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question about how long it will take, I think that will be contingent on the duration of the issue.  If people call us then we have an obligation to get back to them, and we will continue to do that.  That is challenging.  I described it earlier.  We need clinical staff, whom we are trying to pull out of services and hospitals.  Those women who have more complex needs, in the sense that they have a history of colposcopy or cancer, need to talk to an oncology or a gynaecology nurse as well as medical support.  We will have to monitor that week by week.  I cannot give a date by which we will have dealt with all the queries, because the situation is changing each day.  As I say, while there have been some dips in the number of outstanding queries, it has typically come back up again.<\/p> <p>  In the long term, I have mentioned that I do believe we will need to strengthen the helpline to provide support to people over the next six, nine or 12 months as we hopefully turn the corner, give women assurance on the screening service and deal with the many questions, some of which have been captured over the last week or two.

One is the communication with women themselves through the programme, the direct communication.  The other perspective concerns getting greater reassurance into the system.  We all talk to people who have different views - friends, relatives etc. - and as the Senator says, there is misinformation out there.  Hopefully over the coming weeks we will put a plan in place to try to create some reassurance.  That has been difficult, to be frank.  Although the issue has attracted huge attention, as in the situation the Senator describes, it is difficult to get simple messages across to people who are clearly and understandably very anxious, concerned and unsure of exactly what all this means for them.  We are seeing that in our hospitals.  Apart from the phone line that I mentioned earlier, they are getting a huge number of calls straight to their colposcopy units.  These are placing huge strains on the service.  It is our intention to bring together a small group of patients, general practitioners and key people to look at how we can navigate through this, and hopefully provide some reassurance and greater clarity for women.<\/p><p>To be blunt, the difficulty in the last six or seven days has been that with so much happening it is very difficult to translate that through.

It is hard to have the public health and public interest message communicate itself in a situation where we are also doing the historical record and the scrutiny and accountability.  Both are absolutely legitimate and I wonder, and it might not involve the players here at all, if there is any way we could give some collective thought to a more concentrated public health and public interest discussion on explanation and trying to put that out.

I will keep my comments short.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend the existing entitlement to unpaid leave from 18 weeks to 26 weeks.  We, in this country, are in a situation where our parental leave entitlements are among the lowest in Europe.  In total, there is an entitlement to about 60 weeks.  The average in Europe is almost 100 weeks.  This is not any kind of substitute for paid parental leave.  Obviously the Social Democrats and all of us want to see entitlement to paid parental leave being extended as soon as possible.  That, in the main, relates to the very early years in a child's life and I strongly support the proposal that all families should be facilitated in looking after their children for at least the first year of life at home, through paid parental leave.<\/p> <p>  Unpaid parental leave is a different matter.  It can be used in those early years but it principally gives flexibility to parents to balance their work obligations and their parental obligations.  It provides that kind of flexibility where they may go on a four-day week for a period, take time off during summer holidays from schools and that kind of thing.  It is an extremely popular measure.  In the main, it does not cost an awful lot.  There are some small recruitment costs for replacement staff but it does not cost a significant amount of money and, from the parents' point of view, it is a very popular move because it provides the flexibility that parents need to balance their work, life and family responsibilities.  It can be seen as a measure which supports women to remain in the workforce because it provides an element of flexibility.<\/p> <p>  Since this Bill moved through Second Stage, I have had a huge amount of correspondence from parents who strongly welcome it and keep asking, on a regular basis, when the law is going to change because it is such a popular option for people.  We also know that, in many cases, it can make sense from a financial point of view for a parent to take a certain amount of time out of the workforce.  When one considers the cost of participating in work and the extraordinarily high cost of childcare, sometimes it simply does not pay, financially.  The key thing that many women want to ensure is that they retain statutory rights relating to employment and that they can take leave at particular times, have that flexibility, and still maintain all of their employment and statutory rights.  I will leave it at that, with regard to the purpose of the Bill.  It is a family-friendly measure which is about facilitating work-life balance and it is also about retaining women in the workforce.  That is the motivation behind it and I look forward to the support of all members here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#A00700","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":1636,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.

I am surprised and a bit disappointed, therefore, that we have had no opportunity to consult with the stakeholders who will be impacted in both positive and negative ways.  It is one of the issues with Private Members' Bills which I have raised time and time again in the House and elsewhere.  They would be greatly enriched if we had proper pre-legislative scrutiny even before Second Stage such as all Government Bills go through along with other checks and balances.  We are where we are, however.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that many households may be unable to avail of unpaid leave.  As such, it is important that our policies in this area are coherent in both domestic and EU contexts and move forward in a progressive manner and in sync with each other.  We are all in agreement that we must do our utmost to help and support parents.  I remind the committee that over the last three budgets, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has secured an unprecedented 80% increase in the budget for childcare, which reflects the Government's commitment to parents and children.  In 2018 alone, investment in childcare will be &euro;487 million.  This investment is being used to improve access to high-quality affordable childcare for approximately 170,000 children and their families.  As the committee will be aware, free preschool services provided under the early childhood care and education programme have been extended and improved and measures have been put in place to reduce the cost of childcare.<\/p> <p>  The Government believes the focus should now be on introducing parental leave on a paid basis.  A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to increase paid parental leave during the first year of a child's life as research shows that children benefit most from parental care in that first year.  An interdepartmental working group has been examining proposals to give effect to this programme commitment and is in the process of putting the final touches to its report.  We hope to have that shortly.<\/p> <p>  At EU level, a new work-life balance directive is under discussion at working group level under the Bulgarian Presidency.  The proposed directive recognises that the provision of paid parental leave will be more effective and appropriate in encouraging fathers to be more involved in the caring role for their children, thus contributing to the promotion of gender equality.  The directive is part of a package of EU measures aimed at addressing the under-representation of women in employment and supporting women's career progression by creating improved conditions whereby they can reconcile their work responsibilities and family commitments.<\/p> <p>  We must support families and promote gender equality at the same time by bringing about a degree of cultural change in considered steps.  Women's empowerment is a key theme running through our programme for partnership Government.  As such, there are multiple policy objectives in this case which means a nuanced and sophisticated approach is required.  When it comes to improving and expanding our current family leave system, there are wider and more complex factors which I have set out above which this Bill does not consider.  As such, I may bring forward amendments to a number of sections on Report Stage.  I will outline those as we move through the Bill.  We also have a national strategy on women and girls towards which we are working to improve equality.  Just this morning and yesterday, I attended an international conference on equal opportunities for men and boys.<\/p> <p>  A great deal is happening at Council of Europe, EU and Government level in this area.  As such, the Deputy is right to bring this forward.  However, there are issues.  We must bear in mind the impact any change in legislation has on stakeholders and the need to involve them in the process.  If the Government brought forward legislation like this without involving stakeholders in some kind of discussion, there would be ruaile buaile.  We are where we are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#D00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1526485500,"counter":1645,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1526485500,"counter":1646,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":1647,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:&quot;(b) in subsection (2)(a) by substituting &quot;attains the age of 12 years&rdquo; for &ldquo;attains the age of 8 years&quot;,<br \/><br \/>(c) in subsection (2)(b)(ii) by substituting &quot;attained the age of 10 years but not 12 years&quot; for &quot;attained the age of 6 years but not 8 years&quot;,&quot;.<\/blockquote> <p>The purpose of this amendment is to reflect recent developments at EU level since we published the Bill.

It is sensible that this Bill should reflect current thinking at EU level.

We are in sync with the Deputy on that one.  <\/p><p> As every member of the committee will accept, families are best placed to determine what works for them and what supports they need.  I am sure that every member of the committee and the Houses will agree that as legislators and policymakers we have to listen to the needs of families, take on board their concerns and then figure out how we can best ensure that the necessary supports are in place.  In this context, the Government and my Department have received a number of representations from families asking for parental leave to be available in respect of children up to the age of 12.  Second, this is one of the foremost issues addressed in parliamentary questions on parental leave, so colleagues on all sides of the House have been tabling this.  <\/p><p> Increasing the qualifying age from eight to 12 is one of those issues where families know what they need.  It provides families with greater flexibility to determine what is best for them and what works for them.  Indeed, this is the type of measure that is easy to support.  Second, the Deputy's amendment and the Government's intended amendment would resolve another issue concerning the age of children and parental leave.  As we are all aware, section 6 of the Parental Leave Act 1998 provides for 18 weeks of unpaid parental leave in respect of a child up to the age of eight years, or 16 years in the case of a child with a serious illness or disability.<\/p><p> The age provided for in the Act is a statutory minimum.  It is at the discretion of individual employers whether they wish to extend the eligibility criteria for their employers to avail of parental leave beyond that minimum.  At present, the majority of companies in the private sector only permit parental leave to be taken up to the statutory requirement of eight years, whereas in the public sector it can be taken in respect of children up to the age of 13.  Therefore, the secondary effect of this amendment would be to produce an approximate parity between the two sectors.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#D00600","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":1650,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Section 2(a) of the Bill amends the Parental Leave Act 1998 to extend family leave from 18 weeks to 26 weeks.  It could be argued that this is a rapid increase, a case of too much too soon, and could have an adverse effect on some businesses, especially small businesses and employers, if it was implemented in one fell swoop.  The Government may propose amendments aimed at facilitating employers and businesses to adapt more easily to the provisions.  I may bring forward amendments to this effect on Report Stage.  This approach would allow employers sufficient time to implement any necessary measures to reduce the impact on their businesses, and to make sure that they have the necessary structures in place to facilitate the taking of leave.<\/p> <p>  Second, as the committee is aware, negotiations on a draft work-life balance directive are currently under way at EU level.  The Government wishes to highlight the need to ensure that whatever changes are made to domestic legislation will dovetail with the provisions and timeframe for transposing the directive.  <\/p> <p>  Section 2(b) of the Bill amends section 6(8) of the Act to ensure that a relevant parent should be allowed to benefit from the extended parental leave if they have already used their current allowance of 18 weeks.  Parents who have not used their entire entitlement will be allowed to claim the balance of their unused parental leave and the further eight weeks introduced in the Bill.  The Government supports this approach as all eligible parents should be eligible to claim their full entitlement to parental leave when extended.  However, the Government may bring the amendment forward on Report Stage to modify the wording in this regard.  The substance will remain as it is.<\/p> <p>  Section 2(c) of the Bill is a straightforward amendment to section 6(9) of the Parental Leave Act 1998, updating the reference to the Parental Leave (Amendment) Act 2006 with a reference to the Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#E00700","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":1657,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The proposed amendment in section 3(a) of the Bill raises an issue, as it seeks to replace references to \"18 working weeks\" in subsection (7)1 of the Act.  However, there is a problem with the amendment in that neither subsection 7(1)(a) nor section 7(2)(a) includes references to \"18 working weeks\", but refer to \"14 weeks\".

Before being elected to the House I had 20 years of being in business and there is no such thing as something that is free and has no real cost.

Big multinational corporations can handle things like this in their sleep.  It is when we get down to somebody running the local shop, running the local hairdressers, somebody in a village running the pub or somebody running a small manufacturing business that we need to recognise there are two things we need to consider, which are the work-life balance of people working and the impact on the industry and business in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#F02300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":1709,"content":"<p>I note what the members are saying and what the Minister of State has said, but this will not come in overnight.

These must be introduced properly after consultation where people, particularly small businesses, can be prepared for them and have an input.

The uptake of that has been very gratifying.  A total of 67% of young fathers have taken that.  We want to encourage and increase that even more so we are taking the steps in the direction; the issue of paid leave is what will really encourage people because many families will not be able to afford to take unpaid leave but they can take paid leave.  That is where the Government is trying to go.  I ask members to keep that in mind as well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#G00600","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":1717,"content":"<p>Given the Minister of State's response was to Deputy Chambers's question directly, did the Deputy indicate that he might like to come back?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#G00700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":1718,"content":"<p>With respect, when I hear about consultation from the Department of Justice and Equality around gambling and other issues, I see it as a delaying tactic.

I agree that pre-legislative scrutiny is a good thing and a good practice that we have developed but that is where one is talking about a new measure.  This is not a new measure.  It is an existing measure that has been there for some time and is merely an extension of that.  I repeat that it is an eight-week extension that can be spread over several years up to 12 years.  It is not a major change and will not be a sudden change all in one go.  I do not believe there is any need for pre-legislative scrutiny of it.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State also made a point about paid versus unpaid leave.  I said at the outset that I absolutely support the commitment the Minister of State has given to introduce paid parental leave so that children can be cared for in their home by a parent in the first year.  That needs to happen as quickly as possible and I think we would all be supportive of that.  However, this is a different measure.  This is not talking specifically about the early years.  It is talking about flexibility that is available to parents over the child's lifetime for those first 12 years.  It is an entirely different matter and measure and serves quite a different purpose.  This is not an \"either-or\" situation; it is in addition to something that already exists.  I think we would absolutely support the Minister of State if he brought forward proposals for 12 months paid leave.  This cannot happen too soon.  <\/p> <p>  This needs to be viewed in the context of Ireland being among the worst in Europe when it comes to parental leave entitlements.  We have a huge amount of catching up to do.  Much of our legislation in this area has been dictated to us by Europe, which has had a positive influence, but we have not brought forward legislation ourselves.  We have tended to drag our heels in respect of parental entitlements.  Too often, the views of employers have outweighed the needs and views of parents in this regard.  It is time that we got on with it.  This is a small improvement in one of the aspects of parental leave and flexible work options and the sooner it happens, the better.  I think most parents would feel that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#G01200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":1723,"content":"<p>I thought Deputy Shortall mentioned 12 months paid leave there.

I have great respect for Deputy Chambers but I disagree totally with the point he made.  There are a few aspects that are very important.  The first is that we should have consultation on any change.  The reason is very simple.  This country is littered with examples where we have passed legislation without properly thinking through the implications and have lived to regret it.  Deputy Chambers and the rest of this committee engaged in a process when we made a decision and through greater consultation, other parties have reversed that decision today on another Stage of the Bill.<\/p><p>People can argue for and against consultation and they can argue the merits of it one way or the other.  My view on it is simple.  If we have a change that is substantial, we should engage in consultation.  I believe the committee would be better off to have that as a guiding principle.  If we were making a change in another way and we excluded the notion of consultation with parents, people would be horrified at the idea.  There is no real loss in simply talking to everyone involved about a change such as this.  I am not arguing for a delay.  My understanding of this discussion is that everyone here is effectively supportive of this measure and wants to see it proceed.  Everyone is in agreement to try to make it work.  Indeed, the Government has an even more substantive proposal.  I do not believe there is anything greatly wrong in saying that a process of consultation would have benefited everyone involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#G01600","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":1728,"content":"<p>That is noted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#H00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":1729,"content":"<p>I argued for consultation but in a quick, efficient and effective manner.

If people want to do it, then they should do it and get on with it and give us the information and feedback.<\/p> <p>  It is not a political issue but rather a departmental issue across many Departments and it prevents legislation being progressed.  That affects the people we represent and the commitments we make.  I believe in consultation.  Reforms are promised.  One Minister of State has mentioned centralising the entire consultation process.  I know that is not what this Bill is about but there is a plan for a centralised consultation process that would move it away from Departments.  Perhaps it was the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, who mentioned it.  We need to do this more quickly than we have been doing it.  I have an interest in the gambling control Bill.  Every time I ask about it, consultation is the reason given for why we are delayed and we are six years down the line now.

We had a very constructive and productive select committee meeting in April and I thank members for their suggestions.  I look forward to continuing that discussion today.<\/p><p>We are focusing today on the community programme and the Charities Regulator.  I will say only a few words of introduction before discussing the programmes in more detail. <\/p><p><b><\/b>I have already noted in my previous opening statement some of the key features of the community programme.  The Department's 2018 Vote provides &euro;133.596 million in funding for a range of community programmes.  Two programmes, in particular, account for the bulk of this funding.  Over &euro;43 million is provided for the social inclusion and community activation programmes, SICAP.  I launched the 2018-22 programme in Limerick in April.  The aim of SICAP is to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement.  The 2018 allocation will provide for the first year of a new five-year programme of important supports for people in disadvantaged communities.  This will allow for the key essential front-line services delivered through earlier programmes to be maintained and further developed. <\/p><p><b><\/b>The second major programme is the community services programme, with an allocation of over &euro;46 million.  This programme provides financial supports to community organisations to deliver local services through a social enterprise model.<\/p><p><b><\/b>I want to mention a further critical part of the communities programme, namely, the libraries programme.  I was delighted to open the new state-of-the-art Athy library on 3 May.  It is a great community resource in its own right and a real symbol of the very dramatic changes that are happening in our libraries.  Better services for users and an increased role in providing community resources of citizens and businesses are just some of the features of modern libraries around the country.  I hope to launch later this year a new strategy for public libraries to capitalise on these developments and to drive the sector further forward in the coming years.<\/p><p><b><\/b>I want to affirm again the importance of these programmes and all the programmes in the wider community programme.  This is especially true in the context of the national planning framework, with its emphasis on the three themes of equality, well-being and opportunity.  The role of the Department in funding community development goes to the heart of those themes by supporting and empowering communities, particularly disadvantaged communities, and giving them the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from a new and more prosperous Ireland.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, might say a few words on the supports for volunteering and the Charities Regulator before we start the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018051600002#B00300","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1526484600,"counter":1757,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting us today to consider the communities and charities programmes of the Department.  As I noted at the last meeting, the Department has lead responsibility for developing the relationship between the State and community and voluntary sector and for setting the policy framework.  The intention is to strengthen and foster volunteerism in Ireland, building a support structure for volunteering locally from the bottom up.  The Department also provides support to national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, through the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO.  The SSNO provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national organisations in the sector, with a focus on organisations that provide supports to those who are disadvantaged.<\/p> <p>  The Revised Estimates provide for just over &euro;4.4 million in current funding in 2018 for the Charities Regulator.  The Charities Regulator is Ireland's national statutory regulator for charitable organisations.  It is an independent authority that was established on 16 October 2014 under the Charities Act 2009 and now comes under the remit of this Department.

I announced that &euro;190 million over five years had been secured, which is a substantial amount of money.  We are trying to target disadvantage and the people who have been left behind.  The unemployment rate has come down from 15% to under 5%.  Now we need to target others.  Recently, I was in Limerick where I met groups and individuals who had been involved in SICAP.  They were all delighted with it and the way the spoke about it was notable.  Some of them are now creating jobs and a lot of them are working.  What we intend to do with the new programme is to target those who need it.  We are trying to have individual programmes to accommodate persons who have really been left behind because of the recession and not been able to get into the workplace.  Some of them need to be reskilled and educated, while others need specific programmes to help them.  I am very pleased with SICAP and delighted with the &euro;190 million to be made available over the next five years.  I hope the level of employment will continue to increase and that more participants in the programmes will find or create jobs and that the funding we will have available will be used to support those in disadvantaged areas.  SICAP will run from 2018 to 2022.  Speaking to people on the ground who administer the programme, they are pleased.  Of course, we would like to have more - that is always the case, no matter what the scheme - but I am pleased with the funding provided.

The amount of money available for SICAP is good.  I am pleased with what has been given.  I was involved in a development partnership group some years ago and remember that SICAP helped people with financial difficulties.  There was also a small farmers programme at the time and it was extremely successful.  Sadly, the last time funding was given - I hope it will not be the case this time around and that there will be changes - it was directed towards helping groups such as the Roma.  There were not many of them living in west Cork, but there were certainly small farmers in serious financial difficulty.  They received good advice from an excellent worker, Mr. Joe Cronin, in Bantry who worked very quietly and delivered under the programme.  He helped many farmers who were in financial difficulty, but they are now in ten times more difficulty.  Can the programme be reinvented and rolled out?  It was definitely welcomed and proved effective in west Cork at the time.  I presume the position would be the same in any other rural community.  There are other areas that need to be looked at.  I refer to big housing estates such Clancool in Bandon.  The programme has been very beneficial.  However, we certainly need to look at helping small farmers.  There is no other word for it - many of them are on the poverty line and I would be lying if I described it in any other way.  They might not like to be described as being on the poverty line, but they are going through much difficulty.  <\/p> <p>  We are not talking about the community services programme, CSP.  However, I know groups that have community service workers and it is another scheme that has worked very well.  Goleen Community Council delivers a community services programme and has provided four part-time jobs.  I will not take anything away from the scheme, but the only worry I have is that if a programme has a manager - our group does not but other groups do - Pobal is now stating it will continue funding for the community services programme in an area but that the manager will be dropped.  It might be argued that the manager is needed, but it has to be proved, which I accept.  The bottom line, however, is that the local community group must make redundancy payments to the laid-off manager.  If it cannot afford to do so, Pobal will apparently pay, but it will be a penalty against the group.  In any work scheme - whether it is the rural work scheme, T&uacute;s or the community employment scheme - the voluntary community organisation should not be met with the penalty of having to meet the cost of a redundancy package.  If many of the people involved in organisations which are benefiting from the community services programme had known that, they would not have offered the job in the first place.  They could now be met with a fine hefty redundancy package bill.  The person being asked to step aside deserves to be given it, but it should not be the responsibility of the voluntary community organisation to pay.  Pobal should have factored it into the programme initially.  I know because I have tested it.  I have spoken to Pobal directly about a group that is going to lose its manager and that has been told, as I have, that it has a responsibility to meet the cost of the redundancy package.  If it does not have the funding, Pobal will pay, but it will be a penalty that will be applied to the group.  That is my reading of it.  The group will have to pay sooner or later.  <\/p> <p>  They are the points I wanted to make.  I know that they are detailed, but they are of importance to voluntary groups.  As ot was that sector that put me in D&aacute;il Eireann, I must look after it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018051600002#F00400","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1526484600,"counter":1785,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

He is quite correct: farmers have had a very difficult year - a difficult few years.  SICAP includes a scheme for low-income householders, which would include farmers, so they are targeted as well.  There should and can be a scheme for them.  As for the issue Deputy Collins raised regarding the CSP, I note the valid point he makes about groups that have redundancies or staff who might be leaving and that must find that money for them.  The problem with the CSP is that the Department only makes a contribution.  We only meet the cost of the staffing and the management.  We are not the employers.  The employers are the groups themselves.  I understand this can and does cause a difficulty.  As we go along, we are monitoring all these schemes and trying to see what we can do to improve them.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman also raised the CSP and the issue of other new groups coming in.  He is quite correct: &euro;46 million in funding is provided for budget 2018.  Part of the difficulty we have is that, while I think we had an extra &euro;1 million this year, we have brought in some new groups but we are also reviewing existing schemes.  I must be very careful to get new people in.  We must take people out of the scheme.  Something we are doing at present is carrying out a review of the CSP.  I need to deal with a situation I now see arising.  Pobal administers the scheme for me.  We make the rules and regulations and the guidelines.  I need to start looking at guidelines, particularly for real social enterprises that are doing well and get the few years of support from this scheme.  They should move on and let other groups in, but a review has been done of some of the groups that are not really social enterprises but are doing very good community work.  I need to be very careful.  This is something I am talking to my officials about, and they are very wary of it as well.  They are very supportive of these schemes and they accept that we need to look at ways and means of dealing with groups that may not be social enterprises.  The Revenue Commissioners may not be there for them to keep them in the CSP, but if they are doing a community service and a service the State is not able to provide, they should be supported.  If these communities do not provide that service for those people, they will not have a service, so I need to get that right.  The CSP, as I said, is working very well.  We supported more than 2,000 jobs last year, there were 1,670 employees, we have 306 managers and we support 400 organisations.  The scheme is working, but the Chairman asked a very valid question.  I am having reviews carried out and I would like to let new people in.  I do not want groups coming out because they do not meet the social enterprise criteria.  I need to categorise them.  To be fair to Pobal, it administers the scheme and the rules and regulations as we set them out.  I must be careful about the new rules and regulations and the guidelines that I set for the future.  If there is a social need there, I want to ensure it is met.  If it is being met by voluntary groups that are supported by this programme, I must ensure they are supported.  They are not social enterprises.  On the other hand - and Deputy Collins will understand this as someone who is very much involved in the social enterprise sector, if the social enterprises are doing very well and are getting State funding, sometimes they do not want to come off that funding even though they might have a fair balance on their books.  We must have a little fairness in the system.  I need new groups coming in, we need new ideas and we need to give other people a chance.  However, at the same time, if social enterprises are doing well and they can go out there and raise their own money, we should give them the start, the help and the support they need.  However, they must also think about the next groups that want to get in to get the start, the help and the funding they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018051600002#G00200","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1526484600,"counter":1788,"content":"<p>If it is okay to mention something about RAPID funding, I wish to highlight its importance.  I have direct involvement with a community group in Roscommon, and RAPID funding has been really important in helping us to apply for CCTV.  The point about RAPID funding is that in many ways it can supplement further grant assistance.  It is certainly great to see that money has been ring-fenced for that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the community services programme, I wish to compliment the work that has been done.  I recently visited Triest Press Limited in Roscommon town.  It received &euro;70,000 this year under the community services programme.  That is very important in terms of the work it does supporting people with intellectual disability.  Triest Press is very much dependent on that financial support, so it is really important we continue to increase the budget in coming years in order to support, as the Minister has said, such social enterprises.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask one question about SICAP, and I ask it with a rural social men's group in mind.  From speaking with different community groups, I have the sense that with SICAP we need to ensure the maximum benefit for the maximum number of people.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the throughput of people.  Perhaps there is an overemphasis on numbers fitting certain criteria rather than on the benefit that accrues from people being involved continuously.  I will give a brief example.  Roscommon, I think, is the only county that has social rural men's groups.  These people are very dependent on that group.  They attend it every week.  There are three groups around the county.  For example, a number of men have written a book recently on their experiences of life, etc.  The group is really important in meeting their needs.  This goes back to what Deputy Collins mentioned in that they are predominantly farmers.  Because they have attended over a number of years, they do not seem to meet the criteria.  That seems to be the best vehicle for them in terms of trying to secure funding.  I would just like a bit of clarity.  The numbers may not be high, but the impact it is having on these people is significant.  I am probably not explaining the matter very well, but perhaps the Minister can clarify the matter.  It is the throughput of numbers versus the quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018051600002#G00300","speaker":"1415"},{"type":"speech","time":1526484600,"counter":1789,"content":"<p>SICAP and the communities programme are valuable programmes.  Regarding SICAP, I gave the committee the figures earlier, including the number of people involved.  It is not really about volumes; it is more about targeting the people in need.  In this particular round, we want to ensure we target the people most in need, the people who need to be targeted now.  Before SICAP was announced, we did carry out a review, we did talk to people and some changes were made to the programme.  It is a programme that is working very well and one I want to see continue.  I hope we will see the success we had with the programme from 2015 to 2017.  I threw out the figures to the committee earlier: 110,000 people on a one-to-one basis and 5,000 local communities supported.  Jobs were gained from people setting up their own business and other people going into employment.  However, the greatest thing to me is the 9,720 people who gained extra qualifications to give them an opportunity to get back into the workplace again, to retrain and to be assisted.<\/p> <p>  Senator Hopkins also spoke about the RAPID programme, and I hope to announce that funding at the end of the month.  She is quite correct: last year, we did announce that funding.  To be fair to the local authorities, which I must compliment, it was late enough in the year when we actually allocated that funding.<\/p><p>Rather than looking to see the areas of greatest need, we just did it.  On the next occasion, there will be a dedicated amount for each county and we will be identifying the areas of greatest need with a view to ensuring those areas are targeted.  Both schemes are working very well.  We want to ensure that the people we need to target and who need to be on these schemes will be on them.  It is not about the numbers game; it is about the quality of service that given to those who need it.  We must ensure that people who need the service most are targeted and that they are given the opportunities which will give them a chance in life that, for whatever reason, they may not have had in the past.  The service will deal with people in all sections of society and it is important that the programme is continued.

In all the briefs we receive, there is a fetish for numbers.  As the Minister of State knows, however, the temptation is to go for the low-hanging fruit, namely, the person nearest to the labour market who might get into it without any assistance.  This means that a company can tell the Department and the auditor what a great job it has done because it has placed a certain number of people in employment.  The reality is that SICAP was to focus on the people who would find it most difficult to gain employment, namely, those who are farthest removed from the opportunity to work.<\/p> <p>  We need to have a frank discussion on ensuring that we really go into the areas of most deprivation and cater for the people who are furthest away.  I think the Minister of State needs to have a discussion with his ministerial colleague in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  As he knows - I have been saying this throughout my 20 years in politics - the system and a certain number of politicians seem to believe that everybody will get a commercial job.  I know the Minister of State works on the ground with the real people.  I know that we all get people visiting our constituency offices who will never get conventional commercial jobs.  There should be a link between SICAP and getting people on the first step of the ladder.  If they jump the second step, that is brilliant; if they become multimillionaires, that is even better.  In the meantime, however, let us be realistic.  We know the effect that people being unemployed and idle all day has on their children.  We also know that there are problems with illness in some cases and addiction issues in others.  I am of the view that if we could get those to whom I refer into schemes - community employment schemes, T&uacute;s schemes or whatever - as a first step in order that they have a purpose in life and a reason to get up in the morning, that would be welcome.  Good and well if they progress and good and well if they do not.  They would still be doing a lot better than if they were doing nothing.<\/p> <p>  I have a concern about the RAPID programme.  My concern is simple.  We had mapped out the RAPID programme areas and these areas stand out starkly.  There are poor people everywhere but what we know is that the neighbourhood effect of poverty multiplies the deprivation that people suffer.  We know, for example, that if all the children in a really deprived area attend the same school, the issues are multiplied.  It more difficult for people to avoid getting involved in drugs and harder to do well in education because the culture is to be \"agin you\" all the time.  Has the RAPID programme got a reference to those areas or to more newly mapped areas?  Obviously, areas of deprivation have to be updated but the concept of the programme being focused on these hard-to-get-to areas, many of which are around the M50 and in the city centre, parts of which are booming and others of which are bust.  Certain parts of Ballina, Galway city and Limerick city - although it is quite widespread across the latter - suffer deprivation.  Is the RAPID programme for those areas?<\/p> <p>  This leads me to my final question.  There were two elements to the RAPID programme.  First, the direct fund that was used to co-finance actions with local authorities or other agencies.  This included a top-up on capital sports projects so that if a sports facility was being built, those involved were not obliged to collect as much money.  There was a further element to it that was really useful whereby Departments were told that when they were assessing applications for capital sports grants, those from RAPID areas were entitled to get five extra points just because those areas were designated under the programme.  We established the area implementation teams and we went to every Department and agency and asked questions.  For example, we asked what the Garda could do in the context of providing additional community policing in RAPID areas.  We asked F&Aacute;S, as it was at the time, what it could do in terms of providing special training courses outside the centres and right in the heart of the areas in question in order that people would attend them.  We also asked what the teams assessing capital sports grant applications could to in the context of giving extra marks in order that, all things being equal, the RAPID areas would have an advantage.  In most cases, those areas, due to their very nature, are at a disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  People who had to live in housing estates that were in the RAPID areas were on the local area implementation teams.  These people walked the walk and talked the talk every day of their lives.  I am worried that local community development committees, LCDCs, will get this and will try to manipulate it into every area, except those that are the poorest.  The problem towns in County Galway are Tuam and Ballinasloe.  In that context, it would be very noble of a county-wide LCDC to make sure that everything is focused towards not only on Tuam and Ballinasloe but also on the really deprived part of both towns.  I am not trying to attack the Minister of State; it is just that I have a genuine concern in this regard.  What is the Minister of State doing to ensure that what I have outlined will not happen?

I was at the Balmoral show earlier and I am only back now.  All of the people in that part of the world send their best wishes.<\/p> <p>  I have one or two points that I wish to raise.  Broadly in many parts of rural Ireland there is a dire need for the concept of alternative or additional farm enterprise.  We have many small farmers across the vast areas of the north west, where the holdings are very small.  In effect, it is unprofitable for those individuals to farm their properties.  They cannot make a living from their farms alone.  They need off-farm activity in order to make a living or they need to be doing something additional on their farms.  In the 1980s and 1990s, the then Department for Agriculture and Food funded various alternative farm enterprises.  Many farmers went into mushroom production, some went into keeping chickens or turkeys.  What happened was that the pressure of economies of scale came into play in all of those industries.  In order to survive, one had to either become a very big producer or get out of the sector.<\/p><p>I used to work in the mushroom industry and I worked with growers all over the west of Ireland.  In many parts of Galway, Roscommon, Mayo and all over the country, there were growers with five and six mushroom tunnels.  They all went to the wall and the one that had 30 or 40 tunnels kept going.  There is a dire need to try to do something to make the small farm viable.  Representatives of Macra na Feirme were in yesterday evening saying that a farm almost had to be able to keep two families as the older people and younger people coming on had to get a living from it.  Most farms in many parts of the country cannot do that.  It can only be done if there is an alternative enterprise on the farm that can work for these people but they need assistance to be able to establish that enterprise.  It is an opportunity for the Department in particular because it has a focus on rural areas and matters of deprivation, as referenced by Deputy O'Keeffe.  We need to find some way of making the family farm a viable entity.  If we can do that, we could sustain many more parts of rural Ireland.  It will require money and assistance.<\/p><p> I was at the Balmoral show today and there was a food tent that was full of family businesses.  People were growing potatoes and they discovered they were not getting the price of them so they started to mash them.  Now they have a different product to sell.  The same thing is happening with cheeses and various other products.  For people to be able to do this they need the assistance of the Government and that little leg up.  There is an opportunity in that regard.<\/p><p> I know the Minister has probably been beaten with the following matter several times regarding rural social schemes and the work being done in them.  It is a very good scheme and it is working well but the problem we have is that many people are looking to get on it, with community projects that have the work to do, but the JobPath people are getting letters for jobs that do not exist.  I know an elderly woman who might beat me across the head if she heard me calling her elderly who was called into JobPath.  She is in her early 60s and she had looked after her parents, who had passed away.  She was seeking a job but does not drive a car.  She lives 35 miles away from the JobPath centre.  She had to go twice a week to the centre to learn how to write a CV for a job that does not exist, which is nonsense.  If she could get on some scheme, she would be happy enough to do that and the community would be quite happy to have her.  There must be some common sense brought into this.  The direction of JobPath, etc., is causing a problem so there must be greater co-operation between this Department and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in that regard.<\/p><p> I see the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, is here.  There is a proposal for a new by-law for pike fishing.  Perhaps we could get a briefing on that at some point as we must look at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018051600002#H00500","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526484600,"counter":1798,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v makes some valid points.

I would like the committee to invite departmental personnel to speak to this.  Within the action plan we meet representatives of Departments on a one-to-one basis.  I have spoken with people in the Department about renewing these schemes.  The Deputy is correct that people want to stay in these schemes.  We need to review that practice.  Deputy Collins made the very valid point earlier that it is more difficult now to get people to go on these schemes, so we should leave those who are already on them if they are happy to remain.  I will ask my officials about this and I will discuss it on a one-to-one basis with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty.  Like the Deputy, I believe the rural social scheme to be one of the best schemes ever introduced.  We are getting tremendous value for money and it does great community service in its work.  There is a brilliant benefit to the scheme.<\/p> <p>  At the last Question Time the Deputy raised the matter of administration of the RAPID scheme.  There was a value-for-money policy review of RAPID done in 2011 and the recommendation was made that any follow-up programme should not be implemented in the same way.

I am not hiding information and I have no problem with any of the information going out for any scheme.  I can give some figures on the urban and rural parts of the RAPID scheme.  We had &euro;5 million last year and &euro;2.5 million was ring-fenced for the Dublin north inner city.  If ever an area needed such support, it was there.  Other areas in Dublin and bigger cities around the country also need such support.  The other &euro;2 million was divided by allocating &euro;64,500 to 31 local authorities.  The Deputy mentioned local community development committees, LCDCs, and asked if they will target the areas that need it most.  I hope they will and we will have to monitor them to ensure the funding is going where it is supposed to.  The RAPID programme is there to deal with areas that need to be dealt with.  When we announce the scheme, we will highlight this to the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  I realise what the Deputy is saying about LCDCs.  It is supposed to be more democratic and there are more community groups involved.  These people are on the ground and are supposed to know what is happening.  It is way it is being done and if we need to look at the scheme again, we will have to do it.  The most important accomplishment at the end of last year was to get out the &euro;5 million as the scheme had not been announced for a while.  I was pleased to be able to get the &euro;5 million out.  As I said in the D&aacute;il, I visited Dublin's inner city and the projects I saw there are a credit to people on the ground.  They targeted new communities and people suffering real disadvantage.  They gave young children an opportunity when it comes to reading and writing, as well as preschool activities, and it provided help and support.<\/p> <p>  I would like to have more money for the RAPID programme and be able to target more areas but I must live within budget.  We will go at that process again soon.  I would like to see more money going to disadvantaged areas in particular.  The Deputy is quite correct in that it affects urban and rural areas.  There are areas in the country that need more support, help and funding.

The level of compliance required at the small level, where there might be a small charity in a local area where everybody knows what is happening anyway, appears to be the same as what is required for a major national charity that would be handling millions and where international elements could be involved as well.  Does the committee need to examine this again and, if necessary, amend the legislation to provide for <i>de minimis<\/i>, as I call it?  In other words, it would provide that under a certain level the requirements would be minimal.

One is that a large amount of money could be defrauded.  The other is that the more anonymous the charity is and the more it is operating in a big atmosphere, the less the local old-fashioned control is exerted whereby the people know what is happening.  Should we investigate what effect it is having on volunteering, people serving on committees and so forth?

They have gone way over the top here.  It is a heavy-handed set-up.  That does not mean people are being over-rude as such.  One is not talking to anybody but one gets a letter.  I was given a letter the other day from a community voluntary organisation in which the organisation was told it did not comply.  The members are elderly and had left it to an accountant.  Many of them in that situation are doing what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said.  They are just walking away and saying, \"To hell with it, volunteerism is a joke\".  However, the letter told them that if they did not comply, they faced a fine of &euro;300,000 or jail.  In the name of God, where have we gone?  These are voluntary people in the community and not one of them has ever taken a brown cent home.  They might have misread a letter and did not respond or whatever, but where are we going with a fine of &euro;300,000 or jail?  It is dictatorial talk.<\/p> <p>  I questioned members of voluntary groups - I do not know their correct title.  Quite a number of voluntary groups have said, \"Look, we had &euro;6,000, &euro;2,000 or &euro;9,000 in the account but we have had it.  We are gone, off the pitch.  We are not taking this hassle anymore.\"  They collected for a certain cause and left the money in the account because something similar to it might arise again.  Then they would have gone back out to do the walk or whatever.  I asked where that money went because it was never clear to me where it went, but it was taken back into the system and poured back out.  Take the example of a group in Castletownbere.  The money, &euro;8,000, was taken back because the group could not comply with the rules or did not want to get into that hassle because they are 70, 80 or 90 years of age.  That money should have gone back into Castletownbere or into the area where it was taken from, but instead it has gone into a system and nobody seems to know where is that system.  Perhaps the Minister could provide me with that detail.  The bottom line is that we are killing off volunteerism.  That is the last thing that should be done.  Every effort should be made to support the voluntary sector and the men and women who are out day and night, and especially late at night, trying to do the job properly.<\/p> <p>  I was in about 20 voluntary organisations but some of them have disbanded because of this.  I am in one organisation that pays &euro;3,500 for insurance.  It is a voluntary organisation and nobody is taking home a brown cent from it.  I do not know how many thousand we are paying in accountancy fees but it is approximately &euro;5,000.  We are totally dependent on a lottery we conduct every week.  It is a successful lottery because I and other members of the committee are out every Saturday night selling tickets.  It is &euro;1.50 for a ticket and &euro;5 for four tickets.  That is our survival.  To comply with everything, we will soon have to have solicitors and accountants around the table when we are talking, instead of getting on with the duties and the work we want to do.  We are trying to be compliant.  We also have to be vetted by the Garda.  One must be vetted because one is on the community council.  If I am driving the bus to bring people into the social centre, I must be vetted by the Garda for that as well, yet I am in the same organisation.  What the hell is wrong?  A is not talking to B at all.  There is a lot of Garda vetting and fooling around, but the work we should be doing on the ground is not getting done because we are trying to comply with rules and regulations.  If we do not, we will get into a heap of trouble.<\/p> <p>  First, I wish to find out where this money is gone.  If it is gone out of a rural community, it should not have been taken from that community.  It was collected genuinely and held in an account.  It should have been given back to that community and redistributed to the organisations that ticked the boxes.  However, the boxes are getting harder and harder.  Of the 20 voluntary groups I was involved with, there are only nine or ten left.  Ten are gone because they could not comply with the rules.  The Minister will say that there has to be some type of control, but there must be a reasonable effort to keep groups in operation.  Stop sending out letters about &euro;300,000 fines.  I had to stop that letter going to the rest of the committee because I would have been attending a few funerals due to the fright some of them would have got.  They are all genuine honest people.  If they saw the words \"&euro;300,000\" and \"jail\" on a letter, they would have finished the organisation which has delivered a great deal for the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018051600002#L00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1526484600,"counter":1833,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  First, this is National Volunteering Week and I was in Galway this morning to launch a report from the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, and Volunteer Ireland on rural volunteering, its impact and the positivity of rural volunteering in the sector.  I agree that times have changed compared to the easiness at one time of volunteering not just with regard to the requirements of this Department, but also with regard to Garda vetting, Tusla and the responsibilities involved if one is looking after or training young people.  That is right and proper.  Times have changed and that is in place.<\/p> <p>  Last week, I launched a report of the consultative panel on governance of charitable organisations.  It is worth reading.  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, it is a question for the committee as to whether it should examine this area, but that report is worthwhile in terms of the recommendations.  The panel certainly agreed with the need for proportionality.  I do not have the figures with me but I believe 85% of charities do not have employees and a very small number, 5%, have more than 200 employees.  Clearly, proportionality and not treating everybody the same are hugely important.  That is why the consultative panel recommended not going the route of a very onerous burden in respect of governance but looked at a code and simpler rules for smaller charities.  It would be worth looking at that report launched last week.<\/p> <p>  Volunteering is hugely important for urban and rural communities.  The Deputy is correct that we do not wish to frighten anybody away or discourage people.  The Department has funded Volunteer Ireland in terms of volunteer centres, volunteer information centres and to provide training and guidance to organisations and trustees about their responsibilities and to help them along with what is required.  We have funded volunteer organisations in that respect.  Volunteer Ireland is proposing the development of a national vision and action plan for volunteering in Ireland and, as part of that, a monitoring and evaluation plan setting out clear baselines, targets and key performance indicators for the outcomes and actions being proposed.<\/p><p>We all very much respect and understand the importance of volunteering and want to keep it as simple as possible.  However, we also acknowledge that there has been a reduction in the general public's trust in charities because of what happened in a small number of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018051600002#L00300","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526484600,"counter":1835,"content":"<p>They were big charities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018051600002#M00200","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1526484600,"counter":1836,"content":"<p>Yes, they were.

If the Minister of State will wait five minutes, I will have no problem going up to my office to get a copy of the letter, which I can show him.  In the 30 years the organisation in question has existed, not one of its members has gone home with money in his or her pocket.  The letter received by one member was not sent to the rest of the organisation's committee because I stopped it in time.  It would have terrified and worried the board whose members are elderly.<\/p> <p>  The other matter is that if there is money to be taken from a community for genuine reasons, the elderly people just want to give up.  They might have &euro;2,000, &euro;4,000, &euro;6,000 or &euro;8,000 in their accounts.  I want to see that money go back to the community it came from because it was collected from the community.  If the Minister does not have that information now, I have no problem with that.  Where is the money that should go back into the community?  Where has it gone?

Changes have been made to ensure checks and balances are in place.  Are there plans to introduce specific measures to support volunteers as they deal with the bureaucratic nature of the system?  It is important to support volunteers.  As a young representative who is involved in a number of committees in my community, I am concerned that if we fast forward ten, 15 or 20 years, the level of work required and the bureaucratic nature of the system will result in young people deciding not to take on voluntary roles.

They match volunteers who have particular skills with organisations which are seeking volunteers.  I am aware from work with the Galway Volunteer Centre that approximately 12,000 people have signed up as members in the past ten years.  Funding from the Department covers the costs of offices, websites and other facilities that allow people to engage with volunteer centres.  That work is extremely important.  The figure I cited does not account for people who directly volunteer.<\/p> <p>  We want to encourage volunteering.  We have a pilot programme in three volunteer centres in Galway, south Dublin and Dublin to train trustees about their responsibilities.  We will assess the programme at the end of the year to see if it can be rolled out nationwide.  We also have a budget line for volunteering.  We will continue to support Volunteer Ireland, Young Social Innovators, the volunteer centres and the volunteer information centres.  We will also expand budgets where we can, subject to approval.

I do not understand the point in me giving somebody money and getting 80% of my money back to spend and then they can determine the rules with it.  I would be better keeping the 100% and spending it myself.  I did not understand the logic that we would up our contribution voluntarily to the EU and try to get other countries to do the same when we are net contributors.  Therefore, for every euro we put in I do not know if we get 80 cents back.  It is something like that.  The Minister is saying the CAP is great but we put in much more to pay for the CAP than the CAP pays us back.  It has been that way for the last five years.

I always felt that with Exchequer funding it should be a continuous programme.  There is no reason it would not be and that we would not go into this cycle of closing it down for three years and starting it up for four years.  Since it is mainly an Exchequer funded programme we would keep running it and when we get the European money we would break in what we can get, throw it in the pot and keep the rest going with Exchequer funding.

Let us run it on a continual basis and whatever comes the lucky way from Brussels let us take it but the rest should be Exchequer funded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018051600002#P02300","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1526484600,"counter":1868,"content":"<p>I can say the same from my own Department.

There was an accident there and the whole city was held up for at least an hour and half, I reckon.  Nothing was moving from the Port Tunnel and the traffic was backed up as far as the airport, I believe.  Such congestion is happening everywhere.  The M1 and the M50 are regular examples of same.  We will also discuss issues surrounding the Luas and the proposed College Green plaza.  Last February, the committee met a range of representatives from Dublin City Council, Dublin Bus, Transdev, AA Ireland, the Irish Taxi Drivers' Federation and the Taxi Alliance of Ireland regarding traffic congestion in the College Green area.

I am joined by my colleagues, Pat Maher, director of network management, and Nigel O'Neill, director of commercial operations.  I understand that the committee wishes to focus on traffic congestion in the Dublin area, the proposed College Green civic plaza, Luas and related matters.<\/p> <p>  I will start with growing M50 congestion.  With a return to economic growth, the national roads network serving the greater Dublin area has experienced significant levels of growth and, in turn, is handling record volumes of traffic.  There has been continuous growth on the M50 since the completion of the upgrade in 2010.  As the economic recovery accelerated, so did traffic growth on the M50.  The overall level of increase in traffic on the M50 in the five years from 2012 to this year exceeds 30%.  We have seen significant increases in commuting to the city from 2014 along the M1, M2, M3, M4 and N7 and M7, with associated follow-on trips on the M50 and inside the M50 box.  Year-on-year growth on the Dublin radial routes has averaged 4.3% per annum over the past three years, while growth across all sections of the M50 has averaged 4.7% per annum.  The increase in traffic volumes has resulted in the return of traffic congestion to the M50, particularly during the morning and evening peaks.  Peak time duration has also expanded.  Typically, weekday morning peaks extend from 6.30 a.m. to 9.30 a.m. and evening peaks extend from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.<\/p> <p>  These increases have impacted negatively on the safe and efficient operation of the M50.  Increasing traffic congestion leads to peak-hour delays and an increase in incidents such as minor rear-end collisions.  Each such collision results in significant further congestion, so there is a need for incidents to be dealt with quickly.<\/p> <p>  TII has undertaken a range of initiatives to mitigate the impacts of increased traffic volumes and resultant congestion at peak times.  We have significantly improved the incident response regime on the M50 in recent years.  In 2015, we initiated the interagency incident co-ordination group, which includes the principal stakeholders involved in the management of the M50 and its approach roads.  The members include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Dublin Fire Brigade, the four Dublin local authorities, the motorway traffic control centre and TII.  The co-ordination group meets as required but not less than once per quarter to consider and address issues arising in the operation of the M50.  Four incident support unit vehicles operate on the M50 during morning and evening peaks, available to assist at incidents ranging from broken down vehicles to rear-end impacts to more significant incidents.  At present, the average incident response time is 13 minutes.  We have located three tow-away vehicles strategically around the M50 at peak times to allow rapid response and early removal of broken down vehicles.  In 2017, the median time to clear an incident on the M50 was 29 minutes.  This is a significant improvement which has been achieved year on year.<\/p> <p>  TII has implemented further measures to manage major incidents and congestion at junctions.  We have instigated a new system of emergency diversion route signage, whereby in the event of a prolonged incident or closure on a section of the M50, alternative routes are signed.  The diversion routes have been signposted using route-specific symbols on the M50 from the M1 to the M7.  These have been agreed with the emergency services and local authorities.  These routes are typically on roads parallel to the M50.  However, these routes offer limited capacity in their own right.  The operational plan for their use includes the setting of variable message signs on the M50 mainline and direction by garda&iacute; and motorway contractors.  The signage is continuous from start to finish along the diversion route.  In addition, we have implemented changes to the lining and lane marking layout at the mainline merge points at some M50 junctions.  This has given increased priority to traffic on the mainline and has helped to reduce the impact of merging traffic on the mainline flows.  However, such measures simply \"sweat the asset\" rather than bringing significant capacity improvements to the operation of the M50.<\/p> <p>  We are currently in the design and procurement phase for a new mandatory variable speed limit and lane control system on the M50, with the intention of commencing operations in late 2019 or early 2020.  The purpose of this initiative is to smooth the flow on the M50 by regulating speeds.  This measure reduces the amount of flow breakdown and improves journey reliability.  Drivers speeding up when a gap appears and braking suddenly, together with jumping from lane to lane, are factors leading to flow breakdown and increased congestion.  Mandatory variable speed limits work by triggering a reduction in permissible speeds before congestion reaches a critical level.  If appropriate speed limits are obeyed, traffic flow will be smoother with a greater volume of traffic being accommodated.  The effect of the variable speed limits and the smoother traffic flow is to limit the amount of rear-end collisions.  This reduces the significant disruption and delay caused by minor collisions.  Unfortunately, an incident in one direction causes almost equivalent delays in the opposite direction due to \"rubbernecking\".<\/p> <p>  In addition to the display of variable speed limits, the new electronic signs will display lane control signals - red X and green arrow - that will allow lanes to be closed off in advance of an incident location, thereby protecting the people involved in the incident and our colleague emergency services and motorway operators attending the incident.  I have sent around some photographs of this layout to the committee. Current Irish legislation does not allow for the setting of variable speed limits in response to traffic conditions or the enforcement of red X lane control.  Accordingly, new road traffic legislation will be required to give effect to these provisions.  Sophisticated monitoring, control and enforcement technology will be required to operate a variable speed limit system, all of which will be conducted at our motorway operations centre.  This system will be in place at the end of 2019 and in operation when the legislative changes are effected.<\/p><p>The overall cost will be in the region of &euro;50 million.  I stress that these measures will only marginally improve the carrying capacity of the M50.  The primary benefit from these initiatives will be a safer and more reliable journey.  More fundamentally, traffic growth on the M50 quickly erodes all minor improvements in the capacity of the motorway.  Given the current rate of growth, the need to address the management of traffic demand on the route is becoming acute.  Unless demand management measures as set out in the M50 demand management report are introduced, complemented by additional public transport investments, the level of traffic growth will ultimately result in an intolerable level of congestion and economic loss and the failure of the motorway to adequately fulfil its strategic functions.  Without demand management in the form of multipoint tolling, M50 customers will continue to pay in terms of lost time and productivity.  Ultimately, the decision to proceed with these demand management measures is a matter for Government and not one that TII is currently pursuing.<\/p><p> TII continually monitors the performance of the national roads network and collects data relating to traffic volumes, average speeds, journey times and peak hour spreading.  TII publishes its annual national roads network Indicators, which give information on transport trends.  A copy of these indicators has been circulated to the committee for information.  This information informs the development of short, medium and long-term schemes aimed at addressing the impacts of congestion and maximising the efficient use of the current infrastructure.  A number of schemes identified by TII to address congestion in the Dublin area have been included in the National Development Plan 2018-2027 either for delivery or for further development within the lifetime of the plan.  Details of these proposals are included in the supplementary information accompanying this presentation.<\/p><p> The Luas cross city extension to the green line came into passenger service at 2 p.m. on Saturday, 9 December 2017.  That day marked the return, after 68 years, of electric trams in passenger service on O'Connell Street and other places between St. Stephen's Green and Broombridge.  The Luas attracts high passenger demand.  Growth in numbers since the extension of the green line came into service has been high &ndash; 28% increase on the green line and 5% increase on the red line between January 2017 and January 2018.  At times, Luas has not provided a full service to customers, with problems compounded in mid-March following the impact of Storm Emma and an electrical fault with the new trams.  The reliability of Luas services has been improving progressively since mid-March.  The electrical problem that affected the new Alstom trams has been resolved with five of these trams now incorporated into the fleet for passenger service on the green line.  The sixth tram is undergoing testing and commissioning and is due to enter passenger service in the next week or so.  The seventh tram is due to be delivered on 25 May and will soon enter passenger service after a commissioning period.  The five new trams currently in service have greatly improved the tram availability situation.  Transdev, the operator of the Luas, has been operating a full peak service on both the red and green lines for several weeks.  Several additional services in the morning peak have been provided since April making use of the new trams.<\/p><p> Further improvements to passenger services will be made over the summer, after all the new trams have entered passenger service, with the following enhancements: on the red line, Monday to Saturday, two out of three trams will operate to and from the Point and one out of three trams will operate to and from Connolly, compared to the existing 50:50 split between the Point and Connolly while, on the green line, the Luas cross city section will have a journey time of between 23 and 25 minutes compared with 27 minutes currently.  There will be an improved service between Parnell and Broombridge, and southbound services from Parnell between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. will operate every four minutes compared with every five minutes at present.  I thank our colleagues in Dublin City Council and the National Transport Authority, NTA, for working with us to improve these journey times across the city.<\/p><p> While the extension to the green line is realising substantial benefits for customers and for the Dublin region, it has experienced a number of problems in its first few months of operations.  All parties have worked hard to overcome these problems.  I will now outline some of the key problems that have been addressed.  The first longer tram was delivered to Dublin on 13 November 2017 and subjected to extensive testing as required by the Commission for Railway Regulation.  The tram was put into passenger service for the first time on 7 February 2018.  The new tram operated in passenger service in the morning peak on the Sandyford&ndash;Bride&rsquo;s Glen&ndash;Parnell&ndash;Sandyford line.  The second new tram came into passenger service on 20 February.  These two new longer trams were in regular service during morning peak periods.  On 12 March, the first of the new trams failed in service and the following day, the second new tram also failed in service with the same fault indicated.  Alstom, the tram manufacturer, assembled and brought in a troubleshooting team from France on 14 March.  Alstom traced the root cause of the electrical fault to the control board for the static converter.  The first two new trams returned to passenger service on 4 and 5 April, respectively, and another was made available for passenger service on 13 April.  The fourth was made available for service on 18 April, while the fifth new tram was delivered to Sandyford on 6 April and has been available for service from 2 May.  The sixth is currently undergoing commissioning and the seventh and final new tram is scheduled for delivery on 25 May.<\/p><p> Many issues cam together on 13, 14 and 15 March.  Tram availability on the green line was significantly below requirements for the morning peak period on each day.  To deliver a full service on the line, we need 29 trams to be available, but on those days only 24 to 25 vehicles were available, which led to increased overcrowding of morning peak trams.  Difficulties in managing a backlog of vehicle maintenance, and the need to take the two new longer trams out of passenger service because of the electrical fault contributed to the shortfall in tram availability.  A mitigation measure had already been identified to address the maintenance backlog to secure sufficient tram availability in March by extending the overhaul date for some trams until the end of March.  The maintenance resources freed up were scheduled to redeploy on 28 February to clearing the backlog of maintenance for the trams.  However, Storm Emma struck on 1 and 2 March.  This storm could not have come at a worse time.  The storm exacerbated the situation by causing significant disruption to tram maintenance and availability.  Virtually all maintenance resources were redeployed to clearing snow, fixing significant numbers of faults caused by the storm, restoring partial services over the weekend and recovering the entire Luas system for the Monday morning peak on 5 March.  The temporary extension of the overhaul programme did improve tram availability, once the maintenance resources were switched from recovering from Storm Emma and full service was gradually restored from the week commencing 19 March.  Tram availability required for peak times was stabilised and the delivery of services is operating at planned levels.<\/p><p> I would like to address the issue of the O'Connell Bridge-Burgh Quay junction, as the running of the new tram across the O'Connell Bridge was the focus of attention in February.  The Luas system shares space with other traffic on several sections of the red and green lines; this is especially the case with the multiple junctions along the city centre section.  The limitation in space at the O'Connell Bridge-quays junctions was a significant element of the advance design of the system to connect the two tram lines while, at the same time, improving the capacity of the green line.  The challenges faced in enhancing the overall carrying capacity of the O'Connell Bridge junctions was considered in full when designing and developing the new signalling system on Luas cross city.  In the normal course of events, the signals at the junction facilitate the tram clearing the quays in a single movement.  However, if the progress of the tram is impeded by a blocking vehicle, the rear of the tram on O'Connell Bridge can overhang Burgh Quay.  In this scenario, the traffic system will recognise that the tram has not cleared the bridge and will allow for additional time to be allocated to clear traffic from the bridge.  On 8 February, the first new tram was blocked by a car waiting to make an illegal right turn onto Eden Quay.  This was despite the provision of a dedicated right turn lane for Eden Quay being incorporated into the scheme design.  The consequent traffic obstruction was resolved within minutes.  There have been no significant issues with the passage of this longer tram through this junction since it entered service.  In this regard, I acknowledge and am grateful to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has supported the smooth functioning of this junction by regularly patrolling it in peak periods.  I also acknowledge the continual improvements Dublin City Council make to the signalised junctions on the shared running sections of the system.  Such fine-tuning of the signals is an essential ongoing support to the Luas system and traffic management in general.<\/p><p> The extension to the green line is realising substantial benefits for customers and for the Dublin region.  Luas experienced a number of problems in its first few months of operations and I regret the delay and inconvenience caused to our customers.  All parties have worked hard to overcome these problems and the reliability of Luas services has improved considerably in recent weeks.  Further improvements to passenger services addressing increasing demand will be made over the summer when all seven of the new trams will have entered passenger service.<\/p><p> I hope that my opening statement has addressed the specific points raised by this committee that are relevant to our remit.  We are happy to answer questions on any particular issue raised or, indeed, other matters of interest.  If we do not have the information requested to hand we will supply a written response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":1901,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Tim Gaston, director of public transport services.  I understand that the committee wishes to focus on traffic congestion in the Dublin area, the proposed College Green civic plaza and Luas transport.  I will address these issues in my opening statement.<\/p> <p>  I will first discuss traffic congestion in the Dublin region.  Following a period of reduced transport usage and suppressed transport growth, both in terms of private car use and public transport patronage, 2014 saw the start of a reversal of these trends.  Public transport usage has increased for all modes since then and I mean in terms of bus, Luas and commuter rail transport.  Paralleling the changes in public transport, car travel has grown across the Dublin region since 2014.  Demand for travel is now on the increase and patronage on public transport is growing.  During 2017 overall public transport numbers grew by 8% with increases recorded across bus, rail and Luas transport.<\/p> <p>  Major investment is needed in public transport to respond appropriately to this growth and address the congestion problems in the Dublin region.  Both the NTA and others have advocated for several years for a major increase in public transport investment to prepare the region to deal with the growth in travel that was becoming evident.  However, due to Ireland's recent economic circumstances, funding for the required investment was unavailable during much of the past decade.<\/p> <p>  The overall framework for transport provision to meet the needs of the region over the next two decades is set out in the Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy 2016-2035, which was approved by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2016.  The strategy outlined the various networks to be developed.  They are as follows:  heavy rail; light rail; bus; road; cycling and pedestrian networks; and supporting measures, including park and ride provision, information provision, integration and demand management measures.<\/p> <p>  A welcome uplift in public transport funding has been provided in the recently published National Development Plan 2018-2027, which has allocated &euro;8.6 billion towards sustainable transport measures.  The three largest projects are MetroLink, the Dublin Area Rapid Transport or DART expansion programme and BusConnects, all of which will serve the Dublin region.  Let us remember that resolving the transport deficiencies caused by the unavailability of investment for a period of several years will take time and that major infrastructure projects take a number of years to deliver.<\/p> <p>  Supplementing those larger projects, other measures are being taken in the short term to deliver additional transport capacity.  These include the provision of a ten minute DART service later this year, following the resolution of driver training issues; the current peak time rail services from the Kildare rail line that links with Dublin city centre through the Phoenix Park tunnel will be expanded to provide an all-day service; additional capacity will be provided on the Luas green line with additional 55 m trams coming into service; an order will be placed in 2019 for a diesel-electric rail fleet to provide an extended DART service across the Dublin rail network; the Go-Ahead contract for bus services on 24 public service obligation, PSO, bus routes in the Dublin metropolitan area will start operations in quarter 3 of this year; an additional bus fleet will be acquired and additional capacity will be added on busy routes currently experiencing high passenger numbers in peak hours; additional investment will be made in park and ride provision; and, there will be an increased level of investment in cycling projects.  I reiterate that it will take time to remedy the consequences of prolonged under-investment in public transport.<\/p> <p>  In terms of BusConnects, we believe that investing in our bus services is critical when it comes to tackling traffic congestion in the Dublin area.  That is why the NTA proposes to radically change the way bus services are delivered through the implementation of the BusConnects programme.  BusConnects is our plan to fundamentally transform Dublin's bus network so that journeys by bus will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable.  There are three very significant milestones for BusConnects in the weeks and months ahead.  Shortly, in June, a discussion document will be published.  In the  publication we will outline our thinking on the challenges and opportunities that will arise from our proposal to invest in infrastructure on 16 core bus corridors that operate in and out of the city.  We intend to develop the corridors so that each will have a continuous bus lane in each direction.  In the following month of July, we will publish for public consultation the redesigned network of bus services for Dublin.  This will include a proposal for a major redesign of routes, schedules and fares structures.  Finally, in October, we will publish for public consultation our detailed plans for investment in infrastructure on the 16 core bus corridors that operate in and out of the city.<\/p> <p>  I shall next discuss the College Green civic plaza.  The provision of such a plaza at the location has been an objective of Dublin City Council for many years.  Last May, an application for planning consent was made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to develop such a scheme.  An oral hearing on the proposal commenced on 12 March of this year and concluded approximately three weeks later on 29 March.  The decision on our proposal now rests with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, with a determination anticipated to be made before 26 July.  <\/p> <p>  That concludes my introductory statement.  I trust that we can answer any queries that arise.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":1903,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Creegan.

Perhaps that is due to the work that has been done by the organisations and I hope that it is a good omen for the future.<\/p> <p>  It is a fascinating fact that between 2012 and now in 2018, the volume of traffic on the M50 has increased by more than 30%.  I acknowledge that there are great difficulties in sweating the assets, as referenced by Mr. Nolan, and that the current average incident response time has decreased to 13 minutes.  However, I concur with the Chairman that traffic congestion on the M50 is a huge issue.  Mr. Nolan said such measures simply sweat the asset rather than bringing significant capacity improvements to the operation of the M50.  What significant capacity improvements are envisaged for the M50?  I note that he called on the Government to invest more money.  <\/p> <p>  I want to discuss the park and ride provision.  If I want to commute to work by car then I must set off from my home in Boyle, County Roscommon at 4.30 a.m. in order to arrive in time for work.  If I delay my departure then I shall be an hour late for work.  Also, I cannot leave Leinster House until after 7 p.m. in order to avoid traffic congestion.<\/p> <p>  I understand that there are park and ride facilities at Maynooth, County Kildare.  Will the NTA provide park and ride facilities for people travelling by car from the west of Ireland along the N5 and N4?  What does the NTA intend to do?  I understand there are park and ride facilities on the road to Cork and acknowledge that people can avail of a LUAS service.  We have a very good public transport system but many people must drive some or all of the way to Dublin.  It would be extremely helpful if park and ride facilities were provided for people who travel from the west of Ireland to Dublin.  Park and ride facilities would also reduce traffic congestion and allow people to reach their destinations much quicker.<\/p><p>The witnesses have a tough job and most capital cities around the world have this issue.  My office is on the fifth floor.  Five years ago I looked out from my office and I could see no crane at all on the Dublin skyline but last week I counted approximately 45 cranes.  There is a large construction industry that has seen an increase in capacity.  Fair play to the witnesses, as they are trying to address it.  I am delighted they are here today and I hope we can work together to resolve the difficulties.

Members visited my constituency just last week.  I thank the witnesses for the presentations.  Like Senator Feighan, I took public transport coming here today and I am delighted to report it was a very pleasant experience altogether.  The work of Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority with Dublin City Council and Dublin Bus is bearing some fruit in the Trinity College corridor in particular.<\/p> <p>  BusConnects is the most immediate prospect on our horizon.  The first phase of announcements will be forthcoming next month.  What is the plan with regard to the co-ordination between Dublin Bus and the BusConnects project?  From what I have seen before us and so far, it seems there is potential or fear among people that there could be a somewhat phased withdrawal of some Dublin Bus services as a consequence of some BusConnects projects overlapping.  I am curious to hear the thoughts of the witnesses at this stage if they can release information into the public domain on the matter.  It is the single most pressing concern from the BusConnects project.  It has great potential and the idea of a high-capacity, high-frequency set of 16 routes into the city is eminently sensible.  It requires a change of culture and mentality among those who would use public transport.  I am therefore curious to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on that transition period.<\/p> <p>  The next question relates to M50 congestion, as has been pointed out by my colleague, Senator Feighan.  A 30% increase in the use of the M50 is extraordinary and the asset has really been sweated in that regard.  I note it will be 2019 before the legislation will be in place for variable speed limits.  Is that deadline by the witnesses' choice or is there anything we can do to speed that up?  I know any increase in capacity would be most welcome and the M50 is effectively the outline of my constituency; I am very acutely aware of how many people use the M50 and are frustrated by it as a consequence of the increased amount of traffic.  That is a consequence of a number of factors, including the increase in the number of people going to and from work, as my colleague noted.<\/p> <p>  My next question is on my pet project, the Luas to Finglas.  Lord knows it would not be a transport committee meeting with the current witnesses if I did not take the opportunity to ask a question on the matter.  My understanding is that once the metro north project concludes its design phase - the preferred route will be finalised following the public consultation - the design teams could move to the Luas lines, and that could potentially be as soon as the end of 2019, according to the metro document.  Will the witnesses confirm if that is the case?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#F01300","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":1924,"content":"<p>I remind Fine Gael colleagues that one swallow does not make a summer.  They must not take public transport too often around Dublin or engage with their constituents too often around Dublin because the position is quite stark.  Reading the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>this week, there is a report that rush hour now takes up three hours in the morning and three in the evening, totalling six hours.  I am not blaming the bodies before us <i>per se<\/i>as they can only deal with allocated resources.  Failing to address this in any meaningful way, however, means we are robbing people of their lives and leaving them stuck in cars, trains and buses for prolonged periods.  It is not right, proper or justifiable.<\/p><p>The witnesses alluded in their opening statements to the lack of resources impeding what they could do.  I have raised the following point umpteen times, even when we had the EU Commissioner responsible for transportation before the committee.  There is a resistance by any State agents and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to avail of funding that could be got at unprecedented low interest rates to invest in public infrastructure.  As a country we had borrowed heavily but the Italian Government was able to borrow &euro;500 million to improve its rail infrastructure, while we did not do likewise.  It was a big miss and we have been paying for that lack of investment and foresight over the past number of years.<\/p><p>Given the multi-stakeholder approach in dealing with traffic, bus, rail and Luas in Dublin, what are the specific legislative responsibilities of the two bodies before us today?  What must they deliver in rolling out infrastructure, maintaining it and overseeing operations?  Dublin City Council, Dublin Bus, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority all have a role to play in some way.  What is the individual role of the bodies before us in rolling out transport?  Is there a service level agreement in place between the various stakeholders?  The chief executive officer of Dublin City Council appeared before the committee a while ago and he said that he had hoped An Bord Plean&aacute;la would have adjudicated on the planning application for the College Green plaza before now but he did not apply in time.  Why was that and who will hold him to account to ensure an application could be made in time?<\/p><p>There was mention of sweating the M50 asset.  There are some meaningful short-term goals.  As for the legislation required to vary speed limits, has there been any consultation with the Department?  Has legislation been commenced or is it in the drafting stage?  My experience of the Minister over the past two years is that he is unable to bring key legislation through the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>There was mention of the plan for the greater Dublin area.<\/p><p>Part of its plan is to have 10% of all short journeys conducted by bicycle.  I recently submitted a parliamentary question on this.  Success has many fathers but failure is an orphan.  If the money goes up, it is to the Minister's credit; if it is reduced, it is the fault of the NTA.  At a time when we are trying to encourage people to use bicycles, why did the funding for this network fall from &euro;18 million in 2016 to &euro;10 million in 2018?  It is unbelievable when more people are opting to cycle and when there has been a policy decision to increase the number of cyclists.<\/p><p> BusConnects is very ambitious but I think will be very good when it is in operation.  However, I am concerned about the length of time it will take to roll out.  Dublin Bus was recently before the committee and its representatives identified a number of pinch points and signalling changes that would help in the here and now.  Dublin Bus has applied to the NTA for the necessary funding for those changes.  Why is there a delay in making that funding available?  Dublin Bus is by far the largest public passenger carrier in the greater Dublin area and passengers have increased from 120 million to 150 million in recent years.  However, this increase has not been matched by an expansion of the fleet.  Why is that?  Why is the NTA not investing more in buses?  If we are serious about getting people out of cars, we have to offer them a reliable, efficient and affordable alternative but that is not the case on certain routes.<\/p><p> What is the current capacity of the Dublin Port tunnel?  I recently met the Irish Road Haulage Association, which said the tunnel is nowhere near its capacity.  Perhaps some of the charges at key times of the day are prohibitive.  Could we look at the charges and see if we can get more people out of the city centre to use the ports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#F01400","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":1926,"content":"<p>We agreed to stick to committee members by rotation so I call Deputy Munster.

It requires foresight because population growth creates a need for increased capacity.<\/p> <p>  The tolling of the M50 was mentioned as a solution but how can that possibly be acceptable?  What other options have TII and the NTA looked at to address the serious capacity issues?  These issues do not look like being rectified in the near future.

I did not hear anything on this in the presentations.<\/p> <p>  There are serious issues around rush hour, particularly in suburban areas, and the green line was mentioned.  There has been chaos and mayhem and, after all the planning that there was, a complete hames was made of the situation.  Passengers were left standing at the side of the road, they were late for work and they were late getting home from work.

Approximately how much would be needed, annually, to bring Dublin up to the standard one would expect or would see in other capital cities?  Will the funding in Project Ireland 2040 be sufficient to bring us up to those standards?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Creegan mentioned some short-term initiatives to improve Dublin transport and traffic, including the Go-Ahead contract.  Can he explain how privatising routes can be an improvement?  Deputy Troy referred to the increased customer numbers in our public transport system and the fact that this has not been matched by an increase in infrastructure and fleet.  How will the Go-Ahead contract be a positive thing?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Creegan also said additional investment would be made in park-and-ride provision.  This is in every county council development plan but it never materialises.  The glossy brochures only gather dust and I am beginning to think the Project Ireland 2040 plan will end up going the same way.  Can Mr. Creegan say exactly what investment has been identified and outline the timeframe for delivery?  What capacity will it cater for?<\/p> <p>  We have another problem in Dublin, although it is rather minor in comparison with everything else.<\/p><p>I am speaking of rickshaws, in respect of which there is a very obvious need for regulation.

In doing so, what I had in mind was that we consider medium and longer term scenarios because it is important that we are proactive rather than reactive in terms of what can happen.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan and I first met on the consultative panel of the Dublin Transportation Initiative in the early 1990s and we have maintained our interest in transport since then.  This initiative arose out of the change in European policy in regard to how European funding was allocated.  Congestion in Dublin was regarded as such an impediment to the economy that this initiative was put in place to try to resolve it.  As part of that work, there was some scenario testing in regard to land use planning around, for example, where people lived, where they worked and so on.  The intention was to try to consolidate the city centre and have less demand from outside, but the opposite happened because some of the critical pieces of infrastructure were not provided.  In fact, some of them have only recently come on stream.  In the intervening years between 1996 and 2016, according to the census, population growth was as follows: Dublin city, 13%; D&uacute;n Laoghaire, 13%; South Dublin County Council, 22%; Fingal, 43%; Meath, 41%; Kildare, 39%; and Wicklow, 28%.  There are now more people living in counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow than there are in Dublin city and Cork city and county.  In terms of the origin of congestion, it is arising out of additional demand from areas that have not featured in terms of the policy responses or public funding provision to deal with sustainable transport in the city.<\/p> <p>  The greater Dublin area has expanded even further and areas such as north County Wexford, County Laois and Drogheda are now almost regarded as suburbs of Dublin city.  We need to get serious about planning for where people live and how they commute.  A national development plan and a national planning framework were announced recently.  I cannot figure out why DART underground was not one of the central pieces of this plan given the inadequate surface that exists to accommodate all types of transport, including more sustainable patterns of transport such as cycling and walking.  Given we are facing very considerable fines in regard to climate change transport, I do not understand why DART underground was not one of the key pieces of that plan.  I would like to hear from the witnesses what business case was put forward in this regard, including whether congestion in the city and the loss of productivity and people's time were taken into consideration in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the 28% increase in Luas passenger numbers.  There is a misunderstanding in parts of the country about transport services in Dublin, which we hear about constantly in the D&aacute;il.  I am speaking about the greater Dublin area where a sizeable amount of development contributions will be collected to help fund Luas.  There is a degree of public information required on how some of these projects are funded because there is a lack of understanding around how income derived from transportation is spent.  We probably spend the vast majority of motor tax in areas outside of the greater Dublin area.  <\/p> <p>  Has the National Transport Authority and-or Transport Infrastructure Ireland undertaken an analysis of the cost of congestion?  On the purchase of trains, I understand there is a five year lead-in in this regard but that some of the old carriages have been refurbished and are being brought back into service.  Every day, when the first train from Maynooth reaches Leixlip, which is two stations down the line, it is full and there is standing room only for the remainder of the journey.  It was mentioned earlier that if we build it, they will come.  To encourage people to use public transport, it must be attractive.  BusConnects is a useful service but there is inadequate promotion around the attractiveness of it as a system of moving around.  For example, there is need for greater promotion of timetables, capacity and the fact that there is an area where people can wait in comfort for the bus, without which, given our climate, the service would be off-putting.  There is also need for review of network planning from the point of view of commuter usage and the connection of areas from a commuter perspective.<\/p><p>This will work if people, when they see it published, say \"now, that is a great idea\".  That particular aspect requires detailed attention because it must be attractive to people to use.  <\/p><p> I am one of the people who causes the congestion in the city.  I drive in to work on most days mainly because I am never quite sure what time I will go home.  People can delay leaving work or leave early to try to get on the right side of the traffic.  What interaction does Transport Infrastructure Ireland have with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  In all of the years that I have been driving to Leinster House I have never seen anyone enforcing the yellow box rule.  I have never seen a garda at a junction.  Last night I encountered a scenario that was quite typical when I was trying to find the best way out of the city.  It was after 7 p.m. and I drove down by Pearse Street but could not get onto the quays.  I then went up Gardiner Street and down by the Ilac Centre where I had to bully my way into a lane.  There is no discipline on the roads in terms of cars merging, for example, because there are no consequences due to a lack of enforcement.  What is happening in that regard?  It is only when there are initiatives like Operation Freeflow at Christmas, which involves the enforcement of the rules, that one sees different driver behaviour.<\/p><p> Mr. Nolan made the following comment in his opening statement: \"...if appropriate speed limits are obeyed\".  That is a very big \"if\".  Does he envisage this being dealt with technically or how does he anticipate that happening?  Having driven on motorways in the UK, for example, I have seen rubber necking happen and I have seen drivers speeding up and slowing down.  Such behaviour is not unique to Ireland.  While we might like people to be robots, they are not.  If that is our solution to congestion, then we need to do a lot more in terms of enforcement.<\/p><p> I wish to pick up on a comment Deputy Munster made about capital cities.  I have been in most European capital cities.  I was in Berlin recently, a city whose population is the same as that of the entire island of Ireland.  I was there for four days and never saw a traffic jam.  I saw trains, metros, buses and people cycling.  I saw every mode of transport possible but I did not see a traffic jam once in four days.  That is because Berlin does not have bits of a system but rather a whole system.  Unfortunately, what we have here are bits of a system.  We have had bits of a system since the 19th century and we need to pull those bits together.  Pulling them together requires one big initiative, namely, the interconnector.  I want to know why that is not considered by TII and the NTA to be one of the critical pieces of transport infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#H00700","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":1936,"content":"<p>We will now move on to Members of the Houses who are not members of the committee.  I will invite Members in the order in which they entered the room to avoid arguments.  I recognise that this is a hugely important issue for Members but I must make one point.  The political system is responsible for investment in transport.  Our witnesses today have pushed for and want the most modern public transport system in Europe.  They are not responsible for anything other than trying to improve the situation, although that does not mean they are immune from criticism.  Deputy Lahart is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#J00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":1937,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his generosity and I welcome the representatives from TII and the NTA to the House.  They play a very significant role and are key players in the context of the future of transport in Dublin city and the greater Dublin region.  Clearly we need a directly elected mayor for Dublin to pull all of the forces and objectives together.  That is in our hands.<\/p> <p>  The M50 must be one of the few motorways in Europe that does not have dedicated public transport channels.  I invite the witnesses to respond to that point.  Buses can carry between 70 and 80 people but most of the cars on the M50 are only carrying one person.  We need radical solutions here.  Project Ireland 2040 is too far away.  Some of the measures that the witnesses referred to are imminent but the plans and ambitions for BusConnects, for example, are going to get tied up in court over compulsory purchase orders for front gardens and so on.  However, there are small changes that we can make in the meantime to advance matters.  I ask the witnesses for feedback on public transport use of the M50.  Has that been considered?  Are there international comparisons that can be made?  <\/p> <p>  On the role of local authorities, we have double yellow lined drivers out of existence.  People in residential areas seem to think they own the public roads.  I have argued for double yellow lines in parts of my constituency over the years but we need to do a radical review.  If a person cannot access a bus for the entire journey into the city, there is nothing wrong with him or her driving some of the way, parking and then accessing a bus but we penalise such people out of existence.  There is, for example, a road that divides Milltown golf course in two.  When the Luas green line was opened first, 30 to 40 cars used to be parked along that road.  After six or seven months, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council came along, cleaned up the road and painted double yellow lines along it.  Where did those 30 or 40 drivers go?  Did they just decide that they had no option but to drive all the way into the city?  We need to be radical about this.  We need to encourage the local authorities to develop localised park and ride facilities.  I live three quarters of a mile away from the nearest bus stop.  That may not seem like much.  Indeed, many of my rural colleagues would say that three quarters of a mile is nothing and that they are two miles away from the nearest bus stop but in Dublin, it is a lot.  Localised park and ride facilities are needed.  I remember we suggested this to residents in Kilnamanagh and Kingswood in Tallaght because of issues with the Luas red line.  Some roads are getting blocked up by drivers parking and accessing the Luas but rather than double yellow line them out of existence, we need to consider parking bays that facilitate people who do not live close to bus or Luas routes.  <\/p> <p>  As the witnesses know, traffic will ease considerably from 1 June until the end of August because schools will be closed.  It cannot be beyond the capacity of planners, especially given all of the technology companies located in this city and county, to look at that issue and come up with solutions.  School related congestion is not all caused by mums and dads driving their kids to school.  Many of the cars are being driven by school staff.  Once the schools reopen in September, the city almost comes to a standstill.  If it rains on top of that, the situation worsens considerably.  The role of politicians is to devise policy.  Should we consider dedicated school buses?  In my own area during term time the number 15 bus is completely clogged with school children - who are entitled to use the public bus service - but after eight or nine stops they are gone and the bus is empty.  If we had a dedicated public school bus service, as they have in many other cities, that might help.  <\/p> <p>  We have never told the public that public transport is the way forward but that message would be positively received by people if they realised that there are no roads solutions left.  Even if there was a roads based solution to congestion and even if we had the money to build more roads, it would be another decade before any cars travelled on them.<\/p> <p>  I welcome demand management for which I have been calling for many years.  When the witnesses addressed the Oireachtas Budgetary Oversight Committee they said that demand management could give us four or five years of additional capacity on the M50, which I welcome.  I ask that the process be accelerated, if possible.  There were approximately 1,750 incidents on the M50 last year so demand management through signage can help in that regard.  One hears lots of complaints about the M50 exit ramps and drivers weaving into the traffic.  The use of bollards at the exit ramps prevents this and I would like to see greater use of them.<\/p><p>They create greater discipline on the road.<\/p><p> The NTA and TII need to forget multipoint tolling and accept the M50 is now not what it was intended to be, which was a great ring road carrying traffic around Dublin.  If we impose multipoint tolling on the M50 it will have catastrophic consequences for residential traffic.  The witnesses should just drop it and stop bringing it up.  There is no appetite for it.  There is no political appetite for it and it would have devastating consequences for residential areas.  My view on it is very strong.<\/p><p> I welcome the news on how Luas cross city developed in the end.  There seems to have been political pressure to open it too quickly.  It is clear if it had been given another six months, the outcome would have been better.  Luas cross city is moving fast, smoothly and efficiently but the rest of the city, however, has come to a standstill.  This is a big problem the witnesses are not addressing.  The passenger carrying capacity of Luas cross city is to be hugely welcomed but the witnesses should go to the quays any day.  Seven trams have been moved from the red line to the green line to facilitate capacity issues on the green line.  I am getting complaints from passengers on the red line that the red line trams are not as frequent at peak time as they were, and I would like the witnesses to address this.  There is no late night Luas.  Has this been looked at?  Has the Luas starting earlier in the morning been looked at?  We have a huge amount of shift workers in the city who are never considered by any public transport, with the exception of taxis.  On a Friday or Saturday night in the city one cannot get a Luas and is utterly dependent on taxis.<\/p><p> Lately, I have become concerned about a particular mentality.  The witnesses stated they are grateful to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which supports the smooth functioning of the Luas cross city junction at O'Connell Bridge and acknowledged the continual improvements Dublin City Council makes.  No mention was made of Dublin Bus.  The NTA and TII have eviscerated Dublin Bus in this city.  It had to shift 30% of its routes to facilitate Luas cross city, and 27 bus routes have been changed by Dublin Bus because it is a flexible transport system.  The witnesses made no mention of the contribution it was pushed into making to facilitate Luas cross city.  A number of the bus routes redirected prior to the construction of Luas cross city have not been redirected back, for example the 15 route from Knocklyon.  The closest I can get to Leinster House is the Bleeding Horse on Camden Street, but it used to come to Stephen's Green.  I have a couple of other comments to make about Dublin Bus later.<\/p><p> The witnesses did not address the communications and signage issues with regard to the Luas.  There were failures in the electronic signage.<\/p><p> I would like to hear the witnesses' justification for the southern part of the MetroLink going to where we already have a Luas, a DART and the most effective and efficient quality bus corridor in the country.  All of the areas between the green line and the DART, where there is no alternative to the bus, have been abandoned, as has the west of the city, and areas such as Lucan and Blanchardstown, and &euro;3 billion will be invested on a metro line and upgrading the existing Luas green line through the constituencies of the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe, Eoghan Murphy, Ross and Madigan.  I would like justification for the southern end of this.<\/p><p> Cycling continues to be the poor relation.  For eight years as a councillor I fought for the extension of the city bike scheme and what have we ended up with?  We have ended up with four separate local authority bike schemes in the county.  It is a complete joke.  I am not blaming the witnesses for it because nobody is pulling them together and co-ordinating this, but it is a complete joke.  Cyclists are still very much still the poor relations, never mind pedestrians, who have not been mentioned.  There is very poor space for pedestrians in this city.  We need to look at democratising the public space available in this city.  It is still dominated by the private car but there are also pedestrians, cyclists and people who use public transport.  The real workhorse of public transport in the city, Dublin Bus, gets very little mention.<\/p><p> With regard to the Dublin Bus brand, and while we have the NTA before the committee, this may not seem like a big deal but to me the Dublin Bus brand will morph into the anaemic Transport for Ireland brand where every bus will look the same.  We will lose the Dublin Bus colours, the Dublin Bus icons, and the vibrant yellow in which Dublin Bus invested quite a significant amount of money, particularly on researching with disability groups and visually impaired groups.  Dublin Bus is a part of this city.  The new livery that is proposed speaks nothing to Dubliners and speaks nothing of Dublin.  It borrows slavishly from Transport for London and replaces an iconic Dublin service and image with a Transport for Ireland blancmange of a symbol.  The red bus in London was an iconic service and bus before it ever got privatised so that made sense, but Dublin Bus will be erased from the transport map of Dublin and replaced with Transport for Ireland.  There is no buy-in from the public for this.  This is an issue I will come back to again and again, because I am concerned that the NTA's attitude to Dublin Bus is to push it around.  It is the most flexible form of public transport we have and it is micromanaged.  I cannot organise a meeting with Dublin Bus officials in my constituency without Dublin Bus okaying it with the NTA.  I say hands off Dublin Bus.  It is an independent semi-State company and is a hugely valuable contributor to public transport in the city.  Its revenue over the past six years has increased exponentially and its PSO contribution from the State has been decreasing exponentially.  It is a fine company and a fine example of how a semi-State company should operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#J00300","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":1939,"content":"<p>To put some structure on this afterwards, as a huge variety of ideas and thoughts are being put forward, after we respond and have a debate on them we will summarise them and have another meeting in six weeks to see what progress has been made on the points so it is not just a talking shop.

As Deputy Catherine Murphy said earlier, we have been soldiering on this specific issue for 25 years and, trust me, it is not going away.  It will be centre stage in this country and city and there is a huge amount of work to be done.<\/p> <p>  I am never late, and I was not late in the morning, because I cycle in, but I dare anyone to take the last mile or two of my route, weaving as I do between buses, trucks and other bikes in the chaos that is Leeson Street and St. Stephen's Green.  I hold the witnesses personally responsible for the harrowing nature of my journey.  I am sorry for being personal and hard but it is borne out of 25 years of frustration.  When I came in this morning I had my coffee and I saw a bunch of officials in the corner.  I thought, \"God help them they are the health service officials about to get a grilling\" and then I realised it was our transport officials.  I will be critical but I hope it is constructive criticism and it is certainly based on real urgency and need.<\/p> <p>  The criticism is because of exactly what Deputy Catherine Murphy said, which is that the analysis of what we have needed for the past 25 years has been ignored.  There was clear understanding as far back as 25 years ago.  All of the transport analysis was that we needed to switch to public transport and to stop the sprawl and concentrate development but everything since then has gone in the opposite direction.  I remember as clear as if it were yesterday a meeting with the key engineers, planners and modellers at the conclusion of some of the modelling research we did in the late 1990s.  We were finalising the A Platform for Change plan and a slide was shown asking what were the first priorities and what would we do first.  I will never forget it.  The first priority was to build the metro or the DART interconnector or both because they were the two crucial pieces of public transport infrastructure and, later, possibly widening the M50 would be considered.  What did we do first?  We widened the M50, dumped the metro and now are still dumping the DART interconnector which, God help us, is needed for the people in Kildare and Meath and for the entire system to work.<\/p><p>I am sorry to hear the analysis given today in the presentations to the effect that there has been a lack of investment in recent years and that the M50 has become a problem.  That is nonsense.  I sat for three weeks at the oral hearing on the widening of the M50.  It was as clear as day and a mathematical certainty that the M50 was going to gridlock.  It was probably two years later than the projections because of the economic crash, but that is the full extent of it.  Why was the pressure so much greater to upgrade the M50 and not the pursue the other projects?  I remember the inspector tried to stitch in a requirement for some type of management system.  The political system ignored it.  The political system must hold its hand up here too.  We are facing chaos.<br\/><br\/>I am sorry but the reason for my anger is that I have utterly lost confidence in TII.  I have no confidence in its leadership.  I had confidence previously in the NTA but I am increasingly seeing that it talks the talk but does not walk the walk, and it sure as hell does not cycle it either.  I have read Mr. Nolan's presentation.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>A number of schemes identified by TII to address congestion in the Dublin area have been included in the National Development Plan 2018-2027 either for delivery or for further development within the lifetime of the plan.  Details of these proposals are included in the supplementary information at the end of this statement.<\/blockquote><p>I went to the end of the statement to see what schemes are being planned to address congestion.  The schemes are to widen the M7 between Naas and Newbridge and to widen the N2 near Slane with a bypass.  I do not dispute the fact that people in Slane will want that.  There are also schemes to widen the N2 between Rath and Kilmoon Cross, to widen the N3 at Clonee, to widen the N4 from Maynooth to Leixlip and to widen the N11 and upgrade the junction near Kilmacanogue.  We have learned nothing.  The scheme to tackle congestion in Dublin from TII is to widen further the approach roads into Dublin, a city that cannot cope.<br\/><br\/>I am sorry but that is just not good enough.  One must ask why we keep going wrong on this, after 25 years of knowing what we must do, namely, invest in public transport and bring development back to the core.  Is it that the people who are building the roads are so influential in IBEC or that the PPP projects are so attractive or so easy to finance?  We are saving ten minutes on each of those widening projects so this makes the economic analysis case and Colm McCarthy must be right.  I am sorry, but Colm McCarthy is wrong.  What level of gridlock do we have to reach?  Do we just keep widening roads?  When do we stop the widening?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#K00300","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":1942,"content":"<p>Sorry, but I wish to be fair to everybody.

There are also bottlenecks in the system.  It is inefficient and unsafe.  I understand that the lack of investment in public transport over many years is having an impact on what we do.  However, I am still charged with the statutory remit of a safe and efficient national road network.  I cannot get away from that.

My frustration is due to the fact that if we went the alternative route and invested in cycling, as Deputy Troy said, with a high-quality, first-class network of cycling super highways in and around the city, it would do more than anything else to tackle the congestion problem.  In all journeys from the centre of the city to a distance of 4 km a bicycle will be fastest.  Any journey from here to the M50 is within that distance or has that timeline of a half an hour cycle ride.  We could transform the congestion problem by investing in that network but, as Deputy Troy said, the opposite is happening.  The budget is collapsing and there are no projects ready to go.  There is no leadership in that area.<\/p> <p>  Second, I agree with what Deputy Lahart said.  There should be massive investment in the bus network.  Take the example of his route, the No. 15.  My concern is that the statistics show that bus patronage on the Rathfarnham QBC fell 4.6% last year.  Bus speeds are stuck at 10 km\/h, and have been that way for ever and a day.  We have been looking at that route for 20 years and wondering how to solve it.  My personal view is that the metro should go to Rathfarnham.  It would transform that corridor.  I fully support the BusConnects project but I have some fears.  Can Mr. Creegan say, in advance of the presentation being launched in June, how we can solve the QBC problem on the Rathfarnham route when the section from Rathfarnham Road through Terenure Road North and Harold's Cross is a 9 m wide carriageway all the way?  There are all sorts of complications with left and right turning junctions and a very difficult Terenure junction.  I am frustrated because we are not recognising the scale of the crisis we face and the need for radical solutions for cycling and public transport.  That would include the DART underground today, whereas it has been ruled out of the metro project.  It appears to have been ruled out for ever because no space is being provided for the DART underground station in St. Stephen's Green.  We are taking another 25-year leap ahead here and saying that we are not going to have that proper system.<\/p> <p>  We should bring the metro to Rathfarnham and upgrade the Luas green line by increasing frequency times and other measures.  Let us be radical about cycling in the city.  However, I do not hear or see that and that is the reason for my frustration and anger.

I welcome the debate and the robustness of the exchanges.  It is good for us to hear this.  We have been working under severe constraints for the past eight or nine years, which was not our fault or of our making.  We are probably in catch-up mode on many different fronts.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the comment of Senator Feighan that things have improved in the College Green area.  He also asked what capacity improvements we can bring to the M50.  We have made considerable effort in the past ten years to improve the capacity and safety of the M50 but we are at a point where we just cannot keep building out the M50.  I do not think that going to four lanes or five lanes in each direction is tenable.  We must keep in mind that, at the time the M50 upgrade was mooted and there was a hearing, there was a whole series of public transport initiatives in Transport 21 that were supposed to come into play and be delivered and executed at around this time, but they have not happened.  It was not the case that the M50 was a single solution to traffic ills along that corridor; it was one of a range of solutions.  It just so happens that we managed to execute the Government's vision of the time, upgrade the M50, remove the toll plaza and move to free-flow tolling.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Senator Feighan that one would have to be in Dublin by 7 a.m. to have an efficient journey and would need to leave early or, otherwise, leave around 7 p.m. in the evening.  I empathise with those coming from the west but that is the reality of what is happening because of congestion.  Due to the economic upturn of the past two or three years, every second car on the M4 is a commercial vehicle, such as a white van working in the construction industry.  There was a comment that construction traffic has not lifted yet but I believe construction traffic has been quite buoyant in the last three years.  There has been significant commercial development within the city core and a lot of traffic is heading into the city, not just on the M50 but using the M50 to distribute along different radial routes.<\/p> <p>  With regard to park and ride, and the M4 is an example, there are a number of opportunities.  Drivers can pull in at Mullingar, Enfield or Maynooth and get a train, and there is ample parking at those locations.  Nonetheless, the M4 does not have a park and ride facility such as at the Red Cow roundabout on the M50, which is a fantastic facility that has been well used.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the capacity that exists in the port tunnel, the charges are set to prevent unnecessary traffic coming into the city at peak times.  It is a man management measure in its own right, and it works.  The tunnel has considerable capacity.  Where we do not have the capacity is in the receiving street network in the centre of Dublin.  It is fine heading north, as anyone who uses that route on a daily basis will appreciate, but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":1965,"content":"<p>Sorry to interrupt.

We then simplified that and reduced the charges to a &euro;3 trip and a &euro;10 trip but, since the upturn, although we do not know the exact figure, we find there has been a substantial increase in the number of cars using it to come into the city at peak times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":1967,"content":"<p>On that point, I use the port tunnel a lot and it often does not recognise the tag, which causes delays.

There is a small capacity bonus but that is not the primary objective.  We have to have realistic expectations in respect of capacity.  There has been an increase of more than 30% and when collisions happen the implications for journey times are very severely impacted.  Variable speed limits are a well used technique in other jurisdictions and we are unique in not having a provision for variable speed limits on our motorways.<\/p> <p>  Apart from the Dublin Port Tunnel, we do not use a red X control but, from a safety perspective, red X is very important, particularly for emergency services operatives.  We always envisaged deploying this technology on the M50 and under all the big gantry structures there is a latticework with slots for electronic indicators to be made available.  One of the advantages of having done this during the M50 upgrade is that we do not have to go back and cause significant disruption to road users while we are implementing the process.  We do not have variable speed limits in our legislation at the moment but it is being addressed.  We have been in consultation with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the matter and the timeline is by late 2019 to dovetail with the deployment of the technology out on the route.<\/p> <p>  I note Deputy Eamon Ryan's comments about the M50 but there is no silver bullet.  The measures we are taking are not a panacea.

There is a 60 kph speed limits on the dual carriageway section because of legacy planning issues.  We are improving that road but in the context of a broad range of public transport and road transport initiatives over a long period.  That is an example.

This morning - like the M50 - it was still mostly all red on Google maps.  London built its way out of it and still its equivalent of our M50 is all red.  The committee will agree that London has a good public transport system.  Even during the downturn, massive investment was made and it is improving every year. <\/p> <p>  How do we lower car usage then?  We could close off some of the junctions but there are so many ways of lowering car usage not in our remit.  We have one junction every 2.5 km, while the M25 in London has one junction every 6 km.  London has almost 10 million people inside that M25 box; Dublin has about 1 million people inside the M50 box.  I do not have the exact number.  We have three lanes in each direction.  If we did not have the lag in public transport investment over the last ten years, perhaps we would be having a different conversation today.  I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan that public transport in the greater Dublin area is a solution as we cannot just keep building out on the M50.  <\/p> <p>  On guaranteeing that seven trams are sufficient now that the Luas green and red lines are operating satisfactorily, it important to say that we do not just have seven trams coming into operation in a few weeks.  We have also issued an order for the upgrade of 26 of the shorter trams to bring them to the same length as our new trams.  We will have 26 of those elongated trams on the network between the end of 2019 and the start of 2021.  We also have an order for eight new long trams as well.  It is not that we think that seven trams are sufficient.  A big investment has been approved by the Government to progress that.  As ridership will be built up over a number of years, we will be bringing in measures to deal with capacity issues that will keep growing.  <\/p> <p>  I will add that if we look internationally, many light rail systems suffer from underuse.   We have the opposite in Dublin.  What we predict is delivered.  We had a step change increase in December when the Luas cross city opened and two lines connected.  That should have been done years ago.  However, we can see where the uptick on that connected system came into being.  We do not suffer from a lack of Irish usage.  It is a well used system.  From the end of 2019 to the middle of 2021, we will have more new and modified trams coming in.  As for how we will pay for metro north and whether it will be passed over to a concessionary or private operator, I will hand that question over to Mr. Creegan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#P01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":2037,"content":"<p>It is intended that the MetroLink project will be funded by the Exchequer.

I completely agree with her on that.  It is a major impediment.  She also referred to census figures showing increases in the population in Dublin and the greater Dublin area.  Large increases are occurring in the counties surrounding Dublin.  That opens up a conversation about why this is happening.  Nobody drives on the M50 because they like driving on it.  Is it that people have to drive further to find affordable housing?  There are so many considerations we need to understand.  It is very hard to understand the circumstances of a single person in a car.  The increase we have seen between 2012 and 2018 is not entirely attributable to the bounce in economic growth and the recovery.  There is a lot more coming into play.  I do not live in Dublin; I live in one of the counties outside Dublin and I know from experience that people who cannot afford accommodation in Dublin, be they students, trainees or workers, have to drive further.  Driving for two to three hours each way in a car every day is not a matter of choice.  This relates to Deputy Troy's point.

Rather, it is stated that the tunnel will follow separately.  The Deputy asked for an explanation in this regard.  Approximately two years ago, a business case for DART underground was carried out by Irish Rail, with the involvement of the NTA.  DART underground by itself does not stack up economically, the benefits to cost ratio being only 0.8%.  The reason for this is that services outside connecting areas provide the real benefits.  Two big changes have occurred over the past couple of years that impacted the DART expansion and DART underground thinking, namely, the opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel, which brings trains in from the Kildare line, and the MetroLink project, which provides a direct connection to the DART system at Tara Street.  There is currently no need for the DART underground tunnel.  During the course of our work in this area it became evident that the vast bulk of the benefit would be derived from expansion of DART services to Drogheda and Maynooth via the Kildare line.  Rather than wait for a tunnel to be built, we propose to commence electrification of those lines and purchase the fleet necessary to provide these services, following which the tunnel will be built.  We do not need a tunnel to get the bulk of the benefits from this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#R03900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":2127,"content":"<p>Was the cost of congestion factored into the cost benefit analysis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#S00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":2128,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":2129,"content":"<p>What is that cost?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#S00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":2130,"content":"<p>I do not know the exact cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":2131,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. Creegan would forward the information to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#S00600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":2132,"content":"<p>We run a transport model that identifies the time savings versus a tunnel being in place and not in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":2133,"content":"<p>I welcome the proposed electrification of some of those lines.

The Deputy is correct that there are signalling constraints through the city centre.  A couple of years ago, the number of trains that could cross from Connolly Station to Tara Street via the Loopline Bridge was restricted to 12 per hour in each direction.  Following on from the re-signalling work carried out, this has increased to 17 or 18 per hour in each direction.  There are changes that we would have to make to the city centre rail system to make this work.  For example, we will have to reorientate parts of Connolly Station to make it function more efficiently and as the Docklands Station is not in the most useful of locations we will have to relocate it to a better place, in respect of which we have a location in mind.  There are other changes that will need to be carried out at the rail junctions along the line to make the lines operate more efficiently.  We have done sufficient work to be confident that we can get the majority of the benefits out of the system much earlier by proceeding with the bi-mode fleet, including a diesel-electric fleet, electrification and changes to the signalling.  We can then follow with the tunnel.  We do not need to wait for the tunnel to reap the benefits of this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#S01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":2138,"content":"<p>Is there a speed constraint in regard to the Phoenix Park route?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#S01300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526459400,"counter":2139,"content":"<p>Yes, but I do not know that speed off the top of my head.

I agree with Mr. Creegan that the BusConnects project offers us a real opportunity to get the radial routes and hopefully some orbital routes as well, but we should not underestimate the real difficulty of that.  To date we have seen, for example, on the Clontarf route the difficulty in getting that right and not giving sufficient priority to cycling in the final design.  Let us look at what the design does.  Even if we do that, we also need other infrastructure, which is really high quality segregated and separate to the low network cycling.  A coastal cycle route on the south side would have significant benefit in terms of commuting traffic, as well as leisure and other routes.  It is the same along the Grand Canal and the Dodder, Liffey, Tolka and Santry rivers.  Those off-road routes are significant pieces of infrastructure and the reality is no progress is being made on those major projects.  There has not been and it has stalled for five years.<\/p> <p>  I am very supportive of the BusConnects project although in certain instances, and I mentioned the Rathfarnham one, I as a local politician, just recognise the reality.  The roadway is a main corridor artery and is 9 m to 10 m wide but it is proposed to put a high-quality bus route and a high-quality cycle route on either side, which will require 7 m to 8 m from the 9 m to 10 m road.  All the roads are full of traffic coming from the outside where the volume is going to increase because we are further upgrading the outer road to attract people into the city.  I have been fighting for this for 25 years and have been sitting down with the engineers and the design teams and I know how much design work it takes.  I would take every single engineer who is working in TII on the inter-urban motorway projects on the edge of the city off those projects and would bring them into the city and get them working on that project.  If that were to happen, I would say it is for real but that is not what is happening.  When I talk to people on the ground and ask them if they have the engineers, draughtsmen and resources at local authority level to deliver at the absolute urgency we need, the answer is no.  We are still in the old system, where our money and our engineers work on the outer urban motorways to attract traffic into Dublin and the truth is that we are not addressing the really difficult engineering problem to retrofit a bus and cycling high-quality infrastructure into a city that is the target for all these long-distance commuters who have only one choice, namely, to drive because that is the only mode we have invested in.

We bring together all of the main providers, including, in the case of the Ed Sheeran concert, the OPW, because it is in the Phoenix Park, Dublin City Council because it has some involvement in the street space, and Dublin Bus, Irish Rail, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and TransDev on the Luas side to create a plan to handle both the arrival and departure of people from the Phoenix Park.  There is a lot of co-ordinating going on for those large events.  The big event this year is of course the papal visit, which has involved intensive planning.  A dedicated team is working solely and very closely on that event with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, events organisers, the OPW, the Department of the Taoiseach, and a large group of other stakeholders.  A very well developed transport plan is being put together for that event.<\/p> <p>  The challenges we face are the smaller events, for example the concerts in Malahide Castle.  These cause particular problems during the week.  If public events occur at the weekend we are able to corral public transport to provide access to and from them.  The bigger challenges are small midweek events, given that public transport simply does not have the capacity to dial up an extra 100 buses to deliver people to another venue mid-week.  For those reasons we believe the event organisers and the businesses that are going to take the profit from those events should also be providing a transport plan.  They should work with the local authorities on that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018051600002#U02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Gaston"},{"type":"speech","time":1526459400,"counter":2195,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee and answering all our questions.
