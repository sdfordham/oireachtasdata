We are joined by Ms Vicky Phelan, one of the women directly affected by the crisis along with her solicitor, Mr. Cian O'Carroll.  We are also joined by Mr. Stephen Teap, the husband of Irene Teap who has sadly passed away from cervical cancer.  Thank you for agreeing to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts this evening.<\/p> <p>  The committee has already met officials from the Department of Health, the HSE and the State Claims Agency on the matter and we will resume that side of our discussions tomorrow.  For now, we want to hear from the people directly affected by this crisis.  It will be key in terms of making changes to the system used by the HSE to learn from those who have had direct experience of the system.  That is why their evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts is important.  We want to ensure that the women and families who have been directly impacted - they are very much representative of that group - are treated appropriately especially in respect of access to their information.<\/p> <p>  We also, of course, want the cancer screening service to continue and for the population to use it.  Notwithstanding the failures that have been highlighted and which have caused such public anger, it is a valuable part of our public health system.  We welcome the changes that are coming in which will make screening a more accurate exercise.<\/p> <p>  Ms Phelan and Mr. Teap are here today specifically to help the members of the committee deal with the whole question of open disclosure.  That matter has been discussed by the HSE and the State Claims Agency at this committee on several previous occasions.  We know there is a policy position in change.  We have heard from the relevant officials from those institutions in the past and no doubt we will hear from them again.  However, the job of the Committee of Public Accounts is to hear all sides of the story as to how that operates in practice.  Your attendance here today will help us verify what we are hearing from the State institutions on the matter.  That is why your evidence today will be beneficial in bringing about improvements that are ultimately required to be implemented - by legislation if necessary - as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  We are in your hands, Vicky and Stephen.  We are here to hear your story.  We are here substantially in listening mode.  We will have some questions afterwards by way of clarification if you are happy to take them.  We are here to listen respectfully to you.  As everyone knows, we public representatives do a lot of talking, but listening is often a far more important aspect of our job.<\/p> <p>  I will start with you, Vicky.  You might tell us your story in your own words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#C00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526486400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Thank you, Se&aacute;n.  Thank you all for inviting myself and Stephen here today to tell our side of the story.  It is great to be able to have this opportunity for me in particular to set out my experience and to answer any questions you may have at the end of it.  Some of you have already heard my story numerous times at this stage I am sure.  It has been dissected in different parts of the media.  For me today, it is important that you hear my side of the story from me.<\/p> <p>  I will give my timeline and go back to where this all started for me.  In February 2011, I had my son, Darragh.  I had a smear test about eight weeks after I had Darragh.  Up to and before I had my son I had always had smears from when I was old enough to have them, before CervicalCheck came into being in 2008.  I never missed a smear.  I had always had normal smears.  I had never had an abnormal one.  I had never had any LLETZ procedures or colposcopies so I had nothing to worry about in 2011 when I went for my smear after having my son.  My pregnancy with my son went absolutely perfectly.  I had no bleeding - no issues whatsoever.  It was a textbook pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  When I went for my smear at the end of May 2011 with my GP, I had nothing to worry about.  When she rang me four weeks later with the result of that smear and told me that it was normal and that I was not due for another smear for another three years, I was not even worried, to be honest.  I was not expecting the result to be anything but normal.  Then in July 2014 I was first diagnosed with cervical cancer.  I actually went in earlier that year - I was not even called for the smear at that point.  I went to my GP in June 2014, complaining of symptoms.  For me, the symptoms were bleeding in between my periods.  It was nothing major, just very light bleeding, but it happened for three months in a row from March until June.  I gave it three months and I decided I would go to my GP and get it checked out, and ask for my smear a little bit early.  I was not due until October that year apparently when I got the letter but I went in a little bit early just to get it checked out.  I still really did not have any worries but there was something at the back of my mind.  I just thought it was a little bit unusual for me.  I was very lucky.  I am a woman who has always had very regular periods.  My sister would have always had very irregular periods and so she would not have gone with the symptoms I had.<\/p> <p>  My gynaecologist at the time when I was diagnosed told me that the type of symptoms I was complaining about were very minor.  I think that is something that women need to know.  It does not have to be really bad back pain and haemorrhaging that will send you into your doctor for cervical cancer.  I had very mild symptoms and I still got diagnosed, but now I know that my diagnosis goes back prior to 2014.  What made me go to the doctor in the end was that I had a bleed after sex, basically.  That is what made me really think this a little bit more serious than I thought.<\/p> <p>  When I went for my smear in June, I bled after the nurse took the smear and she said that was a bit unusual because it was quite a lot so she marked it urgent and sent it off to the lab.  That particular smear in 2014 went to MedLab in Sandyford.  The result came back four weeks later.  I got a call when I was in work on 2 July from the GP who told me that the result had come in and she wanted to talk to me.  I asked her, \"Can you not talk to me over the phone?  Is it just high-grade changes that involve LLETZ procedure or colposcopy?\"  I kind of pushed her, but she would not say anything really over the phone; she asked me to come in.<\/p> <p>  I went in when I got back after work that week.  She told me that there were very high-grade changes and that she was sending me for an urgent colposcopy so I went for that urgent colposcopy two weeks later on 15 July 2014.  When I had the colposcopy, I went to the colposcopy clinic in Limerick.  Dr. Kevin Hickey is the lead colposcopist there in Limerick.  He checked me and while he was doing the LLETZ procedure - he told me two days later when I got the result that it was cancer - but that day he did not tell me.  Obviously, he had to get the result of the biopsy, but he told me he knew.  He could see the tumour.  I had a 4 cm tumour.<\/p> <p>  He did the LLETZ procedure and took away 3 cm of a tumour that day.  It was a very uncomfortable procedure.  It was not a nice experience for any woman to go through, to be honest, but I did have an inkling that something was wrong before I left his clinic because he asked me if I was finished having children.  At that stage I was 39 and had two kids.  Luckily enough for me I did not want any more children; I was happy with my two.  I said to him, \"Why?  Are you telling me I have cancer?\"  He said, \"No, no, no - I am sending your sample off for a biopsy.  It's just that these changes are very high grade and we would recommend a hysterectomy.\"  He had already booked me in for a hysterectomy at that stage.  I was due to come back on 1 August for a hysterectomy.<\/p> <p>  At that stage alarm bells were ringing and I thought, \"Jesus, is it cancer or is it not?\"  I was waiting for this call.  That was 15 July.  Two days later he rang me.  He had the results of this biopsy and it was cancer.  He said, \"We're going to go ahead with the hysterectomy on 1 August, but in the meantime I'm going to send you for an MRI scan just to be sure there hasn't been any spread outside your cervix.\"  If the cancer is contained within the cervix, a hysterectomy would sort everything out and there would be no need for chemotherapy or radiation.  I went off for my MRI scan a week later on 22 July.<\/p><p>On 29 July, I went to Kevin Hickey for the result and my husband came with me to that appointment.  Dr. Hickey told me that unfortunately the cancer was showing up as having spread outside my cervix.  It was highlighted in two lymph nodes.  He said that at that stage, the hysterectomy was off the table because once it spreads outside the cervix, the cancer is graded much higher.  He was then going to send me for a PET scan to see if it had spread any further and whether they might see small metastases.  I went for my PET scan and that came back.  Luckily enough, at that stage, it was only in two lymph nodes.  However, the treatment plan had changed from a hysterectomy, for which I had planned at that stage, to radical chemotherapy and radiation.  I was then passed to the oncology team and put under a radiation oncologist.  For people who do not have cancer, it is hard to understand.  You have all these oncologists and some people are under radiation oncologists while others are under medical oncologists, depending on the primary treatment.  In my case, I was having radiotherapy five days a week and my primary oncologist was a radiation oncologist, namely, Dr. Lorraine Walsh.  If you are attending primarily for chemotherapy, you have a medical oncologist.  Dr. Lorraine Walsh was my lead oncologist and Dr. Kevin Hickey was the gynaecologist.<\/p><p> I started my treatment at the start of September 2014 and it was five weeks of hell.  That is the only way to describe it.  I was told that type of treatment is not prescribed for everyone.  I am sure Stephen will attest to that as Irene Teap had the same type of treatment.  It is usually prescribed for younger women who can tolerate it.  It is five days a week of radiation and one full day of chemotherapy.  It is all day from 8.30 a.m. until 6.30 p.m. and you are literally green coming out of it.  At the time, I was coming home to two small children.  My son was only three and my daughter was eight.  It was very difficult and I was in bed for two or three days, unable to move and vomiting.  It is a horrible experience and one I would not wish on my worst enemy.  It was very difficult.  On top of the treatment, you have to put up with all of the side effects.  You are very sick and are given tablets to deal with that.  You cannot sleep because you are on steroids to deal with the chemotherapy.  It is a vicious circle.  Luckily, I did not lose my hair.  I like my hair and that was one good thing.  People can call it vanity if they want but it was important to me because my son loved my hair.<\/p><p> It was a horrendous experience.  The worst part of it, which no one really explains, was to come.  I am sure Stephen will say the same.  It was the brachytherapy, which is internal radiation treatment.  After the five weeks of hell, you get a two-week break and they then bring you in for internal radiation treatment called brachytherapy.  They literally insert an applicator up inside you.  They knock you out for this.  It was three times in a week and a half.  There were three epidurals in a week and a half.  They then irradiate whatever is left up there.  Whatever is left inside you is literally melted together.  I have no ovaries, womb or anything at this stage.  It is all melted together.  That is supposed to cure you.  Those two weeks were the worst part of it.  I had my last treatment on my 40th birthday so that was really lovely.  At the end of it, I had an MRI scan.  They leave you alone for a few months to recover and it takes that long.  I had an MRI scan in February 2015, which showed there was no evidence of disease.  I was relieved.  I cannot say I was delighted because I was still sick and in recovery from the effects of the treatment.  I had no evidence of disease and they told me that was great.<\/p><p> The next step was to bring me in every three months for two years because I was very high risk.  I was stage 1B2 in terms of my original diagnosis in 2014, but because it had spread outside the cervix into lymph nodes, I was staged much higher in treatment terms.  One is staged like a stage 3 cancer because once it spreads to the lymphatic system, there is no telling where it is going to go.  They have to keep a very close eye.  I was being seen every three months after I finished my treatment.  One goes between the gynaecologist and the oncologist every three months.  I had complained consistently of back pain after I finished my treatment, however.  Looking back at my medical notes, which we got when I went through my court case, I was glad to see that I was not making this up.  I complained consistently at the appointments of back pain but nobody really took much notice.  They just kept saying it was a normal post-radiation effect.  One trusts the doctors and assumes they know what they are doing and, as such, I believed them.  I got to my two-year timeline and I thought that was good.  They say that if you get past the first two years, you are doing really well.  The next step after that is five years when you are really flying it.  Obviously, I have not got to the five years and am back now with terminal cancer.  I barely got to the four years, to be honest.<\/p><p> When I went back to Kevin Hickey for my check-up in September 2017, I was not feeling any worse than usual.  I was fine and had no reduction in my energy levels.  However, I had this lower back pain.  The previous year, 2016, I booked myself into Barringtons Hospital privately for an ultrasound because I had this tugging sensation in my abdomen.  I thought I had pulled a muscle or something as I was weight-lifting at that stage and trying to get back into exercise.  However, it did not clear up so I went for the ultrasound.  It could not explain the tugging and came back as normal.  As such, I did not think anything of it.  When I went to Kevin Hickey in September, I told him about the usual back pain and this tugging sensation in my abdomen.  I had a pelvic exam, an internal exam, and he did not find anything wrong at that stage.  Everything looked normal as far as he was concerned.  He told me he would send me for a scan just to be sure.  At that stage in September, when I had this meeting, I still did not have cancer.  That is important to bear in mind with what I was told then.<\/p><p> I went for a scan in November and that was when I found out cancer was back.  Once I went through the whole round of MRIs and PET scans, I found out, just after Christmas, that my cancer was back and was literally up my body.  It is in my paraaortic lymph nodes so it is in a chain all around my aorta.  It is touching off all my organs.  Approximately five lymph nodes are forming a 10 cm mass around my aorta.  All of one's vital organs are around there.  Part of it is touching off my kidneys, my lungs and my liver.  As such, I am not a candidate for surgery or radiation.  All they would offer me was palliative chemotherapy.  I went to see my radiation oncologist on 12 January this year and was told the only option open to me was palliative chemotherapy.  No other treatment was available.  If I took the palliative chemotherapy option, I had 12 months and, if I did not, I had six months to live.  I pushed her to find out the timeframes as she was not willingly going to tell me.  That is where I am at the moment with a terminal diagnosis.<\/p><p> I will rewind a bit to that meeting I had with Dr. Hickey in September 2017 when he sent me for the scan to find out what I know now, that I have terminal cancer.  He told me then that he wanted to have a chat with me about the audit the cervical screening programme had carried out.  He told me audits are carried out as a matter of routine when women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  That triggers a check.  When a woman is diagnosed with cervical cancer, CervicalCheck will look at her screening history to see if there was anything which might have been missed.  The smear which diagnosed my cancer was in 2014.  My previous smear was in May 2011, eight weeks after the birth of my son, and I had been told it was normal.  When they retested it, he told me, there was now a query about the smear.  He did not actually say it was cancer at that meeting, he just said there was a query and that I may have had cancer or the starting of cancer, pre-cancer, in 2011.<\/p><p> When I was in with him in September, I was not in a state of mind to take this any further for two reasons.  First, I was cancer-free as far as I was aware.  That changed two months later.  Second, as a family my husband and I had a lot of medical issues to deal with for my daughter who has a congenital disorder.  Last year, in 2017, she had two full tonic-clonic epileptic seizures in school, which came out of nowhere.  It is a result of her congenital toxoplasmosis diagnosis, which led to a reactivation.  Basically, she has a parasite living at the back of her eye.  I was diagnosed when I was pregnant and she was treated for 12 months when she was a baby.  We went through the early intervention programme.<\/p><p>She had a stroke effect on her left-hand side.  We had awful problems with her.  She is basically blind in one eye.  She has 70% vision in the other eye but we thought we had dealt with it.  We were very lucky that she was not brain damaged and that she was not blind.  We were very happy that she was doing really well in school.  All of a sudden this kicked off in 2016 but it is all because of puberty.  She has hit puberty, she is nearly 13.  We went back down the whole rollercoaster of medication for her.  She was now on anti-epileptic medication as well as medication to treat her condition.  She nearly lost her eyesight during the summer of 2017.  We had to take her to Moorfields Eye Hospital in the United Kingdom.  She had to have laser surgery.<\/p><p> I had enough going on at that stage without trying to get my head around knowing that I probably had cancer in 2011 so I did not take it further in September.  When I found out in November I knew at that stage that I was going to have to do something but I waited until I knew what my treatment plan was.  There is all this waiting with scans, going from MRI scans, to PET scans to treatment plans.  When they told me it was terminal I was trying to get my head around it but I was not going to accept a terminal prognosis and went to research other options at that stage.<\/p><p> By the time I went to see the medical oncologist about options for the palliative chemotherapy I had insisted on a biopsy because I wanted to be 100% sure this was the same cancer I had, not a new cancer because the treatment would be different.  On 19 January I was waiting to have my biopsy.  Myself and my mother were sitting in a treatment room waiting for a bed, as you do with the HSE.  We were there for about four hours.  I was very bored.  I had my file because it had been sent up with me from admissions.  I started looking through it.  I still had not made the decision about whether I was going to go further legally about this missed smear.  As I was going through my file I noticed this letter from CervicalCheck and when I read it I could see the smear test date, 24 May 2011.  This is the report that CervicalCheck sent back to my gynaecologist on the review of my smear from 2011.  The original report stated no abnormality detected, NAD.  The review was query squamous cell carcinoma.<\/p><p> At that stage alarm bells started ringing in my head because Mr. Hickey was very vague in September and just said that there was a query, that there may have been a question about me having cancer in 2011 but this was in black and white, quite clear, this is cancer.  I then noticed at the end of the page that this was page 2 of two of this report.  I work in administration so I notice these things even though it is tiny, page 2 of two.  I was sitting there asking my mother \"Jesus, where's page 1?\".  Mam said \"Ah sure it's probably just a cover page.\"  I said, \"Well, yeah, but from who, to who and when was it dated?\" because at that stage I started questioning when this was sent.  When I thought back to the conversation with Mr. Hickey I assumed that the audit had been carried out just that year, in 2017.  I took a photo of that and anything else in my file and straightaway started researching medical negligence solicitors.  I contacted Cian O'Carroll on 30 January, I was in his office and that was the start of me taking my court case.  We requested files then from CervicalCheck and that was the start of all this coming out.<\/p><p> I was not affected by the delay in being told that my cancer went back to 2011 and make no mistake about it, I had cancer in 2011 - it was not pre-cancer, it was cancer.  The misdiagnosis in my case, and I know this is not the case for other women in this audit, has cost me my life.  I have got terminal cancer.  I do not believe I am going to die but at the end of the day I am going to have to fight to live for the rest of my life and go from one treatment option to another until I find something to cure me but I should not be in this position at all, if my cancer had been picked up on that smear where there were plenty of cancer cells, there is no question from the expert cytologist on my legal team.  The person looking at my smear sample either was not competent or did not look at it at all because it was full of cancer.  It is not that there was a small little bit of cancer on the slide, it was full of cancer.  I could have been one of the women, like Irene, Stephen's wife, who was not given the chance to find out and was not given the chance to fight.  Stephen is here on her behalf.  At least I am still here to tell the tale.  That is why I am fighting with everything in my being not only to live but to get to the bottom of this because it is a disgrace that we have been put in this position.<\/p><p> There are three issues, first, open disclosure, which did not happen in my case, too little too late.  Mr. Hickey told me in September 2017 about this audit.  When we got the correspondence back through disclosure we found out that this audit was carried out in October 2014 on my smear.  I was diagnosed in July 2014.  It took a full two years to decide to communicate this to clinicians so it was July 2016 before CervicalCheck communicated my particular case to my gynaecologist.  Then there was 15 months of correspondence between the head of CervicalCheck and my gynaecologist about whose responsibility it was to tell me, 15 months of them deciding \"You tell her\", \"No you tell her\" before he finally told me in September 2017.<\/p><p> People will say it would not have made any difference at that stage because I already had cancer but I know the type of person I am, and Stephen will tell you the same about Irene, I would want to know that.  They should have told me that.  That is my information.  I am the patient.  It is my information that was hidden from me.  I would probably have asked for more scans if I had known \"Jesus hang on a minute here, I don't have cancer only since 2014, in fact it's going back a further three years.\"  We know with cervical cancer the longer you have it the worse your prognosis.  That would have made me be more on top of my gynaecologist and oncologist and look for more scans and maybe it would have been picked up a little sooner and I would not be in this position.  <\/p><p> Patient safety is another issue.  Why were serious errors highlighted by these audits not treated as patient safety incidents?  In the briefing note sent to the Minister with regard to my case before it went to court, Jerome Coffey gave a written opinion to say that my mistake was not a patient safety issue.  I would like to know does Jerome Coffey, who is the head of the National Cancer Control Programme, NCCP, still believe this to be the case now that there are 18 women dead and 209 women involved.  If it is his view is he the appropriate person to be in charge? <\/p><p> The other question I have is who are the senior management team who approved this communication strategy which has come out?  We have seen various iterations of it in the press over the past few days.  Who approved this communications strategy and who decided it was okay not only not to tell the clinicians but not to tell the patients?  Why was the HSE more worried about being sued by the labs, such as Quest, than communicating the information on incorrect or misread smears to patients?  That fills the gap for us, to know that in the two years between my audit and the communication I received from my gynaecologist there was a full 12 months of wrangling between the HSE and one of these labs about disclosing information to clinicians never mind patients.  Where is the open disclosure in this instance?  Who stood over these contracts? <\/p><p> My questions are about open disclosure, patient safety and the labs.  With regard to the labs, who stood over these contracts where patient safety and open disclosure were not considered to be important issues?  When you think of the legal wrangling they were having with these labs where the labs were basically saying their contracts stipulated that the clinicians were not to be told because these were for educational purposes.  The reason my case went to court and I had to give evidence, and it went on for four days, was that the lab was insisting on a confidentiality clause because this was agreed as part of its contract with the HSE.  They are the two big issues I see with the labs.  I want to know who stood over these contracts, if they were reading them.  Patient safety and open disclosure were clearly not included if you read through their stipulations.  How can anyone stand over that and give these people contracts?<\/p><p> I think that is it.<\/p><p>If there anything else I need to say, the big thing for me is patient safety.  I am not interested in revenge.  That is not what I am here for.  I want to see accountability and I would like to see a legacy that this will never happen again to any woman, man or child in this country.  This is not just an issue for women.  This is affecting men and children who are without their wives and their mothers.  I never want to see this happen again.  If I do die, I do not want it to be in vain.  I want to make sure that protocols put in place, that there are sanctions for people who make these mistakes and that they are held accountable.  The HSE should be overhauled, and I mean overhauled from the ground up, so that people are held accountable and that this will never happen again in any shape or form.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Vicky Phelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you Vicky.

Thanks very much for the opportunity to speak to you all today.  I am here representing my late wife, Irene, who died in July last year at the age of 35.  I am going to begin just over two weeks ago when the HSE first contacted me.  It was Tuesday, 1 May, around 2.30 p.m.  I was in work and got a call from a non-clinical adviser from the HSE.  I was advised that Irene was one of the 17 women at the time whose name had come up in the most recent audit.  We now know that is 18.<\/p> <p>  I requested there and then - there is obviously no good time to receive a call like that - a face-to-face meeting.  I said I could not have that conversation over the phone.  I did ask what smear tests were being referred to in respect of this audit and I was told 2013 and 2010.  I asked whether they going back as far as 2010.  The woman on the phone pointed out that she was not a clinical adviser and that I needed to come in and meet a consultant next Thursday night at 7.30 p.m.  <\/p> <p>  I asked on Thursday night why a non-clinical adviser was phoning to tell us this.  Why was it done over the phone?  Why could someone not have called out to my house?  I was told then that a decision had been made that no medical staff were going to make the phone calls because they did not want us asking any questions over the telephone when we received those calls on Tuesday, 1 May.  <\/p> <p>  On Thursday, 3 May, at 7.30 p.m. we arrived in St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork.  I was there with Irene's mum and dad.  We were brought into a waiting room within the hospital.  It was just a standard hospital waiting room.  We were passing women on the way out the doors of St. Finbarr's who were upset.  We were brought into an empty waiting room with vending machines in the corners and a television on and just told to wait there.  A girl walked in with her mum and dad.  I would say if she was 30 that would be a lot.  They sat down behind us.  I was trying to get my head around the fact of whether we were actually being brought in with all of the other victims of this audit.  Surely not, that would have been a bit insensitive.  I turned around to that family and asked were they one of the 205 or 206, as it was at the time.  The mother turned to me and said \"yes, we are.  And you?\".  I said that we were one of the 17.  The daughter of that family just got up then and left the waiting room.  She was clearly upset by that.  <\/p> <p>  We waited there alongside that family for the next half hour.  Then we were brought in to see the consultant.  He was actually the consultant that Irene was referred to on day one.  There was just him, a nurse and Irene's mum and dad.  We sat down.  Irene's file was open on the table with the CervicalCheck audit on it.  The last time I saw that file was 14 July last year, when we were given Irene's terminal diagnosis in hospital.  It was the same bulky file with all of her information in it.  The consultant started reading through the audit with us.  It was like the piece of paper that was shared a minute ago.  He shared with us that were two sides to the page.  On the left-hand side were the smear tests which Irene had done and the results that her GP would have been given.  On the right-hand side of the page were the results from the audit carried out on these two smear tests.  <\/p> <p>  Obviously, Irene was led to believe that both of these smear tests came back clean.  The 2010 test said to call back in three years and the 2013 test said to call back in three to five years' time.  When these were audited, it turned out that the 2010 test had pre-cancerous cells in it.  That was the result from the audit.  I asked what this would have triggered if Irene had got these results on day one.  I was told they would have brought her back in, they would have done a physical examination and would have performed a procedure where they would have burned away the cells.  The chances are that would have been it then.  She would have been told to go and live the rest of her life.  As the consultant pointed out to us, 2013 was the most concerning of the two smear tests because this had the beginnings of cancer.  This was the biggest concern because Irene would have been called in straight away.  She would have gone through treatment.  Again, she could have gone on to live a happy life with us - with me and my two boys.  <\/p> <p>  The question is how did Irene find out she had cancer.  It was not from a screening process.  Irene had two missed opportunities for cancer to be identified in her smear tests.  If it had been identified in either one, she would still be here with us today.  I have heard through different sources and through the media that these smear tests are accurate up to 70% or up to 90%.  They might have 10% inaccuracy.  In Irene's case it was 100% inaccurate.  Two consecutive smear tests were missed and two opportunities to save her life.  <\/p> <p>  On 21 April 2015, Irene gave birth to our youngest boy, Noah.  Soon after that, Irene noticed she was not recovering from childbirth.  She was still bleeding.  About five or six weeks after Noah was born, she went back into Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, for an examination.  She was given some statistic.  I am not sure what it was but it was on the lines of so many women can bleed up to eight weeks and ten weeks after birth.  It was a rarity but did happen.  At eight weeks, Irene was still bleeding.  She went back to the GP and got an appointment to go back in to see a consultant in CUMH and at 12 weeks she went back in.<\/p> <p>  At that stage, her cervix was looked at.  There was nothing wrong with it.  It was going along the lines of maybe Irene had some kind of hormone imbalance and that was why she was not recovering from childbirth.  They were going to write her a prescription to balance her hormones.  Essentially that prescription would have been for the contraceptive pill.  Irene was breastfeeding Noah.  He was 12 weeks old.  Irene knew that this medicine that she had been prescribed would dry up her milk supply and she would be unable to feed Noah.  She refused it straight away.  <\/p> <p>  At 18 weeks, Irene was still bleeding and she went back to her GP.  Her GP referred her back to the CUMH to see the same consultant again.  They decided then to do a dilation and curettage, D and C, procedure because they were thinking that maybe some elements of childbirth still left in her womb might be causing an infection.  They said that if they carried out a D and C that might get rid of the bleeding.  When they were doing the D and C on Irene, the consultant that had seen her at 12 weeks noticed there was a change in her cervix at that point, at 20 weeks.<\/p><p>They took a sample and tested it.  It was then that Irene was diagnosed with cervical cancer.  At this point, we had a five-month-old boy being breast-fed and a two-and-a-half-year-old boy and Irene needed to start that gruelling treatment that Vicky went into detail about - radiotherapy, chemotherapy and brachytherapy at the end - for eight weeks.  As Vicky mentioned, this is a horrible experience - all of it.  The eight weeks of treatment are gruelling.  The medication and steroids - everything you are put on just makes you sick.  It was a very difficult time for all of us but we are fighters.  Irene led the pack and we just got on with it.  When you have two small children, you have to fight this.  At the end of the eight weeks, you have the horrible wait of three months for that scan to review how this treatment has gone.  That brought us up to around February when we had that scan.  In March, we were told the treatment went very well.  When Irene had been diagnosed that previous September, she had been diagnosed with stage 2 cancer and they told us they would be treating for cure.  So when they told us in March that all that was left was scar tissue from the tumour on her cervix, obviously we were delighted with that.  Everything seemed to be working fine.  <\/p><p> During the summer, Irene started to get progressively sick again with back pain and pain down her legs.  It go so bad that she was getting up in the middle of the night to take pain medication and to make up water bottles.  When we went back for our appointment in September 2016, after a couple of weeks of testing, Irene was told that she had secondary liver cancer and tumours in her lungs.  They did not discuss treating for cure at this point.  They never said it was terminal.  They just said we would now be living with cancer, that they had a very aggressive chemotherapy treatment plan, that after that, they had plan B and that after that, they had plan C.  Irene went through this chemotherapy involving one day of chemotherapy and going back every three weeks.  You are floored in the first week of this chemotherapy.  In the second week, you are coming back together and in the third week, you are up and running again.  Then you get slammed again with another dose of this chemotherapy and you are wiped out again.  It is just a continuous cycle for 12 weeks.  After a second dose of chemotherapy, Irene lost all her hair.  She said \"I am now a sick person\" because, as Vicky said, you do not lose your hair the first time and can still blend into the crowd and nobody knows what is going on but this time, as she said, people were giving up their seats for her and opening doors.  You are now sick.  This treatment lasted until January.  We had a scan that said the tumour on her liver was shrinking.  Less than a month later, we had another scan saying it was growing again.  Irene spent every second or third week in hospital in early 2017 - infection after infection after infection - up to the point of 14 July 2017 when they sat us down and said there was no more they could do for us and were stopping all treatment.  When we asked how long we had, they said a few short weeks and that they hoped we would get to the end of the summer.  Irene's only ambition there and then was to see our eldest guy start primary school at the end of August.  Irene only lasted a week and a half later.  She passed away on 26 July.  <\/p><p> The HSE received the audit results on 3 July last year - just over three weeks before Irene died.  It decided there and then that it was not going to share that information with Irene or me.  At that meeting on the evening of Thursday, 3 May, I was told a team of counsel made the conscious decision not to share the information with Irene or me.  They thought she was a bit too sick.  This was 3 July.  She did not get her terminal diagnosis until 14 July.  They did not know if she was going to live for three weeks.  They did not have a clue at that point.  We told him that this was not his decision to make - how dare he?  If he knew Irene at all, he would know that if she had three minutes to live and this information landed across her desk, she would want to know exactly what that was about.  The next morning, 12 hours later, I got another call from this consultant.  He said to me that he gave me misleading information at our meeting the previous night.  He did not do it deliberately but he wanted to correct it.  He said that the counsel - the team of people he met - did not actually tell him not to pass on the information to Irene or me and that they actually said that it was about open disclosure and told him to contact CervicalCheck.  Somewhere within the 12 hours, this consultant was clearly reminded of the company line and made a conscious effort to get in touch with me quickly just to correct exactly what he said.  When I asked him what happened when he did contact CervicalCheck, he said he did not know, which was odd because you would think that would be the first question I was going to ask.  He did not have that information for me.  I politely reminded him that this was a big part of the puzzle and that I wanted to know exactly what conversation he had.  I said that he was told about open disclosure and then told to contact CervicalCheck so I asked the conversation was.  I told him he needed to find this out to which I got the smart response that he would have a look and that he needed to trawl back through 2,000 or 3,000 emails but that he would have a look.  I told him that he had better do that and that I wanted to know that.  He replied that it may have been a verbal communication and that he did not know 100%.  I think we can all take it that I will probably never find out the answer to that question.  That is a problem.  <\/p><p> This lack of open disclosure within the HSE is clearly a problem.  The communication between senior management and consultants is an issue.  Communication between senior management and the Department of Health is an issue.  From what we have learned in the past 24 hours, communication between the Department of Health and the Government is clearly an issue.  While it exists with a fantastic nursing staff and the majority of consultants - I have to give credit to the nursing staff who took really good care of my wife - clearly patient care is diluted up the ladder and the element of protect and deny is introduced.  That is basically what we have seen in the past few weeks when it comes to all of this communication or the lack of communication we are being fed, the lack of communication with Irene, the lack of communication with me and the lack of communication with her GP.  I had to inform Irene's GP that she was one of the 17 women who were audited.  I had to inform Irene's GP about the results of the audit.  Irene's GP is not only her GP but the GP of her three sisters, her mother and father, my two boys and my niece and nephew.  He is the family doctor and he was never consulted about any part of this.  I have copies of the smear tests he performed in his clinic and they could not even give him the audited results of the tests he conducted.  Information was clearly withheld from him and it looks like information was clearly withheld from the Ministers.  We have to take them at their word that they did not receive this information.<\/p><p> It seems that the people in these senior positions who knew about all of these memos in 2016 are the same people in senior positions today who need to be questioned when it comes to these inquiries.  I do not understand how they can sit in these positions while inquiries are ongoing.  We have dead women here.  We have women who have been given terminal diagnoses - death sentences.  We are talking about 209 women, of whom 18 are dead.  We still do not know how many of the rest have a terminal diagnosis, how many are still going through treatment and how many have finished treatment and are lucky enough to be out the other side.  It is how many weeks later and they still cannot give us this information.<\/p><p>We have two people gone but more need to go now.  They need to step aside.  They have to get out of the way so these inquiries can take place.  Right now, they know where all the answers to the questions lie.  They know the places not to look or to keep us away from and they are clearly sitting on this information, preventing us from getting it.  It is obvious that this is going on from the drip-drip feed that Oireachtas Members seem to be getting at these committee meetings.  I welcome the Scally inquiry.  It is important that we have a third party inquiry on this.  He needs to speak to the same people that are sitting in these senior positions who are deliberately covering up information.  If someone knows something about another department and mistakes are being made, and that information is not being passed on, that is a cover-up.  If other people are involved in not sharing that information, they are now part of that cover-up too, yet they all remain in senior positions in the HSE.  That is a huge concern of mine.<\/p><p> Last Thursday, when I left the meeting, I left with nothing.  Nothing was offered.  There were no support services, nothing for me to help my kids through their bereavement.  Oscar was four when his mum died and Noah was two.  They are five and three today.  Ten to 15 years from now, they will be reading all about this in the papers and they will look at what their dad was doing here today.  What is there to help me prepare them for that?  What is there when they see two missed opportunities to save their mother's life?  How do I communicate that with them?<\/p><p> I am one of now 17 families.  There are close to 200 women.  We do not know how many are terminal and how many are going through cancer treatment.  When one is going through that horrible process of treatment for cancer, one's mental attitude towards that treatment is very important.  How do you think these women feel in the last couple of weeks after having these meetings and being told that a few smear tests were missed that could have saved their lives?  Maybe they would not have to go through cancer treatment, maybe they are not terminal and maybe they do not have to die.<\/p><p> On top of that, they have to fight for their life while having to process that information.  When the HSE informed them of this audit, it just sent them back out the door with no support services.  There was absolutely nothing but a \"Goodbye, there you go\".  This is why, from the beginning, I decided to share Irene's story because that is exactly what she would have wanted.  If she got this information three weeks or three minutes before she died, we would all know about that story.  She would have been shouting the same thing that I am shouting.  The support services took almost a week to be put in place from the second I started roaring and shouting about it.  We heard the announcement last Friday of all these support services, which I welcome.  They are great.  The problem is that I still have not heard anything.  I know you have not heard anything.  I do not think anybody has heard anything.  Will this come in for us in 2020 or 2021?  Those support services should have been in place two or three weeks ago when we were sitting with the HSE, and they were not.  It is another example of the lack of patient care within the HSE.<\/p><p> The HSE needs to be reformed, particularly at the senior level.  It needs to start looking at how it is run from the ground up and the staff that are there today, looking after patients.  Patient care needs to be put in the backbone of the HSE, right up to senior management.  Communication is key.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Teap","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526486400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I have not heard anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Vicky Phelan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526486400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I am not interested in open disclosure but am more interested in mandatory disclosure.

Thank you for coming here and sharing your stories with us.  As you know, we had representatives of the HSE and Department before us last week.  We will have more representatives before us tomorrow.  Some of those people that Stephen spoke about that knew about the strategy, the memo and the cover-up which has been referred to, will be here tomorrow.  We will ask the hard questions on your behalf, on Vicky's behalf and all of the women's behalf, and of those husbands and partners who are suffering.<\/p> <p>  Any of you can answer this question but I know that Vicky's solicitor has very publicly said that he believes that there is a cover-up in the main centres relating to the lack of open disclosure, the fact that discretion was given to consultants and, in the cases of women who passed away, the information was not passed on to their next of kin.  We heard Stephen's story.  If Mr. Cian O'Carroll is in a position to address the committee, he might expand on that a bit more with regard to his view of a cover-up and what exactly he meant by that.  He might also, if he can - and Vicky or Stephen can respond to this too - talk to me about how people were selected for audit in the first place.  Given the documentation that emerged yesterday, does Mr. O'Carroll feel there were any discrepancies or issues relating to how people were selected for the audit?<\/p> <p>  I am looking at a questions and answers document that was prepared for the Department and the HSE.  It talks about the 1,120 cases that were part of the audit by December 2015.  It says that 317 cases, which is 28.3% of the total cases, were flagged for further review.  In most, though not all, of these reviewed cases, there may have been an opportunity for earlier intervention.  This includes pre-cancerous cell changes that were not detected.  Those for whom this resulted in a delay in diagnosis of treatment are most likely dead.<\/p><p>I want to ask Stephen if that is what happened to Irene and whether she is in that category.  Vicky, how is that different from your own experience?  You said yours potentially might have been an outlier, or was it that it was an outlier in terms of how your smear test was so badly misread?<\/p><p> In terms of Mr. O'Carroll's work, did he discover any problems with the lab itself?  Vicky put it extremely well, better than anybody could, that the issues are open disclosure and patient safety.  I find it incredible that the HSE and the Department are still saying there are no patient safety issues when we clearly heard what happened in your case.  It is beyond words that they still say that, but you also talked about the labs.  When you talked about the labs being an issue, are you talking about the performance of the labs, issues in relation to the labs and the relationship between the labs possibly preventing information getting to patients because of contractual issues?  Is that the issue?  You might be able to come back on some of those points.<\/p><p> Those are the questions I have.  I will finish by saying that I think everybody admires your bravery and your courage, Vicky, as well as yours, Stephen.  I genuinely wish you both well.  It is sad you have had to come here and tell your story but I think it is worthwhile for us in view of our preparations for tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#H00500","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I welcome Cian, Vicky and Stephen and thank you for taking the time to be here.

I am ashamed that, as the body that is supposed to hold all of these organisations to account, we have all spectacularly failed you, and for that I am personally sorry.  I have two questions, one for each, although you covered it, Stephen.  Normally, we call people \"Mister\" and so on in here but if you do not mind, we can be more informal.  Given the work that is under way, and you did touch on this, you may want to add something in terms of the Scally scoping report.  We also have the indication of a commission of investigation after that and the indication of a peer review, as well as the work of the health committee and this committee.  In terms of accountability, if there are any tangible actions both of you would like to see now, you might expand on that.  Clearly, you have highlighted an awful lot that, as Deputy Cullinane said, will feed into our questioning tomorrow, and we will do that.<\/p> <p>  The other comment is that the principles of care that underpin actions in Ireland are from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists following the report in 2011.  The first of them is that the woman must be at the centre of her own care.  Have you any comment on that, give it is supposed to be principle No. 1?<\/p> <p>  Very finally and quite specifically, and Deputy Cullinane touched on this, you mentioned that MedLab was the lab where your test was.  We know from its confirmation and a statement on Sunday that it subcontracted to a third-party laboratory, and we will be asking on contractual issues about that tomorrow.  I know from speaking to some GPs that all the results coming back to them were signed by an Irish-registered pathologist.  I wondered if there was any information you had as to whether your tests were done on-site there, or were they a part of the backlog situation where MedLab subcontracted this work.  If it was a subcontracted test, were you or your physicians informed of that in your own research through the legal process or otherwise?  If so, is it the case that the Irish-registered pathologist based in Sandyford is transcribing results from another lab and just signing off on them, taking them as correct, or is that person looking under a microscope to say, \"Yes, I concur with that\", and then signing off on them?

We have had the HSE in at this committee routinely on various issues.  Very often, it is about something much more academic and we are trying to understand something and humanise it.  Unfortunately, we tend to get change in this country by people putting themselves forward, putting themselves out there in a way that really should not have to happen.  Whether it is the Garda, the health service or otherwise, that seems to be what is important in terms of triggering public understanding of the failure of our system.  That is why it is so important that you have both gone so public in a situation that is so personal to yourselves.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  I know there are a lot of us here and I do not want to delay you.  One thing jumped out at me, Vicky, in regard to one of the points you made, and that was about the contractual obligation between the HSE and the lab.  Did the contract actually have a requirement for confidentiality?  Were there other things, as in the court, that jumped out to you, and that may well be more nuanced, but that would be helpful for us in exploring how we make changes to the system?  Stephen, I have to say the way you have been told, and the way this has been handled, has compounded the problem or - I should not call it a problem - has compounded the crisis.  The situation where you were brought in and told in such an insensitive way, plus the fact the supports are not there for you, is something of which we have to take very serious note because that is as much to do with the care as everything else that has transpired before this.

It is an emotive term but I think it is fair to say that, from the documentation, you can clearly see there was a co-ordinated and a premeditated plan to deny patients the information, although not in total.  The documentation suggests that it was envisaged that some patients would be told of the audit, albeit quite late in the day.  Nobody was to be told before the middle of 2016 and, at that point, people were to be selected.  It is the criteria for their selection that causes a major problem for disclosure.  We see from the documentation that doctors were told not only could they be selective with their patients, but if the woman had died, they were not to tell her family and it was simply to be put in the file.  That appears in a number of documents and it turns up in the CervicalCheck preprinted leaflet that was sent out to the clinicians telling them how to deal with the audit in July 2016.  More than 120 pages of documents were released yesterday by the Department of Health.<\/p><p>I have not considered them in detail, but I did notice that there is a set of precedent letters towards the back of that bundle which are to be used by CervicalCheck.  Included in that bundle is a letter to clinicians.  The letter includes a line about open disclosure but beside that, in the Microsoft Word format, is a comment which tells the person reading the precedent document that in cases where a woman has died this sentence is to be deleted from the letter and there is to be no reference to open disclosure.  Therefore, we see that there is a thread moving through documents which suggests that there was a premeditated and orchestrated plan to keep this information from patients who had died in particular.<\/p><p> Furthermore, in the correspondence between CervicalCheck's Professor Flannelly and Vicky's consultant gynaecologist, there is a dialogue going on over a period of more than a year - 15 months - in which two clinicians are talking to one another and in which CervicalCheck's clinical director is saying that she does not believe that all these women should be told.  At one point she describes three of the ten patients who were on that list as meeting her clinical criteria for being told, yet we know that all of those women had suffered some degree of delay in the treatment of their cancer.  While I cannot comment in any meaningful way about the degree to which they were all affected by that delay, from the reports of this audit I have seen to date - and the records have been slow in coming through - four out of four women have been significantly affected.  It is reasonable at least to say that doctors looking at those records must have known that there had been a very significant clinical effect on women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cian O'Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Do Vicky or Stephen have any comment on the points made?

I asked the consultant that.  He did not know the answer but, thankfully, there was a nurse in the room who did.  She could only speak on behalf of the clinic in St. Finbarr's.  She explained the process there to me.  Irene did not attend that clinic but it is where the tests for cervical cancer are done.  She said that once a month a list is compiled of the names of all the women who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer and it is sent off to the register.  It is there that the audit process begins.  I asked how long it takes for an audit to take place.

With the memos last week we discovered that this was clearly the case with one of the laboratories in particular.  That answered a question for us because we were wondering why there had been this delay of two years.  My audit was triggered in October 2014 and then in July 2016, almost two years later, CervicalCheck contacted my gynaecologist to inform him that I was one of these cases and that he was to use his judgment on whether to inform me.  It took another 15 months, until September 2017, before he actually did tell me.  We were wondering what the delay had been.  Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly was interviewed on \"Morning Ireland\" and that interview answered one of the questions because she said it took them a while to come up with this communications strategy.  That strategy had to be decided on and we were asking \"Jesus, could that take two years?\"  That was one explanation.  Then when these memos came out last week they showed that the laboratory was thinking about suing the HSE because it did not want the clinicians to know, let alone the patients.  How long did that legal wrangling between the HSE and the laboratory go on for?  My question is where was the patient in all of this?  Nobody really cared about whether the patient should be told.  It was about the legal wrangling between the HSE and the laboratory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Vicky Phelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I have one small point.

Perhaps the committee members could be mindful in their questioning that this can be used as a major distraction.  I cannot speak about Irene's medical records but what happened to Vicky Phelan, and what I have seen in other situations, is that an error occurred in the reading of the original smear which was of an unacceptable magnitude.  While technically it may be correct to call that a false negative, if one simply rests on it as a false negative and a statistical occurrence one closes one's mind to the necessary investigation of the cause of that failure.<\/p> <p>  It would be beneficial for patient safety if there was some questioning of the relevant key witnesses as to why clinical directors and other clinical people involved in CervicalCheck and the Department of Health appeared to have closed their minds to the magnitude of the errors which were coming back to them through the audit.  They were largely doctors and it must have been quite evident to them, from these 209 cases which involved a significant delay in the commencement of treatment, that there might have been someone in those laboratories who was simply incompetent or that there might have been other factors causing this.  The fact that only a month ago a memo from the senior medical people involved in cancer screening in Ireland to the Minister for Health stated that an error of that magnitude in Vicky Phelan's case was not a patient safety incident confirms that they have never investigated the error in her case.

Everybody in Ireland owes thanks to Vicky, Stephen and anyone else who has come out on this issue and explained to us, from where we are, how it has affected them, their families and all those around them.<\/p> <p>  I want to home in on one particular aspect, which I believe Vicky said.  It is the idea that it would not have made any difference.  I keep thinking about her saying that.  Who decides what a difference is?  It may not have made a material difference to the outcome in some cases.  It is difficult to quantify in some cases, although I am not saying in the witnesses' cases, but the fact that something has to have a change in staging for it to have made a difference is getting to the crux of the issue because we are ignoring the feelings and the considerations someone goes through when they have a diagnosis of cancer.  They wonder what could have been if they had noticed something earlier.  Vicky went through her symptoms in great detail, and I thank her for doing that.  It is very difficult  but it is important that we hear the actual detail of what she has gone through.  However, it is important to acknowledge that in terms of families or individuals who have a cancer diagnosis, everyone will meet that news with a different reaction.  The difference does not have to be a stage or a level in terms of how long they have got left.  It is more to do with how they deal with it, and how they deal with it as a couple, in Stephen's case.  It is very difficult for any of us here who have husbands and young children to consider how they would get on without us.  In terms of the future, it must be very difficult for Vicky, with her diagnosis, to consider that it might not be her but those she may leave behind who will have to continue her fight.<\/p> <p>  Vicky mentioned the 12 months of wrangling with the HSE and laboratories.  Like Deputy Kelly, I sit on both the Joint Committee on Health and the Committee of Public Accounts.  So much has come out in the past week but I am almost sure that we were told that period of wrangling occurred between March of 2016 and the summer of 2016 and that was the reason for the line in the memorandum, \"Pause all letters\", or whatever it said.  The justification I heard this morning at the health committee for that period was that this was dealing with that issue, but Vicky has told us she was wrangling with the HSE for 12 months.  I do not want to put her under pressure but it is important because my understanding is that we were led to believe that this was a short period of a few months.  Is it possible for Mr. O'Carroll to find out where that is coming from because it is important for tomorrow's meeting?<\/p> <p>  I am shocked at the way Mr. Teap was treated.  I cannot believe the insensitivity shown in that people were brought into a holding area, for the want of a better term.  We need to find out who in God's name decided in the past few weeks that this was the appropriate way to treat these people.  I suspect it was not anybody with a medical degree, but perhaps I am wrong.<\/p> <p>  What comes to the fore in all of this is that people have a vocation.  They are clinicians first and they see patients before they see data.  We have a serious issue in our health service when somebody like Mr. O'Brien opens an email and decides, without his medical degree, that this is not a significant error.  A committee, and I believe it should probably be the health committee, needs to get to the bottom of who decided that was the framework in which Stephen should be treated.<\/p> <p>  On the magnitude of errors, in Vicky's case, when the audit of the slide was done, it was essentially extensive cancer.  It is becoming more alarming to me, as we find out more information, that the 15%, 20%, 30% or whatever was the acceptable level of false negatives or false positives was not a consideration.  To my mind, we have not seen any evidence that anyone quantified those errors.  Was it a systemic error in a particular laboratory?  It is shocking to me that anyone could look at Vicky Phelan's case in particular and say, \"Okay, we have this false negative.\"  However, it is not really a false negative.  It is active cancer on a slide.  My understanding from the conversation around it is that they would not really need a microscope; it was that obvious.  It seems to me that this would be fundamental to the audit process.  If there was a 30% rate, they would need to make sure that it falls within the category of false negative and that it is not something extra to that.<\/p> <p>  We spoke about the auditing process at the health committee earlier and there seems to be a serious issue with that process.  There seems to be many people in the HSE with the word \"audit\" in their job titles.  One of the fundamental aspects of audit is that one should know what one will do with the results when they are received, and there should be a pathway.  Critical to this is that there was no pathway decided before anything happened, so what was the point of the audit?  It appears the point of the audit was data rather than people.<\/p> <p>  I hate giving round figures because everyone is a person in this but we have a figure of 1,500 and then 1,641 from the cancer registry.  If we combine them we have approximately 3,000.  That is the number of women with a diagnosis which have been audited.  Of those, there are 209 in the first batch - excuse my terminology - and another number in the second batch.  We do not know that number.  In the case of the error on Vicky's smear, it seems obvious to me that an immediate random audit has to start of all of the samples, not just the approximately 3,000 women because all of those have cancer-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#M00700","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526486400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Vicky Phelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>-----but all the people in the system.

My comment relates to what you said earlier about the wrangling period.  My understanding was similar to that of Deputy Kate O'Connell, namely, that that period of disagreement between the labs concluded around May or June 2016.  My understanding - and I will double-check tomorrow - was from the documentation we had received, which said that a meeting was requested between the national screening service and the labs.  After that took place, all legal correspondence ceased.<\/p> <p>  My questions relate to some of the issues that we heard last week and on which I seek your views.  Last week, representatives of the State Claims Agency claimed that they were completely opposed to the non-disclosure agreement which Vicky was being asked to sign.  They said that under no circumstances did the agency support that.  Can Vicky say whether that was communicated to you or your legal team?  Perhaps Cian O'Carroll can answer that.  When did either Vicky or Cian become aware that the State Claims Agency had taken the position that it was completely opposed to the use of a non-disclosure agreement in Vicky's case?<\/p> <p>  What sort of process was there in respect of obtaining documents?  Was co-operation given to Vicky and her legal team up to this week?  Can Cian say what the attitude has been by CervicalCheck towards releasing documentation to people, in his experience?  Is there an open procedure to getting that information or is there still a culture of trying to put obstacles in people's way in terms of getting the documentation to which they are entitled? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#N00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526486400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>To return to Deputy MacSharry's question on MedLab, am I correct that it related to the history of the examination of those slides and where they were examined?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cian O'Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>It had been suggested to me by GPs that no matter where the examinations were done by MedLab, that they were getting results back that were signed by an Irish-registered pathologist.

The Government and the HSE have a duty of care to alleviate women's fear and to do so quickly.  Second, we do not know what the error rate actually is.  There are so many different variations of what it is and we are being told by people who cannot back it up with any type of proof.

We thank them for making the time available to give their accounts.  Stephen said he wondered what Oscar and Noah would think ten years from now when they look back on this and on what their Dad did today.  They will be very proud of what their brave Dad has done in standing up and talking for their Mum in Leinster House.<\/p> <p>  Officialdom has been given a fair crack of the whip in these committee rooms, week in and week out, but I am not sure if people listening are any wiser.  The impact of its decisions, or lack of decisions, is a personal human story that is manifest in the stories of Vicky and Stephen, on behalf of Irene.  Vicky spoke about the appalling breach of trust - on the day of her court case - on the steps of the High Court.  As she has monitored proceedings over the past couple of weeks, has she seen anything that shows a willingness to change on the part of the people who are coming to this committee to answer questions or, as Stephen said, is the protect and deny culture still thriving even up to this point?

Is that fuelling her request for a complete clear-out to allow for an honest appraisal of the situation, rather than protecting an entity?  God knows what they are protecting.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the question Cian posed about the magnitude of the errors.  The discussion has been focused on the lack of communication, but you made an interesting point in terms of focusing on the magnitude of errors and why there is a closed-mind attitude to the latter.  How far do you think that closed-mind attitude permeates the system?  When the Taoiseach was addressed on this matter during Leaders' Questions on 1 May, he said it is just the norm that two pairs or four pairs of eyes miss something like this.  However, as Vicky said, it was not a small amount of cancer but, rather, a slide full of it.

Obviously, the past period of time has been very difficult for them.  I recall a certain individual a number of years ago making the point about another person who had passed away that he had done the State some service.  There is no doubt that Vicky, Stephen and Cian have done the State a great service over the past couple of weeks.  They have become the catalyst for something everybody in this room and many people in Leinster House have been seeking in recent years, namely, reform of the HSE and the health service.  As a result of what they have done I believe we will never again see the same attitude in the future.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise two points arising from the presentations.  One was mentioned by Deputies Cassells and Kelly and I wish to tease it out further.  It is about the same people still being in position as we move on.  I believe there must be accountability not just in the House but across the board.  Vicky, Stephen and Cian will be aware that there are a number of investigations taking place.  We all want to get to the bottom of this issue.  We need to get all the answers.  Would it be better if the five, ten, 20 or whatever number of people are involved were left there to get the answers rather than move them to one side at this stage?  I have no preference regarding the answer to that.<\/p> <p>  Second, Stephen made a point that refers to both him and Vicky.  First, you said it is disappointing that you still have not heard anything about the suite of services and supports that was announced on Friday last.  Do you think there is enough there?  Stephen might have mentioned that there are other issues that could be addressed in the future.  You are both in different situations to a certain extent.

Over the course of this discussion we have got very valuable information that will help us in questioning the other individuals who will be coming before us.  I wish to raise two things very briefly.  First, anyone with a basic knowledge of statistics would know what a false negative is.  However, the chances of an individual getting a slide wrong twice, in two separate tests, are non-existent.  That is what really worries me here; the incompetence.  As you said, were they looked at at all?<\/p> <p>  The second thing concerns the State Claims Agency.  Its representatives said that they were very vociferous, although maybe I am quoting them incorrectly, in their fight against non-disclosure agreements.  Is that a sense that you got from your interaction with them?<\/p> <p>  Finally, everyone is very proud of you both.  I know from watching her interviews that your family has been incredible.

One of the things that really actually enraged me with my case, when it did settle, is this.  I got to a point where they were going to waive the confidentiality clause because they knew I was not going to sign one.  However, what happened in that case was that the HSE was struck out.  It was absolved of all responsibility and did not have to admit any liability, because we were looking for exemplary damages.  The HSE officials knew that if they got caught there would be a rap on the knuckles and they would have to pay for it.  I have a huge issue with this.  I know there was a trade-off, according to what Cian was telling me.  I do not understand the ins and outs of legalities.  However, he will tell you; I really wanted to keep going, to be honest.

In regard to the point that she makes about the HSE, there were two defendants in the case.  There was a negotiation.  There was one fundamental that my wonderful client had set from day 1, which was that there could never be a confidentiality clause.  Eventually, when that was surrendered by the defendant - I thought it was the defendants, until we found out later it was just the laboratory - then a negotiation began.  That was after three days in the High Court.  It was six days after the case had started.  The focus then was on the terms of settlement.  As part of that, the HSE was to be let out of the case.  There was nothing, apparently, to be lost or gained from doing that.  I almost feel I am confessing and apologising to Ms Phelan.  Maybe in hindsight, if we were to go back now, knowing what we know and what has happened, it would be tidier to keep the HSE in it.  The HSE admitted in their defence to a breach of duty in a partial delay of informing Ms Phelan in 15 months of what had happened, which is extraordinary.  A party has been let out of proceedings, and yet it makes an apology, publicly, for the actual liability issue that the proceedings were about.  I do not think I have ever seen that before.

It started with the interview given by Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, then clinical director of CervicalCheck, on \"Morning Ireland\" on 25 or 26 April.  We first got a sense of statistics then, when she explained that there were 1,462 cases that had been looked at.  Of those, a cohort selection of 460-odd cases had been sent for review.  Of that, there were 209 cases - it was about 206 then, but the number has since grown - which involved an error in the reporting, which resulted in a clinically significant delay in the commencement of treatment for the cancer.  That is the crucial bit.  We then found out that there were another 1,500 on the national cancer register, and that brought the total figure of women who had been diagnosed with cervical cancer over the ten-year life of CervicalCheck to date to 3,000.<\/p> <p>  However, the documents that were released last night from the Department of Health include some of the annual reviews and audits which were happening around the CervicalCheck programme.  In the review, the statistics for 2016 show that at that stage they had only audited about 400 cases.  The current figure is somewhere around 462.  That is the figure that Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly gave.  It explains why not everybody is being audited in this report.  It shows that the service categorised cases by the timing within the history of the cancer.  They categorised the timing into six different categories.  For example, among women who had a diagnosis following a previous colposcopy, only most of the cases were reviewed and looked back at.  None of the cases where there was no screening for the woman prior to diagnosis of cancer were reviewed or looked back on.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#P01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cian O'Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1526486400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>If there was no screening-------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018051600002#P01500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526486400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>It says under category 1: \"No screening prior to diagnosis (woman presented with symptoms)\".

I would like at the outset to recall the bravery of Vicky Phelan, Ms Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, and the loved ones of other women who have come forward in recent days.  Their testimony and willingness to speak publicly about deeply personal matters has raised very serious questions.  These questions related to how the health service engages with individuals when things go wrong and the fact that the audit results for these women were not conveyed as they should have been.<\/p> <p>  The CervicalCheck programme was established to help prevent cervical cancer.  Before it was introduced, we were not making any impact on cervical cancer but following its introduction we are seeing a steady reduction each year.  However, every time a cervical cancer is not prevented, it is a tragedy.  That is compounded when women who have been diagnosed with cancer are not properly informed of the results of a subsequent audit.  I would like to acknowledge the powerful and deeply generous nature of the advice that is given when women who have had such painful experiences encourage others to continue to participate in the programme in the interest of their health.<\/p> <p>  These powerful testimonies place on all of us a responsibility to act to address weaknesses while sustaining the national cervical cancer screening programme in the interest of current and future generations of Irishwomen.  The Department is committed to discharging its particular responsibility to take the necessary steps, in association with the HSE, health professionals and others, to restore the trust of women in the CervicalCheck programme and, indeed, our health service more generally. <\/p> <p>  Last week, the Government commissioned a leading UK expert, Dr. Gabriel Scally, to conduct an inquiry to establish the facts and to review all aspects of CervicalCheck.  We are determined to do everything we can to assist Dr. Scally in his inquiries so that we can all find out what happened and why it happened, to make sure that we have a robust cancer screening programme for women, and so lessons are learned for the future.<\/p> <p>  The focus, however, needs to be on the women most affected as well as the CervicalCheck programme.  On Friday last, the Government agreed a comprehensive package of health and social care measures to support the 209 women and their families who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer and whose audit result differed from their original smear test.  The Government has committed to ensuring that these women and their families are supported to the fullest extent possible.<\/p> <p>  The health and social care measures include a discretionary medical card for every woman affected, or her next of kin in cases where the woman has sadly died, so that they can avail of health services, including medicines provided under the medical card scheme, free of charge; out-of-pocket medical costs incurred, including the cost of any medicines that have been prescribed by their treating clinician; primary care supports, including counselling, for the women affected, and also counselling services for the immediate family members of these women, including bereavement counselling where needed; and other health and social care supports, including travel costs and childminding.<\/p> <p>  An international clinical expert review panel is also being established as part of the Government&rsquo;s investigation into CervicalCheck.  The main purpose of the panel is to provide women with facts and independent expert assessment of those facts.  The panel&rsquo;s findings will also contribute to the overall independent assessment of the quality of the CervicalCheck programme.<\/p> <p>  The review will consider all cases of invasive cervical cancer in Ireland since CervicalCheck was established.  Women who developed cancer and who were screened by CervicalCheck will be identified and their screening histories will be examined.  The expert panel will review the cases of those women who had previous screening tests prior to their diagnosis and undertake a re-examination of cytology tests.  Where the expert panel opinion of cytology results differs from the original results provided by CervicalCheck, the panel will endeavour to determine, wherever possible, any failures to prevent cancer or to intervene at an earlier stage and will prepare individual reports for those affected, setting out the facts and their expert and independent assessment.<\/p> <p>  The Government has also announced that the State Claims Agency is advancing a new initiative aimed at expediting the resolution of the nine outstanding legal cases in a sensitive manner, utilising mediation wherever possible.  In addition, last week the Minister for Health received Government approval to provide in law for mandatory open disclosure, through the forthcoming patient safety Bill, in respect of serious patient safety incidents.  The Bill will also provide for mandatory reporting of these serious events to the appropriate regulatory authority, such as HIQA.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, the Department published records relating to the CervicalCheck clinical audit.  The information submitted by the HSE in regard to this audit in 2016 provided the Department with an understanding that this was a retrospective clinical audit undertaken for quality assurance and learning purposes and that CervicalCheck had a clear objective to provide results to consultants in order to allow for direct communication with the women concerned.  Both clinical audit and the communication of the results of clinical audit to women were seen by the Department to be very worthy and valuable undertakings by the CervicalCheck programme.  Clinical audit is an important means by which standards are maintained and advances made in healthcare.<\/p> <p>  I believe a reasonable approach was taken by the Department at the time based upon the information available to it.  There are two ways of looking at issues, one based upon the information available at the time and the other based on hindsight.  Of course, had the subsequent widespread non-disclosure been escalated by CervicalCheck within the HSE and raised with the Department, this would have triggered major concern and a much different attitude.  Based upon the information we had, however, we viewed the initiative taken to communicate audit findings to women in a positive light.<\/p> <p>  The widespread and still unfolding distress caused by the non-disclosure of the clinical audit results to the women concerned demands serious reflection, however.  The Scally inquiry provides us with a mechanism to achieve an objective basis for introducing improvements, where these can be identified.  The Department has at this stage publicly committed to engaging with the HSE on a full review of the implementation of its open disclosure policy.  <\/p> <p>  As I have mentioned, the Government has approved the drafting of a patient safety Bill by the Department.  This Bill will provide a mechanism to develop and introduce standards relating to clinical audit so as to ensure that open disclosure, including roles and responsibilities for such disclosure, are fully addressed in advance of the commencement of an audit.  As the CervicalCheck experience shows, it is important to anticipate the issues that will arise for the disclosure of clinical audit findings before commencing the process.  The clinical audit standards to be introduced under the patient safety Bill should also entail a responsibility to record the fact that open disclosure has taken place.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to the recommendations produced by the Scally inquiry.  The inquiry will produce an interim report at the start of June and a final report by the end of June.  The Department will be subject to this inquiry and will be scrutinised by it, but the committee can be assured we will provide full support and co-operation and address any learning and recommendations as a matter of priority.<\/p> <p>  With the agreement of the Chairman, I will ask Dr. Tony Holohan to make some remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Breslin.

I cannot recall a time in those years when patients were gripped by such widespread fear and concern as they are now.  Of course, given the nature of the events that have unfolded in recent weeks, the fear and concern are entirely understandable, but it has been difficult to get real facts, which people can trust, into the public domain and hence into public understanding.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute in this regard this morning.<\/p> <p>  We know things went wrong.  It is true that lessons must be learned but it is important that we be clear about what actually came to light.  Arising from the publicity following the Vicky Phelan court case, questions arose as to whether other patients might be in a similar situation.  Had Vicky Phelan not highlighted her case, we might not have become aware that other women had not had the findings of the CervicalCheck clinical audit disclosed to them by their clinicians.  We therefore owe a debt of gratitude to Vicky Phelan.  <\/p> <p>  It has become clear since the case that the non-disclosure of clinical audit findings was widespread.  It has also become clear that the issue of disclosure was the subject of dispute among some elements of the relevant clinical community.  I can provide assurance that the Department was not aware of these issues until this controversy arose, towards the end of April.  We have since had the opportunity to engage directly with a view to understanding, directing and investigating what happened.  <\/p> <p>  Let me be clear on what we knew in 2016.  First, no Minister was advised.  Second, the decision not to escalate was a fair and reasonable decision based on the information available to the Department at the time.<\/p><p>It was reasonable because the information provided in the briefing notes provided by the HSE to the Department was evidence of ongoing improvement to how the service was being delivered, rather than the identification of problems that might require escalation to Ministers.  The HSE has confirmed, and will confirm, that no systems of escalation within its organisation in relation to the implementation of the audit programme were activated.<\/p><p> In respect of CervicalCheck, it is important to point out how much has been achieved in recent years.  Before 2008 in this country we had a disorganised arrangement of random screening were random women were getting too many smears and many others were not getting any smears at all.  On an annual basis, we were doing more smears in the country at that time than we do currently.  Smears were being examined in a wide range of laboratories, many of which were too small and not fit for purpose.  There were no quality assurance arrangements in place and there were very long turnaround times for reporting of smear results.  In 2008, the population-based programme which invites patients to come forward to their GPs for smears was established with those smears being sent to accredited laboratories and appropriate follow-up in colposcopy services.  Prior to 2008, cervical cancer incidents were rising but we know that the impact since 2008 has been a 7% annualised reduction after 2010 in the incidence of cervical cancer, a clear impact of the programme.<\/p><p> Let me turn briefly to open disclosure.  It is important, given some of the debate that has taken place, that we make the position of the Department clear.  The Department does not and never has regarded open disclosure as optional.  Open disclosure should happen in the right way, in every circumstance in which it is indicated.  Patients simply must be informed.  I know that this can be a challenge for the medical profession but professionals in this country are rising to that challenge.  Our legislative approach is to encourage doctors to do the right thing in circumstances where disclosure is required.  We know from international evidence that one of the reasons that disclosure does not always happen in the right way or at all is that doctors may fear the medico-legal consequences.  We have directly addressed this fear through the voluntary disclosure legislation, the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017.  The regulations are to be signed within the coming weeks.  That legislation provides that if doctors disclose appropriately, they will not contribute further to any legal risks they may have.  That is intended to create a so-called safe space to encourage people to do the right thing.  <\/p><p> That is not to say that we do not see a role for mandatory open disclosure, so a stepped approach is required.  Therefore, following many months of work, we have secured Government approval for the patient safety Bill to introduce mandatory open disclosure for a specified list of serious reportable events.  This is in line with the UK duty of candour.  However, it goes further in that it is not just an obligation on organisations, as with the duty of candour in the UK, rather it is an obligation on doctors to disclose.  Thus, the commitment to open disclosure in this country could be regarded as exceeding - when we have enacted that legislation - that which is placed on doctors in the UK.  <\/p><p> It is really important that I am clear that we absolutely recognise that at the centre of this are tragic cases.  We are fully sensitive to that.  I want to engage, and the Department would wish to engage, directly with the individuals involved in these cases, as we have done in the past in other situations, to ensure we fully understand their perspectives and fully engage them in the process of further policy development and oversight so that we can ensure that any lessons that can be derived here can be properly applied to improvements in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to attend this meeting.  Several issues have already been covered by Mr. Breslin and Dr. Holohan so I will truncate my opening statement accordingly.<\/p> <p>  First, I would like to acknowledge and apologise for the confusion and alarm which has been created in relation to the CervicalCheck programme as a result of the failure to communicate with the women affected.  This failure has ultimately impacted on every female in Ireland, their families, their spouses and their children.  Irrespective of the original, well-intentioned undertaking by the CervicalCheck programme to conduct an audit of invasive cervical cancers and communicate the results to the patients affected, the organisation - in that respect both CervicalCheck and the HSE - has failed by any measure. <\/p> <p>  I sincerely apologise on behalf of the HSE and CervicalCheck to the women and their families who have been directly affected by what has happened and to all the women of Ireland who have been understandably frightened and concerned by what they have read and heard.  We must learn lessons from what has happened.  I assure the committee and especially the women of Ireland that I am determined that we will take on board these lessons.  Together with my colleagues, we will work to bring about the changes needed with a view to ensuring that this does not happen again.  The CervicalCheck programme is vital to women's health and we must clearly understand the mistakes that have been made and how we can learn from these and restore confidence in this life-saving public health programme.<\/p> <p>  In the short time that I have been interim director general, less than three days, I have asked for a full record search and a full chronology of events to be compiled.  That exercise is now under way.  The HSE last week provided three separate briefing notes at short notice to the Committee on Public Accounts, PAC, and we have also submitted them to this committee for information.  Regrettably, there was not sufficient opportunity at the PAC meeting last week to provide appropriate context and interpretation of the three briefing notes.  I have therefore brought colleagues to this committee who will be prepared to answer any questions of detail on these notes.  The full record search has allowed three further briefing notes relating to the audit process.  These briefing notes are provided to the committee here.  It is fair to say that the language in all of the briefing notes is very functional and somewhat lacking in empathy for the women who were to be communicated with. <\/p> <p>  I have submitted an information note to the committee regarding the briefings that were submitted to PAC together with other information.  In relation to the three specific briefings given to PAC last week, and which we have also copied to this committee, the context for the briefing given in March 2016 to the national director, health and well-being, HSE, the former director general of the HSE, and to the Department of Health was to raise awareness of the audit process that CervicalCheck was engaged in and the initial outcomes and next steps of that process.  The intent of the CervicalCheck programme was that all treating clinicians would be given individual audit findings for their patients so that these could be in turn communicated to the women concerned, in line with guidelines at that time.<\/p> <p>  A key element within the March 2016 briefing was the assurance it gave that there was no systemic quality issues of concern with the programme.  This is the most important element of an audit from a cancer prevention and effectiveness perspective, namely, to provide assurance that there is nothing systematically happening in the screening programme and its operations that would lead to it operating outside of internationally acceptable quality parameters, for example, European guidelines. <\/p> <p>  The process involved sending audit results to treating clinicians in order that these results could be communicated to the women concerned.  The CervicalCheck programme had commenced sending letters to treating clinicians in February 2016.  All individuals briefed expected that women affected would be receiving information from their treating clinicians on the result of the audit findings pertinent to their case. <\/p> <p>  The subject matter of the March 2016 briefing was to provide a snapshot of the process to date and to escalate a particular issue at hand.  This issue concerned one laboratory, Quest Diagnostics, that challenged the CervicalCheck programme communications process with treating clinicians and invoked a dispute resolution process, as part of that contract.  I have been advised that this is why \"pause all letters\" was listed as a next step in the briefing.  It was imperative that CervicalCheck and the National Screening Service resolved this issue quickly so as to ensure it had solid legal footing to continue with its work in sending audit findings to treating clinicians for onward disclosure to the women concerned, within the guidelines set out. <\/p> <p>  The thinking at that time was that if CervicalCheck were to continue sending letters, without that assurance that it had legal cover to do so, it could have created subsequent legal issues for the operation of the CervicalCheck programme, in addition to potential risks for any women seeking redress where the laboratory could claim its legal rights and entitlements were infringed by the process.  This is why \"await advice from solicitors\" was one of the next steps in the briefing note from March 2016.<\/p> <p>  CervicalCheck was supported in resolving the dispute with Quest Diagnostics and the process of issuing letters to treating clinicians recommenced in June 2016.  During the time it took to resolve the dispute, CervicalCheck was preparing individual letters for each patient case history to send to treating clinicians.  The March 2016 briefing note states that \"There is now a batch [or] accumulation of clinical audit case reports that have been completed\".  It was understood by those that were briefed that these case reports needed to be converted into individual letters in relation to each patient concerned.<\/p><p>The correspondence demonstrates that this work was happening at this time.  This correspondence will be made available to the scoping inquiry.<\/p><p> CervicalCheck explained in the briefings how the audit and communications process was complex, multi-layered and resource intensive.  They made clear to those being briefed that each communication needed to be specific to the individual and checked and rechecked for accuracy relating to the specifics of each patient, and that the logistics of sending out these communications needed to be carefully thought out so as to mitigate any risks relating to the manner, mode, content and logistics of the communication.  This is, therefore, why \"decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks\" is set out as a next step in the briefing note.  It is important to note that CervicalCheck issued the majority of the correspondence concerned during July and August 2016, with approximately 200 letters according to the July 2016 briefing notes.<\/p><p> We need to be realistic in our assessment of the communication process.  The CervicalCheck programme did not close out the issues that were subsequently encountered regarding the breakdown in the process of treating clinicians discussing those audit findings with their patients.  Indeed, it is not clear to me that the staff within the programme were aware of the scale of the difficulty in terms of the proportion of women who had not been communicated with.  I can confirm at this point that the screening service is concluding an agreement with the faculty of pathology to provide guidance and direction for the screening programme.  This will help us to provide the necessary clarity as we move forward.<\/p><p> It is also important that we look at some key facts.  Most women&rsquo;s smear test results are accurately reported.  Every year, more than 250,000 smears are undertaken.  For women who have received a normal result, the chance of going on to have cervical cancer by their next smear test three years later is less than 1%.  Since 2008, the CervicalCheck programme has provided some 3 million screenings to over 1 million women.  The programme has detected over 50,000 high-grade pre-cancerous changes in women, therefore reducing their risk of cervical cancer by 90%.  These were women without any symptoms who, without that screening programme, would not have known that they had pre-cancerous changes.  Latest figures show that the incidence of cancer in Ireland reduced by 7% in the period 2010 to 2015, which is welcome.<\/p><p> I want to take this opportunity to say a few words briefly in defence of our national audit programme.  The process of clinical audit is about measuring the quality of care against relevant standards and best professional practice.  It encompasses the requirement to identify any factors causing sub-optimal delivery of care, either at an individual patient level or more widely, and allows the necessary remedial actions to be identified and taken.  In light of the controversy over the CervicalCheck audit process, we must ensure that healthcare professionals are not discouraged from taking part in clinical audit.  Fostering an open culture which supports clinicians and encourages learning must be part of our ethos.<\/p><p> I should also say a few words on accountability.  To me, accountability is the obligation for an organisation or individual to account for its, his or her activities, accept responsibility for them, and disclose the results in a transparent manner.  As interim director general, it might also be useful to outline how I see myself discharging my duties against the obligation to be accountable to the Minister and more generally.  As part of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013, which established the directorate as the governing body of the HSE, the directorate is accountable to the Minister for the performance of its functions and those of the HSE.  As the interim director general, I account to the Minister on behalf of the directorate through the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  It is important that we, therefore, foster a culture of openness, transparency and both personal and organisational accountability in doing so.<\/p><p> The process and procedures for how the CervicalCheck programme intended to communicate the results of the audit to patients was developed at that time with the best of intentions, with a view to ensuring that women would receive the results of the audit, consistent with policy and best practice as set out in the 2015 open disclosure national policy, and informed by wider best practice for the disclosure of cancer screening audit results.  The failure here, which was a collective failure, was on ensuring effective follow through on these good intentions.  While the results of the audit were communicated to the relevant clinicians, the arrangements thereafter broke down.  The outcome was that a large proportion of women were not told about either the audit itself or the results for them as individuals.  The impact of this failure has been profound for every woman affected and for their families.  It has also undoubtedly caused significant levels of fear and anxiety for the wider population of women living in Ireland and it has, sadly, undermined public confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.<\/p><p> I will conclude with four pledges.  We will move swiftly and with compassion to provide effective support packages to the women and families who require support.  As outlined by the Secretary General, we will do this with the minimum of fuss and bureaucracy and with empathy.  We will fully, openly and transparently co-operate with the Scally inquiry and any subsequent inquiries.  If there is a requirement to hold individuals to account on a personal basis, we will do so.  In this respect, the Scally inquiry and subsequent inquiries will be important for the independence of their views and to allow due process and fair procedures to be followed.  We will learn lessons from recent weeks, not least the ability to say sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Connaghan.

Those who are not members of the committee will be allocated five minutes to ask questions and have them answered.  With this in mind, I will begin.<\/p> <p>  I have number of questions which I would like Mr. Connaghan to answer.  Why was the information on the false negatives identified in the audit not brought to the attention of the secretary general of the HSE and the Minister for Health at the time, in regard to open disclosure?  Why was it not escalated up the line?  Where is the information regarding the number of false negatives identified from the various laboratories?  We requested last week that we would get information on the quality of the reporting of each laboratory, but we still have not received that information.  Why was open disclosure posing such a great difficulty in 2016 when it was already HSE policy in 2013?  What was the issue that inhibited open disclosure?<\/p> <p>  I believe it was the responsibility of the CervicalCheck programme to make information available to patients.  I do not think it was the responsibility of the treating clinicians.  I would like Mr. Connaghan's comments on this because it was the CervicalCheck programme that took the smears, and I believe they were the appropriate people to contact patients and pass the information down the line.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the documents we received yesterday, in document No. 5 there is a table of cervical cancer cases notified to the National Cancer Registry in Ireland and another table of the cancers identified by CervicalCheck.  Up to 2013, some 1,853 cancers were notified to the cancer registry yet the CervicalCheck screening programme had only 808.  Did that not trigger alarm bells, that there was a growing disparity between the figures?  Perhaps Mr. Connaghan will comment on this.<\/p> <p>  Was there any withholding of information over the period up to now, from women who specifically asked for information on their previous smears but were denied access to that information?  Are there any issues in relation to cytology, other than the false negatives, that have led to delayed diagnosis and delayed treatment in the CervicalCheck programme, in other words, in the process of recall, getting appointments and access to colposcopy?  Why is the proposed introduction of HPV testing of smears being delayed until November of this year?  Surely that test could be introduced sooner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#J00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I will call on some of my colleagues because the Chairman has raised issues that precede my time in Ireland and my time as interim director general, and which are probably best answered by them.<\/p><p>I call on Dr. Peter McKenna to make some comments on the false negatives, the quality of reporting in laboratories and the questions raised about cytology and HPV.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>The false negatives will come out when we look at the 209 cases to see which laboratories were responsible.

I would explain that it happened in so many instances, that it was unusual and again that I was very sorry.  What would happen in that hypothetical example would be current and the error I would be disclosing was mine.  The question of an audit is quite different.

There is literally no reference to telling the woman anything.  For the avoidance of doubt, if anyone is unsure about what it is people are angry about, it is that impression that has been given that information was deliberately withheld.  We can get into a conversation about whether that information was material to a woman's health and well-being, but it was information that certainly could and should have been shared, and by my reading of it, any policy of open disclosure should have encouraged that information to be shared with the woman herself.  Dr. Holohan is signing off on these letters.  They explicitly exclude telling women.  They simply say \"ensure that the correspondence is added to [her] medical records\" and, \"If open disclosure is indicated [very much optional here] please follow the local hospital guidelines\", unless of course she has passed away, in which case just stick a note on her file.  That is the sort of stuff that makes people very angry.  Dr. Holohan might advise us on those letters and when he signed off on them.  It does not look like open disclosure to me, but perhaps he has an alternative view.<\/p> <p>  Around the same time as these letters were circulating, Dr. Holohan sent an email to Ms Conroy on the memo.  In it he said they should have a chat about this.  Does Dr. Holohan have any recollection of that?  Was it a formal meeting?  What would they have been discussing at that time?  It strikes me that Dr. Holohan has come here to talk to us, in hindsight, about all he knows, but the truth is that he and his colleagues knew more than the women themselves.  That information was available to him and his colleagues.  It is not fair for people who would have had sight of these memos from February 2016 to pretend they are surprised at the revelations now.

It is shocking to me that that sort of information would not have been escalated to the level of a Minister.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure I am satisfied with the explanation Dr. Holohan gave because it is clear when these memos are read through that the women are hardly mentioned at all but the media features.  Dr. Holohan and his colleagues were getting themselves ready for some class of a media storm.  He would have seen the Minister in the D&aacute;il two weeks ago.  The Minister was not pleased at being handed information just as he walked in the door, and I do not think anybody would be in those circumstances.  This information was known to Dr. Holohan in February 2016 because he would have had sight of those memos, so it is not fair of him to pretend it is coming as a surprise to him now.  On the process of escalation, it defies belief that it would not have been escalated to the level of a Minister, but maybe Dr. Holohan can explain his involvement in those template letters, because clearly they were sent to him for his own information.

It is a prerequisite to being able to record incidents.  What we need to be able to move to then, as we strengthen our implementation around open disclosure, is that system capturing the fact of open disclosure when adverse events have occurred.

When this was first brought to my attention in February 2016, all of those briefings detailed that there was an accumulation of case reviews that had been completed.  A decision was made the previous year to ensure that this information was given to women.  A process was put in place to figure out the best way to do that.  As Dr. McKenna mentioned and in relation to the Chair's question on who the best person to give this information was, they considered all those things.  They looked at the open disclosure policy and the guidance for the disclosure of audit findings for cancer screening programmes to come up with a process that would support this.  I have got emails from the screening programme stating that the programme has information on women's screening history that may be of benefit to her and we believe it should be disclosed.<\/p> <p>  The issue that they brought to my attention in February and March was the fact that they felt that some of the laboratories had queries once they found out that they were issuing letters to treating consultants so that the information could be given to patients.  They were concerned, they escalated it to me and I supported them to resolve it so that those letters could continue to be given.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly's questions on the interpretation in relation to the letters are very fair.  The questions on whether the open disclosure policy was appropriate at the time are very fair, especially in hindsight, but they were looking at what the policies were in other jurisdictions on this type of disclosure in these circumstances.  Their intent was that the information would go out.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Deputy O'Reilly's specific question on the letters, it is fair to say that these are templates.  What that means is that every letter is individualised to the case, so when it says \"if open disclosure is required\" that is also a template letter for women who are getting the results of audit findings where there is no discordance between the cytology.  Open disclosure would be required if there is a discordance.  It is true that within the provisions here they have left space for clinical judgment.  That needs to be reviewed and we need to look at it.  In speaking to Professor Flannelly who was running the programme at that time and meeting individual women, and it can be seen in the first memo that she meets women, talks to people who are getting these results, and she is talking to consultants and so forth, my understanding was that there would be circumstances where it would not be advisable to tell a lady something like that, for example, if the person was close to passing away.<\/p><p>That absolutely has to be looked at, in terms of what kind of guidance can be given to clinicians in the context of wanting to be fully open and disclose this information, and some of the challenges there might be from a clinical perspective.  It has to be reviewed in hindsight, but it is really important to say that those carrying out the programme, at all times, wanted the information to get into the hands of these women, and expected that it would.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#N01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>It is funny, because the information did not get into their hands.

I can provide that by copy to the committee.  There were a number of other mini-competitions within that framework.  The framework agreement provided for a number of laboratories, and the mini-competition was effectively a mini-competition within that for the supply of laboratories.  For some number of years now, Quest Diagnostics and MedLab Pathology have been the two laboratories involved, with 10% of the testing undertaken by the Coombe hospital.<\/p> <p>  In terms of quality assurance - and the Deputy will appreciate that I have only looked at this in the last number of days - there is a quality assurance process around the laboratories which covers a range of areas, including the facilities, the staff qualifications, the specimens regime and data entry, among other things.  I will not list everything out, but we can supply that information to the committee.  It involves regular meetings with the laboratories.  There is also a quality assurance group within the programme that looks at that area, including international expertise to support it from outside the Republic of Ireland.

When people were briefed, they would have been briefed in the context of knowing that these type of things happen in screening programmes.  They work at a population level but, unfortunately, they do not work for every single individual.  Patrick Lynch would have been involved in supporting a constructive, positive process at the time.

In the briefing note the Deputy has, from October 2016, it is made very clear that the process we were engaged in over the period had concluded and that the historical letters had been sent to consulting clinicians.  It is very clear within the memo that the programme was engaging colposcopists with treating clinicians to support the process of open disclosure and that they would be issuing letters at a pace of approximately four to six every month as they started to conclude reviews that were coming in.  At that point, they were also hearing about cases that were coming through, which was always the intent.  In carrying out this audit process and in sharing this information with women, the reason they were flagging the media piece was because we always knew that, once women had information, they would have absolutely every right to seek legal advice and legal address if they so chose.

The information all arrived in to him on the one day and he was asked to inform the patients.  I want the delegates to clarify whether the clinicians at the front line in the 15 centres around the country were aware of the clinical audit before it started.  Why were they not involved in the process and kept up to date as it developed?

The updates we had from the HSE were updates that gave us assurance that the process was taking place over a number of months and that the HSE was problem-solving when issues arose to get through them.  It completed that process around late summer or so in 2016.  I am aware that a clinical audit of that nature is not a common thing in screening programmes internationally.  That is a positive development.  I knew that open disclosure arrangements in respect of those findings would be even less common.  These are features that would have added to the value and the standing of our screening programme in international terms and we saw them as good developments.  There was nothing in that in a broad sense of risk, problem or concern being escalated to us as part of all of that which would be the subject of disclosure.  That was the information we had at the time.  Clearly there were gaps in the system.<\/p> <p>  It is very clear to see in retrospect that if the arrangement had been in place to have absolute clarity tied down before the commencement of feeding back of those findings with regard to whose job it was, what precisely was going to be fed back by way of a clear open disclosure policy for the service and a clear feedback loop to tell the centre, in this case the screening programme, then this might not have happened.  There is clear learning in respect of all of those things.  Without getting ahead of where Dr. Scally will take us in terms of findings, at a minimum we can see these are developments that will enhance the screening programmes.  The patient safety Bill, which the Minister brought to Cabinet last week, will give the Minister powers to essentially set guidelines for clinical audit that would ensure that when clinical audits are started - of this nature or elsewhere - that in advance of commencement those guidelines would be crystal clear on the question of responsibility for feedback to patients and on the question of feedback to the centre so there is verification the open disclosure has happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#V00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I accept Dr. Holohan's word on what he is saying but if I had been Minister for Health at the time I would have been very disappointed and I would be wondering about the whole system.

I will not tell the Deputy it is a perfect system.  I will and would like to say it is a system that is getting better and better.  For example, we have a patient safety protocol that has been in development and improvement between us and the HSE which captures the kind of information we really need to have when patient safety incidents arise so we are able to discriminate between those circumstances that we really need to be concerned about and where, as the Secretary General said earlier, we need to step in.

I would like to restore confidence in the cervical smear process and our ability to furnish the committee and to get the right people in front of it that it wants to see.  Those are my immediate priorities.  In terms of mid-term priorities, implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report will figure quite highly.  I can see many benefits in it.  I come from a system which has geo-aligned health authorities with funding provided on a weighted capitation basis and devolved authority to a lower level.  I think that is good because with devolved authority comes more power but also more responsibility.  That is good and we should do it.<\/p> <p>  I have a particular interest in encouraging the growth of clinical directorates at local level, both in hospitals and community healthcare organisations.  That is where decision making and power are moved nearer to the front line by investing clinicians with a degree of budget responsibility.  I am a particular fan of it and have operated it very successfully in other jurisdictions.  <\/p> <p>  Another objective of mine is to ensure the values we must observe in terms of the principles of public life - transparency, openness and personal and organisational accountability - are also quite up on my agenda.  Last but not least, one of the interests I had in applying for the job of deputy director general of operations was related to trying to improve the performance of the health system in Ireland, from elective, emergency and scheduled care points of view and to transform what we were doing in changing the model of care to a better one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#W01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I wish Mr. Connaghan the best of luck in performing his role.  Many members of the committee were members of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  When we hear Mr. Connaghan talk about geo-alignment and clinicians in directorship roles, many of us get very excited about that prospect.  In particular, Deputy Bernard J. Durkan is very excited about geo-alignment.  I genuinely wish Mr. Connaghan the best of luck in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Professor Scally's letter that was put into the public domain yesterday.  As a member of the committee, the people concerned have been before us since after 10 a.m.  Obviously, there is value in the conversation.  In no way am I trying to shut down any conversation about the CervicalCheck scandal, or whatever we want to call it, but, as indicated by Mr. Breslin in his exchange with Deputy Alan Kelly, there are only 24 hours in the day.  He was answering calls late last Thursday night.  When we are questioning whether people are on holidays and so on, the committee might take on a responsibility to perhaps pause for a moment and let people in the Department and the HSE work with Professor Scally who is very well qualified.  I have heard nobody criticise him in his role or his level of competence.  It is not as if we have been told that this issue will be referred to in 2020.  We have been told it will be referred back by the end of June.  I understand the preliminary report is due to be presented in a couple of weeks.  While I understand the value for the public and committee members in extracting information, I wonder about the material impact of such sessions in the overall investigation.  I also think that discussing the issue in this forum at this time may be contributing to a lack of confidence in the smear programme which, as we all know from the evidence, has actually saved lives since its introduction.  This is my own view.  Perhaps we might discuss it when all of the contributions to the committee have concluded.  I support what Professor Scally said in his letter.  Perhaps we might pause and reflect on the issue until the interim report comes out.  <\/p> <p>  I want to focus on auditing.  My understanding is a fundamental principle of auditing involves what one does with the information when one receives it.  Mr. Connaghan will be very familiar with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence from his time in the United Kingdom.  It is also used as the standard for many of us in our practice.  At the heart of clinical audit is clinical governance.  It involves reviewing notes and, fundamentally, seeking ways to serve the patient better.  That is what appears to have been lost.<\/p><p>I am asking about the person who was responsible for designing the audit process.  Dr. O'Keeffe referred to the process that was set up.  It seems very strange that when the audit process started, what would be done with the information when it was received was not considered.  How did that happen in the clinical audit process?  Who is responsible for not designing the process correctly?  Perhaps whoever answers the question will state whether a similar non-ideal audit process is happening in, perhaps, BreastCheck and BowelScreen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#W01400","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I will start with a couple of remarks on the purpose of clinical audit and will then turn to colleagues who might be able to best tackle some of the detail.  Clinical audit is the systematic review and evaluation of current practice against research-based standards with a view to improving clinical care for service users.  That is the objective.  Colleagues might correct me on this but one of the primary objectives in conducting the audit on cervical cytology was to feed back into the training of those who were interpreting those results, as well as furnishing the women concerned with the results of those audits.  There is a dual purpose, based on my understanding.

It was established in 2008 and 2010, it was decided that it would be audited.  I understand that the programme was governed through an independent statutory agency at the outset and then, during the period of austerity, was merged into the HSE, into the national cancer control programme.  In 2010, it started the audit.  When the open disclosure guidelines were initially published, the service reflected on the information that it had and decided that this information would be of benefit for patients.  It is of benefit for patients anyway because those involved in the service are trying to improve all elements of the care pathway, from the letters that they issue if there is no one at the address or to general practitioners, GPs.  There are many parts of the cervical screening process that could fail.  The audit looks at all of those processes.  It is of huge benefit to patients in identifying any problems.  It is important to note that with this particular audit, the cervical screening service has stated that there are no systemic issues of note and that the programme is working well.  The open disclosure element, with regard to making a decision that the information on individual patients' reviews is of benefit to patients, was the right decision to make in 2010.  It will be interesting to finally hear Dr. Scally's findings on this with regard to the journey.  It has clearly been a process that has been evolving.  Whether those decision-making points many years ago were the right decisions, that is, to continue with the process approach rather than making finite decisions that we would stop all the cases that we reviewed up to that point and only do open disclosure prospectively, the service committed to ensuring, in the decision that it made, that the information it had would benefit all patients who had been diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer and had a history of screening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":486,"content":"<p>My question is whether the process was flawed from the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#X00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":487,"content":"<p>One could say that it was.

On such a committee, one would have had, as well as colleagues and service users, an ethicist.  A core principle for successful work is that one does not impose a duty on somebody who is not represented in one's protocol.

The first clinical audit that was endorsed through that mechanism was the trauma audit last year, which directly informed the trauma strategy that was approved by Government as a consequence.

All of those documents are there.  It is the case, however, that if there were issues or concerns arising within CervicalCheck, and I say \"if\" because the only person who can really give us that answer fully is not here today, because the person who engaged with those consulting clinicians in the main was Professor Flannelly herself, then either she felt it was being dealt with or it was not escalated as an issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#Y00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":517,"content":"<p>To set the context, I would like to comment briefly about the response to the whole tragic controversy.  While I understand the pressures that are on the system since the controversy broke, I would like to highlight one particular case that really brings home the anguish and worry of women across the country, and that is the case of Jacinta Doyle.  She is a Wexford woman and mother of two who had a smear in 2011 which did not flag any issues but, in 2012, when she presented to her doctor with chronic back pain, she was referred for a scan - which she had to pay for privately, incidentally - and that is when her diagnosis was made.  My concern is the ongoing firefighting approach we have seen since the controversy broke.  This lady spent 12 days trying to get answers as to where she goes next.  She initially called the helpline on 28 April but got no response.  She then called on 3 May but got no response.  She then contacted CervicalCheck via a Facebook post on 7 May.  It was only on 10 May that she was told her original smear was tested in the US and that this lab was no longer used.<\/p><p>That constant drip-feed of these stories we hear in the media is not reassuring to the women of Ireland.  Furthermore, from a general practice point of view, it is only really in the past few days that we have got any clear direction in order to provide the free smear programme, which GPs are more than happy to do.  While it is clear that, for patients with medical cards, we can use an STC, or special-type claim, and put the medical card number on it, for private patients I understand we are instructed to use the patient's PPS number.  Can the witnesses clarify if there is a breach of data protection, as I understand there may be some issue in this regard?<\/p><p>Second, Dr. Holohan stated in his submission:<\/p><blockquote>It has become clear since the case that the non-disclosure of clinical audit findings was widespread.  It has also become clear that the issue of disclosure was the subject of dispute among some elements of the relevant clinical community.  I can provide assurance that the Department was not aware of these issues until this controversy arose...<\/blockquote> <p>It is very difficult for people watching this today to understand or believe how this could be the case.  I would like an answer as to how the Department was not aware of this until the controversy broke.  Really and truly, the women of Ireland need reassurance about this.

In terms of the response, I acknowledge the scale of what has happened and of trying to put a cohesive response in place.  The screening programme is a relatively small service.  CervicalCheck has just over 30 staff, which includes managing and running the service day to day.  The helpline was effectively inundated in those first number of days with a very low response rate.  To date, there have been over 17,800 calls as of our report last night.  A total of 14,290 of those have been responded to.  This still leaves a very significant number.  As I think I explained at one committee meeting last week, I do not want to go over old ground but in simple terms, we set up four call centres to try to deal with this.  One is in Cork, which takes the initial calls.  Typically, it is able to handle 25% to 30% of the calls at the first point of contact from the women who are concerned.  All of the others are requesting callback from a clinician.  That is one of the key issues for us at the moment in terms of making enough clinical staff available to deal with the responses.  We triage those calls into a number of categories.  One is where a woman has a normal smear history so the call is taken to Limerick where the centre is based and they go on to the system to pull down the information for that woman so it is not actually just a phone call and a conversation.  It involves looking at their full clinical history so that we can then determine who is best placed to talk to that woman about the concerns she expressed.  If the woman has a normal smear history, our call centre in Waterford or public health take that call.  If there is an abnormal smear history, there are two centres in Dublin and Limerick, which we try to resource to take those calls.  The final category are people who have had a cancer history or colposcopy.  We have put a model in place for the hospitals where the women contact them directly.  It is fair to say that there is significant stress and strain in that model.  Obviously, we had to put it in very quickly.  We brought in some expertise around call centre management but it is after the act.  One would certainly not be doing this in the normal course of events.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the case mentioned by the Senator-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>This lady had a history of cervical cancer and she still had to have three contacts with the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#Z00500","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

We are taking them chronologically so that people are waiting for the shortest period of time possible but in terms of clinical resources, we are pulling the resources from the hospitals.  That is where the clinical staff are based.  The screening service itself has a very small pool of clinical staff who can answer those questions.  The cancer screening programme is also supporting it.  We are looking from all the agencies - those that are contracted and those that are not.  We have looked at cross-Border options.  We have tried to ensure that no stone is left unturned to maximise that.  We have made some progress but I accept that it is still an extensive delay for some people in getting through.  Our priority is to look at those women who have had a history first.  These women are being prioritised with the hospitals, which are working through those cases this week.

All of this stuff makes really interesting reading in the documentation provided so far.  The reason for this is that one can see a clear escalation in terms of the number of cases and what people were thinking along the way.  If we go to the March 2016 briefing note, we see the logging of cases.  Work is under way by the State Claims Agency to extend the architecture of the national incident management system to facilitate logging of incident cases for screening programmes.

There was a process CervicalCheck had started to instigate.  A laboratory suggesting CervicalCheck should not be sending letters to treating clinicians threatened the process.  In that context, I received a presentation the day before the first meeting, which for the record was in February.  I received a presentation from Professor Flannelly on the audit.  Although there are many other meetings I do not particularly remember, I remember a lot about the particular meeting because it was new information.  I remember initially feeling a sense of concern about the audit as to whether it was throwing up any factor or issue with the integrity of the screening programme.  I satisfied myself that it was not and was happy with that.  We addressed the issue with the laboratory and it was going to continue to engage, although that became a little more problematic in March, as can be seen from the briefings.<\/p> <p>  I also genuinely remember Professor Flannelly talking about the case from the perspective of what we should do as part of it.  CervicalCheck was certainly conscious to alert me to the fact that it was engaging in this and that it intended for patients to receive their information  I actually remember Professor Flannelly telling me that CervicalCheck would be providing the lady with all of the information on advice received from its solicitor.  I remember saying at the time that there was no need to wait for the solicitor and that the person could be given the information.  However, CervicalCheck was very conscious that, because it was engaging in the process with the intent that women would receive the information and knew that it clearly would result in cases, it wanted to ensure it could protect the totality of the programme.  It knew that cases would come up in carrying out the audit.  <\/p> <p>  From my perspective as a national director, it was very important to ensure there was nothing else within the findings of the audit that was troubling or concerning and that we had a safe programme.  We do have a very safe programme.  What is being found through the audit is within all of the normal parameters.  While I absolutely accept the criticism that the briefings are very process oriented and not personal, the conversations are personal.  There was a personal conversation about the difficulties in having that conversation.  However, as can be seen in the February briefing, there was a statement to the effect that this is what CervicalCheck did and that Professor Flannelly would meet patients, which she went on to do.  That is what happened at the first briefing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#DD00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Keeffe for answering the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#DD00700","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1526457600,"counter":696,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked me about Mr. Patrick Lynch and Mr. Liam Woods.

The advice I gave reflected on a review and examination of the international evidence which showed that, although it was almost counterintuitive, it was the case that mandatory open disclosure in all circumstances carried with it risks in the sense that it, first, sometimes conferred a view among medical practitioners that the risk of medical legal actions was increased, which could make them less likely and less willing to make such disclosures.  If it is applied as written in all situations, as opposed to being targeted at the most serious cases, as we plan to do, it will unnecessarily bureaucratise the reporting and potentially lead to mandatory disclosure.<\/p> <p>  The reality is culture is what is important as opposed to law.  The law may say something, but, frankly, doctors do not tend to look to it for guidance in conducting clinical practice.  Something in the law might lead to more box ticking style reporting.  We want to encourage the safe space and support the culture of open disclosure in its development by ensuring that when something goes wrong which is the reality and a feature of everyday clinical practice because the sciences, people and technologies are not perfect, the first thing that is done is that, rather than withdrawing from patients, as we have seen happen in some patient safety instances, doctors, nurses and other senior staff will metaphorically put their arms around the patients and support them through understanding.  That is a relationship that is built over time; it is not a single event.  Putting something in legislation on its own will not deliver that culture.  <\/p> <p>  The view is that the combination of mandatory reporting, where appropriate, and voluntary support by giving doctors assurance that protection will be available in wider circumstances if they come forward and do the right thing in the so-called safe space will lead to and support more a culture of open disclosure.  We will have standards for how that open disclosure should be done, recorded and so on.  The science on it, so to speak, is not absolute.  These are judgments.  There is not a huge body of international evidence in that regard, but it tends to point in that direction.  There are other areas of social science and so on where these questions also play out.  The extent of mandatory reporting can sometimes actually drive down reporting, increase fear on the part of those reporting and so on.  <\/p> <p>  That was the reason for the advice which the Oireachtas committee reflected in its report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018051600002#DD01800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1526457600,"counter":707,"content":"<p>Is it possible to see the advice provided in 2015?

Some 10,666 women had requested callbacks from a clinician as of yesterday.  The number of women who have yet to receive one is now 3,562.  As to when this will be closed out, I note that at the moment there has not been a significant drop in call volume.  Effectively we have to plan on the basis of two things.  One is that we will have to plan to continue with this for a certain period, until people have a certain level of satisfaction.  Then the call volume may drop.  Second, I note that the CervicalCheck helpline was always there, but it had a different purpose.  It was intended to facilitate and advise.  My view is that in light of this we will have to strengthen it beyond the current week so that it provides greater assurance to women.  Moreover, the people manning the line will have to be clinical staff.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question about how long it will take, I think that will be contingent on the duration of the issue.  If people call us then we have an obligation to get back to them, and we will continue to do that.  That is challenging.  I described it earlier.  We need clinical staff, whom we are trying to pull out of services and hospitals.  Those women who have more complex needs, in the sense that they have a history of colposcopy or cancer, need to talk to an oncology or a gynaecology nurse as well as medical support.  We will have to monitor that week by week.  I cannot give a date by which we will have dealt with all the queries, because the situation is changing each day.  As I say, while there have been some dips in the number of outstanding queries, it has typically come back up again.<\/p> <p>  In the long term, I have mentioned that I do believe we will need to strengthen the helpline to provide support to people over the next six, nine or 12 months as we hopefully turn the corner, give women assurance on the screening service and deal with the many questions, some of which have been captured over the last week or two.

One is the communication with women themselves through the programme, the direct communication.  The other perspective concerns getting greater reassurance into the system.  We all talk to people who have different views - friends, relatives etc. - and as the Senator says, there is misinformation out there.  Hopefully over the coming weeks we will put a plan in place to try to create some reassurance.  That has been difficult, to be frank.  Although the issue has attracted huge attention, as in the situation the Senator describes, it is difficult to get simple messages across to people who are clearly and understandably very anxious, concerned and unsure of exactly what all this means for them.  We are seeing that in our hospitals.  Apart from the phone line that I mentioned earlier, they are getting a huge number of calls straight to their colposcopy units.  These are placing huge strains on the service.  It is our intention to bring together a small group of patients, general practitioners and key people to look at how we can navigate through this, and hopefully provide some reassurance and greater clarity for women.<\/p><p>To be blunt, the difficulty in the last six or seven days has been that with so much happening it is very difficult to translate that through.

It is hard to have the public health and public interest message communicate itself in a situation where we are also doing the historical record and the scrutiny and accountability.  Both are absolutely legitimate and I wonder, and it might not involve the players here at all, if there is any way we could give some collective thought to a more concentrated public health and public interest discussion on explanation and trying to put that out.

We will need to look again at the open disclosure policy and update it in the light of the lessons that have emerged from this and develop open disclosure policy specific to the screening programmes.

I will keep my comments short.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend the existing entitlement to unpaid leave from 18 weeks to 26 weeks.  We, in this country, are in a situation where our parental leave entitlements are among the lowest in Europe.  In total, there is an entitlement to about 60 weeks.  The average in Europe is almost 100 weeks.  This is not any kind of substitute for paid parental leave.  Obviously the Social Democrats and all of us want to see entitlement to paid parental leave being extended as soon as possible.  That, in the main, relates to the very early years in a child's life and I strongly support the proposal that all families should be facilitated in looking after their children for at least the first year of life at home, through paid parental leave.<\/p> <p>  Unpaid parental leave is a different matter.  It can be used in those early years but it principally gives flexibility to parents to balance their work obligations and their parental obligations.  It provides that kind of flexibility where they may go on a four-day week for a period, take time off during summer holidays from schools and that kind of thing.  It is an extremely popular measure.  In the main, it does not cost an awful lot.  There are some small recruitment costs for replacement staff but it does not cost a significant amount of money and, from the parents' point of view, it is a very popular move because it provides the flexibility that parents need to balance their work, life and family responsibilities.  It can be seen as a measure which supports women to remain in the workforce because it provides an element of flexibility.<\/p> <p>  Since this Bill moved through Second Stage, I have had a huge amount of correspondence from parents who strongly welcome it and keep asking, on a regular basis, when the law is going to change because it is such a popular option for people.  We also know that, in many cases, it can make sense from a financial point of view for a parent to take a certain amount of time out of the workforce.  When one considers the cost of participating in work and the extraordinarily high cost of childcare, sometimes it simply does not pay, financially.  The key thing that many women want to ensure is that they retain statutory rights relating to employment and that they can take leave at particular times, have that flexibility, and still maintain all of their employment and statutory rights.  I will leave it at that, with regard to the purpose of the Bill.  It is a family-friendly measure which is about facilitating work-life balance and it is also about retaining women in the workforce.  That is the motivation behind it and I look forward to the support of all members here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#A00700","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":895,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.

I am surprised and a bit disappointed, therefore, that we have had no opportunity to consult with the stakeholders who will be impacted in both positive and negative ways.  It is one of the issues with Private Members' Bills which I have raised time and time again in the House and elsewhere.  They would be greatly enriched if we had proper pre-legislative scrutiny even before Second Stage such as all Government Bills go through along with other checks and balances.  We are where we are, however.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that many households may be unable to avail of unpaid leave.  As such, it is important that our policies in this area are coherent in both domestic and EU contexts and move forward in a progressive manner and in sync with each other.  We are all in agreement that we must do our utmost to help and support parents.  I remind the committee that over the last three budgets, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has secured an unprecedented 80% increase in the budget for childcare, which reflects the Government's commitment to parents and children.  In 2018 alone, investment in childcare will be &euro;487 million.  This investment is being used to improve access to high-quality affordable childcare for approximately 170,000 children and their families.  As the committee will be aware, free preschool services provided under the early childhood care and education programme have been extended and improved and measures have been put in place to reduce the cost of childcare.<\/p> <p>  The Government believes the focus should now be on introducing parental leave on a paid basis.  A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to increase paid parental leave during the first year of a child's life as research shows that children benefit most from parental care in that first year.  An interdepartmental working group has been examining proposals to give effect to this programme commitment and is in the process of putting the final touches to its report.  We hope to have that shortly.<\/p> <p>  At EU level, a new work-life balance directive is under discussion at working group level under the Bulgarian Presidency.  The proposed directive recognises that the provision of paid parental leave will be more effective and appropriate in encouraging fathers to be more involved in the caring role for their children, thus contributing to the promotion of gender equality.  The directive is part of a package of EU measures aimed at addressing the under-representation of women in employment and supporting women's career progression by creating improved conditions whereby they can reconcile their work responsibilities and family commitments.<\/p> <p>  We must support families and promote gender equality at the same time by bringing about a degree of cultural change in considered steps.  Women's empowerment is a key theme running through our programme for partnership Government.  As such, there are multiple policy objectives in this case which means a nuanced and sophisticated approach is required.  When it comes to improving and expanding our current family leave system, there are wider and more complex factors which I have set out above which this Bill does not consider.  As such, I may bring forward amendments to a number of sections on Report Stage.  I will outline those as we move through the Bill.  We also have a national strategy on women and girls towards which we are working to improve equality.  Just this morning and yesterday, I attended an international conference on equal opportunities for men and boys.<\/p> <p>  A great deal is happening at Council of Europe, EU and Government level in this area.  As such, the Deputy is right to bring this forward.  However, there are issues.  We must bear in mind the impact any change in legislation has on stakeholders and the need to involve them in the process.  If the Government brought forward legislation like this without involving stakeholders in some kind of discussion, there would be ruaile buaile.  We are where we are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#D00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1526485500,"counter":904,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1526485500,"counter":905,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":906,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:&quot;(b) in subsection (2)(a) by substituting &quot;attains the age of 12 years&rdquo; for &ldquo;attains the age of 8 years&quot;,<br \/><br \/>(c) in subsection (2)(b)(ii) by substituting &quot;attained the age of 10 years but not 12 years&quot; for &quot;attained the age of 6 years but not 8 years&quot;,&quot;.<\/blockquote> <p>The purpose of this amendment is to reflect recent developments at EU level since we published the Bill.

The Government will not oppose the amendment and in fact supports it.<\/p><p> I mentioned earlier that the Government intends to bring amendments forward on Report Stage, and this is one that we had prepared.  We are in sync with the Deputy on that one.  <\/p><p> As every member of the committee will accept, families are best placed to determine what works for them and what supports they need.  I am sure that every member of the committee and the Houses will agree that as legislators and policymakers we have to listen to the needs of families, take on board their concerns and then figure out how we can best ensure that the necessary supports are in place.  In this context, the Government and my Department have received a number of representations from families asking for parental leave to be available in respect of children up to the age of 12.  Second, this is one of the foremost issues addressed in parliamentary questions on parental leave, so colleagues on all sides of the House have been tabling this.  <\/p><p> Increasing the qualifying age from eight to 12 is one of those issues where families know what they need.  It provides families with greater flexibility to determine what is best for them and what works for them.  Indeed, this is the type of measure that is easy to support.  Second, the Deputy's amendment and the Government's intended amendment would resolve another issue concerning the age of children and parental leave.  As we are all aware, section 6 of the Parental Leave Act 1998 provides for 18 weeks of unpaid parental leave in respect of a child up to the age of eight years, or 16 years in the case of a child with a serious illness or disability.<\/p><p> The age provided for in the Act is a statutory minimum.  It is at the discretion of individual employers whether they wish to extend the eligibility criteria for their employers to avail of parental leave beyond that minimum.  At present, the majority of companies in the private sector only permit parental leave to be taken up to the statutory requirement of eight years, whereas in the public sector it can be taken in respect of children up to the age of 13.  Therefore, the secondary effect of this amendment would be to produce an approximate parity between the two sectors.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#D00600","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":909,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

This approach would allow employers sufficient time to implement any necessary measures to reduce the impact on their businesses, and to make sure that they have the necessary structures in place to facilitate the taking of leave.<\/p> <p>  Second, as the committee is aware, negotiations on a draft work-life balance directive are currently under way at EU level.  The Government wishes to highlight the need to ensure that whatever changes are made to domestic legislation will dovetail with the provisions and timeframe for transposing the directive.  <\/p> <p>  Section 2(b) of the Bill amends section 6(8) of the Act to ensure that a relevant parent should be allowed to benefit from the extended parental leave if they have already used their current allowance of 18 weeks.  Parents who have not used their entire entitlement will be allowed to claim the balance of their unused parental leave and the further eight weeks introduced in the Bill.  The Government supports this approach as all eligible parents should be eligible to claim their full entitlement to parental leave when extended.  However, the Government may bring the amendment forward on Report Stage to modify the wording in this regard.  The substance will remain as it is.<\/p> <p>  Section 2(c) of the Bill is a straightforward amendment to section 6(9) of the Parental Leave Act 1998, updating the reference to the Parental Leave (Amendment) Act 2006 with a reference to the Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#E00700","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":916,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

This is a crucial consideration as far as I am concerned.  There is a time factor in that businesses need to gear up for any type of change.  There is also an impact.  Before being elected to the House I had 20 years of being in business and there is no such thing as something that is free and has no real cost.  Everything has an impact on businesses, particularly businesses that run on very tight margins, which is the case for a lot of the small employers in Ireland, who have one or two employees.<\/p> <p>  In the absence of a consultation process for those people or their representative groups, it is vital that we take time on this to ensure we get the balance right between the aims of the Bill, of which I am very supportive in general and which are to facilitate work-life balance and increasing leave overall, and the impact it will have, particularly on small businesses.  Big multinational corporations can handle things like this in their sleep.  It is when we get down to somebody running the local shop, running the local hairdressers, somebody in a village running the pub or somebody running a small manufacturing business that we need to recognise there are two things we need to consider, which are the work-life balance of people working and the impact on the industry and business in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#F02300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":968,"content":"<p>I note what the members are saying and what the Minister of State has said, but this will not come in overnight.

I said earlier that we have an interdepartmental working group that is due to report.  I am concerned that we did not have any formal consultation on this Bill with stakeholders.  In all fairness, if someone is impacted in any way, as Deputy Brophy said, particularly small businesses, they should have an opportunity to have their say.  Usually, if it is a Government Bill, we would have a public symposium where people would come along, have their say and have an impact.  That was not possible here and did not happen.

I wish to raise another issue at the end when we discuss the summing up.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#F02500","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":971,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's concerns in that regard are noted but the committee did make its own judgment call, which is its prerogative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#G00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":972,"content":"<p>I know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#G00300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":973,"content":"<p>I note that the Minister of State mentioned the potential ramifications and negative feedback.

We are talking about the first year of a child's life.  We are talking about going way beyond this and bringing in paid leave.  As I said, there are implications for the EU work-life balance directive and there are other nuances.  These must be introduced properly after consultation where people, particularly small businesses, can be prepared for them and have an input.  There could be unforeseen consequences of which nobody has thought, which is why consultation is so important and why I am such a fan of listening to what people have to say on these kinds of matters.<\/p> <p>  In respect of section 4(3) regarding the three months after enactment, I note what Deputy Shortall said about it going to the Seanad and that Report Stage might be a number of weeks away and so forth.  Even at that, it may very well be okay but I will be bringing forward amendments to be sure in case something unforeseen arises so we are not locked in to three months after enactment.  That is all but we are very anxious to support parents in a very positive way by introducing paid parental leave.  Last year, we started off with two weeks paternity leave.  The uptake of that has been very gratifying.  A total of 67% of young fathers have taken that.  We want to encourage and increase that even more so we are taking the steps in the direction; the issue of paid leave is what will really encourage people because many families will not be able to afford to take unpaid leave but they can take paid leave.  That is where the Government is trying to go.  I ask members to keep that in mind as well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#G00600","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":976,"content":"<p>Given the Minister of State's response was to Deputy Chambers's question directly, did the Deputy indicate that he might like to come back?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#G00700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":977,"content":"<p>With respect, when I hear about consultation from the Department of Justice and Equality around gambling and other issues, I see it as a delaying tactic.

I agree that pre-legislative scrutiny is a good thing and a good practice that we have developed but that is where one is talking about a new measure.  This is not a new measure.  It is an existing measure that has been there for some time and is merely an extension of that.  I repeat that it is an eight-week extension that can be spread over several years up to 12 years.  It is not a major change and will not be a sudden change all in one go.  I do not believe there is any need for pre-legislative scrutiny of it.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State also made a point about paid versus unpaid leave.  I said at the outset that I absolutely support the commitment the Minister of State has given to introduce paid parental leave so that children can be cared for in their home by a parent in the first year.  That needs to happen as quickly as possible and I think we would all be supportive of that.  However, this is a different measure.  This is not talking specifically about the early years.  It is talking about flexibility that is available to parents over the child's lifetime for those first 12 years.  It is an entirely different matter and measure and serves quite a different purpose.  This is not an \"either-or\" situation; it is in addition to something that already exists.  I think we would absolutely support the Minister of State if he brought forward proposals for 12 months paid leave.  This cannot happen too soon.  <\/p> <p>  This needs to be viewed in the context of Ireland being among the worst in Europe when it comes to parental leave entitlements.  We have a huge amount of catching up to do.  Much of our legislation in this area has been dictated to us by Europe, which has had a positive influence, but we have not brought forward legislation ourselves.  We have tended to drag our heels in respect of parental entitlements.  Too often, the views of employers have outweighed the needs and views of parents in this regard.  It is time that we got on with it.  This is a small improvement in one of the aspects of parental leave and flexible work options and the sooner it happens, the better.  I think most parents would feel that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#G01200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":982,"content":"<p>I thought Deputy Shortall mentioned 12 months paid leave there.

I have great respect for Deputy Chambers but I disagree totally with the point he made.  There are a few aspects that are very important.  The first is that we should have consultation on any change.  The reason is very simple.  This country is littered with examples where we have passed legislation without properly thinking through the implications and have lived to regret it.  Deputy Chambers and the rest of this committee engaged in a process when we made a decision and through greater consultation, other parties have reversed that decision today on another Stage of the Bill.<\/p><p>People can argue for and against consultation and they can argue the merits of it one way or the other.  My view on it is simple.  If we have a change that is substantial, we should engage in consultation.  I believe the committee would be better off to have that as a guiding principle.  If we were making a change in another way and we excluded the notion of consultation with parents, people would be horrified at the idea.  There is no real loss in simply talking to everyone involved about a change such as this.  I am not arguing for a delay.  My understanding of this discussion is that everyone here is effectively supportive of this measure and wants to see it proceed.  Everyone is in agreement to try to make it work.  Indeed, the Government has an even more substantive proposal.  I do not believe there is anything greatly wrong in saying that a process of consultation would have benefited everyone involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#G01600","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":987,"content":"<p>That is noted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018051600002#H00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1526485500,"counter":988,"content":"<p>I argued for consultation but in a quick, efficient and effective manner.  I argued for the Department simply to go and do it.  My experience of other legislation is that those responsible talk about doing it and years go by.  My point was not to try to remove consultation.  If people want to do it, then they should do it and get on with it and give us the information and feedback.<\/p> <p>  It is not a political issue but rather a departmental issue across many Departments and it prevents legislation being progressed.  That affects the people we represent and the commitments we make.  I believe in consultation.  Reforms are promised.  One Minister of State has mentioned centralising the entire consultation process.  I know that is not what this Bill is about but there is a plan for a centralised consultation process that would move it away from Departments.  Perhaps it was the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, who mentioned it.  We need to do this more quickly than we have been doing it.  I have an interest in the gambling control Bill.  Every time I ask about it, consultation is the reason given for why we are delayed and we are six years down the line now.  The Department of Justice and Equality is not moving quickly enough on that front.  That is not a ministerial issue but a departmental issue.
