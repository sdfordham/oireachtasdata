Agreed.<\/p> <p>  We now move on to category C, correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.<\/p><p>Item No. 964C of 4 December 2017 relates to an incident in the Irish Prison Service in 1988.  The individual was dismissed from the service in 1989, the committee requested the Minister for Justice to respond to previous correspondence from this individual and when the reply from the Minister, reference 293C, was considered on 24 November 2017 it was agreed to send a reply to the individual.  The Minister in his correspondence encouraged the individual to make information that he had in regard to the murder of a prison officer available to the Garda.  The individual has been in touch again with the secretariat and today&rsquo;s item is additional information in relation to his general situation.  While we are sympathetic to the individual&rsquo;s case, we have sought and got a clear response from the Minister which we have passed on to the individual.  It is not within our remit to take the matter of an individual&rsquo;s dismissal from his employment further.  I propose that we write to the individual accordingly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Correspondence item No. 968C is from Ms Orla O'Connor, National Women's Council of Ireland, dated 5 December 2017 in response to a request from the committee for information regarding its public funding.  Ms O&rsquo;Connor states that the audited accounts, which are audited by independent auditors, are approved by the membership every year at the AGM.  The matter which an individual had raised with the committee was whether it was permissible for the National Women&rsquo;s Council to use public funds to fund a pro-choice campaign.  The correspondence from Ms O'Connor does not directly address that issue and I suggest we write to her for clarification.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Correspondence item No. 970C from Mr. Padraig Corkery, communications and public affairs manager, NAMA, dated 5 December 2017, regards further information requested by the committee in relation to a hotel in Kinsale, County Cork.  I propose to send this reply to the original correspondent and to advise the correspondent that the committee&rsquo;s consideration of the matter is closed.  Is that agreed? Agreed.<\/p><p> Correspondence item 978C(i) and (ii) is a copy of correspondence sent to Deputy Andrew Doyle, Minister of State, from an individual received on 8 December 2017 regarding public funding of the Irish Horse Welfare Trust.  The secretariat had previously written to the Department of Agriculture on this and will follow the matter up.  Can we note the correspondence?  Noted.<\/p><p> Correspondence item No. 979C is from councillors R&eacute;ada Cronin and Nicola Lawless, members of Kildare and Wicklow ETB, dated 24 November 2017 in relation to our meeting with Kildare and Wicklow ETB on 16 November 2017.

The economic impacts of the measures are both complex and long term.  Chapter 3 was compiled to provide an estimate, as at end-2016, of the net financial cost of the measures.  The chapter updates a previous report which gave the position as at the end of 2014.<\/p> <p>  The sums involved in recapitalising banks, including covering their losses, are relatively straightforward to identify.  Income accruing from the investments, and capital repayments or disposals of investments, are also generally clear.  Less easy to identify are the costs incurred by the State in funding the investments, which are substantial.  Estimation procedures are required to identify those funding costs, and in arriving at a valuation of the State's residual interest in banking assets. <\/p> <p>  The results of the examination analysis are summarised in figure 3.1 in the chapter.  The overall investment in the banks, including the value of shares accepted in lieu of dividends, totalled &euro;66.8 billion.  That resulted in additional State borrowing and the utilisation of State investment funds, at an estimated cost of &euro;14.8 billion up to the end of 2016.  Against that were receipts totalling just over &euro;25 billion from disposals of shares, income from the investments, fees for bank liability guarantees and related Central Bank surpluses. <\/p> <p>  By the end of 2016, the estimated net cost to the State of measures taken to stabilise the banking system was &euro;56.5 billion.  When the estimated value at that date of the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholdings in the banks and NAMA&rsquo;s projected surplus are taken into account, the estimated net outturn is a cost of around &euro;39.9 billion.<\/p> <p>  After taking account of the estimated residual value of the State&rsquo;s holdings in the financial institutions, the estimated net outturn, as at 31 December 2016, for each institution is as shown in figure 1.<\/p> <p>  We estimated that, up to 31 December 2016, support for the IBRC had cost the State a net &euro;35.8 billion, support for AIB had cost a net &euro;7.9 billion, support for Permanent TSB cost a net &euro;1 billion, and there was a net surplus of &euro;1.8 billion in respect of the State&rsquo;s support for Bank of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The projected &euro;3 billion in receipts arising from the winding up of NAMA offsets a part of those net losses but cannot be attributed across the rescued institutions.  I emphasise that all those estimates are at a point in time, and that the final cost of the measures will not be identifiable for some time to come.  In particular, the cost of servicing residual banking-related State debt will be an ongoing economic cost.  It is estimated that this cost will be around &euro;1.7 billion for 2017.  In the longer term, this cost is estimated at between &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.4 billion annually, if the State&rsquo;s average cost of borrowing is in the range 2.5% to 3.5% a year.  To put that in context, the NTMA&rsquo;s average cost of borrowing was around 3% at end June 2017.<\/p> <p>  Of course, other factors will also be at play in determining the final overall cost of the stabilisation measures.  These will include the amount the State ultimately realises from the disposal of its remaining bank investments, and the period for which the Central Bank continues to hold Government bonds related to redemption of the IBRC promissory notes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017121400002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Harkness"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513242000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Chairman and his committee for the opportunity to address them this morning.  With me this morning are Mr. Gary Tobin, Assistant Secretary General in the banking division in the Department of Finance, Mr. Scott Rankin, deputy head of the shareholding and financial advisory division, Mr. Gary Hynds, senior banking specialist in the shareholding and financial advisory division, Mr Eoin Dorgan, principal officer in the banking division, and Mr. David Tuohy, banking specialist in the shareholding and financial advisory division.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on chapter 3 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the accounts of the public service 2016.  Chapter 3 of this report deals with the cost of the banking stabilisation measures as at year end 2016.  From its invitation to the Department of Finance, I understand that the committee particularly wished to discuss the special liquidation of IBRC and specifically the costs incurred as part of the liquidation.  However, as per my letter to the committee dated 12 December 2017, having consulted with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, unfortunately we are not in a position to respond to queries concerning the costs associated with the special liquidation given that these matters are now the subject of dispute in the High Court awaiting determination.  This is as a result of the Department of Finance being served with a plenary summons on 8 December 2017 seeking declaratory reliefs against the Minister for Finance with regard to a number of matters pertaining to the terms and conditions of remuneration and expenses of the special liquidators and their oversight by the Department.  We have shared the plenary summons with the committee so it will appreciate its scope.  While the special liquidators were due to attend with us today, their legal advice is that it would not be appropriate for them to be present.  We have shared the correspondence between the Department and the special liquidators in this regard with the committee for full transparency.<\/p> <p>  We are very disappointed and frustrated that we are not able to discuss the costs of the liquidation as this is a topic in which we invest considerable efforts to ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money.  We warmly welcome the committee&rsquo;s interest in this topic as we recognise that the absolute quantum of fees are, on the face of it, large.  It was for this reason that in 2014 the first of four detailed reports were published to provide transparency on the work streams associated with the special liquidation and the associated costs of each of these work streams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017121400002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Carville"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513242000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Deputy Sean Fleming took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1513242000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>It is difficult to hear Mr. Carville.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017121400002#E00800","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513242000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I apologise; I have a chest infection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017121400002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Carville"},{"type":"speech","time":1513242000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

The gross cost of recapitalising the banking system during the period 2009-2011 stands at &euro;66.8 billion, which was funded through a combination of funding from the Exchequer and National Pension Reserve Fund.  Taking into account the cost of servicing the debt to end of 2016 of &euro;14.8 billion and the income earned on investments to the end of 2016 of &euro;25.1 billion, the net cost estimated by the Comptroller and Auditor General was &euro;56.5 billion as at the end of 2016.  When the estimated value at that date of the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholdings in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB - a combined &euro;13.6 billion - and NAMA&rsquo;s projected surplus of &euro;3 billion are taken into account, the estimated net outturn at the end of 2016 is a cost of around &euro;39.9 billion.  This shows a reduction of approximately &euro;3 billion since this analysis was last conducted at the end of 2014, which reflects additional receipts of &euro;5 billion and the recognition of the estimated &euro;3 billion surplus now expected when NAMA winds down in 2020.  This was offset by the increase in the cost of debt servicing associated with these investments by &euro;6.1 billion over the period. <\/p> <p>  At the end of 2016 the value in the State&rsquo;s shareholdings in the three quoted banks was &euro;13.6 billion.  Since then the State realised &euro;3.4 billion from the initial public offering, IPO, of AIB in June this year leaving it with a 71% remaining shareholding in that bank.  The IPO of AIB was managed by the Department and was the second largest IPO globally in 2017, the largest in Europe in 2017 and the largest on the London Stock Exchange since 2011 as measured by the level of funds raised.<\/p><p>As of the close of business on 12 December 2017, the market value of our remaining investments in these banks stood at &euro;12.4 billion, indicating a net increase in the value of our shareholdings since the end of 2016 of almost &euro;2.2 billion when the proceeds from the AIB IPO are taken into consideration.<\/p><p> In respect of banking stabilisation-related Central Bank income, for the years 2009 to 2016 the examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General has estimated that in the region of &euro;7.7 billion of the Central Bank's surplus income of &euro;12.5 billion was attributable to financial instruments held as a result of banking stabilisation measures taken by the State.  These financial instruments were in the form of exceptional liquidity assistance and Government bonds held by the Central Bank.  The report estimates that 97% of the &euro;7.7 billion portion of the Central Bank&rsquo;s surplus income for the years 2009 to 2016 is attributable to transactions between the Central Bank and IBRC. <\/p><p> Subsequent to the liquidation of IBRC in February 2013, the Central Bank acquired just over &euro;25 billion of floating rate notes, FRNs, and &euro;3.46 billion of fixed rate treasury bonds.  Between 2013 and 2016, the Central Bank earned net interest of &euro;2.7 billion from the bonds and realised gains of &euro;3.2 billion from the disposal of some of these bonds.  The Central Bank stated in its 2016 annual report that it intends to sell the remaining floating rate bonds as soon as possible, provided conditions of financial stability permit. <\/p><p> As at 13 December 2017, the bank has so far disposed of &euro;9.5 billion nominal of the floating rate notes, significantly exceeding its minimum targets outlined in 2013.  While the pace of these disposals is significantly ahead of the minimum schedule, it is positive that the NTMA is locking in current low market rates now rather than some time in the future, at which point rates could be higher.  Furthermore, the cancellation of these bonds will also increase the amount of Irish debt that the ECB can purchase in the sovereign debt markets, which should help in further reducing the cost of the State&rsquo;s borrowing.  Notwithstanding these positives, clearly this acceleration needs to balance the negative consequences of the purchase and cancellation which includes the potential creation of excess supply in the market and the forgoing to the State of ongoing Central Bank profits related to these bonds. <\/p><p> The debt-related cost to the State associated with the investments in the bank was in the region of &euro;14.8 billion over the period 2009 to 2016.  These costs are estimated by the Comptroller and Auditor General and reflect the additional annual debt servicing costs and other related costs incurred by the State as a result of the borrowings used to invest in the banks. <\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General highlights that the Exchequer continues to incur the cost of servicing the debt associated with the net &euro;56.5 billion cost of the investments in the banks and the report estimates that this cost is likely to be in the region of &euro;1.7 billion for 2017 with over &euro;1 billion of this in respect of IBRC and a further &euro;0.6 billion in respect of AIB.  The ongoing annual cost of servicing the debt associated with Permanent TSB is estimated at around &euro;50 million per annum.  The State has recouped its investment in Bank of Ireland and therefore incurs no ongoing debt servicing costs in respect of Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p> The long-term cost of servicing the debt associated with the bank investments will depend on a number of factors, including the amount the State realises from its remaining investments; the period for which the Central Bank continues to hold government bonds; and the cost of funding for the State as it refinances existing debt when it matures.  The State guaranteed certain bank liabilities under three main schemes, namely, the deposit guarantee scheme, the credit institutions (financial support) scheme, and the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  By the end of 2016, the State had received net income in the region of &euro;3.7 billion under the schemes with the majority of this relating to the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  Included in this figure is &euro;280 million received as an interim dividend from the special liquidators of IBRC and it is expected a second interim dividend of &euro;280 million will be received in the next few weeks following the announcement last week of a further 25% payment to admitted unsecured creditors of IBRC. <\/p><p> In respect of NAMA, its board has approved a projected terminal surplus of up to &euro;3 billion over the course of its life, which is dependent on favourable market conditions being maintained when realising remaining assets.  This surplus will be paid to the Exchequer to reduce the overall cost of banking stabilising measures. <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and committee for their attention.  I hope members will appreciate that the stance adopted by the Department today is in the interests of protecting the position of the State in the proceedings that have been brought against it.  I would welcome any follow-on questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017121400002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Carville","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513242000,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carville and apologise that I was not here for the commencement of his statement.

The other letter came in on the 12th, informing us of the plenary summons seeking declaration reliefs.  From my layman's point of view, and I stand to be corrected if I am wrong, a declaration relief is where the Minister is not being sued for money or such recourse.  If the person wins the case, the court will make declarations to do with how the liquidation is going.  Costs is what the State would lose in the event that the person wins the case.  It is unfortunate they took it last Thursday.<\/p> <p>  When I wrote to raise issues, I wanted to know if we had invited the special joint liquidators individually.  I think we did not do so, which is unfortunate.  That was what I intended when I raised this last September.  The Department of Finance replied on 12 December saying it that in light of developments, the special liquidators would not be coming either.  Then we have this email going in and the timing of it.  To me, it looks choreographed.  I raised the question of why the Department is telling the special liquidators what to do.  It is matter for them if they come in.  They are not party to these proceedings.  They are not named in the proceedings against the Minister.  They should be here.<\/p> <p>  It was implied that the Attorney General was advising them and I raised that point.  Then, lo and behold, we got a letter saying they had their own legal advice but they understood the Attorney General was advising the Department of the same.  It looks grubby.  It looks like there is collusion between the three.  Frankly, as is so often the case these days, it looks like this is being used as a device for bodies that are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General to opt not to answer questions.<\/p> <p>  While I appreciate on a personal level Mr. Carville's saying he is disappointed he cannot talk about this, I have steam coming out my ears when I hear him say so.  The practice we see here is one of avoidance, with bodies saying they cannot answer our questions.  Maybe Mr. Carville is being absolutely genuine and I will take him at his word.  However, we had education and training boards, ETBs, coming in here saying they would not say anything because of legal advice.  We had the Acting Garda Commissioner saying he would not talk about a liaison committee.  We had a previous Garda Commissioner referring something to GSOC late at night to avoid answering questions on an issue here.<\/p> <p>  The Government may as well abolish the Committee of Public Accounts for the disdain and contempt with which it is frequently treated.  Ultimately, our responsibility here is not votes.  There are not many votes going for being on the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is about putting in hours of reading and research to try to pursue things that have nothing to do with one's constituency.<\/p><p>It is about taxpayers' money and, in this instance, it is about &euro;222 million of taxpayers' money as of the end of 2016.  Mr. Carville is disappointed that the liquidators cannot come in.  I am bound to conclude that there was collusion between the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Finance and the special liquidators to come in today and say how disappointed they are that something cannot be discussed.  There was no stopping whoever it was in the Department who yesterday rushed to tell the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>that everything was perfect - a Department official was quoted in an article by Shane Phelan - yet nothing can be said today.  I have a serious problem with this.  The new way of avoiding questions when appearing at the Committee of Public Accounts is simply to say that one has legal advice and cannot say anything.  It is a disgraceful abuse of that term in the Civil Service and in Departments.  It is so often the practice.  What would one say in here when explaining the expenditure of taxpayers' money that one would not say in the courts?  The Department has its legal advice from the Attorney General.  The joint special liquidators are saying they have their legal advice.  I have mine too.  <br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding what the Chair might tell me as we go, I will proceed to ask my questions.  In the event that I am ruled out of order, I will be ruled out of order.  However, I see no reason that any question I am about to ask the witness should not be answered.  There is no reason whatsoever.  I would like him to take that on board.  I would also like him to bring back to Merrion Street that I for one, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for however long I will be here, will not be putting up with the constant disdain and contempt being shown for this committee, the only constitutional committee of the State where witnesses are under the auspices of the Comptroller and Auditor General and where it is our job to ask questions of them.  I know the answer to this but, for the record, why is the Secretary General, the Accounting Officer, not here? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017121400002#F00500","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513242000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I will answer that and will then come back on the points the Deputy has made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017121400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Carville"},{"type":"speech","time":1513242000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I do not have time for it to be honest.

This is all set out in the opening statement.  The intention to pay an interim dividend is in the public domain and the witnesses are able to discuss that issue.  However, they cannot discuss other matters.  Mr. Carville will accept that members of the public may have difficulty understanding the Jesuitical approach being taken.  I would like to tease this matter out with him.  I note from a letter received from the special liquidator yesterday that representatives of IBRC have been advised not to attend the committee.

My interpretation is that the Attorney General has not told the Department it is precluded from discussing the matter.  I take the same reading from the letter from the special liquidator which refers to advice being given not to attend the meeting.  There is no indication that he is precluded from attending.

His principal rationale for claiming this is commercially sensitive is that there may be another liquidation or something major of this scale in future and he does not want to disclose this information in case it prejudices the State's negotiations the next time around.  This is a once-off case for which special legislation was introduced in the Oireachtas and on which the Minister has powers to supersede the normal creditors' committee.  Let us hope for everyone's sake that we do not have another one of these cases in our lifetimes.  I expect the Department will ensure this does not recur.<\/p> <p>  The rationale is that this commercially sensitive but there is nothing commercial sensitive.  It is commercial and there is no sensitivity involved because the fees are publicly available and the amounts to be paid should also be publicly available.  It does not have a knock-on effect because I cannot envisage a similar case arising again, whereas Mr. Carville can envisage another such case where this case could be used as the benchmark.  Is the reason this is commercially sensitive that another project of a similar scale could arise and releasing information now could jeopardise negotiations at a future date?

This has been on our work plan for some months.  When one looks at the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, not that one would need to, the one organisation that jumps off the page is IBRC in terms of the totality of what we are dealing with here.  We all know and accept that.  It is pretty exceptional and if it is ever repeated, I think I will be long gone.  One thing that was said around the time of the beef tribunal was that there would have been no need for that tribunal had questions been replied to.  I am looking at what has been sought in the courts - monetary remuneration, a transparent process, monitoring the remuneration and expenses sought for and paid, protecting the interests of the taxpayer, properly and effectively assessing and-or monitoring remuneration of the joint special liquidators' expenses sought and paid etc.  That is what we are looking for.  I do not know how the State can be protected by elongating that process, which is essentially what is happening.  If those issues were addressed, the case before the courts would be moot.  There would be nothing to answer.  I do not understand how the State is protected.  The length of time this will take in the courts is indeterminate but judging by the length of time it takes for cases to go through the courts, particularly a case like this one, we are likely to be looking at least 12 months during which time we will not have oversight.  The period could be even longer.  If this was addressed now, is the State not protected by virtue of the fact that we have transparency and we understand how remuneration is monitored?  I really do not understand the logic of that legal advice.  In the question posed by the Chairman regarding taking advice and whether the Department was restricted in terms of answering, there is real merit in coming back and actually answering those questions because it may short-circuit the process through the courts and engender far more confidence that the Department is dealing with this matter.  That is a comment as opposed to a question but will the Department at least undertake to go back and consider that point with legal advisers because it is not obvious what is being served by delaying this except that the Department answers the questions in the court that it will not answer before the Committee of Public Accounts?  Will the Department at least go back and have that discussion with its legal advisers and perhaps with the Minister?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017121400002#M00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513242000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>In respect of the Deputy's first comment and the general endorsement of claim - I think there are ten different items - I will pick one of the points made.  I am trying to be helpful because we must defend this in due course.  I agree with things like the declaration that the each and all of the defendants have a duty to ensure there is a transparent process for accounting for the remuneration.  There are other ones where the State is accused of failing to do various things.  I disagree absolutely with those.

We have a really good story to tell here and we are hugely frustrated that we cannot communicate this today.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the second point, as this case evolves, we will continually reassess what the legal position is.

We cannot allow the public to know how much it is getting for its euro.  That is laughable and unacceptable.  The committee has a job to do.  The Department of Finance is not alone.  Time and again departmental officials have queued to tell us that information is commercially sensitive and what is the legal advice, etc.  It actually does not matter that Mr. Hall took the case last week because the reality is that Mr. Carville will tell us nothing.  He has spoken about the report the Department produces periodically, which is great.  I said to another Secretary General last week that we were not here to celebrate all of what the witnesses were doing well.  What is contained in the report is great, but we are only interested in finding what can be improved to get better value for money.  That is what is missing from the report.  Regardless of the case, Mr. Carville has confirmed for me that I need not waste any more time on this issue at the Committee of Public Accounts because witnesses will not tell us because of the commercial sensitivity of information.  I have taken up enough time and I am bound to conclude.  There is a culture across departmental agencies and organisations audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General which uses evasion and any device within their reach to avoid an appearance or candour at the Committee of Public Accounts and that subverts the people's right to know that they are getting value for money.

Therefore, the banks do pay tax and that has been approved by the Oireachtas.  There are a few really important things to note about the tax losses.  First of all, tax losses are normal.  I think all OECD countries have the concept of tax losses, so there is nothing unusual about the banks having tax losses <i>per se<\/i>if one imagines other Irish corporates that are tax-resident in this country.

It is a very good question.  When we make an IPO for the bank, what is important is one must assess our performance when the last share is sold, so the assessment ranges over a period.  We own 99.9% of the bank, so one has to assess when the final share is sold, not as we sell, because in capital market terms what we want to do is sell into a rising market.  Therefore, every time we sell shares, in an ideal world - it will not work out like this in practice because it will take many years - we will continually sell at a higher price.  There are plenty of examples of this not working and examples of it working really well.  I am glad to say AIB is one example of it having worked really well.

Mr. Sugarman went to the Central Bank and disclosed some information in his role as risk manager.  We have been told that the central banks share a lot of information.   They are subsidiaries of the ECB.  Mr. Draghi has flatly denied having any knowledge that there was any risk or that he was aware of anything that was disclosed to the Central Bank of Ireland.  Yet, in 2010, the then Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, claimed that the Central Bank maintained a close relationship with the ECB.  How do we square that circle whereby that information was not shared when it was received?  Was it just dismissed?  How do we treat whistleblowers?  If somebody went to the Central Bank today and disclosed that there was a risk, how would the information be treated?  Would it be treated any differently to the way this was treated?

Regarding the 25% - the programme for Government figure was up to 25% - a huge amount went into considering why it would be that level.  To expand on that, say we picked 5%, then we would still own 95%.  We are dealing with very sophisticated buyers on the other side who are paid multiples of what we are paid.  They are multiples better than we are whose job is to get the State to pay at the lowest possible price and ours it to ensure that we sell the shares at the highest possible price, bearing in mind that we have other transactions to make and shares to sell.  It was very important to us that if we sold 5%, the other side would have felt that was not much to trade and they might look for a liquidity discount.  They would think that we have 95% left and they would look for an overhang discount.  I could anticipate the valuation falling.  The converse would have been true had the programme for Government allowed us to sell 50% or 51%.  Then we would look as though we were a distressed seller, and they would want to apply a discount on that or we could have been selling so many shares that the market could not absorb it.  As I said in my opening statement, it was the second largest IPO in the world this year.  A sum of &euro;3.4 billion is a huge transaction.  We had lots of advice, including independent advice from Rothschild, that 25% was the right figure to sell.  That is borne out by the share price only rose 4.6% in the first day.

It might be said that is not provided for, but there would be a benefit if there was an equivalent independent audit produced at the end of each year, especially when a liquidation is likely to span several years.  When the special liquidator gives his report to the Comptroller and Auditor General it is published, and nobody has any way of knowing if it is true or not.  That is probably why this case is going on at the moment.  There is a missing link in terms of public accountability when a public, State owned organisation is being liquidated, compared to the private sector.

The committee knows what has been happening for the last while and we wanted to inform people who have been viewing the proceedings all along that we have agreed our report.  I want to take the opportunity to thank each member of the committee.  It has been a very constructive committee.  I have never ceased to be impressed, surprised and amazed at the work that has gone into this committee.  For the most part, we worked extremely well together, and I want to pay tribute to every member with whom I have really enjoyed working.  On a personal level, I have made some friends and I am really grateful to have had that opportunity.<\/p> <p>  The amendments we have made reflect the votes we took yesterday and the evidence we heard overall.  I think we all agree it has been a very challenging experience.  I have personally found it challenging.  I have learned things about myself that I did not know, and I have learned things in general.  Overall, members have been on a journey.  I am very impressed with the Members of the Oireachtas on this committee.  I suppose I am biased in saying this but we have really shown how effective an Oireachtas committee can be, and on this most difficult and divisive issue.  I do not think anyone on this committee would ever seek to underestimate the challenge put in front of us.  It is part of an overall process.  We are now handing this over to ourselves, as Members of the Oireachtas, and to our colleagues to facilitate a vote of the Irish people, who will ultimately be the decision-makers on this, and it is very important to clarify that.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses who attended the committee.  We are indebted to them.  They did the State some service in attending.  We had excellent witnesses for the most part.  I wish to express our gratitude.  I very much thank the secretariat.  I hope Ms Suzanne Gunn and Ms Claudia Zelli will not mind me singling out the clerk, Mr. Ted McEnery, who we will all agree has been absolutely excellent.  His nature is such that he is an absolute pleasure to work with and, besides that, he is extremely strong and supportive.  We have all benefitted from his very considerable experience in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Everybody has said how lucky I am to have had the clerk that I have, and there is a reason he was put into the position. That is very really important.<\/p> <p>  I also want to thank Mr. Tom Malone, who is not here at the moment and who has been supportive also.  I am very grateful for the legal advice I have received.  I also thank Ms Zelli for all her support.  The amount of work she has done is underestimated.  I thank our legal adviser, Ms Nuala Butler, an excellent senior counsel, who also did us some service.<\/p> <p>  We will leave it at that.  The committee will launch its report next Wednesday.  I know the Vice Chairman is indicating a wish to speak.  On another committee, she might have had more opportunity to take the chair but the way the situation evolved, it became important that we had consistency in the chairing.  However, the Vice Chairman was very supportive, and I appreciated that support.  We have agreed that it suits everybody to launch our report at 12 noon next Wednesday.  Thank you, everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121400002#J00100","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513270800,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>On behalf of members of the joint committee, I thank the Chairman.
