The organisation is the representative body for member Rape Crisis Centres in Ireland that provide free advice, counselling and support for survivors of sexual abuse.  The Rape Crisis Centres are separate entities from the Network and they receive public funding independently of the Network.  It should be noted that not all Rape Crisis Centres are members of this Network.<\/p><p>  The new Child and Family Agency, established on 1st January, 2014 has now assumed responsibility for the funding of Rape Crisis Centres.  These services were previously funded by the HSE.  In 2013 the HSE spent over &euro;17 million on the provision of domestic and sexual violence services.  This included the funding of 60 services throughout the country composed of 20 Crisis Refuges, 16 Rape Crisis Centres and 24 Support Services.  Funding of some &euro;4 million was provided to the 16 Rape Crisis Centres.  <\/p><p>  In the context of significant constraints on public expenditure the emphasis has been on protecting funding for frontline service provision as much as possible and examination of all non-frontline expenditure to ensure this contributes effectively to the needs of those experiencing domestic, sexual or gender based violence.  The RCNI received funding of &euro;256,000 from the HSE in 2013.  The RCNI financial statements for 2012 indicate that the organisation received total income of over &euro;650,000 including &euro;254,000 from the HSE. <\/p><p>  The RCNI<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>had a service level agreement with the HSE which was due to finish on 31st December, 2013.  This service level agreement was extended to 31st March, 2014 to allow for the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, the appointment of a Programme Manager for Domestic, Sexual and Gender based Violence and to enable the Agency to tender for future support services.  There has been very high level engagement with the RCNI in recent times as part of a process which is ongoing.<\/p><p>  The Programme Manager took up the post on 3rd February and will work with the Head of Procurement in the Child and Family Agency to continue to put arrangements in place to achieve value for money in the delivery of priority national supports related to Rape Crisis Services.  It is recognised by the Child and Family Agency that there is a continuing requirement for training support and quality assurance services and the efforts underway will clarify the range and cost of this support within the overall envelope of funds for this sector.  The tendering process for future provision of national supports being undertaken by the Child and Family Agency will be open to all qualified providers, including the RCNI.<\/p><p>  As has been the case throughout this process senior personnel in Children and Family services and specifically the newly assigned Programme Manager within the Child and Family Agency will remain available to continue engagement with the RCNI.  The Child and Family Agency has been clear in stating that there is a continuing need for training and quality assurance supports for the Rape Crisis sector.  Accordingly, I believe it is premature to reach conclusions as to the outcome in advance of completion of the process which is underway to put contractual arrangements in place for the future provision of such supports.  I would hope that all parties will remain engaged and seek to demonstrate the value and economy of the national support services to be provided from within the total envelope of ring-fenced resources which continues to be made available to the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200068#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200068#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[6647\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200068#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the recently published Health Information and Quality Authority report on Crann&oacute;g Nua at Portrane; the actions she expects will follow on its content and recommendations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[6492\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200068#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the actions that will be taken in 2014 to reduce waiting times for children to obtain places in special care units in circumstances where they have fulfilled the criteria for admission to special care.","asker":"1020","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.<\/p><p>  Children who are unable to live with their parent\/s for their welfare and protection are taken into the care of the Child and Family Agency and placed mainly in foster care.  For approximately 5% of all children in care, residential care is considered the most suitable option to meet their needs.  Less that 1% of children in care with specialised needs are placed in a High Support or Special Care Unit.  The Child and Family Agency has informed my Department that it has put in place revised arrangements for the management of cases under consideration for a special care placement to provide a simpler and more child centred approach to managing the prioritisation of special care placements.

To increase special care capacity, Crann&oacute;g Nua will cease providing High Support Services once the current children complete their interventions and move on to their next placements.  This closure is expected to take place in May 2014.  Crann&oacute;g Nua will then be refurbished to bring the standard of  facilities to the security level required to provide Special Care Services by the end of January 2015.  This development will increase Special Care places on a national basis from seventeen places currently, up to twenty-five by the end of January 2015.

I am assured that this review will direct planning to ensure that appropriate placements are accessible to children with varying and complex needs.

The Minister briefed Cabinet on the 4th of February last on the O'Keeffe judgment.  Further consideration of this complex judgment is ongoing and I anticipate that there will be further Cabinet briefings in respect of the matter.  The Minister has announced his intention to initiate a review of the current and planned child protection systems operating in respect of schools in light of the judgment.  Discussions and meetings have been ongoing between officials in both our Departments in advance and following the Cabinet's consideration.  I expect that the scope of the Review and how it is to be carried out will be agreed shortly. <\/p><p>  This work will build on the existing strong links between our two Departments in respect of the Interdepartmental Group on Children First implementation.  The purpose of the Group is to promote the importance of Children First compliance across Government and to ensure consistency of approach.  The Group has completed a benchmark phase of establishing structures, mechanisms and activities in place within each sector to support and drive the implementation process.  In July 2013 the Government approved the publication of each Departmental Children First Sectoral Implementation Plan on the relevant Department websites.  A key priority of the Group is the development of appropriate reporting mechanisms in respect of the implementation of Children First within each sector and the assurance arrangements to monitor implementation and compliance.<\/p><p>  It is important to emphasise that there has been significant legal and structural reform changes to improve all of the systems of protection of children in Ireland.  In my own area, these include the Children's Referendum, the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, the ongoing implementation of Children First National Guidelines and the development of legislation to put key aspects of Children First on a statutory footing.

As a contracting state under the Hague Convention, the Adoption Act 2010 provides that adoptions by Irish prospective adoptive parents may be made subject to Irish and Indian requirements being satisfied  in line with relevant laws and the provisions of the Hague Convention. <\/p><p>  It is a matter for contacting states whether they wish to impose restrictions on whether and how intercountry adoptions of citizens of that State may be effected.  In this regard, the Authority advises that there remains a general moratorium by the Indian Central Authority (CARA) on India accepting adoption applications from other countries other than in special circumstances.  The Authority  has recently received an announcement from CARA that India is currently accepting packs from non-resident Indian prospective adoptive parents for the adoption of Indian children (normal category).  This means that India remains closed to non-Indian prospective adoptive parents at this time in respect of its normal categories of children.  The Adoption Authority understands that CARA is accepting applications in respect of special needs children, which includes children over five years of age and sibling groups.  The Authority is currently attempting to establish from CARA a possible time frame for the acceptance of application packs in the 'normal' category from non-Indian nationals. <\/p><p>  The Adoption Authority has advised it is their position that it is necessary to have an Irish registered accredited body to facilitate intercountry adoptions from India in order to safeguard the process for the child and the adoptive parents.  The Authority has two applications for India from Irish agencies which are being considered. Any accreditation being considered by the Authority can only apply to the Indian Special Needs Programme at this time.  The accreditation of agencies to facilitate adoptions is solely a matter for the Adoption Authority under law.  I have raised with the Adoption Authority the likely timescale of reaching conclusions on these applications and I understand it is intended to finalise the process promptly. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, the Authority advises that it is the policy of CARA to impose the following age limits and age differentials.  Again, they are a matter for the Indian authorities and are not specific to Ireland:<blockquote>-  To adopt a child in the age group of 0-3 years, the maximum composite age of the prospective adoptive parents should be 90 years wherein the individual age of the prospective adoptive parents should not be less than 25 years and not more than 50 years.<br \/><br \/>-  To adopt children above three years of age, the maximum composite age of the PAPs should be 105 years wherein the individual age of the PAPs should not be less than 25 years and not more than 55 years.<br \/><br \/>-  In the case of a single applicant, he or she should not be less than 30 years of age and shall not be above the age of 50 years.  The maximum age shall be 45 years to adopt children in the age group of 0-3 years and 50 years for adopting children above 3 years. <\/blockquote>  Updates in relation to intercountry adoption from India will be posted on the Authority website when available (www.aai.gov.ie).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200068#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200068#WRA01850"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[6573\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200068#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the main elements of her Department's responsibilities for children and young adults, with particular reference to the extent to which it is intended to provide or make available supportive services in areas most notably in need of such services in recent years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

It delivers on a key Programme for Government commitment and represents one of the largest and most important public sector reforms undertaken by this Government, bringing together over 4,000 staff and a budget of some &euro;609 million to provide a dedicated focus on services for children &amp;amp; families.  The formation of the Agency brought together key services relevant to children and families including child protection and welfare services, and services previously provided by the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  The Agency is tasked with achieving a new strategic focus, better management and consistency of approach so as to deliver a world-class service model of child welfare and protection.  For the first time we have child and family social workers, family support workers, social care workers and education welfare officers all working together to protect children and support families. <\/p><p>  I recently announced that an additional nine areas have been selected to enter the design stage of the Area-Based Childhood (ABC) Programme 2013-2016 in line with a key Programme for Government commitment bringing the total number to 13.  Three existing projects which participated in the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) in Tallaght, Ballymum and Darndale have already been approved for entry into the ABC Programme and a further project in the Midlands linked to the existing &quot;Preparing for Life&quot; project in Darndale is also included.  Its objective is to implement evidence-based prevention and early intervention programmes in some of the most disadvantaged areas of the State with a view to significantly improving outcomes for children. With 50% co-funding from The Atlantic Philanthropies, this brings total funding to nearly &euro;30m over 2013-2016.<\/p><p>  Significant investment, totalling more than &euro;260m, is being provided this year by my Department to support childcare programmes.  These include the Free Pre-School Year, from which approximately 68,000 children benefit annually.

These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drug Task Force projects and certain other provisions including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector.<\/p><p>  My Department also works in close partnership with other Government departments, statutory agencies and non-governmental organisations on a range of cross-cutting issues in relation to both policy and provision as they relate to children and young people. <\/p><p>  The 2014 Revised Estimate for my Department includes a net allocation of &euro;974 million  which represents an increase of &euro;540 million or 124% when compared to the 2013 allocation of &euro;434 million.

I have outlined to this House and to the Seanad on a number of occasions the proposed reforms and the measures necessary for their implementation.  Legislative amendments to Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 have been passed by the Oireachtas and will underpin the reforms.  The objectives are to strengthen the current inspection regime, provide a statutory basis for registration of pre-school services and also provide for the setting of minimum qualification standards for staff working directly with children in pre-school services.  To provide for the implementation of the changes to the Act it will be necessary to amend or make additions to the current Regulations in a number of areas, and these are currently being considered.  <\/p><p>  The new regulations will be accompanied by new National Quality Standards, both of which will form the basis against which services will be inspected by the Early Years Inspectorate of the Child and Family Agency.  The Standards will set out the outcomes for quality, and supporting criteria, against which the compliance level of a service will be measured.  Inspection under the new regulations and Standards will commence as early as practicable, and following the development of new inspection tools and guidelines.  In advance of the introduction of the new regulations, a communications exercise will be  undertaken to ensure that childcare services fully understand the impact of the changes to how they will be inspected. <\/p><p>  A new system of registration has been introduced and anyone proposing to open a new childcare service must first be registered with the Early Years Inspectorate before they begin to operate.  The registration and inspection system will allow Inspectors to specify improvement conditions that a service must comply with.  This system will, for the first time, provide for timely and effective regulation and enforcement of standards in pre-school services.  Information in relation to the inspection and registration system is available on the Child and Family Agency's website at www.tusla.ie.<\/p><p>  I have also indicated my intention to introduce a new requirement that all staff caring for children in an early years service hold a minimum qualification at FETAC Level 5.  In addition, the minimum requirement of FETAC Level 5 currently in place for pre-school leaders delivering the Pre-School Year programme, will be increased to Level 6.

We do not tolerate content which is directly harmful, for example bullying, but controversial or offensive behaviour is not necessarily against our rules.

It also reflects our cultural attitudes to alcohol in Ireland, which very often do not set the best examples for our children.

The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, under which funding is made available on an annual basis to 31 national and major regional youth organisations, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drug Task Force projects and certain other measures including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  The funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector.  There is some 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and over 40,000 volunteers involved in the provision of services and activities for young people.   <\/p><p>  In a context of the very difficult budgetary constraints that have arisen in recent years there have been no applications for the funding of new projects sought under the schemes since 2008.  In the determination of the annual allocations for the schemes, my Department, while seeking to meet the savings requirements under the  Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, has sought  to ensure that the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are maintained and  protected, as far as is possible, from the impact of the necessary reductions in funding.  <\/p><p>  I am aware of the challenges that youth organisations face in their efforts to maintain and develop their services to respond to the needs of young people in different parts of the country.

The Adoption Act 1952 placed adoption on a regulatory footing in Ireland and all adoptions that have taken place since then should, in accordance with the law, have been in compliance with that Act.  I am advised by the Adoption Authority of Ireland that 44,042 adoptions took place in Ireland between 1953 and 2012.  While records exist in relation these adoptions these records may not be as expansive as current day practices would envisage.  I am also aware that some of the arrangements which were put in place were not within the provisions of the adoption legislation leaving people assuming they were adopted, when they in fact were not, or that their births were the subject of illegal registrations.<\/p><p>  I have been anxious to see improvements in existing procedures for the tracing of birth parents by people who have been adopted.  The Child and Family Agency, which was established on 1st January last, has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland or the Agency's Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.  The existing arrangements for those seeking access to information reflect a transition from complex and historical situations and I am anxious that the Agency implement much more improved and consistent arrangements.  I have been advised by the  Agency that it is reorganising adoption services in 2014 at a national level, and will consider how best to deploy its staff to deal with this important issue so as to facilitate access to records where they exist. <\/p><p>  The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring records from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the Agency.  In the case of the Sacred Heart Adoption Society, for example, some 25,000 records have been transferred to the Agency's Regional Adoption Service in Cork.  Work by the Agency on the organising and storage of these records has taken place.  The advice of the National Archives has been sought in relation to the proper storage of these records that are of great significance.  I have raised the importance of arrangements for the management of these records directly with the Child and Family Agency and I have also asked my officials to examine the work that could be undertaken with the Child and Family Agency, the Adoption Authority and other stakeholders to improve arrangements for managing and accessing the records that are available. <\/p><p>  I have highlighted previously in the house the Constitutional and legal barriers to providing access to Adoption records without the consent of the birth mother.  The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill will address this matter but the legislature will be constrained in the nature of any access which can be granted to adoption records by these legal considerations.  In this context, I would urge birth mothers to enrol on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register which  was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.<\/p><p>  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the Contact Preference Register.  I believe there is an opportunity in the context of the considerable public attention this area is receiving to promote awareness amongst women whose children were adopted of the importance of registering their consent if contact is to be successfully re-established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200068#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":48,"content":"<p>Question No. 26 answered with Question No. 11.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200069#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[6495\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200069#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the discussions she has had with other Departments on foot of the publication of the audit report on neglect cases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>An audit report on neglect cases in Roscommon, Waterford and Dublin South East, 'A Review of Practice and Audit of the Management of Cases of Neglect', was published in June 2013 by the HSE.  The audit was conducted on foot of an examination of the management of systematic and problematic neglect in a family known to the HSE Child Protection Services.  Concerns had been raised that this might not have been an isolated case and that there might be more widespread practice and governance issues in the management of cases of neglect throughout the country. <\/p><p>  Follow-up work arising from the findings of the audit report is being led by the new Child and Family Agency, which was established on 1 January, 2014.  The Agency brings together over 4,000 staff previously employed by the HSE, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency.  The bringing together, for the first time, under one roof of social work, family support, education welfare and social care, working in partnership with non-statutory and State agencies will allow for a dedicated focus on improving the well-being and outcomes for every child who needs support.  The context within which our child welfare and protection services operate today is ever more challenging.  Referrals increased by nearly one third to over 40,000 referrals in 2012.  The area of neglect is particularly worrying and has seen a marked increase in referrals.<\/p><p>  A number of key initiatives have been taken arising from the audit report as follows:<blockquote>-  Audits of practice standards, including in the area of neglect have been carried out;<br \/><br \/>-  Briefing and training days have been held for professional staff to assist in identifying and responding to neglect cases;<br \/><br \/>-  A national review panel has been established, with an independent chair, to undertake impartial serious case reviews in cases where concerns have been raised.  These reports are published and the learning from them is systematically disseminated to staff.<\/blockquote>  With regard to the issue of inter-agency work a number of key documents are in place and will underpin the approach of the Agency to this key area including:<blockquote>-  &quot;Joint Protocol for Inter-Agency collaboration between the Child and Family Agency and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&quot;;<br \/><br \/>-  &quot;Joint protocol for Inter-Agency collaboration between the Child and Family Agency and the HSE&quot;; and<br \/><br \/>-  &quot;Memorandum of Understanding: Strategic Agreement between the Child and Family Agency and the HSE&quot;.<\/blockquote>  My Department is taking a lead role in the cross-sectoral implementation of Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children [2011].  A Children First Implementation Inter-Departmental Group has been established involving key Government Departments.  This Group is a forum at which cross-sectoral or cross-departmental issues arising from the audit report can be addressed.  The purpose of the Group is to promote the importance of Children First compliance across Government and to ensure consistency of approach.  In July 2013 the Government approved the publication of each Departmental Children First Sectoral Implementation Plan on the relevant Department websites.  A key priority of the Group is the development of appropriate reporting mechanisms in respect of the implementation of Children First within each sector and the assurance arrangements to monitor implementation and compliance.  <\/p><p>  To deliver on our aspiration to do better for children at risk and families in crisis including those affected by neglect, the Agency will have a broader focus than child protection.  Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic and care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families in need.  This will be an area of particular focus and attention for the new Agency.  We will adopt a cross-Government and inter-agency approach to ensuring that we deliver a timely, comprehensive and integrated service to vulnerable children and families.

A key element of this Agenda is to strengthen the national pre-school inspection system. <\/p><p>  Pre-school services that are required under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006 to notify their service to the Health Service Executive are subject to inspection by the Pre-School Inspectorate on a regular basis.  The inspection reports were generally held by the Inspectorate in paper format and access to these reports has been an issue of concern to many parents seeking quality childcare for their children.  The HSE did encourage services to share the reports with parents as preparation for the publication of the reports online was made.  <\/p><p>In July 2013 the HSE commenced publication of retrospective pre-school inspection reports online and also new inspection reports as they were finalised.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;50.530m including &euro;750,000 for a new capital funding programme has been provided to my Department for these schemes. <\/p><p>  In Co. Kildare, six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town, under the auspices of Kildare Youth Services, receive funding under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme.  Funding is also provided for a Youth Information Centre in Naas.  In addition, Kildare Youth Hub, Kildare Town has recently received approval for a capital grant of &euro;50,000 towards the cost of developing a new youth caf&eacute; facility.<\/p><p>  In 2014, funding of &euro;488,200 has been allocated for the projects and services under Kildare Youth Services.  The detailed notifications about the allocations and payment arrangements for this year are being issued by my Department this week.  As in recent years, national organisations along with the grant administering agencies that administer youth funding, on behalf of my Department, are invited where it is appropriate, to submit proposals to my Department for the reconfiguration of the funding allocations notified to them across projects and funding schemes to better meet local needs.  My Department would be happy to consider any such proposals on behalf of Kildare Youth Service and to discuss with the service and Youth Work Ireland any proposals, within their budget, that would assist the organisation in the provision of local services.   <\/p><p>  My Department, along with all government departments, is required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE).  My Department, in determining the annual allocations for youth programmes, while having regard to the CRE, has sought to ensure that, as far as is possible, the focus is maintained on the front line youth services particularly those for the most vulnerable young people.  This year, I secured an additional &euro;1m in the 2014 Budget to offset the impact of the CRE on the youth services.  As a result the overall reduction in 2014 budgets for the youth services at 3.75 % was significantly less had been indicated in the CRE.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the challenges that the budgetary constraints raise for the youth services throughout the country and its impact on services such as Kildare Youth Service.

The complement was determined following a detailed census and re-classification process undertaken in 2013, through which social workers were formally assigned to particular care groups, including children and families.  This work was necessary in order to prepare for the establishment of the new Agency and to allow for the transfer of designated staff.<\/p><p>  Staffing vacancies arise for various reasons including retirements, resignations, career breaks and unpaid leave.  In addition, gaps in service cover arise where staff are on paid leave.  Social work staffing levels across the whole country are at 93% according to the CFA.  Vacancies are covered by temporary staff as required to ensure staffing levels do not fall to an unsafe level.  This is risk assessed by Area Managers. <\/p><p>  Over the past 18 months a total of 153 social work posts have been filled.  In addition to this, there are a further 181 posts in the process of being recruited: <blockquote>- 23 of these have been offered and accepted positions and starting dates are being agreed;<br \/><br \/>- 6 offers have been made and are awaiting a response<br \/><br \/>- The remaining 152 posts have been approved to be filled.

This was evidenced by the results of the Census of Population 2011, where over six thousand children indicated that they provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problems or disability.  Children and young people with caring responsibilities face particular difficulties.  They often bear social, educational, emotional and health burdens that are inappropriate for them, and it is important that any responses to support them address such issues.<\/p><p>  In 2012 the Department of Health published &quot;The National Carers Strategy &ndash; Recognised, Supported, Empowered&quot;.

My Department will continue to support the raising of awareness among education and other providers of the signs that children and young people have caring responsibilities and the impact of caring on them.  Furthermore, my Department will ensure that the children strategies which are being developed will be as 'carer friendly' as possible.    <\/p><p>   It is also important that all statutory agencies keep under review the way they respond to such negative impacts.  The newly-established Child and Family Agency has a crucial role to play in relation to providing protection to children and assistance and support to families.  It is reliant on neighbours, schools, GPs, public health nurses, hospitals and disability services to alert it to instances where there is a concern that a child's welfare may be impacted by the caring  responsibilities they carry.  If a child's welfare is assessed as being negatively impacted by their caring role, the Child and Family Agency is obliged to provide supports to the child to assist them in that regard.

All of these items will be included in the funeral account issued by the undertaker to the family of the deceased.

I announced in my Budget 2014 speech that the 0.6% Pension Fund Levy introduced to fund the Jobs Initiative in 2011 will be abolished from the 31st of December 2014.  I have, however, introduced an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% for 2014 and 2015. I am doing this to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative.<\/p><p>  The reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services was one of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the Jobs Initiative.  It was due to end in 2013.  In my Budget 2014 speech I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate.  I also announced that the Air Travel Tax is being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014.  The 9% VAT rate has helped to create 15,000 new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs.  Since the Budget announcement about the reduction in the Air Travel Tax, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in significant increases in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.  The additional 0.15% levy for 2014 and 2015 will also be used to help make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties although funds from the levy will not be hypothecated or specifically set aside for this purpose.  The Government has decided that such liabilities will be met by the Exchequer as they arise.<\/p><p>  The chargeable persons for the pension fund levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans.  The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy. <\/p><p>  I am advised by the Minister for Social Protection that in developing the measures contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act (No.2) 2013, consideration was given to imposing an obligation on employers to secure a minimum level of funding before a scheme could be wound up and to the provision of a pension protection scheme.  Defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland are set up and maintained by employers on a voluntary basis.  There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to their pension scheme (although schemes rules can place some level of obligation).  Most defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland were established under a trust deed.  As part of the process of establishing each occupational pension scheme, an employer undertakes to be bound by the rules of the scheme and to undertake certain liabilities and duties defined therein.  The position around the employers and employees contribution obligation in a trust deed varies from deed to deed. <\/p><p>  Employers have, by and large, made great efforts to support and deliver on the promise made to scheme members.  This process is generally managed through dialogue between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability which may include a mix of measures such as increased employer\/member contributions, longer working and amended benefits.  Given the uncertainties as to the overall impact and potential for unintended consequences of applying an obligation on an employer to secure a minimum level of scheme funding in the event of the wind up of a scheme, it was not considered appropriate to make provision for such a legislative obligation.<\/p><p>  I am further advised by the Minister for Social Protection that while some countries with very large defined benefit markets provide pension protection schemes it was considered that such an approach was not appropriate for the Irish pensions market.  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013, provides that, in the event of the wind up of an underfunded pension scheme where the employer is insolvent, the State\u00a0 guarantees that existing pension benefits will be protected to a level of 50%, with pensions of &euro;12,000 or less being 100% protected.\u00a0\u00a0The Pension Board is actively engaged with the schemes which do not meet the scheme funding requirement in order to assist these schemes, particularly schemes in a weak funding position achieve a more sustainable funding position. \u00a0<\/p><p>  The overriding priority in this area is to ensure that pensioners and members of pension schemes are protected and the future viability and sustainability of their schemes is ensured and made safer.  The Minister for Social Protection informs me that it is normal practice for her officials to engage with representatives of stakeholders in relation to any substantial change to the Pensions Act.  The consultation process which preceded the publication of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill, 2013 included engagement with representatives of pensioners, the pensions industry, employers and trade unions.  Written submissions were also sought from these stakeholder groups. <\/p><p>  The Minister for Social Protection also advises that any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Pensions Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board.  This guidance makes provision for the notification of all pensioners in advance of any application to the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits.  In such circumstances a pensioner will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal.  The Pensions Board must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits. <\/p><p>  The matter of representation by pensioner groups in consideration of a change to scheme benefits might also be considered in a broader industrial relations context.  This is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Social Protection has referred this matter to him for consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200070#WRC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200070#WRC03100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Weight of Schoolbags","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200070#WRC03050"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[7151\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200070#WRC03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on the concerns of parents that children's schoolbags are too heavy because of the weight of books; the action his Department will take in consultation with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Increasing trade and investment is the way forward to create growth and jobs, addressing inequalities, increasing individual opportunities and providing mechanism to tackle abuses of individual rights.<\/p><p>  Before negotiations on any FTA takes place however, an extensive Impact Assessment is undertaken by the Commission that includes, for example, an analysis of any trade and investment agreement on human rights \/ labour standards, environmental impacts etc.  Before starting talks on a trade agreement the Commission requires a mandate from the Council. This sets out the areas that should be covered in any agreement.  It is here that I have frequently made it clear that when it comes to sustainable development, issues related to human rights should be given the utmost priority.<\/p><p>  Many of the EU's trade agreements now contain strong provisions to promote respect for core labour and environmental standards.  Those agreements with South Korea, Singapore, Central America (Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica) and Colombia\/Peru include such provisions.  Specifically, topics covered extend to adherence by both parties to essential international labour and environment standards and agreements, as well as the promotion of activity encouraging sustainable development, such as Corporate Social Responsibility. <\/p><p>  For example the EU-Colombia, among others, includes far-reaching provisions on the respect of the rule of law and effective implementation of international conventions on labour rights and environmental protection.  Civil society organisations are and will be systematically involved in the practical implementation of this agreement, as well as others, to monitor how these important commitments are being put into practical and meaningful effect.  In addition, implementation will also be subject to oversight by a special committee, and can be subject to an arbitration process.  In respect of this agreement, a meeting between the EU and civil society took place on 7 February to open the dialogue with citizens and local Non Governmental Organisations to look at how the sustainable development provisions of the trade agreement are being implemented.  The meeting is the first open meeting of the Subcommittee on Trade and Sustainable Development set up under the EU-Colombia\/Peru Trade Agreement.  This is one important agreement where my Department was especially vocal due to the serious concerns about the ability of trade unionists to undertake their legitimate role. <\/p><p>  In other areas the EU promotes and encourages countries to comply with international core labour and environmental standards by granting them preferential access to the EU market. Full tariff removal is given to countries that commit to implementing 27 international conventions covering labour rights, environmental standards, human rights.  Participating countries must report on their ratification and implementation procedures and are required to be open to international monitoring of their implementation activity.<\/p><p>  These preferences can and have been withdrawn by the EU, as instanced in the withdrawal of these preferences from Sri Lanka over shortcomings in implementing three UN human rights conventions.

It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known.  <br \/><br \/>- Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required.

","asker":"1059","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":285,"content":"<p>The State pension is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system. Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to State pension all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age, is taken into account when assessing whether they are entitled to State pension and the level of their State pension entitlement.<\/p><p>  Once over 16, the date a person enters into insurance is taken as the date used for averaging purposes in order to qualify for a State pension.<\/p><p>  To qualify for a state pension a person must:<\/p><p>  have at least 520 paid contributions and<\/p><p>  satisfy a yearly average (a yearly average of 48 is required for a full rate pension).<\/p><p>  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced. The scheme was designed with a view to ensuring that people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was limited.<\/p><p>  Under the pension reform programme, there is a plan to adopt a total contributions approach where the number of contributions paid over a work life will closely reflect the rate of payment received. For example, 30 years contributions (1560) could qualify a person for maximum State pension (contributory). A person would accumulate 1\/30th of a pension for each year of contributions up to a maximum of 30\/30ths inclusive of a certain number of credits. The introduction of new rate bands in September 2012 moves somewhat closer to this process. It had been planned to introduce this change in 2020 but in the context of changing demographics and longer working, this date may be brought forward.<\/p><p>  The OECD Review of the Irish Pension System which was published in April 2013 also endorsed the move to a total rather than an average contributions test to determine entitlement to a State pension.<\/p><p>  An increase for a qualified adult, which is a means tested payment may be made to an individual who does not qualify for a pension in their own right or qualifies for a lower rate of pension due to gaps in insurance or the means tested non-contributory pension may be available to an individual who meets the qualifying criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200078#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Internship Scheme Eligibility","counter":286,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200078#WRL00350"},{"type":"question","counter":287,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[7153\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200078#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if people who transfer their social insurance credits to their spouse's tax free allowance are not eligible to apply for JobBridge; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Participants retain the equivalent of their prior welfare payment, under the BTEA provisions.<\/p><p>  The Springboard Initiative in higher education offers free, part-time courses at Certificate, Degree and Masters levels.

Participants in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment can retain their payment by registering for the Part-Time Education Option at their local social welfare office.<\/p><p>  Evening courses and blended learning technology courses are also available through the former F&Aacute;S Training Centres, for which participants can retain their social welfare payments.<\/p><p>  In general, unemployed people taking up full-time training (other than of very short duration) are supported either through training allowances or through BTEA. In order to incentivise young people to take up training, those young people on a reduced social welfare payment (i.e. &euro;100 or &euro;144) see their payments increase up to &euro;160 while attending full-time training or education programmes.<\/p><p>  Those taking up part-time courses or more intensive short duration courses are supported the Part-time Education Option (PTEO) and Education Training and Development Option (ET&amp;amp;D). The PTEO allows participants to attend part-time day\/evening or weekend courses of education or training and retain their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while an entitlement exists provided that they continue to satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking employment on an on-going basis. The ET&amp;amp;D allows participants to attend certain courses of education, training or development of short duration and retain their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while an entitlement exists. Participants are exempt from engaging in job search but must be available for employment should an opportunity arise.<\/p><p>  In addition to these education and training options, JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme) provides work experience placements for interns for a 6 month or a 9 month period.

Along with all my colleagues in Government I am acutely aware of the ferocity of the winter storms which have resulted in widespread damage right around the coast and also the ongoing stormy weather since which has impacted on the fishing industry.  I am conscious of the damage to the many small Local Authority piers and harbours right around the coast, of the loss of fishing gear by many inshore fishermen and of the impact in terms of loss of income on the fishing fleet and its crews as highlighted by the IFPO letter.  <\/p><p>  A key priority for me, in allocating any limited resources that might become available, is the repair of storm damage to fisheries and aquaculture landing places. Such repairs to harbours, piers and slipways are essential to facilitate the fishing and aquaculture segments in the continuation of their normal operations.  Another priority for consideration, subject to any available resources, is to possibly assist inshore fishermen who have lost static fishing gear in the recent weather events. <\/p><p>  In considering any possible response to the situation of the fishing fleet and its crews I must take account of the fact that EU Law limits the options.  Any financial assistance provided by Government to the seafood sector must always be considered in terms of what is permissible under EU State Aid rules.  It is clear that under Council Regulation 1198\/2006 on the European Fisheries Fund, that while it provides for compensation for temporary cessation of fishing activities due to natural disasters and other exceptional occurrences, article 24 of the Regulation confines that aid to the period 2007-2013.  There are no other provisions in the EFF Regulation available to me to assist those fishermen identified by the IFPO letter.

This package includes:<\/p><p>- &euro;23m for the Beef Genomics Scheme;<\/p><p>- &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme;<\/p><p>- &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme; &amp;amp;<\/p><p>- &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s investment is a strong vote of confidence in the suckler beef sector.  It exemplifies the smart, green growth initiatives envisioned in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  It is important to note that this investment in the beef sector is aimed not just at sustaining a critical mass in the suckler cow herd, which is the seed bed of our high quality beef industry, but also at improving efficiency, profitability and viability at farm level. <\/p><p>  I have recently announced details in relation to the financial allocations for the new Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 (RDP) as well as outlines of the proposed measures for inclusion. The development of a new RDP for the period 2014-2020 will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.<\/p><p>  My Department has also published a consultation document outlining proposed measures for inclusion in the new RDP, including a new beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year.  Under the new RDP, beef sucker farmers will be eligible for participation under a range of measures including: <\/p><p>- a substantial new agri-environment\/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS.  This will provide for a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers, and a further payment of up to &euro;2,000 for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions, <\/p><p>- continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now Areas of Natural Constraint), to the tune of about &euro;195 million per year, <\/p><p>- incentives for on-farm capital investment, including support for the expansion of the dairy sector following the abolition of milk quotas in 2015, <\/p><p>- knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions, <\/p><p>- a new beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year aimed at improving the genetic quality of the beef herd, <\/p><p>- a separate strand of the support for on-farm capital investment will be ring-fenced for young farmers at a higher rate of aid intensity of 60%, and<\/p><p>- other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers, organic farming etc.<\/p><p>I am confident that this range of measures will, when taken together with other Pillar I direct payments, assist suckler farmers to improve their on farm viability. <\/p><p>  The proposed measure outlines are now available on my Department's website and will form the basis for a public consultation.  Written submissions are now being sought by the deadline of 19<sup>th<\/sup> February 2014.

Responsibility for promoting the welfare and protection of children at risk is a key function of the Agency. The context within which our child welfare and protection services operate today is very challenging.  The number of child welfare and protection referrals to social work departments increased by nearly one third to over 40,000 in 2012.<\/p><p>  It is my intention that the Child and Family Agency will bring a renewed focus on delivering safe and effective services for children and families who need a wide continuum of supports and interventions.  The Agency will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many children and families with the most complex needs. The Agency is tasked with developing a role in supporting families more universally by providing less complex, less intrusive, less expensive responses which have a preventive function.<\/p><p>  The principles underlying this responsibility are outlined in the prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic and care interventions which are key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families in need. A key policy objective for the Agency is to ensure that the fundamental principles of co-operation and co-ordination in the development and delivery of services are in place.<\/p><p>  My Department has a range of systems in place to ensure it  is informed of risk to children and the measures put in place to minimise these risks.  Monthly, quarterly and annual reports are received from the Child and Family Agency in respect of all its functions, including detailed reporting of key performance indicators. Officials have a range of meetings with the Agency to review areas in need of improvement. There are protocols in place for the Agency to inform the Minister and the Department of specific issues where risk is identified and to enable a robust management response to be put in place.<\/p><p>  Inspection reports are also received on an ongoing basis and meetings with HIQA managers and inspectors will be held on a regular basis to review key inspection findings in relation to children in detention schools, children in care in residential care including special care, foster care and children in receipt of child welfare and protection services in the community.  Reports from the Ombudsman for Children and the National Review Panel where risk to children is noted  are reviewed by Department officials to identify issues that require input and progress in the area of  policy or of operational issues.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that in establishing the new Child and Family Agency we now have in place the necessary structure to ensure the provision of a more responsive and integrated service to children and young people at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200091#WRY02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":528,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[7175\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200092#WRZ00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which it is intended to reinforce the rights of the child with particular reference to addressing issues of physical, mental or sexual abuse; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":529,"content":"<p>My Department is taking a lead role in the cross-sectoral implementation of Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children [2011].

In 2014, funding of &euro;50.530m including &euro;750,000 for a new capital funding programme has been provided to my Department for these schemes. <\/p><p>  I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet, regularly with many youth organisations and groups to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.<\/p><p>  Young people benefit hugely from participation in youth work services.  There is a growing body of research evidence which highlights how engagement in quality programmes helps young people to acquire important life skills such as confidence, problem solving, resilience and the ability to develop and maintain positive relationships and how it can enhance young people&rsquo;s competences for communication, leadership and innovation and their employability.   <\/p><p>  My Department also provides funding on an annual basis to support the work of the National Youth Health Programme (&euro;83,940 in 2013). This programme is a partnership between the National Youth Council of Ireland, my Department and the HSE.  The programme aims to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion\/education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.<\/p><p>  This work is achieved through the development of programmes and interventions specifically for and with youth organisations throughout the country and the provision of training and support for workers and volunteers who implement these programmes.  In particular, the Mindout Mental Health Promotion training and resource pack, which was developed by Health Promotion HSE West and NUI Galway, takes a positive approach to the promotion of emotional and mental health among young people and adopts a universal mental health promotion approach which has strong links with the &ldquo;Support for all&rdquo; element of the recent guidelines on Mental Health Promotion for Schools published by the HSE, Department of Education and the National Office for Suicide Prevention.   <\/p><p>  Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the development of the policies and services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning.<\/p><p>    The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, appointed by me in January 2013 includes the key national youth organisations, that work directly with young people. The Committee, which also includes representatives of Government Departments, the Education and Training Boards and other statutory agencies involved in youth matters, has an important advisory role to me on issues to do with how youth work practice and services can better meet the requirements of young people. <\/p><p>   My Department has regular engagement with members of the youth sector organisations in the development of policy initiatives that impact on young people.  At this time, members of youth sector organisations are contributing to the development of the Children and Young Peoples&rsquo; Policy Framework, my Department&rsquo;s new strategy for children and young people. They are also engaged with my Department in relation to the potential contribution of the youth sector to the measures to implement the youth guarantee. The National Youth Council of Ireland has a lead role in carrying out the EU structured dialogue process with young people in Ireland and the youth sector organisations are represented on the National Steering Committee chaired by my Department. It is planned that youth organisations will have a significant role in the new youth policy strategy which is being developed in my Department for completion in 2014. The next stage of the development of the youth policy strategy will include a consultation process with youth organisations, other youth stakeholders and young people themselves. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200092#WRZ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Budgets","counter":534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200092#WRZ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[7178\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200092#WRZ00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which she remains confident regarding the adequacy of resources available to her Department to meet in full the cost of services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":536,"content":"<p>The Revised Estimates for Public Services 2014 allocated gross funding to my Department of some &euro;997 million which includes over &euro;955 million in current funding and &euro;42 million in capital funding.  When Appropriations-in-Aid receipts of just over &euro;22.8 million are taken into account, the net current funding allocated to my Department in 2014 is some &euro;974.3 million.  This level of funding (&euro;997m) represents an increase of over &euro;558 million on the 2013 Estimate of &euro;439 million and the significant investment demonstrates that, while operating within difficult Budgetary constraints, this Government is strongly committed to delivering important reforms and service developments to support children and families. <\/p><p>  I consider that the estimate provision for my Department will facilitate the delivery of a significant level of public services as well as a number of new policy measures that include the following.  The establishment of the new Child and Family Agency took effect on 1  January 2014. This was a historic development and a significant milestone in the programme of this Government to fundamentally reform the delivery of services to vulnerable children and families. The level of funding allocated to the Agency is over &euro;602m in current funding and &euro;6.8m in capital spending. This resource allocation is for the continuing provision of services previously administered by the Health Service Executive, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency. The overall level of funding available, which is significant by any measurement, will help the agency to respond to demand and to the needs of clients.  It will help to improve the level and quality of services and assist in responding to the historic legacy of failings highlighted in the various inquiry reports published in recent years.  An additional &euro;4 million was provided to support implementation of the Preschool Quality Agenda which seeks to support high standards through supporting the efforts of providers and their staff in delivering improved and more reliable quality; and to respond to concerns raised by parents.  An increase of &euro;1.5 million in funding was provided to address child poverty through the new Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme. This will bring to &euro;4 million the State funding to be invested in this initiative in 2014.   The total budget allocation for the programme over the period 2013 &ndash; 2016 is almost &euro;30 million.   &euro;31m in capital funding is being made available to facilitate the continuation of construction work on the new Children Detention School facilities in Oberstown, Lusk, Co. Dublin. The timeline for the project will see the first three residential units available in the third quarter of 2014 and will be prioritised for the transfer of 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities, currently in St Patrick`s Institution. <\/p><p>  Other important areas being supported in 2014 are the free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which has a funding provision of &euro;175 million. Some 4,300 preschool services are participating in the programme and approximately 68,000 children are currently benefiting from it. In addition, in excess of &euro;50 million is also being made available to support the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services by the voluntary youth sector for all young people including those in disadvantaged communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200092#WRZ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":537,"content":"<p>Questions Nos.195 and 196 answered with Question No. 189.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":539,"content":"<p>Question No. 197 answered with Question No. 9.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":540,"content":"<p>Question No. 198 answered with Question No. 189.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Juvenile Offenders","counter":541,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200093#WRAA00500"},{"type":"question","counter":542,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[7183\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021200093#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which her Department continues to engage with juvenile offenders with a view to providing rehabilitative or educational supports; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of childcare tax relief.  <\/p><p>  Tax relief or tax credits would not, for example, support parents working in the home and could therefore, as opposed to the targeted approach, be seen by some as discriminatory.  Also these reliefs would favour the better paid and those on the minimum wage or in part time work or student parents would not be in a position to benefit to the same extent as higher income families.  Many parents use childminders or relatives to meet their childcare needs and might not be in a position to obtain receipts making it impossible for them to establish their entitlement to such benefit.<\/p><p>  I am very much aware of the relatively high cost of childcare in this country and of the difficulties that this presents, particularly where both parents are in employment outside of the home. To help address the issue, funding of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to support a number of targeted childcare support programmes that assist parents in accessing quality and affordable childcare.<\/p><p>  For example, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or parents in employment who are on low or relatively modest incomes.   My Department also implements the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides one free pre-school year to all eligible children before they commence primary school.   <\/p><p>  I am happy to advise the Deputy that a review of the childcare support programmes will be undertaken by my Department in the coming year with a view to identifying areas where they could be enhanced and improved to ensure the best use of the investment which is currently being made in this area.

The therapist, in conjunction with the parent(s) or carer, will determine the severity of the individual&rsquo;s difficulties and prioritise for therapy accordingly.  The level of intervention is in line with clinical policy, age and severity of the diagnosis.  The waiting period for intervention is dependent on the nature and severity of the disorder following assessment.  In an effort to address the issue of waiting lists and ensure that services are delivered in as equitable a manner as possible within available resources, the HSE has introduced a number of initiatives such as therapists increasing clinic based work instead of domiciliary work and providing family-centred interventions in a group, as opposed to a one-to-one setting, whenever possible. <\/p><p>  The HSE has informed me that decisions regarding the provision of services, including therapy services, are not based simply on an individual&rsquo;s level of IQ; rather best practice dictates that each case is assessed individually on its merits and therapy decisions made accordingly.
