The issue was discussed most recently at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday, attended by the T&aacute;naiste. At that meeting the Council adopted comprehensive Conclusions which reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s support for international efforts to support stabilisation in Mali and to counter the threat of terrorism.  <\/p><p>  Recognising that the issues in Mali cannot be addressed by military means alone, the Council also emphasised the importance of progress on the political track and especially the implementation of the transition roadmap which has been agreed by the Malian Government and Parliament.  EU Ministers have underlined in particular the preparations for free and fair elections scheduled to take place before the end of July, and the establishment of a National Commission for Dialogue and Reconciliation in Mali.<\/p><p>  The Council stressed the importance of international coordination on Mali and welcomed the outcomes of the meeting of the Support and Follow-Up Group which took place in Brussels on 5 February, and which I attended. <\/p><p>  Following on from the important discussion on the resumption of development assistance to Mali which I chaired as part of the informal meeting of EU Development Ministers in Dublin on 12 February, the Council welcomed the gradual resumption of EU development aid, linked to implementation of the transition roadmap.  <\/p><p>  I am particularly concerned at the impact of the crisis on the civilian population of Mali, and am pleased to note that this issue was addressed by the Council on Monday, with particular emphasis on the plight of refugees and displaced persons.

The focus was very much on the most appropriate steps for the EU to take in support of ongoing efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict.  <\/p><p>  Against the background of escalating fighting between the Syrian army and opposition groups, and with no military resolution in sight, it is increasingly evident that a negotiated solution is the only realistic option to bring about an end to the appalling violence (which has so far cost more than 60,000 lives) and to start a genuine process of political transition.  The Council made clear, in its Conclusions this week, that the EU welcomes and supports all efforts to bring a peaceful solution to the violence in Syria.    <\/p><p>  These objectives are central to the mission of the UN\/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi. The Council reiterated its full support for Mr. Brahimi&rsquo;s efforts and also welcomed the offer made to the Syrian authorities by the President of the National Syrian Coalition, Dr Al Khatib, to start a political dialogue leading to a peaceful transition. <\/p><p>  The Council devoted considerable attention to reviewing the current EU sanctions which apply against Syria. These sanctions remain essential in order to maintain strong pressure upon the Syrian authorities to stop its campaign of repression and violence against the Syrian people. I welcome the fact that the Council was able to agree on renewing the full range of existing sanctions for a further period of three months. <\/p><p>  Accountability remains very important, in the context of the many war crimes and human rights violations that have been committed by all sides during the conflict. Ireland has been to the fore within the EU in supporting calls for the situation in Syria to be referred by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court.  The Council has issued a clear call on the UN Security Council to urgently address the situation in Syria in all its aspects, including on a possible referral to the International Criminal Court.  <\/p><p>  The role of the UN also remains key in coordinating international relief efforts to address the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation arising from the conflict. Ireland was represented at the highly successful high-level pledging conference on Syria chaired by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in Kuwait on 30 January at which in excess of US$1.5 billion was raised to support ongoing international relief efforts.

An excess of 60,000 people are now estimated to have been killed as a result of the almost two year old conflict, which has witnessed indiscriminate targeting of civilians and residential areas, as well as humanitarian and medical organisations. With more than 820,000 individuals having fled the desperate situation in the country, the majority of whom are women and children, neighbouring countries have shown great generosity but also endured great strain in hosting those in need.<\/p><p>  At the High Level Donor Pledging Conference for Syria in Kuwait City on 30 January 2013, I announced, on behalf of Ireland, a pledge of &euro;4.7 million towards the humanitarian response in Syria and neighbouring countries, particularly Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. This substantial contribution has further illustrated Ireland&rsquo;s clear commitment to meeting the urgent needs of those affected by the ongoing conflict.  As early as March 2012, the Government commenced providing emergency assistance through partner agencies on the ground, and to date, our total contribution now stands at &euro;7,100,000. <\/p><p>  As part of the most recent pledge the Government has donated &euro;1million to the International Committee of the Red Cross. This is in recognition of the key role the organisation plays in reaching those in desperate need of vital humanitarian assistance within Syria.  We will also make &euro;1 million available to the UNHCR, which is leading on the Syrian Regional Response Plan, to meet the needs of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees across the region.  A further &euro;750,000 in Irish support is going to the World Food Programme which is currently reaching approximately 1.5 million people each month with emergency food assistance in all of Syria&rsquo;s 14 governorates.  The pledge also includes &euro;750,000 in assistance to UNICEF towards an improved protection environment for the children affected by the conflict and for their greater access to basic health and education services. <\/p><p>  In order to help address the needs of Palestinian refugees, including through cash and food assistance, emergency shelter rehabilitation, emergency health, education and the provision of winter supplies, a contribution of &euro;500,000 has been pledged to UNRWA.  Finally, funding of &euro;500,000 to the Syria Emergency Response Fund will enable both UN agencies and international and local NGOs to expand their reach to assist those in the worse affected areas.

As Presidency of the European Union, Ireland is striving to build momentum behind international efforts to ease the terrible humanitarian burden the Syrian people face, emphasising the need for all parties to the conflict to facilitate humanitarian access and aid delivery to the people in need, to ensure the neutrality of humanitarian aid and to abide by International Humanitarian Law. I remain committed to using the EU Presidency to call on all donors to fulfil pledges made, in coordination with the UN and in full respect of humanitarian principles so that the worst effects of the deplorable violence in this conflict can be abated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000070#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000070#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[8944\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000070#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will outline the total funding allocated at EU level for development programmes arising from the recent conclusion of discussions on the Multi-Annual Financial Framework; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>On 8 February the European Council reached an agreement on the EU Budget Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2010.

As Presidency, Ireland will now take on new responsibilities on gaining the assent of the European Parliament to the Regulation.  <\/p><p>  The agreement reached will see the overall budget fixed at &euro;960bn.  Within that figure, provision for Global Europe (Heading 4), from which development funding is drawn, is to increase by 3.3% (to &euro;58.704bn) as compared to the previous budget.At least 90% of EU overall external assistance over the 2014-2020 period will be counted as official development assistance. <\/p><p>  The European Council also agreed to increase the European Development Fund by 0.6% (to  &euro;26.984 billion) and to raise the maximum annual amount of the Emergency Aid Reserve by 15.5% (to &euro;280 million), both outside the MFF structure.  So overall, each instrument used to support development will increase under the new budget.<\/p><p>  In the MFF negotiations, Ireland sought to ensure that a fair proportion of the EU budget would be allocated to development assistance.  The decision to increase EU funding for external relations is a positive outcome, particularly in the context of the economic constraints across the EU, and demonstrates the commitment of the EU and the Member States to continue playing a leadership role, to engage effectively when humanitarian crises emerge and to target extreme poverty and hunger.<\/p><p>  The agreement reached on 8 February ensures that the EU and its Member States will collectively remain the largest provider of development assistance in the world, providing over 55% of global ODA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000070#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Peace Process","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000070#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[8941\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000070#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has discussed with his EU counterparts fresh plans to provide a much-needed and new impetus to the Israel\/Palestine peace process in view of last month&rsquo;s general election in Israel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1040","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>I agree entirely that a renewed impetus is badly needed in the Middle East Peace Process.

My most recent meeting with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers MP was here in Dublin on Monday 11 February. We agreed to continue working together to support the parties in Northern Ireland in addressing both the underlying and immediate causes of the deplorable violence seen in recent months on the streets of Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>  While the situation has been calmer in recent weeks, we remain fully engaged as Governments in our support of the work of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and are united in our view, in the context of forthcoming parades, that the Parades Commission&rsquo;s determinations must be respected. Dialogue between parade participants and resident communities continues to be the most effective way to prevent outbreaks of violence.  <\/p><p>  On 17 January 2013, together with the Secretary of State and her colleague Minister of State Mike Penning MP, I met with First Minister Peter Robinson MLA and deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness MLA.  <\/p><p>  At that meeting, we reviewed the situation following the recent flags controversy across the three dimensions of public order, political leadership and rebuilding Northern Ireland&rsquo;s reputation.  We emphasised the need for protests to stop as well as our support for the PSNI who have been at the frontline in dealing with the violent incidents unfortunately associated with some of the protests.  The Secretary of State and I encouraged the First Minister and deputy First Minister to work with other Party Leaders in Northern Ireland to move on from the current controversy towards building a shared, cohesive and integrated society.  We also offered to work with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the good work done by the Executive and others on attracting inward investment and tourists to Northern Ireland is not put at risk.  <\/p><p>  The persistence of sectarianism in Northern Ireland, with the absence of political agreement on how to make progress towards a truly reconciled society, contributes to the likelihood of incidents such as those we have witnessed in recent weeks. This crisis will not be resolved other than by a cross-party, cross-community response. In my view therefore, there is no substitute for the party leaders agreeing on a framework for talks to address the issues that have arisen in relation to flags and symbols. These are political issues that require a political solution. The sooner the framework is agreed the better. In the meantime, there has been very welcome progress in securing practical support for ongoing programmes to address sectarianism in Northern Ireland, in particular the agreement on a new EU Peace Programme (PEACE IV) with funding of &euro;150m secured. <\/p><p>  Looking forward, the focus of political leadership in Northern Ireland should be on maintaining and creating jobs through economic recovery, in which inward investment and tourism play such a crucial role.

I have regularly stated that the Government is completely opposed to this practice and, furthermore, that Ireland does not tolerate and will not tolerate the use of our airspace or airports for any illegal purpose, including torture, rendition or the unauthorised detention of any individual.  This is clearly reflected in the Programme for Government, which states that this Government &ldquo;will enforce the prohibition of the use of Irish airports and related facilities for purposes not in line with the dictates of international law&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  The Open Society Justice Initiative report, CIA Secret Detention and Extraordinary Rendition, is a compilation of existing material on this subject. It does not contain any new information, or make any new allegations, in respect of Ireland.<\/p><p>  Immediately following the first reports which suggested that the US was carrying out extraordinary rendition in order to transit prisoners, the then Government demanded and received specific assurances from the US authorities that such prisoners had not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission.  I am satisfied with these assurances, which were confirmed at the highest political level.  They are of a clear and categoric nature, relating to facts and circumstances within the full control of the United States Government.  <\/p><p>  The permission of the Irish Government must be sought and obtained for the transport of prisoners through Irish airports. I made it clear in this House on 22 May 2012 that &ldquo;under no circumstances will we grant permission for the transport of prisoners who are subject to extraordinary rendition&rdquo;. <\/p><p>  It is likely that a small number of commercially leased aircraft which have been involved in legitimate commercial activities have also been involved at various times in activities relating to extraordinary renditions.   However, there is no evidence to suggest that any of these aircraft were carrying prisoners at any time when they transited through Irish airports, including Shannon Airport. <\/p><p>  Deputies Boyd Barrett and Halligan have called for an investigation into the use of that airport by planes involved in illegal activity.  Where allegations have been made, including by members of the Oireachtas, these have been fully investigated by senior officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In no case has any evidence been adduced to support claims that extraordinary rendition had occurred.

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish immigrants will continue to be pursued by the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  <\/p><p>  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform would appear to have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election. The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as his subsequent speech on the issue on 29 January and his State of the Union address on 12 February sent a very positive signal in this regard.  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.<\/p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress continue with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In this regard, I raised the issue with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.   <\/p><p>  I am currently engaged in a round of telephone discussions with key US Senators and in this context I spoke with Senator John McCain on 8 February last to express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the efforts he and others are making in developing bi-partisan Senate proposals and to underline our ongoing interest in the issue.  The Taoiseach discussed immigration reform when he spoke with President Obama to congratulate him on his re-election.  The issue will remain a central feature of the Government&rsquo;s engagement with the US authorities, including over the forthcoming St Patrick&rsquo;s day period.  My programme, and that of other members of the Government during that period, while not yet finalised, will include meetings with key political figures and the Irish community groups that provide assistance to the undocumented. <\/p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what any future legislative deal might comprise.

We also fully support the sanctions which have been imposed on Iran with a view to persuading it of the need for a negotiated solution of this problem.   <\/p><p>  Progressive sanctions have been reluctantly imposed by the EU, particularly in the last two years, after many years in which Iran simply refused to negotiate on this issue.  During 2012, sanctions were extended to include oil and gas imports and increased restrictions on financial transactions and investment.  We believe that these sanctions have been successful in bringing Iran to the negotiating table.  However, the Iranians have as yet shown no real evidence that they are ready to engage seriously with this process.<\/p><p>  A further round of talks with Iran, involving the E3+3 group and led by HR Ashton, is scheduled to take place in Astana, Kazakhstan, at the end of this month.  The United States, through Vice-President Biden, has recently repeated its willingness to meet directly with Iran to discuss issues on which they have differed. <\/p><p>  However, the indications are not positive.   Recent meetings between Iran and the IAEA have made no progress; and Iran has been reluctant to agree dates for the E3+3 meeting.  The Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has reacted negatively in public to Vice-President Biden&rsquo;s proposal for direct talks.<\/p><p>  If there is no progress on the diplomatic track, there will inevitably be pressure to strengthen sanctions further.  In addition, recently enacted additional US sanctions may lead to renewed pressure within the EU for a further tightening of bilateral EU sanctions against Iran.  However, it will be difficult to go much further in this direction without reaching what amounts to a de facto trade embargo on Iran.  Any further proposals for EU sanctions would have to be considered carefully by all member States and in the context of Iran&rsquo;s engagement with the ongoing negotiations. <\/p><p>  Ireland will continue to lend full support to High Representative Ashton and to the dual track approach which is being pursued by the E3 + 3 on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000071#WRC00800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":71,"content":"<p>Question No. 27 answered with Question No. 23.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000071#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[8876\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000071#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on internment in Northern Ireland.","asker":"1084","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>We all have an obligation to use language responsibly and in particular to be careful with the use of terms such as internment.

Each of these partners is fully accountable to my Department for any funds received.  Programmes in receipt of Irish Aid funding are subject to regular internal and external monitoring to ensure that our support is reaching its intended beneficiaries and the planned objectives and goals of the Irish Aid programme are being achieved.  These programmes are regularly monitored by internal auditors, by independent experts, and by the Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  These reports are reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of the Department. <\/p><p>  In line with best practice and with recommendations from the OECD for improving the accountability of all development financing, Ireland strongly supports the strengthening of partner country delivery systems.  We provide assistance to national Government oversight institutions, such as the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committees of national Parliaments, to ensure Governments are held to account for the effective expenditure of public funds, including overseas development assistance. <\/p><p>  The recent case in Uganda, where there was evidence of the fraudulent use of Irish Aid funds, is a clear indication of the need for continuous vigilance in the oversight of any Irish Aid funds disbursed to our programme partners.

I have always accepted Israel&rsquo;s right to defend itself, and security forces themselves have a right to defend themselves, but consistent and repeated reports suggest a routine use of force, including lethal force, in circumstances where little threat was posed by those against whom it was used.  The rules or guidelines governing the use of crowd control weapons are either too permissive or are not being thoroughly enforced.  It is notable that different thresholds for the use of force in crowd control appear to apply depending on whether protesters are Israelis or Palestinians. Even in the West Bank, where Israeli military authority applies generally, the reaction of the security forces to demonstrations by Palestinians or Israeli settlers is completely different. <\/p><p>  It is important to note also that most Palestinian demonstrations take place in their own home villages or areas, and relate to intrusions by Israeli authorities into their lives there. Demonstrations are routinely subject to banning or exclusion orders which render them illegal, and crowd control weapons are then used against those illegally assembled. In this way legitimate protests are suppressed, and conflated with more serious violent attacks by militant groups. The result is a steady toll of Palestinian fatalities in non-threatening situations which should be wholly unacceptable in any civilised society.<\/p><p>  In any situation of military occupation, particularly one so long prolonged, there is a constant risk of security forces becoming desensitized to use of force, of &lsquo;last resort&rsquo; measures being routinely or improperly used, and of breaches of rules not being punished or indeed being actively condoned. The publication last month of a report on the use of crowd control weapons by B&rsquo;Tselem, a noted Israeli human rights group, has helped to highlight these issues.<\/p><p>  I have noted with great concern the rise in Palestinian fatalities in recent months, including those cases mentioned in the Question, suggesting that these problems are worsening. These concerns have been raised in recent weeks by Irish diplomats directly with the Israeli authorities, both here and in Israel, and in discussions at EU level. The Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv has organised a briefing of EU Missions by B&rsquo;Tselem, which will take place tomorrow, to help draw wider attention to their recent report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000072#WRD00600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000072#WRD00650"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[8935\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000072#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the aid that has been provided to Mali arising from the conflict there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>The political crisis and ongoing conflict in Mali has compounded an already serious humanitarian situation, in which millions of people have been affected by drought, hunger and food insecurity across the Sahel region.

This action directly threatens peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and is a clear violation of North Korea&rsquo;s international obligations under UN Security Council Resolutions 1718, 1874 and 2087.  It has been the position of successive Irish Governments that nuclear weapons have never and will never guarantee the security of any nation.  The existence of these weapons threatens security.  Following this test, the international community has been united in its strong disapproval of this action.  There has been strong condemnation to this effect by the EU, the US and China.  The UN Security Council has also strongly condemned the test.  The members of the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2087 on 22 January which expressed the Council's determination to take significant action in the event of a further test.  In line with this commitment, following this latest nuclear test, the members of the Security Council have begun work on appropriate measures in a Security Council resolution.

Ensuring a properly-funded Common Agricultural Policy was central to this, as was ensuring that the EU&rsquo;s regional policy addressed the real and current challenges we face, including unemployment.<\/p><p>  The Commission proposal for the MFF would have seen spending of &euro;45.7 billion on a special Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), including &euro;24.8 billion on transport and &euro;10.5 billion on telecommunications.  However, the final MFF agreement was for a total CEF amount of &euro;29.3 billion, of which &euro;23.2 billion was for transport and &euro;1 billion for telecommunications.<\/p><p>  The MFF outcome was a compromise, and could not fully reflect the ambitions of all Member States.

This is an act of political terrorism which I unreservedly condemn.  I join with High Representative Ashton in expressing the hope that the Tunisian authorities will conduct a full investigation into this assassination, so that those responsible for this terrible act are swiftly brought to justice.  Having sparked the popular movements for change and reform across the region, Tunisia has already taken great strides in establishing the foundations of a functioning democracy.  It was among the first countries to organise free general elections in October 2011.  There is no denying, however, that the pace and scale of change have somewhat slowed down since, with delays in the drafting of the new Constitution, regular extension of the state of emergency and threats to public order, all compounded by a worsening of the socioeconomic situation.  The violent activities of a number of extremist groups represent a particular concern and challenge in terms of the recent progress made. I encourage the Tunisian authorities to take all necessary steps to put an end to the actions of these extremist groups.<\/p><p>  The transformation in Tunisia from an oppressive regime to a normal functioning democracy will inevitably take time, as is also the case in other countries in transition in the region.  We need to be patient and, as the European Council commented recently, maintain our support for the processes of transition and economic development, with the clear understanding that the overall aim is to protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms.<\/p><p>  While I had a very useful and worthwhile meeting with President Marzouki last February (when I visited Tunisia to attend the inaugural meeting of the Friends of Syria group), I have not had an opportunity since then to discuss the most recent events with the Tunisian Ambassador.

The EU and the US are two of the world's largest trading blocs and already have very strong trading and investment ties with each other.

That High Level Group issued its Final Report to EU and US Leaders on 12 February 2013.  The Report concluded that a comprehensive agreement that addresses a broad range of bilateral trade and investment issues, including regulatory issues, and contributes to the development of global rules, would provide the most significant mutual benefit of the various options which had been considered.  The Report therefore recommended to Leaders that each side initiate as soon as possible the formal domestic procedures necessary to launch negotiations on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement.<\/p><p>  In a joint statement on 13 February 2013, EU and US Leaders welcomed the Report's recommendations and confirmed that each side will now initiate the internal procedures necessary to launch negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.

Civil society organisations play an important role in bringing citizens together to act collectively and participate in the development of their own countries and communities. They have a strong role to play in demanding better services from the state and holding governments to account.<\/p><p><br \/>  In some developing countries, civil society organisations have come under increasing pressure in recent years as they seek to play their legitimate role in society.  In these countries, dialogue with civil society organisations is limited and the space for civil society engagement remains narrow or is, in some cases, shrinking. This can severely limit the operations and effectiveness of organisations, notably those working on human rights and advocacy.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland has a long tradition of supporting civil society engagement.  In fact, Tr&oacute;caire and a number of other organisations, such as, Christian Aid and Frontline Defenders, are specifically funded by my Department to promote and facilitate strong civil society engagement across a range of countries.  In our nine partner countries, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance, we also provide funding to local civil society organisations.  This enables their participation at local and national levels of decision-making and their work for the fulfilment of human rights, especially for the most vulnerable.

This relentless process serves to poison relationships between the two peoples and is the exact opposite of what would be done by a government actively pursuing confidence building and reconciliation.   <\/p><p>  I am seriously concerned by a significant rise in these demolitions in recent weeks. Figures provided by the UN indicate that in January there were 139 demolitions of Palestinian structures including 59 residential structures and 80 animal shelters. The majority of these were in the Jordan valley. This represents a three-fold increase over the monthly average in 2012. These actions forcibly displaced 251 Palestinians, including 153 children, and affected many more. In some cases, troops returned days later to again destroy tents and temporary shelters supplied by aid agencies.<\/p><p>  The main reason for these demolitions and evictions is to make room for the ongoing expansion of illegal Israeli settlements. In other cases the land is cleared for military use, including training ranges, or even for parks. It is clear that all of these are just variations of an intention to force Palestinians off the land, to leave it in undisputed Israeli control. This occurs principally in Area C, which includes the whole Jordan valley, and in east Jerusalem. Regular destruction of wells, cisterns and other water and power infrastructure has the same objective. The usual pretext for demolition is that the structures lack planning permission. However, the authorities systematically refuse planning permission to Palestinian applicants, while at the same time applying completely different standards and responses to building by Israeli settlers.<\/p><p>  These policies are clearly in violation of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention.  International law accepts that occupation authorities sometimes may have to demolish buildings, but this is usually in the context of imperative military necessity or indeed actual combat, neither of which would seem to be relevant to these cases. In addition, these actions are carried out in many cases to facilitate the continued expansion of Israeli settlements, which is itself contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention.<\/p><p>  Ireland has consistently raised concerns about settlements and related issues such as demolitions, especially at EU level. The Foreign Affairs Council in May 2012 adopted detailed Conclusions on many of these issues, including demolitions and forced transfers. EU Missions on the ground are also actively engaged at present in exploring ways of helping the affected communities while our strong concerns and opposition to such practices have repeatedly been relayed to the Israeli authorities, both via our Embassy in Tel Aviv as well as through the Israeli Embassy in Dublin. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000076#WRH01100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":164,"content":"<p>Question No. 70 answered with Question No. 21.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Visits","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000077#WRJ00250"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[8460\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000077#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will be supportive of efforts to bring about an official visit from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to this State; his views that, amongst many other merits, such a visit would help market Ireland as a holiday destination for UK residents, particularly amongst the younger demographic; if he will make contact with the appropriate authorities to ensure that a formal invitation will be extended by this State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>Deepening relations between Britain and Ireland, including through high-level visits, is a priority for this Government.

My officials are in regular communication with a network of contacts, including public representatives, individuals and organisations working closely with the prisoners themselves.

Much progress has been made to date in implementing the recommended reforms contained within this report, including a significant uptake of the prison officers&rsquo; &ldquo;exit&rdquo; scheme and a corresponding recruitment of new prison staff.  Minister Ford confirmed recently that, to date, 287 prison officers have left the service through the voluntary redundancy scheme and he has secured funding to allow a further 73 Prison Officers to leave.  The delivery of a reformed justice system has a major part to play in building and protecting a more positive future for Northern Ireland.

My most recent meeting with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers MP was here in Dublin on Monday 11 February.  We agreed to continue working together to support the parties in Northern Ireland in addressing both the underlying and immediate causes of the deplorable violence seen in recent months on the streets of Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland.  While the situation has been calmer in recent weeks, we remain fully engaged as Governments in our support of the work of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and are united in our view, in the context of forthcoming parades, that the Parades Commission&rsquo;s determinations must be respected.  Dialogue between parade participants and resident communities continues to be the most effective way to prevent outbreaks of violence.<\/p><p>  On 17 January 2013, together with the Secretary of State and her colleague Minister of State Mike Penning MP, I met with First Minister Peter Robinson MLA and deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness MLA.  At that meeting, we reviewed the situation following the recent flags controversy across the three dimensions of public order, political leadership and rebuilding Northern Ireland&rsquo;s reputation.  We emphasised the need for protests to stop as well as our support for the PSNI who have been at the frontline in dealing with the violent incidents unfortunately associated with some of the protests.  The Secretary of State and I encouraged the First Minister and deputy First Minister to work with other Party Leaders in Northern Ireland to move on from the current controversy towards building a shared, cohesive and integrated society.  We also offered to work with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the good work done by the Executive and others on attracting inward investment and tourists to Northern Ireland is not put at risk.<\/p><p>  The persistence of sectarianism in Northern Ireland, with the absence of political agreement on how to make progress towards a truly reconciled society, contributes to the likelihood of incidents such as those we have witnessed in recent weeks.  This crisis will not be resolved other than by a cross-party, cross-community response.  In my view therefore, there is no substitute for the party leaders agreeing on a framework for talks to address the issues that have arisen in relation to flags and symbols.  These are political issues that require a political solution.  The sooner the framework is agreed the better.  In the meantime, there has been very welcome progress in securing practical support for ongoing programmes to address sectarianism in Northern Ireland, in particular the agreement on a new EU Peace Programme (PEACE IV) with funding of &euro;150m secured.<\/p><p>  Looking forward, the focus of political leadership in Northern Ireland should be on maintaining and creating jobs through economic recovery, in which inward investment and tourism play such a crucial role.

We also coordinate responses to requests from other bodies as they arise.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps is made up of highly-skilled people who can be deployed at short notice to assist in emergency relief efforts.  Calls for applicants are published annually on my Department&rsquo;s Irish Aid website and recruitment is undertaken through a competitive interview process.  Roster Members are required to hold an appropriate technical qualification and possess substantial relevant professional experience, preferably in a humanitarian context, demonstrate a commitment to humanitarian values, and be in a position to deploy at short notice for periods of 3 to 6 months.  Induction training for roster members is mandatory and is delivered in partnership with the Irish Defence Forces.  The selection of roster members for deployment is undertaken by the UN agencies by matching skills, experience and competencies with the vacancy.  When an Irish roster member is selected by the UN Partner, Irish Aid makes all the necessary preparatory arrangements (visa, travel, insurance and medical).  Members of the Irish Aid rosters have deployed on 188 occasions to 42 countries.  There are currently 11 members of the Irish Aid roster on deployment with the United Nations in 8 countries, Egypt, Kenya, Lebanon, Myanmar, the Philippines, Senegal, Somalia and South Sudan.<\/p><p>  The European External Action Service (EEAS) issues periodic &ldquo;calls for contributions&rdquo; requesting Member States to nominate persons to fill vacancies in civilian crisis management missions established under the Common Security and Defence Policy.  My Department maintains a list of persons who have asked to be considered for such missions, and also advertises positions of interest to Ireland through the Public Jobs website.  My Department nominates applicants to the EEAS only where it considers that their qualifications and experience satisfy the requirements for the position, as set out in the call for contributions.  The final selection of candidates is made by the EEAS from among those nominated by the member states.  Member states bear a significant proportion of the cost of seconding their experts to missions.  In light of the limited financial resources available, my Department deployed ten seconded experts in 2012.  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for the deployment of members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to these Missions.<\/p><p>  The Government believes that international election monitoring missions have an important role to play in the promotion of human rights and democracy, and my Department maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions.  We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.<\/p><p>  There are currently some 300 people on the Department&rsquo;s Election Observation Roster.  A call for applications to participate in the roster was recently published on my Department&rsquo;s Irish Aid website, with a closing date of 18 February.  The main requirement for inclusion on the roster is experience in the administration of elections (domestic or overseas).  Candidates who fulfil the requirements are placed on the roster following an interview.  The election observation programme is subject to continuous monitoring to ensure that it operates efficiently, and is currently under review.  It is expected that a new roster will be in place mid-year 2013.<\/p><p>  When a request for electoral observation is received from the EU and OSCE, the Department seeks expressions of interest from all observers on the election roster.  From the expressions of interest, a list of suitably qualified observers is then drawn up, taking into account the length of time since their last mission as well as any specific criteria for the mission, including country and regional experience and relevant language proficiency, if applicable.  Attention is also given to contributing to the commitment by the EU and OSCE to achieving a better gender balance on missions, as well as the need for Ireland to increase the number of experienced observers on our roster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000077#WRJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":180,"content":"<p>Question No. 76 answered with Question No. 62.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000077#WRJ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[9263\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000077#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"in relation to the recent detention of Jeyasundaram in Sri Lanka, considered illegal by UNWGAD, the reason there was no Irish diplomatic presence on the release date to ensure their release proceeded and to further ensure safety out of Sri Lanka.","asker":"1005","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[9267\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000077#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which information has been made available to him or his Department arising from the on-going detention of an Irish citizen (details supplied), in Sri Lanka; if their continued detention and the procedures to date followed by the authorities there are in accord with international law and human rights principles; if he is in a position to take any action at EU and or UN level with a view to ensuring that international procedures are strictly observed, that diplomatic access is available; whether in the absence of adherence to due process a request can be made for their repatriation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions No. 77 and No. 78 together.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware from previous responses to questions in relation to the person named my officials remain in close and direct contact with the person&rsquo;s wife and family and they liaise directly with her on all developments in his case.

These areas are identified in identified in the joint statement on the future of the British-Irish relationship issued by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron in March 2012, and include continued cooperation on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, addressing global issues such as climate change, poverty and hunger, and working closely together as partners within the European Union.

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish immigrants will continue to be pursued by the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  <\/p><p>  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform would appear to have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election.  The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as his subsequent speech on the issue on 29 January and his State of the Union address on 12 February sent a very positive signal in this regard.  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.<\/p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress continue with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In this regard, I raised the issue with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.  I am currently engaged in a round of telephone discussions with key US Senators and in this context I spoke with Senator John McCain on 8 February last to express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the efforts he and others are making in developing bi-partisan Senate proposals and to underline our ongoing interest in the issue.  The Taoiseach discussed immigration reform when he spoke with President Obama to congratulate him on his re-election.  The issue will remain a central feature of the Government&rsquo;s engagement with the US authorities, including over the forthcoming St Patrick&rsquo;s day period.  My programme, and that of other members of the Government during that period, while not yet finalised, will include meetings with key political figures and the Irish community groups that provide assistance to the undocumented. <\/p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what any future legislative deal might comprise.  It is therefore not possible at this stage to identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000079#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":212,"content":"<p>Question No. 90 answered with Question No. 31.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000079#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[9280\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000079#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the main locations worldwide in respect of which he and his EU or UN colleagues continue to be briefed where war, starvation, famine, human rights abuses and denial of women&rsquo;s&rsquo; rights remains an issue; the extent to which he and his colleagues continue to focus on such issues and bring about a means whereby such matters are addressed in a meaningful way; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>Neither Ireland nor, as far as I am aware, the European Union or the United Nations maintains a list of countries in regard to the violations highlighted by the Deputy.   In our foreign policy, which is expressed in direct contact with other countries or multilaterally through the EU, the UN, and other international bodies such as the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, we are working to alleviate instances of war, starvation, famine, and human rights abuses, including the denial of women&rsquo;s rights, and to enhance international peace and security.<\/p><p>  With our EU partners, we monitor closely the human rights situation in many countries throughout the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources, including official channels and non-governmental\/civil society organisations. Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question. We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015. We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses. This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.<\/p><p>  Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council. The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States every four years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance. Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011. The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned. Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it. We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.<\/p><p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings. In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.<\/p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.<\/p><p>  Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.<\/p><p>  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, the Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, supports concrete actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions (in particular through legal training). Legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses are also supported.

An example would be a residential property that is used to accommodate girl guides or boy scouts who take part in guiding and scouting activities.

In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it is adapted.  The exemption ends if the property is sold and the incapacitated individual no longer occupies it as his or her sole or main residence. <\/p><p>  Residential properties that have been certified as having significant pyritic damage will be exempt from LPT for a temporary period of approximately three years.

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability\/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome who have care needs may also receive access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupil's disability categorisation.<\/p><p>  I have asked the National Council for Special Education to provide me with policy advice on the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability.

Should a school need such additional accommodation it is open to the school authority to apply for same by completing the application form which can be downloaded from the Department's website <i>www.education.ie<\/i>.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.

The Government is determined that all young people will leave school able to read, communicate orally, in writing and in digital media, and be able to understand and use mathematics in their everyday lives and in further learning.  The Literacy and Numeracy Strategy which was launched in July 2011 adopts a modern and comprehensive definition of literacy which includes digital literacy.  The strategy sets out a range of improvement targets for literacy and numeracy including digital literacy.  The new Junior Cycle which is to be implemented in schools on a phased basis from 2014.  Eight skills underpin the learning which is to take place at Junior Cycle.  Among the key skills, are literacy and numeracy, including digital literacy and each of the key skills has elements which relate to digital literacy.  These will be embedded in all of the new subject and short course specifications developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for the new Junior Cycle.  In addition, the new Junior Cycle Framework also provides for short courses designed for approximately 100 hours of student engagement over two or three years and specified at a common level across the entire junior cycle.<\/p><p>  The NCCA is currently working on short courses in relation to digital literacy and programming and coding.  These will be available to schools from 2014.  ICT (including ICT infrastructure) is an important tool in the development of digital skills. ICT provides teachers with more up to date, exciting and relevant ways of presenting and engaging with the curriculum. One of the most important ICT infrastructure developments is the provision of 100mbps to post primary schools.  The availability of high speed broadband opens up endless possibilities for the use of ICT in the classroom.  In addition to the availability of infrastructure, teachers must be proficient in the use of ICT in teaching and learning and curriculum relevant digital content must be available for use by those teachers.<\/p><p>  There are a numerous specific examples of how ICT can be used to enhance the teaching of literacy skills.  One particular project where ICT is used as an incentive to improve literacy levels among school children is the FIS Bookclub.  The Bookclub is an online network designed to facilitate peer-to-peer book reviews for primary school pupils.  The network allows pupils to upload video reviews of their own choice of books, for the benefit of other members.  Technologies such as visualiser, interactive whiteboards and more increasingly individual student devices are being used in the classroom.  These technologies in particular can be used across a range of literacy activities at primary and post primary level.  For both primary and post primary level, Scoilnet, the national portal for digital content in Irish Education provides a central resource to teachers, pupils and parents, offering access to a growing repository of advice and information.  There are over 12,000 specific resources relating to the curriculum available.<\/p><p>  The education system has a key role to play in fostering and developing the digital literacy and ICT skills necessary for the competitive employment market.  In view of the importance of digital literacy skills in relation to employment opportunities my Department is actively pursuing a programme of work to ensure our young people leave school with the skills necessary.  In addition, the joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan which I launched last year outlines a range of short, medium and long term measures to increase the domestic supply of high level ICT graduates from the education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000084#WRQ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Grants","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000084#WRQ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[9254\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000084#WRQ00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will ensure that eligibility for third level grants will continue to be calculated on the basis of earned income, that the value of assets used to earn this income is not made part of this assessment and that children of farming families are not prevented from progressing to third level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that a dedicated capital assets test implementation group was established to bring forward detailed implementation proposals on new means testing arrangements for student grants, to include the value of assets.

The NPS is constantly carrying out research into any number of different markets where it is felt savings for the taxpayer can be made.  One such area of spend under review at the moment is the supply of art and graphic supplies for schools.

To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,500 SMEs nationwide.  In NPS competitions, the tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the participation of SMEs.  A prime example of this is when the NPS decided to divide the office supplies contract into three individual lots for Stationery, ICT Consumables and Paper.

Nevertheless, while the precise details remain to be worked out, it is expected that Ireland&rsquo;s overall Structural Funds allocation will actually increase from the &euro;901 billion we receive under the current round.  This represents a considerable achievement and is due to the consistent efforts of the Government to maximize support from Europe for our Structural Funds programmes.  In the case of the Border, Midlands and Western Region however, is likely that the allocation it receives will be reduced.  This is because the region will no longer qualify as a transition region since its GDP per capita exceeds 90% of the EU average.  Nevertheless, the Government was successful in securing a special allocation of &euro;100 million for the BMW Region to mitigate the effects of its change in status and in recognition of the significant economic downturn that the region has experienced.

It is intended that the competition will involve an upfront payment by the operator of the next licence to the State, a portion of which will be used to help build the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  It is envisaged that the competition will commence later this year.  A National Lottery Bill was published in December 2012 and is currently before the D&aacute;il.  The proposal to provide for a special weekly National Lottery draw, the proceeds of which would be set aside to help fund the building of the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, was one of a number of issues raised in a private members' motion which was debated in the Seanad on 13 February 2013.  Central to the success of the National Lottery since its establishment in 1986 has been the provision of ongoing Lottery funding for good causes.  They are categorized as follows in section 5 of the National Lottery Act 1986:<\/p><p>- sport and other recreation<\/p><p>- national culture (including the Irish language)<\/p><p>- the arts<\/p><p>- the health of the community<\/p><p>- youth<\/p><p>- welfare<\/p><p>- national heritage<\/p><p>- amenities<\/p><p>  It is intended that the next licence will continue to provide for the ongoing provision of a significant level of funding for good causes each year.  The National Lottery Bill provides that the categories of good causes will remain as they are at present.  While the motivation for the proposal referred to in the Question is well-intentioned, it is likely that such a draw would simply see players switching their usual spend on lottery products to one that would be dedicated to assist funding the Hospital.  In addition, there would be uncertainty around the scale and timing of likely revenues that would emerge.  Essentially, the provision for a special National Lottery draw to raise funds for the building of the new Hospital would result in less funding for the existing categories of good causes.  Consequently, less money would be available for the type of local and community-based projects which are so closely associated with the success of the National Lottery over the years.<\/p><p>  The decision to provide for an upfront payment under the next licence was made after careful consideration of the various options.  Unlike the proposal to provide for a special draw, the Government&rsquo;s approach will ensure that the raising of funds to allow the State to proceed with the building of the Hospital will not be at the expense of good causes.  The Government is seeking to maximise the benefit of the Irish National Lottery Licence so that maximum benefits can accrue to Irish citizens both through a sizeable upfront payment that can help fund the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital and through strong growth in revenue for good causes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000084#WRQ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Service Overtime","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000084#WRQ01650"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[9189\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000084#WRQ01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he is engaging with the Prison Officers' Association in negotiations with respect to the payment of hours worked during unsocial hours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>In response to the above Parliamentary Question I would refer the Deputy to Question number 6 on the order paper for questions answered on 23 January 2013.

It is unwise to concentrate solely on one single set of statistics and a comprehensive view of the sector requires an assessment of all relevant indicators, especially over a longer period, as erratic fluctuations can occur from time to time.<\/p><p><br \/>  The key data source for Industrial Production is the monthly Central Statistics Office publication on <i>Industrial Production and Turnover<\/i>  . The most recent release, published earlier this month, covers the period up to December 2012 so we now have full 2012 data. This latest information shows that production increased by 11% in December last over the previous month (seasonally adjusted basis) and this helped overcome a poor performance during some earlier months of 2012. The index of Industrial production now stands 2.8% higher than its level at the end of 2011, which represents a very solid recovery.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to <i>Purchases,<\/i> the reputable NCB Purchasing Managers Index is a composite indicator designed to provide an overall view of activity in the manufacturing sector of the Irish Economy and also acts as a leading indicator for the whole economy. After a period of contraction between November 2011 and February 2012, this Index has recorded 11 straight months of consecutive growth from March 2012 to January 2013. The Index now stands at about 50% higher than its low point in early 2009.<\/p><p><br \/>  Regarding <i>export<\/i> performance, the picture is also positive. It is heartening that exports of manufactured goods are continuing to rise despite challenges in many of our key markets. Final 2012 export data published by the Central Statistics Office just last week showed that goods exports increased by 1% over 2011, reaching a total of &#8364;92bn, the highest figure since 2002.<\/p><p><br \/>  Employment in the sector had suffered a major shock in 2008-2010 when approximately 50,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing.  However, numbers have stabilised over the last two years and there are now 205,700 people directly employed in manufacturing (both full-time and part-time), and a similar number of people are employed indirectly.<\/p><p><br \/>  To promote job opportunities in this sector, the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 included several specific initiatives to develop the sector. The Manufacturing Development Forum, which I established last year, has facilitated this process.  I asked Forfas to develop a new Strategy for Manufacturing up to 2020 and this study is currently being finalised.  A new report on the Skills needs of the sector, also being finalised at present, will also be a key driver in pursing those specific needs. <\/p><p><br \/>  A number of steps have already been taken to enable indigenous manufacturing firms to specialise, develop skills and value and scale up including:<\/p><p>- The launch of the new Potential Exporters Division in Enterprise Ireland, to support more indigenous companies to trade in foreign markets,<\/p><p>- Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s Lean Business Offer enables manufacturing clients increase productivity and competitiveness,<\/p><p>- The Launch of a new Development Capital Scheme, aimed at addressing a funding gap for mid-sized, high-growth, indigenous companies,<\/p><p>- Improvements to the R&amp;D tax credit scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  On wider Government actions, we have been systematically identifying those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 included an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to improve competitiveness and support job creation across all sectors of the economy, including the industrial and manufacturing sector. Further measures to improve our competitiveness will be contained in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs which I am currently finalising on behalf of the Government and which will be published in the coming weeks.<\/p><p><br \/>  All these initiatives will help build a solid future for manufacturing in Ireland so that we are well positioned to respond to an upturn in global markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRR01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Supports","counter":381,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRR01550"},{"type":"question","counter":382,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[6828\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRR01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if his Department officials have any role, along with the sponsoring Department, in developing research, development and innovation policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":383,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s core aim in investing in science, technology and innovation (STI) is to protect and create employment in Ireland and to increase national competitiveness through an integrated approach to research and innovation.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.<\/p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance\/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation. These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies. These initiatives are being rolled out in all areas across the country including Tallaght.

SPT will cease to be paid from 2014 which will standardise the payment of pension at age 66.  In addition, the age at which State pension (contributory) (SPC) will be payable will increase to 67 years from 2012 and to 68 years from 2028.  The State pension (transition) (SPT) is paid for a maximum of 12 months and is available to people who retire from work on reaching age 65 provided they satisfy the necessary PRSI contributions criteria and that they do not work for that one year between age 65 and 66. <\/p><p>  Figures indicate the numbers applying for SPT from employment are low.  In 2011, 12,052 SPTs were awarded.  The total number of SPT recipients in 2011 was 12,110.   This compares to 296,995 recipients of SPC in 2011.  Of the SPTs awarded in 2011, 1,478 (12.3%) were awarded SPT directly from employment while almost half, 5,850 (48.5%) were already in receipt of another social welfare payment.  A person who retires from work on reaching age 65 and who does not have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for SPT may apply for  another social welfare payment, depending on their individual circumstances.<\/p><p>  Raising State pension age and the abolition of SPT is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future and to address the challenges of changing demographics such as increasing life expectancy.   It is important that those who need to or wish to continue in employment after State pension age should, as far as is possible, be facilitated and supported.  Longer working can play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future and it can also be beneficial to the individual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRS00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals","counter":394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRS00550"},{"type":"question","counter":395,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[9137\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRS00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a decision has been made on an appeal of a domiciliary allowance application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":396,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 9th October 2012.

These controls are designed to try to ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the Intern.<\/p><p><br \/>  First, the  Standard Agreement signed and agreed to by both the intern and the host organisation upon commencement clearly states the terms of the internship; including the expected working hours, which can range from 30 &#8211; 40 hours (maximum) per week and the specific learning outcomes the intern will gain over the course of their internship.  Second, to ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the Department of Social Protection is involved in the ongoing monitoring of internships. This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conducting of random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the Internship. Of the 1,235 monitoring visits conducted to date, encouragingly 97% of visits were of a satisfactory nature with remedial action taken in the remaining 3% of cases.  Third, each host organisation&#8217;s allocation of Interns is based on it&#8217;s total number of employees. More details on this and the other stringent Host Organisation criteria are available on   .  Finally, under the current guidelines upon the conclusion of an internship position a cooling off period of 6 months must elapse before a host organisation can re-advertise either this position or another placement in the same area of activity.<\/p><p><br \/>  Any individual, who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme&#8217;s criteria, including cases of suspected displacement, quality issues or lack of appropriate mentoring and support, may contact the JobBridge team.  All such matters are fully investigated.  Recent independent research undertaken as part of an external evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon Independent Economic Consultants indicates that displacement of existing paid jobs occurs in only a very small number of cases and accounted for just 3% of the overall number of placements.  Some 40 cases of suspected displacement have been investigated by the Department since July 2011.

At the SCOFCAH meeting, experts from all Member States discussed the Commission&rsquo;s proposals to test meat and meat products for the presence of horse DNA and to test for the presence of phenylbutazone (or bute).  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals received the support of the majority of Member States and were agreed by consensus. Ireland strongly supported the Commission&rsquo;s proposals which represent another important step in restoring consumer confidence in this area. <\/p><p>  It has been agreed that the testing of meat and meat products may commence immediately and will be co-funded by the Commission at a rate of 75 per cent for the first month.  Results from the first round of tests, to be carried out by the end of March, will have to be reported to the Commission by 15th April.  The number of DNA tests, which will be carried out on the basis of representative sampling, is expected to exceed 2,250 across the EU, and this will be supplemented by bute testing on the basis of one sample per 50 tonnes of horsemeat. <\/p><p>  This testing will contribute to a clearer understanding of the situation across Europe and may be extended for a further two months.  The issue will be discussed again at the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 25th February.<\/p><p>  DNA testing has been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI&rsquo;s proactive approach to food authenticity and food fraud control programmes in this country.  It was this testing which first uncovered the issue relating to mislabelling of meat that has since become a matter of concern across Europe.  In the light of recent developments I had separately requested Irish manufacturers of processed meat products to carry out DNA testing and to work with the FSAI in developing testing protocols, to provide further reassurance to Irish consumers and consumers of Irish food abroad about the authenticity of ingredients in our meat based products.  The FSAI and my Department met with the meat processing sector on 14th February to agree a national protocol for DNA testing of meat to be applied at retail, catering and processing level in Ireland.  DNA testing will apply from now on as part of routine food testing across the country. The industry has already been engaged in product testing of over 200 samples and results received by the FSAI to date have all been negative for equine DNA (except for a further 5 that tested positive, which related to products previously identified as a problem and which had already been removed from the market).  <\/p><p>  In addition to the testing for bute agreed to at EU level, my Department and the FSAI are formulating a more comprehensive testing regime for horsemeat to provide full reassurance that no illegal slaughtering of horsemeat is taking place. <\/p><p>  I believe good progress has been made in securing a significant response at European level to this ongoing controversy.  We now have a co-ordinated EU testing plan in place introduced by the Commission at the behest of the Irish Presidency.  Our investigation continues and information is being shared with other competent authorities and with Europol.  The industry, which has primary responsibility for food placed on the market, has agreed to introduce additional DNA testing in order to provide reassurance to consumers.

The Commission is proposing that 30% of the national ceiling be set aside for these payments.  <\/p><p>  In order to attract the basic payment and to qualify for the green element, it is proposed that farmers must comply with three compulsory green measures.  The measures proposed are:<\/p><p>-  retention of permanent grassland (with a 5% tolerance) at farmer level,<\/p><p>-  crop diversification (3 different crops, minimum coverage of 5% and maximum coverage of 70%), and <\/p><p>-  establishment of ecological focus areas (7% of land, excluding permanent pasture, devoted to ecological purposes).<\/p><p>  Ireland supports the idea of encouraging sustainable forms of agriculture, which is at the heart of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, and can support the Commission in its desire to further enhance the green credentials of direct payments.  However, I believe it is preferable to do so in a way that avoids adding excessive bureaucracy.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals give rise to concerns in this respect.  There are also concerns that the proposed structure of the greening payment, which will comprise 30% of the annual national ceiling for direct payments, would hasten the movement towards uniform national or regional payment rates.  In addition, there are practical difficulties with the three greening criteria proposed that need to be resolved.  Almost all Member States share these concerns. <\/p><p>  Negotiations on greening are still in train so that it is not possible at this point in time to outline the specific detail of the arrangements that will apply.  Efforts to agree a common approach in the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers to greening have focused on the need to maximise flexibility for Member States in the implementation of the three criteria, and to allow other environmentally beneficial activities, namely, participation in agri-environmental and national sustainability schemes, to qualify as &quot;green by definition&quot;. <\/p><p>  As regards the three criteria, there is resistance to maintaining permanent grassland at individual farm level as proposed by the Commission, there is a general preference for a higher threshold than 3 hectares for crop diversification and to have a two-crop rule for smaller farms, and on ecological focus areas, the discussion is centring on whether there should be a reduction of the 7% requirement or an increase in the qualifying areas, as well as an increase in the 3 hectare threshold.<\/p><p>  A number of Member States want greening to be optional, i.e. that if a farmer did not meet his\/her greening obligations, they would forfeit the green payment but suffer no further penalty on the basic direct payment.  There is also the question of whether the greening requirements should be incorporated into what is known as the Pillar 2 baseline, beyond which farmers would have to satisfy additional environmental criteria in order to receive Pillar 2 payments. <\/p><p>  Finally, an important issue from an Irish perspective is whether the greening payment is a flat-rate payment.  We would prefer the greening payment to be a percentage of each individual farmer&rsquo;s payment rather than a flat rate.  This is also a key component of the Irish alternative model for the internal convergence of direct payments within Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":551,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRY01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Agencies","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRY01350"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[9026\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRY01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the State agencies or bodies not currently included under Schedules 1 and 2 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that Schedules 1 and 2 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 Act were repealed by the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 - section 22(e) - with effect from November 2012.

The new legislation extends the range of public bodies to come within the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.

I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), as set out in the Programme for Government.  The SDU is working closely with hospitals to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.<\/p><p>  The Special Delivery Unit is strongly focused on improving patient care and in ensuring that all patients who require in-patient admission are placed in a bed at the earliest opportunity.  It has set a clear target that 95% of all patients will either be discharged or admitted from an Emergency Department in 6 hours and that 100% of all patients will be either admitted or discharged within 9 hours.<\/p><p>  This target will be achieved by improving service delivery across the entire hospital and not just in the Emergency Department.  To that end, the SDU is working closely with the National Clinical Programmes and with Hospital Management, including Clinical Directors, to radically change the way that care is delivered to patients.    The measure that is perhaps most associated with hospital performance is the number of trolleys.  While the SDU recognises this as a very important measure, the published number does not come from the SDU.  The number that is reported is that published by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, the INMO.  They collect this information each morning, five days a week and their data made publicly available on their web-site and on the web-site of the Department of Health.  It is their count which indicates that there has been year-on-year improvement in trolley numbers.<\/p><p>  Hospitals will face differing levels of demands on their services at different times, due to external factors such as winter vomiting virus, flu and flu-like illnesses.  This is particularly the case in the winter, when both attendances at Emergency Departments and emergency admissions will tend to increase.  During periods of extra demand and pressure, a hospital may open extra bed capacity as part of their escalation and winter planning.  This extra capacity would only be utilised during these times of high demand.  <\/p><p>  In responding to such pressures, a hospital will take a number of steps, in a systematic and graduated manner, according to the level of pressure being experienced.  In the early stages it will ensure that all ward rounds are happening at the appropriate time so that the number of discharges are maximised, thereby creating the greatest possible number of beds for those that are waiting.  A next step that is taken is to temporarily open additional beds, for example in a ward that might be closed at night, such as a day surgery ward.  A hospital will also contact community services, again to create additional bed spaces by discharging those who can go home with community supports.  <\/p><p>  Where a patient is moved to a bed providing appropriate dignity, privacy and care facilities and that patient is clearly on a care pathway under a named consultant, the SDU sees no reason why that patient should be included in the trolley count.  However, if a patient is on a trolley or a bed, that is not in a proper space, where their dignity and privacy is comprised, the SDU most definitely expects that patient to be counted in the trolley figures.  All hospitals are expected to adhere to this approach and the SDU has been consistent in this message.  In the event that hospitals are forced to use such measures, it is expected that the patients affected will be accommodated in an appropriate bed as a matter of urgency. <\/p><p>  All hospitals will track the number of additional beds in use at a given time.  However, it would be misleading to provide the deputy with a single figure which might then be interpreted as the usual situation in a given hospital.  Both the number of &lsquo;regular&rsquo; and &lsquo;additional&rsquo; beds in use at any time changes from day to day, between day and night and between weekdays and weekends.  It is the role of hospital management to actively manage their bed stock according to the demands of the service and according to the available resources.  At all times however, it is expected that their patients are cared for appropriately, with dignity and privacy.  Where this does not occur it is reflected in the INMO and SDU trolley counts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRZ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":575,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRAA00350"},{"type":"question","counter":576,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[9112\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRAA00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of acute beds that are closed at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":577,"content":"<p>I believe we must concentrate on getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us.

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. <\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, meet the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams. <\/p><p>  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July.

In respect of Part 2 of the Act, which is under the aegis of my Department, a Cross-Sectoral Team was established in 2006 to provide for a joint approach by the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills to the implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004.  The Team now includes a representative of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 provides disabled individuals with an entitlement to an independent assessment of need and a statement of proposed services to be provided, and allows them to pursue a complaint and, if necessary, make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer.  Part 2 of the Act was commenced on 1 June 2007 in respect of children under the age of five.  It had been intended to have both the Disability Act 2005 and the EPSEN Act 2004 fully implemented during 2010 for children and young people aged up to 18.  However, in 2008 the then Government decided, in light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of both Acts.  Notwithstanding this the Cross-Sectoral Team continues to meet to address issues of mutual concern for children with disabilities. <\/p><p>  The Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of Disability Services which I published last year found that HSE funding is based on an incremental determination process with relevant adjustments made to the previous year&rsquo;s baseline allocation.  In recent years, the funding of new places has been made at local level on the basis of providing services to named individuals, but, once allocated, the funding does not remain associated with or follow that individual but is absorbed into the agency&rsquo;s base.  The move towards a model of funding which is linked to individual need, and which by definition will follow that individual, is encompassed by the recommendations in the VFM Review.  It is intended that the actions recommended in the VFM Review will lay the groundwork for individualised budgeting once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure its long-term viability.  The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from a person-centred supports model and developing the administrative and governance infrastructure necessary for a more accountable and individualised service. <\/p><p>  The VFM Review also looked at the issue of administration costs, and found that there were many factors influencing the percentage of an agency&rsquo;s budget which was spent on administration, including the size and function of the agency.  The Review found that it was difficult to draw any conclusions about a universal approach to the generation of management\/ administration savings, which were likely to vary on a case by case basis.  On the broader front, the VFM Review identified significant opportunities to achieve savings in agencies&rsquo; unit cost base and to reduce average costs across the sector.  Savings in management\/ administration costs would be a component in this overall cost reduction.  <\/p><p>  In terms of driving efficiencies, a number of administrative areas such as Human Resources, Finance, and Procurement are being examined and progressed through the work of the National Consultative Forum.  The Health Service Executive remains committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers to ensure that all of the resources available for specialist disability services are used in the most efficient and effective manner possible.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the Disability Sector and to the Social Care area as a whole.   In 2013, the Health Service Executive is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2012, which includes the provision of 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant \/ Home Support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRFF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRFF01050"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[9245\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000085#WRFF01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if assistance and support can be provided to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>In relation to waiting list management in general, the National Waiting List Management Policy , <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2013<\/i>, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.

The State pension (transition) (SPT) is paid for a maximum of 12 months and is available to people who retire from work on reaching age 65 provided they satisfy the necessary PRSI contributions criteria and that they do not work for that one year between age 65 and 66. <\/p><p>  Figures indicate the numbers applying for SPT from employment are low.

These controls are designed to try to ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the Intern.<\/p><p><br \/>  First, the  Standard Agreement signed and agreed to by both the intern and the host organisation upon commencement clearly states the terms of the internship; including the expected working hours, which can range from 30 &#8211; 40 hours (maximum) per week and the specific learning outcomes the intern will gain over the course of their internship.  Second, to ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the Department of Social Protection is involved in the ongoing monitoring of internships. This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conducting of random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the Internship. Of the 1,235 monitoring visits conducted to date, encouragingly 97% of visits were of a satisfactory nature with remedial action taken in the remaining 3% of cases.  Third, each host organisation&#8217;s allocation of Interns is based on it&#8217;s total number of employees. More details on this and the other stringent Host Organisation criteria are available on   .  Finally, under the current guidelines upon the conclusion of an internship position a cooling off period of 6 months must elapse before a host organisation can re-advertise either this position or another placement in the same area of activity.<\/p><p><br \/>  Any individual, who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme&#8217;s criteria, including cases of suspected displacement, quality issues or lack of appropriate mentoring and support, may contact the JobBridge team.  All such matters are fully investigated.  Recent independent research undertaken as part of an external evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon Independent Economic Consultants indicates that displacement of existing paid jobs occurs in only a very small number of cases and accounted for just 3% of the overall number of placements.  Some 40 cases of suspected displacement have been investigated by the Department since July 2011. Following investigation, it was found that these allegations were substantiated in 4 cases and those organisations were disqualified from participating in JobBridge.

At the SCOFCAH meeting, experts from all Member States discussed the Commission&rsquo;s proposals to test meat and meat products for the presence of horse DNA and to test for the presence of phenylbutazone (or bute).  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals received the support of the majority of Member States and were agreed by consensus. Ireland strongly supported the Commission&rsquo;s proposals which represent another important step in restoring consumer confidence in this area. <\/p><p>  It has been agreed that the testing of meat and meat products may commence immediately and will be co-funded by the Commission at a rate of 75 per cent for the first month.  Results from the first round of tests, to be carried out by the end of March, will have to be reported to the Commission by 15th April.  The number of DNA tests, which will be carried out on the basis of representative sampling, is expected to exceed 2,250 across the EU, and this will be supplemented by bute testing on the basis of one sample per 50 tonnes of horsemeat. <\/p><p>  This testing will contribute to a clearer understanding of the situation across Europe and may be extended for a further two months.  The issue will be discussed again at the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 25th February.<\/p><p>  DNA testing has been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI&rsquo;s proactive approach to food authenticity and food fraud control programmes in this country.  It was this testing which first uncovered the issue relating to mislabelling of meat that has since become a matter of concern across Europe.  In the light of recent developments I had separately requested Irish manufacturers of processed meat products to carry out DNA testing and to work with the FSAI in developing testing protocols, to provide further reassurance to Irish consumers and consumers of Irish food abroad about the authenticity of ingredients in our meat based products.  The FSAI and my Department met with the meat processing sector on 14th February to agree a national protocol for DNA testing of meat to be applied at retail, catering and processing level in Ireland.  DNA testing will apply from now on as part of routine food testing across the country. The industry has already been engaged in product testing of over 200 samples and results received by the FSAI to date have all been negative for equine DNA (except for a further 5 that tested positive, which related to products previously identified as a problem and which had already been removed from the market).  <\/p><p>  In addition to the testing for bute agreed to at EU level, my Department and the FSAI are formulating a more comprehensive testing regime for horsemeat to provide full reassurance that no illegal slaughtering of horsemeat is taking place. <\/p><p>  I believe good progress has been made in securing a significant response at European level to this ongoing controversy.  We now have a co-ordinated EU testing plan in place introduced by the Commission at the behest of the Irish Presidency.  Our investigation continues and information is being shared with other competent authorities and with Europol.  The industry, which has primary responsibility for food placed on the market, has agreed to introduce additional DNA testing in order to provide reassurance to consumers.  Ireland continues to be to the forefront in addressing this issue and we will continue to take whatever actions become necessary in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy Reform","counter":850,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WRY01150"},{"type":"question","counter":851,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[9261\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline the specific detail of the new green criteria which will be linked to 30% of the national payment ceiling as proposed by the EU Commission; the way this criteria will affect and benefit farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":852,"content":"<p>One of the key policy issues in this CAP reform is the focus on the \"greening\" of direct payments, which is provided for in the draft regulation on direct payments.  Greening refers to a new payment per hectare to farmers who are following agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment.  The Commission is proposing that 30% of the national ceiling be set aside for these payments.  <\/p><p>  In order to attract the basic payment and to qualify for the green element, it is proposed that farmers must comply with three compulsory green measures.  The measures proposed are:<\/p><p>-  retention of permanent grassland (with a 5% tolerance) at farmer level,<\/p><p>-  crop diversification (3 different crops, minimum coverage of 5% and maximum coverage of 70%), and <\/p><p>-  establishment of ecological focus areas (7% of land, excluding permanent pasture, devoted to ecological purposes).<\/p><p>  Ireland supports the idea of encouraging sustainable forms of agriculture, which is at the heart of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, and can support the Commission in its desire to further enhance the green credentials of direct payments.  However, I believe it is preferable to do so in a way that avoids adding excessive bureaucracy.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals give rise to concerns in this respect.  There are also concerns that the proposed structure of the greening payment, which will comprise 30% of the annual national ceiling for direct payments, would hasten the movement towards uniform national or regional payment rates.  In addition, there are practical difficulties with the three greening criteria proposed that need to be resolved.  Almost all Member States share these concerns. <\/p><p>  Negotiations on greening are still in train so that it is not possible at this point in time to outline the specific detail of the arrangements that will apply.  Efforts to agree a common approach in the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers to greening have focused on the need to maximise flexibility for Member States in the implementation of the three criteria, and to allow other environmentally beneficial activities, namely, participation in agri-environmental and national sustainability schemes, to qualify as &quot;green by definition&quot;. <\/p><p>  As regards the three criteria, there is resistance to maintaining permanent grassland at individual farm level as proposed by the Commission, there is a general preference for a higher threshold than 3 hectares for crop diversification and to have a two-crop rule for smaller farms, and on ecological focus areas, the discussion is centring on whether there should be a reduction of the 7% requirement or an increase in the qualifying areas, as well as an increase in the 3 hectare threshold.<\/p><p>  A number of Member States want greening to be optional, i.e. that if a farmer did not meet his\/her greening obligations, they would forfeit the green payment but suffer no further penalty on the basic direct payment.  There is also the question of whether the greening requirements should be incorporated into what is known as the Pillar 2 baseline, beyond which farmers would have to satisfy additional environmental criteria in order to receive Pillar 2 payments. <\/p><p>  Finally, an important issue from an Irish perspective is whether the greening payment is a flat-rate payment.  We would prefer the greening payment to be a percentage of each individual farmer&rsquo;s payment rather than a flat rate.  This is also a key component of the Irish alternative model for the internal convergence of direct payments within Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":854,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WRY01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Agencies","counter":853,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WRY01350"},{"type":"question","counter":854,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[9026\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WRY01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the State agencies or bodies not currently included under Schedules 1 and 2 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":855,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that Schedules 1 and 2 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 Act were repealed by the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 - section 22(e) - with effect from November 2012.

I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), as set out in the Programme for Government.  The SDU is working closely with hospitals to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.<\/p><p>  The Special Delivery Unit is strongly focused on improving patient care and in ensuring that all patients who require in-patient admission are placed in a bed at the earliest opportunity.  It has set a clear target that 95% of all patients will either be discharged or admitted from an Emergency Department in 6 hours and that 100% of all patients will be either admitted or discharged within 9 hours.<\/p><p>  This target will be achieved by improving service delivery across the entire hospital and not just in the Emergency Department.  To that end, the SDU is working closely with the National Clinical Programmes and with Hospital Management, including Clinical Directors, to radically change the way that care is delivered to patients.    The measure that is perhaps most associated with hospital performance is the number of trolleys.  While the SDU recognises this as a very important measure, the published number does not come from the SDU.  The number that is reported is that published by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, the INMO.  They collect this information each morning, five days a week and their data made publicly available on their web-site and on the web-site of the Department of Health.  It is their count which indicates that there has been year-on-year improvement in trolley numbers.<\/p><p>  Hospitals will face differing levels of demands on their services at different times, due to external factors such as winter vomiting virus, flu and flu-like illnesses.  This is particularly the case in the winter, when both attendances at Emergency Departments and emergency admissions will tend to increase.  During periods of extra demand and pressure, a hospital may open extra bed capacity as part of their escalation and winter planning.  This extra capacity would only be utilised during these times of high demand.  <\/p><p>  In responding to such pressures, a hospital will take a number of steps, in a systematic and graduated manner, according to the level of pressure being experienced.  In the early stages it will ensure that all ward rounds are happening at the appropriate time so that the number of discharges are maximised, thereby creating the greatest possible number of beds for those that are waiting.  A next step that is taken is to temporarily open additional beds, for example in a ward that might be closed at night, such as a day surgery ward.  A hospital will also contact community services, again to create additional bed spaces by discharging those who can go home with community supports.  <\/p><p>  Where a patient is moved to a bed providing appropriate dignity, privacy and care facilities and that patient is clearly on a care pathway under a named consultant, the SDU sees no reason why that patient should be included in the trolley count.  However, if a patient is on a trolley or a bed, that is not in a proper space, where their dignity and privacy is comprised, the SDU most definitely expects that patient to be counted in the trolley figures.  All hospitals are expected to adhere to this approach and the SDU has been consistent in this message.  In the event that hospitals are forced to use such measures, it is expected that the patients affected will be accommodated in an appropriate bed as a matter of urgency. <\/p><p>  All hospitals will track the number of additional beds in use at a given time.  However, it would be misleading to provide the deputy with a single figure which might then be interpreted as the usual situation in a given hospital.  Both the number of &lsquo;regular&rsquo; and &lsquo;additional&rsquo; beds in use at any time changes from day to day, between day and night and between weekdays and weekends.  It is the role of hospital management to actively manage their bed stock according to the demands of the service and according to the available resources.

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. <\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, meet the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams. <\/p><p>  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July. In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE is confident that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Appeals","counter":942,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WREE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":943,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[9203\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WREE01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a decision to refuse the renewal of a medical card to a person (details supplied) suffering from a progressive and incurable condition was made by a Health Service Executive appeals officer or by a qualified medical officer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":944,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WREE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme Applications","counter":945,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WREE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":946,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[9210\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000089#WREE01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Wicklow may expect to avail of a general practitioner visit card under the long term illness scheme and if a general practitioner visit card will automatically issue to those patients on the LTI card or do they have to apply for the card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":947,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to reforming the current public health system by introducing Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all.

In respect of Part 2 of the Act, which is under the aegis of my Department, a Cross-Sectoral Team was established in 2006 to provide for a joint approach by the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills to the implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004.  The Team now includes a representative of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 provides disabled individuals with an entitlement to an independent assessment of need and a statement of proposed services to be provided, and allows them to pursue a complaint and, if necessary, make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer.  Part 2 of the Act was commenced on 1 June 2007 in respect of children under the age of five.  It had been intended to have both the Disability Act 2005 and the EPSEN Act 2004 fully implemented during 2010 for children and young people aged up to 18.  However, in 2008 the then Government decided, in light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of both Acts.  Notwithstanding this the Cross-Sectoral Team continues to meet to address issues of mutual concern for children with disabilities. <\/p><p>  The Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of Disability Services which I published last year found that HSE funding is based on an incremental determination process with relevant adjustments made to the previous year&rsquo;s baseline allocation.  In recent years, the funding of new places has been made at local level on the basis of providing services to named individuals, but, once allocated, the funding does not remain associated with or follow that individual but is absorbed into the agency&rsquo;s base.  The move towards a model of funding which is linked to individual need, and which by definition will follow that individual, is encompassed by the recommendations in the VFM Review.  It is intended that the actions recommended in the VFM Review will lay the groundwork for individualised budgeting once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure its long-term viability.  The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from a person-centred supports model and developing the administrative and governance infrastructure necessary for a more accountable and individualised service. <\/p><p>  The VFM Review also looked at the issue of administration costs, and found that there were many factors influencing the percentage of an agency&rsquo;s budget which was spent on administration, including the size and function of the agency.  The Review found that it was difficult to draw any conclusions about a universal approach to the generation of management\/ administration savings, which were likely to vary on a case by case basis.  On the broader front, the VFM Review identified significant opportunities to achieve savings in agencies&rsquo; unit cost base and to reduce average costs across the sector.  Savings in management\/ administration costs would be a component in this overall cost reduction.  <\/p><p>  In terms of driving efficiencies, a number of administrative areas such as Human Resources, Finance, and Procurement are being examined and progressed through the work of the National Consultative Forum.  The Health Service Executive remains committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers to ensure that all of the resources available for specialist disability services are used in the most efficient and effective manner possible.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the Disability Sector and to the Social Care area as a whole.

At the SCOFCAH meeting, experts from all Member States discussed the Commission&rsquo;s proposals to test meat and meat products for the presence of horse DNA and to test for the presence of phenylbutazone (or bute).  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals received the support of the majority of Member States and were agreed by consensus. Ireland strongly supported the Commission&rsquo;s proposals which represent another important step in restoring consumer confidence in this area. <\/p><p>  It has been agreed that the testing of meat and meat products may commence immediately and will be co-funded by the Commission at a rate of 75 per cent for the first month.  Results from the first round of tests, to be carried out by the end of March, will have to be reported to the Commission by 15th April.  The number of DNA tests, which will be carried out on the basis of representative sampling, is expected to exceed 2,250 across the EU, and this will be supplemented by bute testing on the basis of one sample per 50 tonnes of horsemeat. <\/p><p>  This testing will contribute to a clearer understanding of the situation across Europe and may be extended for a further two months.  The issue will be discussed again at the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 25th February.<\/p><p>  DNA testing has been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI&rsquo;s proactive approach to food authenticity and food fraud control programmes in this country.  It was this testing which first uncovered the issue relating to mislabelling of meat that has since become a matter of concern across Europe.  In the light of recent developments I had separately requested Irish manufacturers of processed meat products to carry out DNA testing and to work with the FSAI in developing testing protocols, to provide further reassurance to Irish consumers and consumers of Irish food abroad about the authenticity of ingredients in our meat based products.  The FSAI and my Department met with the meat processing sector on 14th February to agree a national protocol for DNA testing of meat to be applied at retail, catering and processing level in Ireland.  DNA testing will apply from now on as part of routine food testing across the country. The industry has already been engaged in product testing of over 200 samples and results received by the FSAI to date have all been negative for equine DNA (except for a further 5 that tested positive, which related to products previously identified as a problem and which had already been removed from the market).  <\/p><p>  In addition to the testing for bute agreed to at EU level, my Department and the FSAI are formulating a more comprehensive testing regime for horsemeat to provide full reassurance that no illegal slaughtering of horsemeat is taking place. <\/p><p>  I believe good progress has been made in securing a significant response at European level to this ongoing controversy.  We now have a co-ordinated EU testing plan in place introduced by the Commission at the behest of the Irish Presidency.  Our investigation continues and information is being shared with other competent authorities and with Europol.  The industry, which has primary responsibility for food placed on the market, has agreed to introduce additional DNA testing in order to provide reassurance to consumers.  Ireland continues to be to the forefront in addressing this issue and we will continue to take whatever actions become necessary in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000092#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy Reform","counter":1059,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000092#WRY01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1060,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[9261\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000092#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline the specific detail of the new green criteria which will be linked to 30% of the national payment ceiling as proposed by the EU Commission; the way this criteria will affect and benefit farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1061,"content":"<p>One of the key policy issues in this CAP reform is the focus on the \"greening\" of direct payments, which is provided for in the draft regulation on direct payments.  Greening refers to a new payment per hectare to farmers who are following agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment.  The Commission is proposing that 30% of the national ceiling be set aside for these payments.  <\/p><p>  In order to attract the basic payment and to qualify for the green element, it is proposed that farmers must comply with three compulsory green measures.  The measures proposed are:<\/p><p>-  retention of permanent grassland (with a 5% tolerance) at farmer level,<\/p><p>-  crop diversification (3 different crops, minimum coverage of 5% and maximum coverage of 70%), and <\/p><p>-  establishment of ecological focus areas (7% of land, excluding permanent pasture, devoted to ecological purposes).<\/p><p>  Ireland supports the idea of encouraging sustainable forms of agriculture, which is at the heart of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, and can support the Commission in its desire to further enhance the green credentials of direct payments.  However, I believe it is preferable to do so in a way that avoids adding excessive bureaucracy.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals give rise to concerns in this respect.  There are also concerns that the proposed structure of the greening payment, which will comprise 30% of the annual national ceiling for direct payments, would hasten the movement towards uniform national or regional payment rates.  In addition, there are practical difficulties with the three greening criteria proposed that need to be resolved.  Almost all Member States share these concerns. <\/p><p>  Negotiations on greening are still in train so that it is not possible at this point in time to outline the specific detail of the arrangements that will apply.  Efforts to agree a common approach in the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers to greening have focused on the need to maximise flexibility for Member States in the implementation of the three criteria, and to allow other environmentally beneficial activities, namely, participation in agri-environmental and national sustainability schemes, to qualify as &quot;green by definition&quot;. <\/p><p>  As regards the three criteria, there is resistance to maintaining permanent grassland at individual farm level as proposed by the Commission, there is a general preference for a higher threshold than 3 hectares for crop diversification and to have a two-crop rule for smaller farms, and on ecological focus areas, the discussion is centring on whether there should be a reduction of the 7% requirement or an increase in the qualifying areas, as well as an increase in the 3 hectare threshold.<\/p><p>  A number of Member States want greening to be optional, i.e. that if a farmer did not meet his\/her greening obligations, they would forfeit the green payment but suffer no further penalty on the basic direct payment.  There is also the question of whether the greening requirements should be incorporated into what is known as the Pillar 2 baseline, beyond which farmers would have to satisfy additional environmental criteria in order to receive Pillar 2 payments. <\/p><p>  Finally, an important issue from an Irish perspective is whether the greening payment is a flat-rate payment.  We would prefer the greening payment to be a percentage of each individual farmer&rsquo;s payment rather than a flat rate.  This is also a key component of the Irish alternative model for the internal convergence of direct payments within Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000092#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":1063,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000092#WRY01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Agencies","counter":1062,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000092#WRY01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1063,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[9026\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000092#WRY01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the State agencies or bodies not currently included under Schedules 1 and 2 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1064,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that Schedules 1 and 2 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 Act were repealed by the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 - section 22(e) - with effect from November 2012.

The new legislation extends the range of public bodies to come within the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  As a result of amendments contained in sections 4 and 22 of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 any reviewable agency which comes under the remit of the Ombudsman will now automatically come under the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.

I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), as set out in the Programme for Government.  The SDU is working closely with hospitals to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.<\/p><p>  The Special Delivery Unit is strongly focused on improving patient care and in ensuring that all patients who require in-patient admission are placed in a bed at the earliest opportunity.  It has set a clear target that 95% of all patients will either be discharged or admitted from an Emergency Department in 6 hours and that 100% of all patients will be either admitted or discharged within 9 hours.<\/p><p>  This target will be achieved by improving service delivery across the entire hospital and not just in the Emergency Department.  To that end, the SDU is working closely with the National Clinical Programmes and with Hospital Management, including Clinical Directors, to radically change the way that care is delivered to patients.    The measure that is perhaps most associated with hospital performance is the number of trolleys.  While the SDU recognises this as a very important measure, the published number does not come from the SDU.  The number that is reported is that published by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, the INMO.  They collect this information each morning, five days a week and their data made publicly available on their web-site and on the web-site of the Department of Health.  It is their count which indicates that there has been year-on-year improvement in trolley numbers.<\/p><p>  Hospitals will face differing levels of demands on their services at different times, due to external factors such as winter vomiting virus, flu and flu-like illnesses.  This is particularly the case in the winter, when both attendances at Emergency Departments and emergency admissions will tend to increase.  During periods of extra demand and pressure, a hospital may open extra bed capacity as part of their escalation and winter planning.  This extra capacity would only be utilised during these times of high demand.  <\/p><p>  In responding to such pressures, a hospital will take a number of steps, in a systematic and graduated manner, according to the level of pressure being experienced.  In the early stages it will ensure that all ward rounds are happening at the appropriate time so that the number of discharges are maximised, thereby creating the greatest possible number of beds for those that are waiting.  A next step that is taken is to temporarily open additional beds, for example in a ward that might be closed at night, such as a day surgery ward.  A hospital will also contact community services, again to create additional bed spaces by discharging those who can go home with community supports.  <\/p><p>  Where a patient is moved to a bed providing appropriate dignity, privacy and care facilities and that patient is clearly on a care pathway under a named consultant, the SDU sees no reason why that patient should be included in the trolley count.  However, if a patient is on a trolley or a bed, that is not in a proper space, where their dignity and privacy is comprised, the SDU most definitely expects that patient to be counted in the trolley figures.  All hospitals are expected to adhere to this approach and the SDU has been consistent in this message.  In the event that hospitals are forced to use such measures, it is expected that the patients affected will be accommodated in an appropriate bed as a matter of urgency. <\/p><p>  All hospitals will track the number of additional beds in use at a given time.  However, it would be misleading to provide the deputy with a single figure which might then be interpreted as the usual situation in a given hospital.  Both the number of &lsquo;regular&rsquo; and &lsquo;additional&rsquo; beds in use at any time changes from day to day, between day and night and between weekdays and weekends.  It is the role of hospital management to actively manage their bed stock according to the demands of the service and according to the available resources.  At all times however, it is expected that their patients are cared for appropriately, with dignity and privacy.  Where this does not occur it is reflected in the INMO and SDU trolley counts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000093#WRZ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1087,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000094#WRAA00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1088,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[9112\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000094#WRAA00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of acute beds that are closed at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1089,"content":"<p>I believe we must concentrate on getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us. This means we need to focus on how beds are used, on the throughput of patients, on reducing length of stay to international norms and on having as many procedures as possible carried out as day cases rather than inpatient work. <\/p><p>  The work of the Special Delivery Unit, together with implementation of the Clinical Care Programmes in the HSE, will help to improve the efficiency of our hospitals, allowing us to treat as many patients as possible within budget. I believe that pursuing efficiencies through these means will be a far more productive approach than debating the number of beds open or closed at any one time.<\/p><p>  In the current economic climate the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. The emphasis in 2013 will continue to be to make the most effective use of acute bed capacity through shorter lengths of stay, increased rates of day-of-surgery admission and more day surgery.  In this way the acute hospital system can ensure that, within the level of resources available, it provides safe, effective and efficient care to the maximum number of patients. <\/p><p>  Throughout 2013 hospitals will open and close beds on various wards in order to deliver the planned level of activity.

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants. <\/p><p>  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish\/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. <\/p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, meet the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams. <\/p><p>  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July. In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE is confident that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000098#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Appeals","counter":1151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000098#WREE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1152,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[9203\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000098#WREE01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a decision to refuse the renewal of a medical card to a person (details supplied) suffering from a progressive and incurable condition was made by a Health Service Executive appeals officer or by a qualified medical officer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1153,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000098#WREE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme Applications","counter":1154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000098#WREE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1155,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[9210\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000098#WREE01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Wicklow may expect to avail of a general practitioner visit card under the long term illness scheme and if a general practitioner visit card will automatically issue to those patients on the LTI card or do they have to apply for the card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1156,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to reforming the current public health system by introducing Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all.

In respect of Part 2 of the Act, which is under the aegis of my Department, a Cross-Sectoral Team was established in 2006 to provide for a joint approach by the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills to the implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004.  The Team now includes a representative of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 provides disabled individuals with an entitlement to an independent assessment of need and a statement of proposed services to be provided, and allows them to pursue a complaint and, if necessary, make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer.  Part 2 of the Act was commenced on 1 June 2007 in respect of children under the age of five.  It had been intended to have both the Disability Act 2005 and the EPSEN Act 2004 fully implemented during 2010 for children and young people aged up to 18.  However, in 2008 the then Government decided, in light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of both Acts.  Notwithstanding this the Cross-Sectoral Team continues to meet to address issues of mutual concern for children with disabilities. <\/p><p>  The Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of Disability Services which I published last year found that HSE funding is based on an incremental determination process with relevant adjustments made to the previous year&rsquo;s baseline allocation.  In recent years, the funding of new places has been made at local level on the basis of providing services to named individuals, but, once allocated, the funding does not remain associated with or follow that individual but is absorbed into the agency&rsquo;s base.  The move towards a model of funding which is linked to individual need, and which by definition will follow that individual, is encompassed by the recommendations in the VFM Review.  It is intended that the actions recommended in the VFM Review will lay the groundwork for individualised budgeting once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure its long-term viability.  The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from a person-centred supports model and developing the administrative and governance infrastructure necessary for a more accountable and individualised service. <\/p><p>  The VFM Review also looked at the issue of administration costs, and found that there were many factors influencing the percentage of an agency&rsquo;s budget which was spent on administration, including the size and function of the agency.  The Review found that it was difficult to draw any conclusions about a universal approach to the generation of management\/ administration savings, which were likely to vary on a case by case basis.  On the broader front, the VFM Review identified significant opportunities to achieve savings in agencies&rsquo; unit cost base and to reduce average costs across the sector.  Savings in management\/ administration costs would be a component in this overall cost reduction.  <\/p><p>  In terms of driving efficiencies, a number of administrative areas such as Human Resources, Finance, and Procurement are being examined and progressed through the work of the National Consultative Forum.  The Health Service Executive remains committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers to ensure that all of the resources available for specialist disability services are used in the most efficient and effective manner possible.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the Disability Sector and to the Social Care area as a whole.   In 2013, the Health Service Executive is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2012, which includes the provision of 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant \/ Home Support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000099#WRFF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000099#WRFF01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1172,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[9245\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013022000099#WRFF01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if assistance and support can be provided to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1173,"content":"<p>In relation to waiting list management in general, the National Waiting List Management Policy , <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2013<\/i>, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.
