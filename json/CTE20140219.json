We are pleased to discuss this issue with the committee.  We represent the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which has an interest in this area and in the broader areas of vocational training and further education.  We are here as a national social partner organisation that has been proactive in this respect at a policy level over the years.  We are also here as a body that, through various trade unions, provides a range of training courses for trade unionists and for our members in a variety of sectors.  As training providers, we are actively addressing what we still call the lifelong learning agenda, which involves trying to upskill our members.  The Congress Centres Network, which operates under the auspices of Congress, was set up in the 1980s as a network of centres for the unemployed.<\/p><p>  Most members of the committee will remember the 1980s.  Unfortunately, we are repeating some of the experiences of that time.  For example, we have to respond to high levels of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  The committee will be more than well aware of those issues.  That network is in essence part of the community and voluntary sector.  All the constituent centres that are part of the network are autonomous providers which work in communities to provide services to the unemployed.  It should be noted that Congress has a formal community sector committee, which is concerned with trying to further develop the sector.  My colleague, Ms Claudia Darley, is a member of that committee.  My other colleague, Ms Aileen Morrissey, is responsible for training within Mandate, which is one of our bigger trade unions.  The three pillars I have mentioned are represented in our delegation.<\/p><p>  I do not want to take up too much of the committee's time.  We acknowledge the huge challenges faced by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, which is a new body that is taking over the role of its predecessors.  One of those challenges relates to certification and accreditation needs .  We continue to enjoy a good relationship with QQI.  We have always found QQI personnel to be very professional, approachable and committed.<\/p><p>  We are aware that the fee structure which is being proposed is predicated on the fundamental question of resources.  We recognise that resources are a key consideration.  Congress is not formally opposed, in principle, to the idea of fees being charged as appropriate.  However, we are opposed to measures that we perceive as being unfair or counter-productive.  We are concerned that some elements of the proposed fee structure do not adequately reflect the environment in which much of the community and voluntary sector is operating.  The introduction of fees, which may or may not be subvented by the State from other sources, would be an added burden for many organisations in that sector, which are essentially operating on a financial knife edge.  It could be a decisive factor in determining whether community sector providers on a financial knife edge continue to be viable.<\/p><p>  Many training providers in this sector do not have multi-annual funding.  Certain requirements are often associated with the funding they get.  The State funding these providers get from a variety of sources is often contingent on their ability to certify training.  Congress certainly welcomes the development of accredited training.  We want to see people being certified for training.  In the absence of multi-annual funding, it is often difficult to put in place training courses that can lead to a major award.  The timescale militates against providing such courses on an annual basis.  If providers are not in a position to offer major awards, that can undermine their whole funding base.  We see that as being a particularly critical factor.<\/p><p>  Congress, like everyone in this room, is committed to a further education system that is centred on the learner.  We need to get people into the system in the first instance.  We need to get the bottom rung of people to engage with what we hope will be a ladder of progression in their training and certification.  The community and voluntary sector has traditionally and historically had a unique and key role in accessing such people and bringing them into the system.  Engaging such learners is intrinsically more resource intensive.  It often requires one-to-one interventions to explain to people the benefits of getting involved in training.  If we are to have a system that is generally coherent and equitable, we must ask why we should risk, through the introduction of further charges, prejudicing the ability of the sector to continue in this role.  It has been acknowledged that the community and voluntary sector has an inherent awareness of, and flexibility, responsiveness and alertness to, the basic needs of learners.  Nobody else has that access.  I will not go into the detail of this aspect of the matter.  Some of it was noted in our formal presentation.  The ability to try to innovate, not only in terms of content but also in terms of the development of new programmes, could be undermined by a fee structure that would be simply untenable for many of those organisations.<\/p><p>  We have noted QQI's policy document on fees.  I acknowledge and applaud QQI for its efforts in communicating its strategy and developing and circulating policy documents.  There is an opportunity to engage in a debate with QQI.  I suppose this is a continuing part of that.  We note QQI's statement that \"the determination of fees will have regard to the nature, type and mission of providers and the programmes they offer\".  The policy document makes it clear there is an inherent flexibility in QQI's capacity to determine fees.  The document also provides that \"exemptions and waivers may be provided for in specified circumstances\".  I would like to set out the fundamental position of Congress in this regard, but I cannot speak on behalf of Congress other than by mentioning that the Congress Centres Network is a member of the community education network of Aontas - the national adult education body - which has made its views on this matter known to QQI.  Aontas would take the same fundamental position, which is that fees should not be introduced at this scale and level and should certainly not be introduced up to level 5, in terms of the old FETAC levels.  Historically, social welfare recipients and medical card holders have not been charged certification fees when they would have undertaken training.  While there is no current proposal to change that, we note that it is to be kept under review.  Notwithstanding the other comments we have made about the fee structure, we think it would be a retrograde step if that position were to be changed.  I have set out the fundamentals of our position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900004#D00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Vaughan"},{"type":"speech","time":1392815100,"counter":9,"content":"<p>That is great.

I also thank Mr. Vaughan for his kind comments about Quality and Qualifications Ireland, which are much appreciated.<\/p> <p>Quality and Qualifications Ireland, which I will refer to as QQI, thanks the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection for the invitation to appear before it.  I also apologise on behalf of our chief executive of QQI, Dr. Padraig Walsh, who is chairing a board meeting of the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education of which he is president.  Dr. Walsh looks forward to attending the joint committee's meeting on 26 February when it will discuss community and vocational education.<\/p><p> Quality and Qualifications Ireland was established as a result of the amalgamation of the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI, and Irish Universities Quality Board, IUQB.  It is a single national body responsible for the external quality assurance of further and higher education and training.  It is also an awarding body.  As an amalgamated body, QQI interacts with all parts of the education and training and qualification system.  This includes the universities and institutes of technology, the newly established education and training boards, private providers that operate in the areas of further and higher education and training and English language training, and the community and voluntary sector.<\/p><p> While the scope of the new organisation's responsibilities is wide, it also presents significant opportunities.  At the centre of how Quality and Qualifications Ireland approaches its work is the national framework of qualifications which emerged in 2003 and has become part of the education and training.  While the framework is owned nationally, it is the responsibility of QQI to safeguard it.  It intends doing so by ensuring it represents more than the association of a level with a qualification.  As implementation of the framework continues, it must become a genuine symbol of the standard and quality of the qualification a learner has attained, regardless of where within our diverse education and training system it was achieved.  The link, therefore, between qualifications and quality assurance is paramount.  We must also ensure the ten level framework and the policies underpinning it keep the learner in focus and act as an enabler for individuals to pursue successfully the learning pathways of their choosing.<\/p><p> On the establishment of Quality and Qualifications Ireland in November 2012, the organisation proactively sought to meet education and training representative bodies.  In the community and voluntary sector, it met Aontas and the Community Education Network, CEN.  During these discussions and via the submissions received by the community sector as part of our consultation process on QQI's policy development programme, we had the opportunity to engage with the sector and understand further its concerns on a number of issues.  These included the charging of fees by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, the range of State funding streams upon which the sector is largely dependent and the concerns on the part of some community providers of the association of this funding with the requirement for learning to lead to qualifications and thus to a relationship with QQI.  While it would not be appropriate for Quality and Qualifications Ireland to express an opinion on the extent to which validation of programmes should remain a condition of public funding for the community sector, it is a discussion to which we would be very willing to contribute.<\/p><p> In addition to the challenges routinely faced by the community sector, in which training is often only one part of its service to the community, the shifting environment which all actors in education and training are facing is a further concern.  The further education and training environment has seen the establishment of the education and training boards into which F&Aacute;S training centres are being moved and SOLAS has been established.  The way in which all of this will impact on the community sector is unclear and will, I hope, become clearer in the further education and training strategy to be presented to the Minister for Education and Skills next month.<\/p><p> The establishment of Quality and Qualifications Ireland under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012 also constitutes change.  The legislation identifies that any provider of education and training programmes must be able to demonstrate the capacity to quality assure its provision and validate a programme before it is recognised by QQI.  Assured and consistent quality of education and training is, therefore, the objective that underpins QQI policy.  All providers will need to satisfy QQI that their capacity and quality assurance arrangements are appropriate to their provision.  Providers which made the transition to Quality and Qualifications Ireland from the organisations that amalgamated will thus need to have their quality assurance procedures approved by QQI.  In accordance with the extensive consultation process to which the organisation has committed, a Green Paper was published on this subject in May 2013.  A White Paper will be published for consultation shortly with the details of how we propose to undertake this re-engagement process.  The continued effectiveness of providers' agreed quality assurance arrangements will be monitored and externally reviewed by QQI.<\/p><p> In carrying out these legislative responsibilities, the first priority of Quality and Qualifications Ireland is to provide reasonable assurances to prospective and current learners, members of the public, society, employers and international parties regarding the quality of any provider that has access to the privilege of State awards.  In implementing this external role in the interests of public confidence, it would be neither feasible nor appropriate for QQI to provide support for individual providers to meet the quality assurance standard required.  Having completed this quality assurance transition process, Quality and Qualifications Ireland hopes to invest more of its time and resources in working collaboratively with agencies such as SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority on continually improving quality and facilitating providers to come together to share good practice and expertise.<\/p><p> The charging of fees to providers is enabled by the 2012 Act and is integrally linked with how Quality and Qualifications Ireland intends implementing its quality assurance and quality improvement role.  The development of adequate internal and external quality assurance systems incurs costs.  QQI has adopted a fee schedule in part on the basis of the cost of engaging with a provider.  Some of these costs are fixed, regardless of the scale of a provider's provision.  For example, sending a reviewer to visit a provider's facility incurs travel costs.  The current fee schedule has been developed for an initial number of agreed policies and will be extended as further policies are agreed through the comprehensive policy development programme.  The fees to date have been approved by the board of Quality and Qualifications Ireland, with the consent of the Departments of Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is important to note that from a learner perspective, a certification fee was previously applied by FETAC.  Where waivers of this fee were granted by FETAC, this practice has continued in Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  This has resulted in a blanket exemption in learner certification fees at levels 1 to 3 of the national framework of qualifications as well as exemptions for holders of medical cards and certain provider centres, including Youthreach and vocational training opportunities scheme centres.<\/p><p> The fee with the greatest impact for providers to date is related to programme validation.  To reduce costs, Quality and Qualifications Ireland is incentivising providers to make a number of applications for validation in one submission.  In addition to reducing costs, this aims to encourage providers to think strategically about their programme requirements over a longer period.<\/p><p> In imposing fees on providers, the principles of consistency and equity must also be applied.  Higher education providers were subject to fees by QQI's predecessor bodies.  In addition, within further education and training, private providers are offering the same programmes as those offered by some providers in the community sector.  These include qualifications in child care.  In the light of this, it would be inappropriate for Quality and Qualifications Ireland to determine a fee schedule which would subsidise one part of the education and training system over another.<\/p><p> This is the first time that any fee has been levied at providers in the further education and training sector by Quality and Qualifications Ireland or its predecessor body, FETAC.  In the context of the uncertainty the community sector is experiencing on a number of fronts, it is not surprising that it has reacted negatively to this development.  By their nature, community sector providers often have relatively small numbers of learners.  This is not a negative comment on the importance of the community sector to the individuals in question or the continued need for this provision.  However, it raises questions regarding the multiple small providers with which Quality and Qualifications Ireland is interacting in the community sector and the proliferation of quality assurance systems that will be operating to support this provision.  In 2012, approximately 150 providers categorised as \"community and voluntary\" sought certification for learners from Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  This represents 20% of all the providers in the further education and training sector for which QQI made awards in that year.  The number of learners for which certification was sought was approximately 5% of the number of certificates issued to learners across the further education and training sector. <\/p><p> With decreasing resources across the public sector, the 2012 ICTU report, Downsizing the Community Sector, makes an important reference to the sector working alongside public services in the face of the cumulative impact of cuts in spending.  In this regard, Quality and Qualifications Ireland would welcome the opportunity to work centrally with the ICTU community sector committee, Aontas or any other community sector representative body to establish the feasibility of providers reconfiguring themselves into networks or consortiums which could introduce and sustain quality assurance systems at this level, instead of allocating resources to the development, implementation and review of a multiplicity of quality assurance systems at an individual provider level.<\/p> <p>This would appear to be consistent with the view of Aontas, submitted to us as part of the consultation on our strategy statement, that collaborative linkages between providers and the sharing of good practice will be important.  The establishment of networks of providers may also provide an effective means of boosting the quality assurance capacity of the community and voluntary sector, increasing the level of quality assurance oversight within and external to the sector, and potentially reducing the overall cost of programme validation.  Such a reconfiguration would also require a discussion with SOLAS in the context of the statutory FET strategy and how it envisages the ongoing development of the community and voluntary sector.<\/p><p> QQI has undertaken in its strategy statement to carry out its regulatory and quality improvement functions collaboratively with providers and with Government agencies.  With the level of change being experienced by providers in the community and voluntary sector, we suggest that it is in the absolute interest of learners that the relevant parties would come together to constructively consider the impact of these changes in as comprehensive a manner as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Trish O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392816300,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Our final speaker is Ms Mary Doyle, on behalf of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900006#F00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392816300,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I am accompanied by my colleagues Mr. Brian Power and Mr. Hugh Geoghegan.  I will be as brief as possible.  We are glad to appear before the committee to discuss issues relating to the charging of fees by QQI.  I will focus on the reasons for the establishment of QQI, the roles of QQI and the Department and other issues which are relevant to further education and training.  As the committee will be aware, the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills wrote to the committee on 24 January 2014 providing information on this issue, and I will of necessity cover some of the same ground in my comments.<\/p><p>  QQI was established in November 2012 under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012.  That Act also provided for the dissolution of the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI.  QQI was given responsibility for the functions of those bodies across further and higher education and training, in addition to the external quality assurance function formerly carried out by the Irish Universities Quality Board, IUQB.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the amalgamation of these bodies into QQI was to bring greater coherence to the sector, creating a single body which can deliver a more efficient and integrated service and uphold quality and standards in Ireland's qualifications and educational institutions.  It is also important to bring a stronger focus to the creation of flexible pathways for learners.  As such, it is an important structural element of our education system, focusing on quality assurance.<\/p><p>  Since its establishment, QQI has been undertaking a comprehensive policy development programme involving structured consultation with relevant stakeholders, and I am aware that reference has been made to that consultation process in earlier interventions.  QQI has prioritised the development of its policies on initial access to validation, programme validation and fees.  In accordance with section 80 of the 2012 Act, QQI determined its fees and submitted them for the consent of the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The consent of those Ministers was conveyed to QQI in October 2013.<\/p><p>  FETAC, QQI's predecessor body in the further education and training sector, had approximately 1,000 registered providers to which it provided services and to which QQI continues to provide services.  It is considered unsustainable for QQI to continue to engage with such a large and growing number of providers in the further education and training sector without charging fees in respect of those services.  This is particularly the case given the reduced resources available to all public sector bodies.<\/p><p>  In this regard, I inform the committee of the reduction in resources available to QQI and its predecessor bodies in recent years.  In 2008, the NQAI, HETAC and FETAC together received total Exchequer funding of some &euro;14.4 million, of which approximately &euro;13 million related to current expenditure.  In 2013, QQI received Exchequer funding of &euro;6.4 million, representing a reduction of more than 50% in five years.  At the same time, QQI's staffing complement has decreased from more than 120 members of staff to 80.<\/p><p>  There is a significant amount of work involved in assessing applications from providers seeking access to QQI's awards, so that QQI can be assured that they meet its rigorous quality standards.  The purpose of those standards is to ensure that providers have the capacity to provide high-quality programmes of education and training to their learners.  The fees, therefore, underpin QQI's ability to ensure and monitor compliance with its standards.  Furthermore, the fees help to ensure that only those providers that are serious about complying with those standards apply to QQI.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that QQI's role is not to provide access to awards to all providers who wish to have such access.  The 2012 Act requires that quality assurance underpin the relationship between QQI and the providers with which it engages.  Therefore, QQI is statutorily charged with providing access to a range of quality-assured awards only to those providers that can demonstrate their ongoing capacity to assure and enhance the quality of the programmes of education they provide.<\/p><p>  It is open to organisations, including those in the community and voluntary sector, that find the revised arrangements put in place by QQI onerous to give consideration to working together.  This would allow them to share resources and expertise and thereby build the capacity to engage meaningfully with QQI.  Bodies wishing to have access to QQI awards could also seek to engage directly with providers which have themselves had programmes validated by QQI, including, for example, the new education and training boards which have been established through the amalgamation of the VECs.<\/p><p>  In addition, there is a wide range of other awarding bodies operating in Ireland, with awards which are recognised through the National Framework of Qualifications, which providers may seek to engage with in order to gain certification for their programmes of education and training.  <\/p><p>  I can assure the committee that the role played by the community and voluntary sector in providing training and educational opportunities to marginalised communities is both important and valued.  However, we must recognise that learners, particularly those who may be disadvantaged due to unemployment or who come from marginalised communities, deserve to be assured of the quality of the programmes they undertake and the awards they receive.  Given the establishment of QQI and the reforms taking place in the further education and training sector in general, it will be necessary for providers in this sector, including those in the community and voluntary sector, to work with QQI to ensure they continue to provide a high-quality offering to their learners.  <\/p><p>  Clearly, there is scope for further clarifications and discussion on this issue.  The Department would welcome these discussions taking place at an early date, particularly in the context of the emerging policy and provision landscape being developed in the further education and training sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1392816300,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and join with her in thanking the three delegations for appearing before the committee and putting in the preparatory work in terms of their presentations and the briefing documents supplied to the committee in advance.<\/p><p>  The key concern being outlined by ICTU is the potential impact of these fees on the availability of training programmes through the community and voluntary sector in particular.  As we are aware, they play a very important role in reaching people who might not otherwise have educational opportunities.  Perhaps I can put this question to ICTU.  Given that the schedule of fees is dated from October 2013, have community and voluntary organisations been charged fees at this point in time?  Are these fees in place and, if not, when are they likely to take effect?  I note that the fee for submission of quality assurance procedures for approval in respect of new providers is &euro;5,000 for further education and training programmes.  Is each community and voluntary organisation expected to pay that fee up-front to QQI?  I note also that for standard validation for further education and training courses the fee is either &euro;2,000 or &euro;1,000, depending on the type of course.  Annually, there is a continuing validation fee which is a minimum of &euro;1,500, according to the schedule of fees I have here.  That can rise to &euro;5,000.<\/p> <p>Will the community and voluntary organisations involved in providing further education courses be subject to those fees?  In terms of what it wants to achieve, what specifically does ICTU want us to endorse or what does it want us to ask of the Department and of QQI?  It has indicated there is an opportunity within the legislation for exemptions and for fees not to be applied.  Can the witnesses give us particular details on what ICTU wants in regard to how this can be implemented?<\/p><p> Ms Doyle outlined that previously, FETAC had 1,000 validated providers in the community, a significant number.  QQI has also outlined how funding has dropped to half of what it was.  The number of staff is also reduced to half of what it was.  Obviously, we do not want to see a drop or reduction in the end product in terms of availability of courses for the marginalised, particularly courses provided through the community and voluntary sector.  I have a question for all three groups, therefore.  The role of SOLAS in this regard is unclear, but the Department in particular may be able to give us more guidance on its role.  What role is SOLAS expected to play in terms of engaging with the 1,000 providers to try to ensure the courses and availability we have had in the past are not lost as a result of the significant fees being introduced for assuring and registering them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900006#F00500","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392816900,"counter":17,"content":"<p>My colleagues in QQI will correct me if I am wrong, but in regard to whether the fees are applicable currently, my understanding is that fees exist in a number of different respects.  The fees in respect of validation of new programmes which have been included in the common awards system are being applied currently and have been applied since October 2013.  I am sure committee members understand that in moving to this new competent award system - this is the core of the issue - providers must develop new programmes and these must be validated.  This is associated with the quality assurance, as mentioned by colleagues from QQI and the Department.  The validation fees are currently in place.  Therefore, a provider seeking to provide a training course in any area or level will be asked to pay a validation fee to have the programme validated.<\/p><p>  I understand the application of the changes in the fee structure for the issuing of certificates has been deferred by QQI until the beginning of July 2014.  We welcome that and would like to see the deferral sustained beyond that.  I will not comment on what I am not clear on, but I know that, as QQI mentioned, there is an option to introduce various other fee structures as part of the implementation of policy in a number of other areas.  I confirm that validation fees are currently in place.

It is part of the reality of the economic environment in which we live now that there is no longer something for nothing.  In a way, this is a question of equity and fairness.  If we say the community and voluntary sector has an important contribution to make, but on the other hand there are real obstacles to its financial viability, we must make some choices.  What we are saying, therefore, is that if we are including extra tiers of expense that this sector must sustain, there is a fundamental contradiction and we are undermining ourselves.<\/p><p>  What we would like to see for the sector is that the validation fees would be waived.  We would also like to see the application of certificate fees up to level 5 being waived.  I accept the point made that there are a large number of providers.  This is a function of the sector being in touch with its communities.  Many of these providers are community-based organisations.  Administratively, it would be easier for all of us if, for example, QQI had only ten training providers to deal with.  Financially and in every other way, this would make things a lot easier.  However, we must make provision for the fact there are so many groups.  We can look at it, and congress will do what it can in facilitating sharing in whatever way possible.  Trade unions themselves have concrete proposals to do precisely that and we would certainly add our voice to suggestions that this kind of sharing should take place in the community and voluntary sector.  Nevertheless, we feel the fees are an unwarranted burden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900007#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Vaughan"},{"type":"speech","time":1392816900,"counter":20,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked about SOLAS and the role it will play in bringing the various providers together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900007#G00500","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392816900,"counter":21,"content":"<p>In terms of the structure, the role of QQI relates to quality assurance of learning outcomes, the role of SOLAS relates to policy and strategy in the further education sector, and the role of the Higher Education Authority is similar, but in the area of higher education.

One of the major pieces of work that is ongoing is the development of the further education and training strategy.  This is the major work in regard to the design and development of the future of the further education sector, and QQI has a major part to play in this in the context of quality assurance.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy McConalogue that it is important that the end result does not result in a reduction of the education and training opportunities available to people, particularly in marginalised and disadvantaged communities.

It is important to set out in the strategy the key objectives for the future of the sector and to align and mobilise scarce resources.

Mr. Vaughan outlined one of the obstacles - the lack of multi-annual funding - which makes that particular goal more difficult.<\/p><p>  The other area to which both Ms O'Brien and Ms Doyle referred in their presentations was the possibility of individual providers networking.  While that sounds plausible, I am sure there are issues with it.  I was wondering if Mr. Vaughan could give us some information on the difficulties caused for individual providers due to the introduction of validation fees, whereby they essentially are forced into a situation where they are now networking.   I do not know what the particular problems would be for individual providers, but perhaps Mr. Vaughan could outline some of them.

We also have a large number of centres which are linked to providers.<\/p><p> Mr. Vaughan mentioned equity and fairness, which we consider very important and one of the principles in our fees policy.  We must also consider that in the wider sense of equity for private providers, some of whom are operating in the same area, and in terms of how we deal with higher education, which is all subject to fees.  We have to look at this from the perspective of quality assurance in order to fulfil our statutory functions.  We have to look at the whole system and all of the learners within the system.  We do not believe it appropriate for a quality assurance agency to have a starting point of the financial viability for a subsector within the wider system and for us to look at subsidising a subsector of that.<\/p><p>  In respect of the component piece and the strategic piece, I accept I was talking about a longer period of time.  Many providers in the past would have come with components of awards.  They would have come to validate one component, then another component and then another component at different times, instead of seeking validation of a bigger award, in which case they would be free to offer the components as part of that and potentially have learners on a piece whereby they could gather the components towards a major award.  What often happens is that learners in further education are moving from one provider to another, getting enough components together to have a major award.  We would contend that a provider might think further as to what it wants to offer a provider cohort, which is why we are trying to incentivise that a little.  If a provider were to take that route, the costs on the fee schedule would be significantly reduced.  I accept the financial viability element comes in for the long-term element, but if we take it objectively, this is our intention and our hope in trying to incentivise this.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is quite correct to state that there will be issues in respect of the networking element.  That is why we are hoping to engage with ICTU and Aontas after this to create a model of how it can be done.  It is very easy to say that providers should be formed into networks and consortia, but we have to ensure that we are developing a viable model for them to be able to do that and to meet our quality assurance standards, which is our starting point.

For public providers, the Oireachtas has determined that there will be fewer education and training boards.  The Oireachtas is currently debating the merger of institutes of technology to create technological universities, so consolidation can be imposed as a matter of public policy.  For the community and voluntary sector, it is not for the public authorities to determine how to get economies of scale, but it is a traditional part of the trade union movement to come together in solidarity and to share where possible.  Becoming a provider in a statutory sense incurs very serious responsibilities of scale that are different than what an individual local centre might want to take on.  As far as we can see, there is nothing incompatible in a number of individual local centres coming together to form a network or consortium that would then collectively assume the legal responsibilities that go with being a statutory provider and entering into a relationship with QQI.  If they do so, one of the advantages is that QQI can deal directly with the network representative, or the consortium leadership, however that is established.  It is not for us to prescribe the governance or the legal structure to underpin that, but they need to be sufficiently robust to enable the consortium to carry out its legal responsibilities and ensure that the learners get access to quality.<\/p><p>  It is not just a matter of making life easier for QQI.  It is a matter of trying to get the best scales for improving the quality and accountability of the sector.  This is a sector which historically did not have access to certification.

We understand and strongly support the idea of quality assurance procedures being in place.  Much of the conversation has been about a quality assurance, with perhaps an inference that the community and voluntary sector is not concerned about quality assurance, but I really think that is not the case.  We are talking about a different problem here, namely, how those providers are resourced and have the wherewithal to continue to deliver a quality assurance system in the services they provide.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputy for the question on issues arising from the networking.  Frankly, I am not 100% clear about what the problems would be because we dealing with disparate and different organisations which have different characteristics, although they all share the fact that they are in the community and voluntary sector.

There is scope for further dialogue.  Part of the way we address this may be to look for shared procedures or pooling resources and experience to the fullest extent possible.  However, I do not have the answers at the moment as to what the mechanisms are for how that might be achieved.  Within the structures there is provision for shared validation.  One provider can validate a programme and indicate others with whom it can be shared.  This is something trade unions have been using.  It is far more productive and efficient.  For example, we might work on one programme which the ICTU might submit to the system and we would indicate that Mandate, SIPTU, the Technical Engineering and Electrical Union, the Irish Bank Officials Association and so on will share in that validation.  I am a little unclear about the matter because we have not done it ourselves.  If an initial fee is paid I am unclear on whether the shared providers would have to pay a further additional fee.  If they did not, then within the existing procedure we might have a mechanism to address some of these concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900008#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Vaughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392818100,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Brien sought clarification on a question but I cannot remember what it was.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900009#J00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1392818100,"counter":29,"content":"<p>It was about networking.

I am joined by Mr. Gary &Oacute; Donnchadha, deputy chief inspector; Dr. Suzanne Dillon, assistant chief inspector and head of our evaluation and research unit; and Ms Emer Egan and Ms Doreen McMorris, assistant chief inspectors who each manage one of the inspectorate regions where most of our evaluation and inspection work is carried out.<\/p><p>  I propose to focus on the main issues arising from the report.  A particularly strong theme is the very significant changes that have taken place in the way we inspect schools.  Rather than inspect all schools in exactly the same way, as we did in the past, we have, in the period covered by the report, developed different models of inspection.  These range from short unannounced inspections that take less than a day to inspections where we focus on a particular subject or theme through to much more intense and lengthier models whereby we examine the whole workings of a school.  Using this range of inspection types has allowed us to inspect a greater number of schools more frequently.  An inspection of some sort took place in half of all primary schools in the 2010 to 2012 period covered by the report.  In the same period we carried out some form of inspection in 93% of secondary schools.  Having a range of inspection reports means that we can target a proportion of the more detailed inspections in schools where an earlier visit or inspection showed some cause for concern.<\/p><p>  A second point to highlight is that we have changed the focus of the inspections.  They are now much more concentrated on observing teaching and learning in classrooms and providing feedback for individual teachers and the principal.  We do not seek to examine all aspects of the work of the school.  Instead, we concentrate on asking questions and examining evidence on how well the school is run and the quality of the teaching and learning.  We collect evidence about the general standards we see, which has enabled us to present that information in a systematic way via the report.  We include information on standards in teaching, learning and the management of schools.  Moreover, we have combined these data with national and international data from surveys in which Ireland has participated.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to say the inspections we conducted between 2010 and 2012 generally show a positive picture for most schools.  At a time when the education system was facing a considerable challenge, we found that the majority of schools were well run by their boards of management, which are staffed by volunteers.  Many schools provided good leadership; most teachers were working effectively and students' learning was generally satisfactory.  However, we also identified areas of weakness.  For example, we saw unsatisfactory practice in a significant minority of individual lessons.  Specifically, between 10% and 15% of the lessons we observed in unannounced inspections at primary and post-primary level were categorised as unsatisfactory.  We raised particular concerns about the teaching of Irish at both primary and post-primary levels, the language competence of teachers in Irish in a small minority of cases and the teaching of mathematics at post-primary level.  We have detailed these concerns in the report and the briefing notes circulated to members and will be happy to discuss them further.<\/p><p>  An objective we had for the period 2010 to 2012 was to incorporate the views of parents and students into inspections in a much clearer and more robust way.  A large sample of students and parents now complete confidential questionnaires during the time we conduct a whole-school inspection.  These give us very detailed information on a range of aspects of the work of the school which we include in the report.  We found a very positive view among parents of the quality of the schooling their children received.  More than 97% of the 47,000 parents included in the surveys of primary schools were of the view that the teaching their child was receiving was good.  Some 87% of the 20,000 parents surveyed at post-primary level were likewise satisfied with the teaching their child received.  However, the data also raised questions for schools regarding their communication with parents, its effectiveness and otherwise, especially on how anti-bullying measures were communicated to parents and students.<\/p><p>  All of the statistical data from the confidential questionnaires are fed back to schools and we encourage them to examine the information in detail and reflect on the message it contains for the school and its teachers.  That is what good self-evaluation is all about.  Effective organisations, be they schools, hospitals, voluntary organisations or businesses, must always be asking questions about how well they are conducting their core business and searching for ways to improve.  Traditionally, schools have not been doing this to the extent we would like.  That is why we are encouraging self-evaluation to complement inspection.  Inspection provides a necessary external perspective on the work of a school, but it must be balanced by good thinking within the school if improvements are to be achieved.  We have published self-evaluation guidelines to help schools to do this.  Between November 2012 and January 2014 we made advisory workshop visits to more than 4,000 primary and post-primary schools to encourage that process.<\/p><p>  My final point relates to our own role and functions.<\/p> <p>We are no different from schools or other organisations.  We know we have to change and continue to improve if we are to remain effective.  We introduced follow-up inspections to ensure the recommendations we make are actually implemented by schools.  The details of these are included in the report.<\/p><p> We have developed a number of further initiatives to improve how we inspect schools and provide better reports for parents and schools.  We are examining how to involve students more fully in the inspection process.  We have begun to conduct pilot post-evaluation surveys among teachers and principals - to begin with - in which they are asked about how well we conduct inspections and advisory work within their schools.  We will extend these surveys to boards of management and parents' councils.  We hope the feedback we will receive will help us in improving the way we inspect and evaluate schools.  We are learning many lessons from our participation in North-South projects conducted in conjunction with the inspectorate in Northern Ireland and also from work in which we have been involved at OECD level on inspection and quality systems across schools.<\/p><p> I hope my comments will be of assistance to the committee in its discussions.  We will be happy to discuss the issues to which I have referred or any other matter to which members may wish to refer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900012#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Harold Hislop","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392820500,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Given that they will be obliged to leave soon, I will take contributions from the Senators present because I understand they have to be elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900013#N00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1392820500,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Hislop for his presentation.

Will they expand on the position on self-evaluation?  I was a teacher for many years and witnessed what happened in school and subject evaluations.  Schools are notified of evaluations perhaps three or four weeks before they occur.  All normal activity stops in order that everything can be made ready.  Floors that were never previously mopped are suddenly cleaned.  Everything is made rosy for the arrival of the inspectors.  In the light of the huge competition in the context of the points race for third level and self-evaluation, every school will naturally want to provide the best impression possible.  In that context, it is welcome that the inspectorate is introducing confidential questionnaires for parents and pupils.  It is extremely important for students that the process in this regard remain confidential.  There should be a similar process for teachers in order that they might comment on things that are happening on a confidential basis.  I would love this to be implemented.  Naturally, teachers can be afraid to come forward.<\/p><p>  The concept of follow-up inspections to which Dr. Hislop referred is brilliant.  How effective have such inspections proved to be and what percentage of schools of schools have followed up on recommendations made by the inspectorate?<\/p><p>  As I live near the Border, I am, therefore, interested in the North-South aspect.  I conducted some thesis research on the subject I taught, music.  That research contemplated music technology and the quality of the teaching of the subject, North and South.

Earlier today the Seanad engaged in a debate on the importance of the Teaching Council of Ireland.

I presume inspections took place, but we never saw those responsible for carrying them out.<\/p><p>  On discipline and anti-bullying initiatives, I have been contacted by many individuals who have informed me that they would rather transfer their children to different schools than deal with the problem of bullying head on.  They reported that their children were being bullied but no action was taken.  I asked whether they would report the teachers involved and they informed me that they would not because their children would be victimised.  I am aware of numerous instances in which people transferred their children to different schools.

What lessons have been learned from the experience in Northern Ireland and will Dr. Hislop provide one or two examples in this regard?  <\/p><p>  In the context of what Senator Mary Moran stated, why are there so few inspections of the teaching of the arts?  Some 783 inspections took place of the teaching of Irish, 700 of English and 800 of mathematics.  We are very far behind the curve in the development of drama and music as core curriculum subjects in both primary and secondary schools.  What is the standard in the inspections carried out in schools of the teaching of drama and the visual arts?  How does Dr. Hislop feel about the fact that we still cannot get matters right in respect of either Irish or mathematics?  Where problems arise, they do so in the case of these subjects.<\/p><p>  The report is brilliant, but it shows up major communication discrepancies with regard to parental involvement in the choosing of subjects for the leaving certificate examination.  When parents were asked a question on whether schools regularly sought their views on school matters, 32% indicated that they disagreed, while 24% responded that they did not know.  This means that 56% were not in agreement, which is very serious.  When asked whether schools' parents' associations kept them informed, some 28% of parents indicated that they disagreed, while 20% responded that they did not know.  That means that some 48% were in disagreement.  Only 58% of students indicated that they had received helpful advice from teachers at key transition points in their school careers, which means that 42% had not received such advice.  That is a serious problem, particularly as such advice can set students on a particular path.  The report states, \"Overall, one of the weakest areas of teachers' practice was their use of assessment ... and their efforts to differentiate the teaching and learning activities to suit varying learning needs and abilities of students\".  Will Dr. Hislop comment on this matter?<\/p><p>  I am particularly concerned about the arts in education.  We consistently capitulate on the teaching of the arts, although I accept the importance of teaching the three Rs.<\/p> <p>However, that is done to the detriment of developing drama, language, literacy and oracy skills.  I do not mean that all students should take part in a school play; rather, I mean the idea of oracy, expression, orality and movement.

Both Senators mentioned the notice period for inspections.  In the course of the preparation of the report we substantially cut the notice period.  Traditionally, virtually all inspections were notified, but we have now introduced unannounced inspections.  The majority of the inspections are unannounced.  The announced ones are very short ones generally.  We have also used them not only for single-day visits to primary and post-primary schools but where there are high categories of risk for students.  Inspections of high-support units and special care units for children, for instance, are unannounced visits even though they are more detailed inspections.  However, there are times when notice needs to given of an inspection.  We have cut the notice given, but if we were to meet a board of management, which is made up of volunteers, it would be necessary to give some notice.  If we were to meet a focus group of parents we would need to give them reasonable notice in order to meet them and talk to them at length.  We would want to meet most members of the board of management, if possible, during an inspection and a reasonable number of the members of a focus group of parents.  There is a balance to be struck here having regard to the advantages of the authenticity of an unannounced inspection, where we see what life is really like on the day we arrive, and that has been a really important part of our inspection processes in the last three years.  Although teachers initially reacted against it, to some extent, they prefer it because it is less stressful for them too.  It is less stressful waiting for the inspection if one knows there is going to be one.  Having very large numbers of unannounced inspections allowed us to go into schools and see the reality of what is happening there and then make a choice as to whether we think there is something that requires a deeper investigation with a longer inspection model.  Quite a proportion of the announced inspections are arising and being planned because we have seen something that has worried us at an earlier unannounced visit.  Combining the two processes is useful for us.<\/p><p>  A question was asked about student questionnaires and teacher questionnaires.  The student questionnaires and the parent questionnaires have been successful for us.  They are confidential.  They are read mechanically and the data are provided back in statistical form to both the inspection team and the parents.  We have started to experiment with teacher questionnaires as well.  I will ask Dr. Suzanne Dillon to explain what is involved there.  We have put them in on a pilot basis only because we are doing work to get the questions right and to get at the issues that are most useful in those questionnaires.<\/p><p>  Follow-up inspections were also mentioned.  They take place with only a day's or two days' notice.  A telephone call would be made to say that we want to see the principal, perhaps the senior management of the school or the chairperson or the board of management plus the principal.  We need to give at least a day or a day and a half's notice of that.  We have been pleased with the results.  The years 2012 and 2013 were the first years we have been doing these systematically.  In general, we found that of the recommendations we had made in earlier reports - based on a sample of a number of hundreds - between 80% and 90% of them had been fully or partially addressed by the school.  That is quite a high proportion.  This was done at time when follow-up inspections were not expected.  We found that once we started these inspections the school authorities said they knew we would be back or the chances were that we would be back.  That has made people sharpen up.  Perhaps Dr. Suzanne Dillon would like to add a further comment on the teacher questionnaires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900014#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Harold Hislop"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392821100,"counter":105,"content":"<p>There is not an awful lot more to add other than that we are piloting them.

Through the pilot phase we have revised the question set, and starting in February we are running a new set of questions.

Perhaps the best way can answer that in the short time available is to explain how we go about that.  We have a close association with the Education and Training Inspectorate, ETI,  in the North.  That association has been built up over a number of years.  We work with it in a number of ways.  Since 2008 we have engaged in exchanges with the inspectorate in the North.  By an exchange I mean that one of our people goes to the North and accompanies or shadows an inspector in the North and learns how they go about their business because they are doing the same job, albeit using different approaches.  We find that hugely valuable and we have covered a number of different subject areas over the years since 2008 and also broader areas such as leadership, management and so on.  In return a Northern inspector comes here and accompanies our inspectors.  We also engage in joint inspections with inspectors in the North.  For example, we have inspected a centre for autism in recent years, and a report was published to which our inspectors contributed.  We have engaged also in projects such as Dissolving Boundaries, of which members may have heard.  That involved a good deal of joint inspection work with our people.  Most recently, we have had an inspector from the North work with us here in a further education college, an agricultural college.  We are examining how we can use our links with the inspectorate in the North to meet skills gaps on either side within the inspectorate.  As our people work closely with the inspectors in the other jurisdiction we learn of other ways of doing the same work.  We find it very useful and our experiences have led the chief inspectorate to commit to participating in similar engagements with the inspectorate in Scotland and Wales.  We are building on the successful experience we have had.  We have regular communications a few times a year at senior management level in the two inspectorates.  We have joint meetings - the most recent one was in Dublin - where members of the management of the Northern inspectorate come down and meet us.  It took place on 22 January, if I have the date right.  They have also attended our annual conference.  We have had exchanges at various continuing professional development activities for inspectors.  For example, the Gaeltacht course we provide for our inspectors has involved inspectors from the North.  It is by those means that we try to learn as much as we can from what happens in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900014#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Doreen McMorris"},{"type":"speech","time":1392821100,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Hislop have a further comment to add?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900014#O00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392821100,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Two Senators raised the issue of anti-bullying measures, and I would like if we might address those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900014#O00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Harold Hislop"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392821100,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I will address those.  The report shows quite a few findings that are of concern in regard to bullying.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the most striking one is the very high proportion of parents who indicate that they do not know whether they are happy with how schools deal with bullying.  That is to a level of 25%<b><\/b>at both primary and post-primary level.  We find out about bullying when we go into schools in a number of ways.  We obviously use questionnaires but we also raise issues around bullying at meetings and in the course of the inspection activity while inspectors are in the school.  Building on what is in the report that covered the period to 2012, which members have, we have made some changes to the questionnaire.  Since January of this year we have focused the questions around bullying in a clearer way so that in future inspections we will get even better information on how parents and students consider the school to be performing on bullying and discipline and how safe students are in school.<\/p><p> Members will be aware that within the last year the Minister has implemented new procedures for schools in terms of anti-bullying policies.  The requirements for schools in that regard will be part of our inspection processes as we move forward.  Schools are expected to have procedures in place by the end of this term that are similar to the child protection policy.  This whole area of bullying is one around which none of us can be in any way complacent.  The TIMMS survey does show that Ireland has a lower incidence of bullying than comparable countries.  That is something to bear in mind when we look at the issues around bullying in schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900014#O00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Doreen McMorris","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392821700,"counter":112,"content":"<p>One of the interesting things from the pupil questionnaires and student questionnaires is the extent to which Irish students feel safe in schools.  There are very high percentages there &ndash; often over 90%.  What is really interesting is when the questionnaire data comes in for an individual school, if that is significantly lower than we would expect normally, we would immediately say to the school that it might think it is dealing well with bullying but there is clear evidence that it needs to go back and go through its anti-bullying lessons and make sure that children know who to talk to and who to report bullying to.  It can be quite a shock sometimes for a school because when we interview those involved they say the school has an excellent anti-bullying policy and it is doing an excellent job on that but when we get the data they throw up a completely different set of questions.<\/p><p>  The issue of school self-evaluation was raised by Senator Moran.  I will ask Mr. &Oacute; Donnchadha to talk about it in a bit more detail.  Self-evaluation is very much a process that is owned by the school itself.  It is a whole attitude of asking questions about how one is doing one&rsquo;s own work internally as a group of teachers, a principal and a board, and if they are doing the job they should be doing and getting the best results for the children.  Very often, what we see is that schools traditionally have not been asking those hard questions of themselves.  We can come and ask the hard questions as an external set of eyes, and it is really important that we do that, but the change will happen if schools own the change and want to make the change.  If they can identify areas in which they are strong or weak and they tackle the weaknesses then one has an organisation that is on the move.  That is what self-evaluation is about.<\/p><p>  Senator Moran made a very good point about the public nature of that and the competition that schools face.  The published report, or the report that is public, is not the most important part; it is the honest questions that the schools ask internally and the data they look at.  Mr. &Oacute; Donnchadha can talk about the data in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900015#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Harold Hislop"},{"type":"speech","time":1392821700,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Do parents get to see the self-evaluation report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900015#P00300","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392821700,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900015#P00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Harold Hislop"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392821700,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Moran for raising the issue.  She had an eye to the future.  A really robust quality assurance system must have both effective mechanisms within the school or organisation and robust mechanisms outside such as can be provided by external inspection.  That is why since 2012 we have been investing a lot of effort in giving schools the tools for effective and robust self-review.  We have launched very detailed guidelines and a standard cycle for reviewing teaching and learning in all schools, and we took a decision to invest some of our own inspection time in improving skills in the system with regard to school self-evaluation.  Between November 2012, when we started on school self-evaluation, and now, we have visited 3,700 of the 4,000 schools in the system to speak directly to every teacher about school self-evaluation, because early on the school principals said to us in consultation that they are the converted.  Embedding high-quality, robust self-evaluation requires that every teacher understands the concept and knows where to access the tools, and that there is a buy-in to the school's engagement with us.  We have conducted universal coverage of the school system to make sure there is no doubt in the system that we have an expectation that effective school self-evaluation will be commenced in schools.  It will take time because this has to embed itself in the management, organisation and life of the school itself.  We envisage that in the next four, five or six years the balance between external inspection and the internal quality review - the school looking at its own assessment, outcomes data and practice - will work towards a complementary quality assurance mechanism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900015#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary &Oacute; Donnchadha"},{"type":"speech","time":1392821700,"counter":116,"content":"<p>None of my questions has been answered so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900015#P00600","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392821700,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I will respond to the questions about arts education.

That arises for a number of reasons, partly because it has not been an issue that has been treated in a great deal of depth in the initial teacher education to date.  More recently, it has become a more important part of the teacher education programmes.  The Teaching Council has been overseeing the implementation of those in the colleges of education and in university education departments, but it has not been a major aspect of the courses.  While teachers have used standardised and other tests that have been made available to them, we see them getting little or limited information to inform their teaching.  They administer the tests and record test results but there has not been a systematic practice of examining the assessment data as to what that means for the way they should change teaching and learning.  That is what we are trying to get them to do in the self-evaluation process.

I spoke previously with the chief inspector about the teaching of the Irish language.  I know it has been addressed already and, unfortunately, we have to rush now and therefore we will not get to have the discussion I was hoping to have.<\/p><p>  Everybody is happy with the boards of management process in that it is acceptable and it works but where a difficulty arises or a parent has a problem with a board of management, does the inspectorate have a role in that regard?  From what I can see the process seems to involve going around in circles from the board to the patron but the Department is keen to wash its hands of it.  Everything is devolved, but it has also absolved everybody of their responsibility.  I am curious to know the role of the inspectorate in regard to boards of management.  Has Dr. Hislop dealt with complaints from parents about decisions by boards of management?  Does he have a function in that area?<\/p><p>  Related to that is the role of the Ombudsman for Children.  I discovered recently that almost half of the 9,000 complaints to the ombudsman related to education.  Does the inspectorate have a connection with the ombudsman or an input in that?  Is there a two-way feeding system, so to speak, between the ombudsman and the inspectorate to address issues that arise?<\/p><p>  The chief inspector mentioned twice the voluntary aspect of boards of management, which I accept and we all appreciate, but it is not a reason for having a hands-off approach, especially with the way boards have been in the news of late in terms of transparency and openness, and challenging boards.  Teaching teachers is very important, and boards have a huge role to play in the educational well-being of any school and the population of that school.  However, there is a huge appetite among parents with children in the school, and I know not all board members are parents, to contribute to the school, and people are willing to come on board in that regard.  We can sometimes take a hands-off approach because it is voluntary.<\/p><p>  On teaching the teachers, do the witnesses have an input into courses such as instructional leadership - they may not even be aware of them - carried out formerly by the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA, now the Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI?  Do they have an input into the training of teachers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900016#Q01000","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392822300,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I will work from the bottom of my list of questions if I may.  The instructional leadership programme has begun in many of what were the Cork vocational educational committees.  We have had close links with it and some inspectors are involved in both the programme itself and helping to support that programme.  While we do not run it we are very much aware of it, and we see the good outcomes of it in the leadership skills it gives to principals in many schools.  It has done some very good work.  Some of us would have spoken at some of their conferences and training programmes at different times in the past.<\/p><p>  The leadership of the school is a critical factor in the quality of the self-evaluation and the attitude to improving.  The implementation of the curriculum in general is dependent on the attitude of the principal of the school.  We spend quite a lot of time in inspections as well looking at the quality of that leadership, asking the right questions and prompting that leadership to move on and to challenge the work that leader is doing but also the work they are doing with their teachers.<\/p><p>  On the voluntary nature of the boards of management, I mentioned that because people who serve on boards of management do extraordinary public service.<\/p> <p>They operate and run the system without the local education authorities that would exist in many other countries.  That therefore is the reason that when we evaluate the work, we are conscious they are volunteers with different sets of skills, some having very rich skill sets and others having more limited skill sets.  There are training programmes which the management authorities provide, paid for by the Department, to help upskill those people.  However, this does not obviate the need for the board to actually run the school.  We are absolutely clear on that.  We make our judgments on how effectively the school is run and how effectively the board is carrying out its duties.  Some of these are down to setting and signing off on general policy and making sure they are implemented.  However, in self-evaluation we perceive a really important role for the board to want to know from the principal and senior teachers what are the results the children are getting in the school concerned.  Questions such as whether the children are getting better, whether there are categories of students who are doing well or not doing well, what groups within the huge population that can be in a secondary school actually are making progress or what percentages of students are taking higher level rather than ordinary level are legitimate questions for a board to ask.  Moreover, it can be really important support for the principal if the board is seen to ask those questions and to be interested in them.<\/p><p> Deputy McConalogue also asked about the numbers of inspections and self-evaluation and if I might ask Mr. Gary &Oacute; Donnchadha to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900016#Q01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Harold Hislop","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392822900,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Briefly, the Deputy asked about the number of inspectors and so on and whether our capacity was sufficient.  Like all other public services, we certainly were affected by reductions in our numbers.  Our numbers fell from approximately 166 staff towards the end of the noughties down to 116 staff.  While there was quite a substantial drop, our focus was on getting the highest impact from the staff resource we had.  Many of the reforms about which members read in the chapter in the chief inspector's report on the reconfiguration of our inspection have pertained to getting the highest impact we can from the available staff resources.  Fortunately, our numbers have risen a little with the sanction we have received lately for recruitment and at present, our staff number is approximately 124 inspectors.<\/p><p>  I mentioned the school self-evaluation initiative earlier and we took a decision to scale down slightly whole school evaluations.  Consequently, our numbers at primary level are slightly down in order to be able to cover all 3,300 primary schools with a school self-evaluation support visit.  However, these numbers will come back up again in future years.  The other point members will note in the report is that through using this blend of unannounced visits and whole school evaluations, we have a much higher footprint in schools than we have ever had.  Our current rate of coverage is approximately one in six years at primary level and one in two to three years at post-primary level, which constitutes a significant improvement on the coverage we were able to get in previous years when we were relying simply on a whole school inspection model to try to cover the country.  This twin-track approach of coverage on the one hand and targeting resources using short-form inspections is working very well for us to get coverage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900017#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary &Oacute; Donnchadha"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392822900,"counter":136,"content":"<p>If I may, I will address the questions raised by Deputy McConalogue regarding continuing professional development, CPD, for teachers and the junior cycle.  The Minister's decisions to implement the new junior cycle framework and the roll-out of the individual subject have of course created a big demand for teacher in-service training.  Most such training will be focused, in the second and third years of it, on the assessment.  That is the design of the in-service training that has been worked out.  The initial sessions for teachers in the year prior to the implementation of each subject mainly pertain to the content of the syllabus but those sessions in year one and year two, as assessment becomes a reality for teachers, are mainly about assessment.  Where they are into the first year of roll-out but prior to the second year, when assessment by teachers will take place, that year's in-service training will be mainly about the skills of assessment.  These skills, which will be transferable to CPD, also will be bolstered by the guides to assessment produced by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, that is, by the resource pack of assessment materials the NCCA would produce.  Moreover, the State Examination Commission, SEC, will continue to produce the examination paper for use at the end, as well as the marking schemes.  Unlike many countries that simply transferred completely to a teacher-based assessment model, the decision here appears to have been a much more nuanced one.  While we are moving to a much more teacher-based assessment, it is being supported and framed much more comprehensively than many other countries would have done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900017#R00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Harold Hislop"},{"type":"speech","time":1392822900,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I must stop Dr. Hislop there, as another meeting has been scheduled for this room.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900017#R00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1392822900,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Before the meeting concludes, may I have an answer to my question on special education?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900017#R00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1392822900,"counter":139,"content":"<p>While the witnesses may respond to that question, they might revert to the Deputies and Senators in respect of any outstanding issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014021900017#R00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392822900,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I will make one comment in respect of special educational needs, because this is an important question.

The committee has played and will continue to play a valuable role in considering the public service reform agenda which is very much at the heart of what we want to do as a Government.  That is why I wrote to the Chairman to ask for an opportunity to present the documents to the committee.<\/p><p>  I propose to brief the committee on the progress made in implementing reforms and also to set out our plans for further public service reform in the coming years.  Unlike the private sector where demand for goods and services falls during a recession, the demands on public services have increased in recent years.  It is important to underscore these issues.  For example, the numbers in receipt of social welfare payments increased by some 260,000, or 18 %, between 2008 and 2012; there are approximately 500,000 more medical card holders now than in 2008; in acute hospitals the number of day cases increased by 92.5 % in the ten years to 2012; and last year there were nearly 49,000, or 6 %, more children in schools than in 2009.  While meeting these increased demands, staff numbers in the public service have been reduced by more than 30,000 since 2008.  The public service pay bill fell from &euro;17.5 billion in 2009 at its peak to &euro;14.1 billion last year.  Longer working hours, new rosters and standardised arrangements for annual leave and sick leave have been introduced and we have also been removing barriers to the redeployment of staff to priority areas across the public service.  We have had more movement than at any time in our history.  That this has been achieved in an environment of industrial peace is testament to the patriotic resolve of the public service.<\/p><p>  Of course, we still face challenges.  We will borrow &euro;8 billion this year.  Reforming public services is a critical component in meeting these challenges.  Effective public governance can also contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and the attractiveness of its business environment for investment and the important issue of employment creation.<\/p> <p>Last month I forwarded a copy of our new reform plan for 2014 to 2016 to each Member of the Oireachtas.  I also circulated a copy of the progress report on the Government&rsquo;s first reform plan, which was published in November 2011.  I will give a few examples of the progress made since that time.  PeoplePoint, the Civil Service-wide human resources and pensions shared services centre, has been operational since March of last year.  It now serves more than 24,000 employees across 19 organisations.  When it becomes fully operational in January 2015 it will provide services to 40 organisations, with estimated savings of &euro;12.5 million annually.  We are implementing a radical overhaul of our approach to public procurement.  Spokespersons have debated the issue on many occasions during Question Time, with a target of &euro;500 million in procurement savings over the next three years, including a target of &euro;127 million this year.  An action plan to deliver efficiencies in the State&rsquo;s extensive property portfolio is currently being implemented.  We have issued more than 500,000 public services cards.  The cards are currently being used for social welfare payments and the free travel scheme, and we are considering extension of the card to cover a greater range of services.<\/p><p> The office of the Government chief information officer has been established within my Department to maximise the potential benefits of digitisation in delivering services and information.  We have made strong progress on this agenda already.  The Government services portal <i>www.gov.ie<\/i>now includes quick links to more than 400 information and transaction services online.  A series of public expenditure reforms have been implemented to bring greater structure, scrutiny and openness to budgeting, and we are making good progress in implementing our programme of political and legislative reform, aimed at enhancing openness, transparency and accountability.<\/p><p> The new public service reform plan outlines the key reform initiatives that will be implemented over the next three years.  It also addresses the broader ambition for reform between now and 2020.  Part of our thinking in producing a second plan is to embed the idea of reform within the system.  Reform is not a journey with an absolute beginning and end.  Rather, it needs to become a cultural tenet of the public service, where improvement, innovation and value for money are always on the agenda.  Central to that is the development of a proactive management and leadership culture within the service.  Four key themes run through the new reform plan: delivery of improved outcomes; utilisation of the reform dividend; digitisation and open data; and openness and accountability.<\/p><p> The previous phase of reform had a necessarily strong focus on reducing the cost of delivering public services.  The next phase of reform will continue that work but it will have a greater focus on the delivery of improved outcomes for service users.  That will include using alternative models of service delivery by commissioning for specific outcomes, more digital delivery of services, and service delivery improvements at sectoral and organisational levels.  As part of an increased focus on the needs of service users, we are considering innovative approaches, from social impact investing to funding services in return for delivering specified outcomes.  We need to measure the impact of public spending in deciding how and whether we fund those services.  Of course, moving to alternative methods of service provision does not alter the fact that the Government is accountable to the public for the overall performance of a service, deciding how and to what extent services are funded, and in regulating the behaviour of service providers.<\/p><p> Public service organisations must also improve how they consult with their customer bases to identify areas where priority action is required to enhance service delivery and to ensure that information and transactions are more readily accessible.  As well as centrally driven initiatives, many of the service improvements will be seen at organisational level, where most interaction with the State takes place.<\/p><p> As well as changing how we deliver public services, we will continue to focus on increasing efficiency and productivity.  This productivity has been critical to achieving our saving targets to date but also in freeing up resources to meet the challenges facing the public service, as I set out at the start of my contribution.  To give just a few examples: The creation of a new single payroll shared service centre for the Civil Service, which is currently under way, will consolidate and integrate payroll processes and practices from 18 to three payroll centres.  There will be one service in three locations.  It will deliver an estimated &euro;5.6 million in annual savings.  There will be more efficient and effective public procurement, with targeted savings of more than &euro;500 million over the next three years.  The implementation of the Government&rsquo;s property management action plan will deliver efficiencies and a more integrated approach to the management of the State&rsquo;s extensive property portfolio.  The Haddington Road agreement will act as a key enabler for the delivery of this next phase of the Government&rsquo;s reform programme.  The agreement will deliver an additional &euro;1 billion reduction in the cost of the public service pay and pensions bill by 2016.  The agreement also provides for a total of 15 million additional working hours annually across all sectors of the public service.  Every euro saved is a euro we do not have to remove from front-line services.<\/p><p> Under the new reform plan, the reform agenda will be about protecting and improving public services, and over the period of this plan, there will be an emphasis on saving to invest.  This reform dividend will underpin and help sustain the reform agenda beyond the current fiscal crisis.<\/p><p> In recent years, the introduction of consumer technology has spread throughout businesses, homes, schools and other public service organisations.  The public service must embrace that and make maximum use of digitisation and open data to deliver services and information in innovative ways.  A new Government ICT strategy will be published later this year that will address the use of new and emerging technologies, ensuring that e-Government is designed around real needs and taking steps to improve the take-up of digital government.  We already have a strong record in that regard.  As part of the new strategy, we have captured data on the top transactional services on which the citizen engages with the State.  That will help to inform what further services we should put online.  We will also bring forward legislation to govern the circumstances under which data can be legitimately and securely shared, to ensure that citizens are not repeatedly asked for information that is already held in other parts of the public service system.<\/p><p> Citizens must be able to clearly see that the public service is working fairly in its decision making, in implementing policy and in delivering public services.  We will continue to implement our legislative programme to improve public governance and rebuild public trust in the administrative and political branches of the State.  This will include: the enactment and implementation of a reformed Freedom of Information Act, which is moving to Report Stage in the House shortly; the enactment and implementation of legislation to protect whistleblowers, which is also before the D&aacute;il - I expect to complete Second Stage tomorrow depending on the number of speakers that offer - having secured passage through the Seanad; participation in the , which I mentioned previously, with a strong emphasis on the economic potential of open data; the introduction and implementation of lobbying regulation; the continuation of the comprehensive programme of statute law revision; and further strengthening of the ethical framework for office holders and public servants following the publication of the Moriarty and Mahon tribunal reports, underpinned by legislation.<\/p><p> Nor should we overlook the Constitutional Convention.  This innovative approach to public policy reform will see this Government present to the people the most radical suite of reform to the Constitution in the State&rsquo;s history.  While the people will, in their wisdom, make the ultimate decisions, it is important that their stamp will be borne on the State&rsquo;s institutions.  Last month, I published a consultation paper on strengthening Civil Service accountability and performance.  I regard the matter as of particular importance.  That is why I separated it from the reform agenda that I published a week later.  This extensive public consultation will assess how greater clarity, certainty and common understanding on the key issue of who is accountable to whom and for what in the Civil Service.  An independent panel on accountability has been established to oversee the consultation process and to develop recommendations for me by the end of May.  In recent years, we have introduced a suite of reforms to improve how we manage public expenditure - to deliver greater transparency, to enhance efficiency and to ensure that the public finances remain on a sustainable course into the future.<\/p><p> Every day, civil servants deliver many complex roles, including advising on key policies, implementing major projects and programmes, delivering front-line services, representing Ireland&rsquo;s interests abroad, and supporting and directing the wider public service.<\/p> <p>We should also acknowledge the role played by the Civil Service in securing the continuity of the State during the difficult times we have endured in the past five years.  Our Civil Service renewal programme will ensure the Civil Service is a strong and capable organisation equipped to address current and future challenges, with a workforce that has the skills, capacity and tools to meet these challenges effectively.  As part of the programme, we are looking at a range of areas where capacity and capability need to be developed to meet the challenges we will face in the future.  These include leadership; change management; policy formation; and implementation.  In the coming months views will be sought from inside and outside the system on what the Civil Service does well and what needs to change to participate in the renewal process.  As well as participating in the consultation process online, a series of &quot;town hall&quot; meetings are taking place across the country to seek the input and ideas of civil servants, of all grades and levels, as we develop our vision for the Civil Service to meet Ireland&rsquo;s needs into the future.<\/p><p> We have made good progress in implementing our expenditure reform programme.  For example, the performance budgeting initiative has resulted in more timely and higher quality information being made available to support decision-making and allows the Oireachtas and members of the public to more closely view the relationship between Government objectives, budgets, performance and outcomes.  This year <i>IrelandStat <\/i>- the citizen-focused public service performance information website - is being extended to all Departments and offices.  This shows what the Government has achieved, what it did to deliver on these achievements, what it cost and how Ireland compares with other countries.  <\/p><p> In delivering reform we will continue to ensure strong implementation and governance structures, which were an important element of the first reform programme.  The Cabinet committee on public service reform will continue to provide strategic direction and hold senior managers to account for the delivery of reform.  Each Department and office also developed its own integrated reform delivery plans, based on the commitments set out in the overall reform plan but also incorporating its own organisational and sectoral reform objectives.  We must ensure we have the capacity and the capability to deliver reform.  Leaders and managers across the public service must have a clear sense of what needs to be achieved and they must have a strong focus on performance, delivery and results.  Performance management systems must support managers in getting the best from staff and staff must be given the tools and opportunities to develop their own capacity to deliver public services to the best extent possible.<\/p><p> I take the opportunity to thank Mr. Paul Reid, head of the Reform and Delivery Office, for his contribution to the delivery of an unprecedented programme of reform that we have implemented since his appointment in 2011.  He will shortly take up the position of Fingal County Manager and I wish him well in this important role which will be more hands-on.  He might regret his critical part in reducing the pay of senior public servants at county manager level, but he has been pivotal to all we have achieved in the past three years.  The process to secure a suitably qualified programme director to replace him is already under way.<\/p><p> Since we published the first reform plan in November 2011, we have made considerable progress in building a new public service, one that is more efficient, more customer-focused and more responsive to changing priorities and needs.  We must build on these achievements and maintain our focus and commitment as we look to the next phase of reforms.  In doing so we are always open to good ideas.  I welcome the role the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has played to date and look forward to it playing a pivotal role in a future reform agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900003#B00500","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392828300,"counter":164,"content":"<p>For the questioning, I propose we permit 15 minute slots, if that is agreeable.  Before calling Deputy Charles Flanagan, I want to outline the overall context for the Minister.  There are three questions that need to be asked of him.  First, what is driving the public sector reform plan?  While the reforms have a financial context, surely reduction is not reform in that it creates an additional hindrance.  Second, what is the Minister's view of the allegation that we are trying to create a no-frills public sector?  In other words, if everything is stripped out, we will end up with a no-frills service.  Third, what the committee is ultimately examining is an environment in which people who avail of public services receive a quality service and that those who work in the public service are operating in an environment that allows them do their job to the best of their ability and motivates them accordingly.  The target figure in 2014 is 282,500, which represents a reduction of 2,900.

A reform agenda had to be at the core of recovery and that meant fixing not only the economic woes that had befallen us but also the administrative and oversight structures that had failed, as well as the political systems.  That is why a Department with responsibility for reform was created for the first time in the history of the State.  We are driving reform because it is an essential part of our recovery and there are different elements to it within the public service, the Civil Service and politics, a good chunk of which falls within the remit of my Department.<\/p><p>  On whether we are creating a no-frills, Ryanair-type public service, if I can use that term, that is not what is at stake, but we need to be open to delivering services in a different way.  Simply because we have done it in a certain way for 40 years does not mean that it is the only way to do it.  We must learn from the best business practices which can migrate into the public service, but what underpins the public service is a public service ethic that has served the country very well.  I pay tribute in particular to those public servants who kept the ship of State afloat when all systems seemed to have collapsed in the dying part of the previous Administration.  They served the country very well.  We are not looking to create a no-frills public service.  We are looking to have a high quality public service in which everybody knows his or her job and there is clear accountability for inputs but also outcomes.  I spoke yesterday to people on a local radio station who were talking about measuring inputs.  The quality of the service is determined by how much money one provides for it rather than by what one gets for one's money and how the service is delivered.  We need to have a much greater link between the service user, that is, the citizen and public services.  That is what we are trying to create.<\/p><p>  On the last point on from where we get the numbers and whether there is a numbers target, obviously the first days of the reform agenda had to have very much central to it a fiscal target of expenditure controls.  There are only two ways to reduce expenditure - reduce numbers or pay rates - and we did both through the Croke Park agreement which had been designed by the previous Administration and the Haddington Road agreement which was negotiated by us with the public sector unions.  A reduction in numbers is part of that agreement.  If every business had to make changes, it would not simply cut salaries; it would cut numbers to see if it could deliver services in a more efficient way.  There is no holy writ about numbers.  I have said, in terms of the discussions we have had, that I want to migrate some of the savings we have made from back office supports, for example, through the shared services of PeoplePoint and the new shared payroll service, to supplement front-line services.  That is why we have been able this year to restore recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and give leeway to recruit extra resource teachers and special needs assistants.  The numbers policy is a matter for debate in terms of what is the optimum number.  For example, we said, in regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that we would set up a commission this year to examine what was the optimum number of garda&iacute; that should be deployed and how they should be deployed.  This should inform Government policy in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900005#D00500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1392828900,"counter":168,"content":"<p>While I will revert to the business management systems to which the Minister referred in his response, I wish to delve briefly into another area.  The report appears to give a lot of space or scope to the possibility of using non-governmental organisations, NGOs, or philanthropic entities to carry out services on behalf of the State.  I will put to one side the issue with NGOs, regulation and so on and will focus on the issue of philanthropy.  An issue of concern arises in this regard, namely, as the State faces a philanthropy cliff, from where will the funding for philanthropy actually come?  Second, if one operates on the basis that one does not believe in altruism and that all behaviour is needs-driven, it follows that those who engage in philanthropic support obviously have some need they wish to serve.  In this regard, could the situation arise in which the type of supports received through philanthropic funds went towards the things in which those agents are actually interested?  One could then end up with a two-tier arts sector, for instance, in which the jazzy stuff and the black-tie events get funded, while community-based arts programmes do not, because they are not, to use a phrase, as sexy within the arts world.  This also could happen in respect of development agencies and so on.  I do not make this point disparagingly but given the concerns philanthropic funds bring and the needs return - I believe people operate on a needs basis and there is a return for it, even if it is a feeling they are doing good work in their communities - how does the Minister address such concerns?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900006#E00100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1392828900,"counter":169,"content":"<p>The Chairman again has asked a number of questions.  While different service delivery models are being sought, I note we already have a highly complicated matrix of delivery models.  Speaking as a former Minister for Health, I can tell the Chairman that many of the services we provide in the health area built up over time on the basis of charitable organisations that provided services that suddenly were taken into an umbrella.  This is the reason we had a highly disparate patchwork of services.  In some areas, there were very high-quality services for children because good charities had operated in them while in other areas, services for children, the elderly or the disabled were non-existent.  One of the original rationales for the creation of the Health Service Executive, flawed and all as was that architecture, was to have a national, rather than a regional and disparate overview, to pull together all those strands.  There are a number of points to make to answer directly the Chairman's question as to how this should be done.  If there are to be different service delivery models, whether through NGOs, charities or statutory agencies, the main thing is to have absolute transparency regarding both the funding that is available and what is expected from it or in other words, transparent service level agreements.  This is what the Department is driving at because, as those colleagues opposite who have been tabling parliamentary questions in respect of section 38 or 39 organisations are aware, there is a great deal of opacity that has built up over decades and through which the Government must now get to have transparency in the models, how they are funded, the level of administrative costs and so on if quality public services are to be delivered.  However, I am under no illusions as to how challenging is the job of getting the optimum service delivery system, because one cannot change fundamentally and provide a service at the same time.  Some of the questions the Chairman asked reflect some of the challenges the Government will face in the next phase of carrying out that analysis.  However, I am strongly of the view that the more transparency there is and the more open the access to data, the better will be one's confidence that value for money is being achieved and the service delivery model is the best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900006#E00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1392828900,"counter":170,"content":"<p>To come back to the Minister's earlier reference to business management models and so forth, a criticism that may have been made of the public sector is that the type of management model in place there is hierarchical and that in the past, it has not adopted team management approaches and so on.  The report contains strong words on the area of appraisal.  However, if one actually is appraising a system with which there is a difficulty, the appraisal system therefore also is problematic because one is appraising something that may not be working.  How does the Minister envisage the reforms moving towards the putting in place of an appraisal system and the putting in place of organisational structural change whereby there will be team approaches to dealing with issues?  How does he envisage putting in place a structure in which one does not have the aforementioned hierarchical management model but where matters are considered collectively on a project basis, as opposed to each individual being appraised, as well as more innovative stuff that one might encounter in more modern industries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900006#E00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1392828900,"counter":171,"content":"<p>As I noted in my opening remarks, the issue of accountability is at the heart of the reform.  When we pulled back the layers and considered everything that happened in the past, it often came down to a systems failure in which no one actually was accountable or no one was responsible.  We use those words and throw them out but what do the words \"accountable\", \"responsible\" or \"answerable\" mean?  They all have different meanings in respect of Ministers, senior civil servants and so on.  We must try to work towards a system in which people know for what they are responsible - I hope to do that in legislative terms - and therefore, for what they are accountable.  I also have made the point previously about an idea from which we must get away.  At present, we almost have a \"Gotcha\" culture, in which it is a good thing if one can nail someone and failure is never acceptable.  However, the corollary is one ends up with civil servants who will not make decisions because if one never makes a decision, one will never be wrong.  As for always being safe, over the past three years my Department certainly would not have been able to do the job it did had it not been able to make sometimes difficult decisions on a daily basis.  Sometimes, risky decisions were made because one never is certain of outcomes.  By the time one evaluates and measures everything to the degree that is safe, one can end up being too late and the damage done.  Therefore, we certainly need a degree of accountability, as well as a clear understanding of what it is for which people are responsible.<\/p><p>  The Chairman mentioned the issue concerning hierarchy and I note the grading structure is under consideration.  In the documentation on which I worked in advance of the election, which was replicated in some of the work carried out by Fine Gael, we came to the conclusion that there probably are too many grades within the Civil Service and too many people overseeing others, as opposed to doers.  Moreover, there is not enough devolved responsibility and accountability and this is the sort of work that must be done.  However, hand in glove with such work is the need to have proper training because in the past, people often were given jobs.  One was promoted to be a procurement officer or a human resources person without any proper training.  This cannot be and there must be professionalism in this regard.  This is the reason I believe one will see a different model of intake into the Civil Service in the future.  Not everyone will be a generalist but far more specialists will be recruited.  At senior level, many more contract people will come in for specific functions for specific periods and hopefully, there will be a great deal more interaction between the private sector and the Civil Service.  These are the models on which I would work.  Finally, the Chairman made a very good point about team building in that an essential part of any modern enterprise is that one works as a team and not in a hierarchy under someone's control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900006#E00400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1392828900,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his attendance.

Seeing as the Minister asked, there is just one.<\/p><p>  On an issue we discussed here previously, the Minister confirmed that 5% of overall annual public procurement, which amounted to &euro;650 million of the &euro;13 billion in 2011, went to companies outside of Ireland.  I note the Minister wants to drive down prices but he is exporting jobs unnecessarily through this process.  He will be aware that many of the small and medium-sized businesses complain that they cannot get onto these lists.  Right across Europe, they give contracts to companies in their own countries - in some countries, 98% or 99% of them.  They are subject to the same EU thresholds and requirements as we are yet we are going backwards in this area.  By the Minister's own admission and the parliamentary question of yesterday, &euro;650 million is going to companies outside of the State.  For an island nation, we should not have that.  The Minister should be trying to do everything possible to protect Irish contracts and get more in line with the EU average of 97% or 98%.  The Minister stated here it is one of his targets but I do not see anything being done to achieve that target.  I accept it is difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900007#F01400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1392829500,"counter":192,"content":"<p> On the first question about the new quangos we created, Deputy Sean Fleming referred to them as if their creation was bad <i>per se<\/i>.

What we had to date was significantly inefficient procurement where the taxpayer was paying over the odds across the State for a variety of goods and services, with, as I stated here previously, different agencies of State paying the same company a different price for the same product.  That was crazy.<\/p><p>  We set out to enable SMEs.  From the start, we discussed this with the SME representatives.

In it, the Minister speaks of four teams.  The two in which I am interested are the ones that affect the public.  Reform dividend and digitalisation are more internal, but delivering improved outcomes for the public and the old hoary chestnut, openness and accountability, are the two I want to talk about.<\/p><p>  On delivering improved outcomes, we are still looking at significant numbers waiting for outpatient appointments.  As HIQA would confirm, few in the ambulance service across Ireland, while now regionalised, are reaching their point of destination within the appropriate time HIQA has set.  The amount of time taken for social welfare appeals is an ongoing issue.  While the Government speaks about all of these matters, it needs to set targets for some of them to ensure they are achieved.<\/p><p>  Perhaps I will combine it all.  On openness, transparency and accountability, going back to that issue of this new patient safety agency I mentioned in the Department of Health which is specified in this document, the Minister spoke well here but he will be aware, not only because it happened in Portlaoise Hospital but as I am sure it has happened in other hospitals as well over recent years, that children died shortly after birth.<\/p> <p>There had to be a policy of concealment or covering up at the higher echelons of the HSE for the four years until &quot;Prime Time&quot; highlighted the matter. <b><\/b>This concerns the Department of Health.  I know that and I am sure the Minister suspects the Department did not know what was going on in the HSE.<\/p><p> While we have wonderful talks about openness and transparency, these concepts do not apply within public organisations if the staff at senior level believe they could have implications for these organisations.  Endemic in HSE thinking when it is reviewing a critical incident is the questioning of how openness will affect the organisation rather than the patient or people being served.  The Minister can introduce all the freedom of information legislation, ethics, transparency guidelines and whistleblowing legislation he likes &ndash; we will not discuss the issue of whistleblowing because I am sure it is being discussed next door &ndash; but a problem arises if the thinking I describe is endemic.  When the problem is endemic, not among the lower grades but among those earning &euro;100,000, the people on whom we rely to do a good job, one thinks about how people can sit on and conceal information on deaths for four years.  Under the Minister's reform package, these are the same staff that he wants to carry out an inquiry.  I am really concerned about the part of the Minister's document that states the patient safety agency will be established on an administrative basis initially.  We are dealing with the structures of the HSE and the HSE is the culprit in many cases.  HIQA is outside the HSE.  Why would the Minister put such a body such in the structure that has proved itself to be part of the problem?  The HSE is not the solution to some of the problems.  Leaving aside the legislation, there is still a culture of protecting the organisation in the first, second and third instance.  Perhaps the people come later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900007#F01800","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392830100,"counter":197,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised two issues, one of which was the focus on outcomes.  He instanced the ambulance service.  We are moving away from inputs to measure outcomes.  Of course, it will be a journey, not a destination; we are not going to change everything instantly.  However, from the ambulance service I understand the old idea of an ambulance driver has completely changed.  Each ambulance is now staffed by highly skilled and trained emergency medical technicians who can provide first responder treatment at the site of an accident, including treatment for those having a heart attack.  This leads to a completely different understanding in measuring ambulance services and responses.  I am very conscious that the system must be rolled out.  It is happening over time, although we would all like it to happen instantly.<\/p><p>  The other point the Deputy makes, on openness, is very valid and I would not mind a bigger debate on it.  I find that everybody wants everybody else to be open.  All of us, including those of us in the Oireachtas, are always reluctant to have all of our data made available.  We all resent expenses being trawled through all the time, but that is the way the system works.  We should move away from that attitude.<\/p><p>  There are other issues to be considered.  The Deputy is absolutely correct that the law, whether it be on freedom of information, whistleblowing or otherwise, is the law.  Cultural change is much more difficult to bring about.  The Deputy referred to the patient safety agency, on which he made a valid point.  One can debate this subject, certainly in the Department of Health, but citation must demonstrably be on the patient side, not the side of anybody else.<\/p><p>  Let us consider education, for example.  There is a strong view articulated that we should not have real data about outcomes from schools because we do not want to have a league table.  Are people entitled to all of the data on outcomes from schools?  Would a league table not represent a better assessment of inputs and outputs and a stronger argument for directing more resources to where they are needed?  Would it not allow us to discern deficiencies?  There are big issues to be addressed in terms of openness, on which we need to have a debate, as opposed to simply saying there are some areas that are untouchable.  I have instanced education, but there are other areas in which this principle applies equally.  In many cases, there will be a valid reason given on openness.  Let us hear the valid reasons and have the necessary discussion.  I have made this presentation to the Open Government Partnership.  Ultimately, I would like our flagship project to involve an open-data basis for all public information.

It is accepted that there is a need for cultural change in the public service.  Deputy Sean Fleming correctly pointed to the reflex reaction in the case of hospitals on the deaths of infants.  There were very tragic cases in which the impulse was to protect the institutions concerned.  This is undoubtedly an issue.  If the instinct of the Government is, above all else, to protect the State as it sees it, it is not exactly leading by example.<\/p><p>  Under the heading of \"Openness and Accountability\", the Minister referred in his opening comments to the continuation of the comprehensive programme of statute law revision.  For how long will that proceed?  Is it an open-ended process?  It is the process for which the Minister has used JobBridge personnel.  I have discussed this issue with him before and he knows my view on JobBridge.  We will not have this battle again this afternoon.<\/p><p>  I have a couple of specific questions on what the Minister presented.  To what extent does the practice of outsourcing feature in the alternative models of service delivery?  One of the Minister's actions in the next three years will be to up-skill public service managers in the execution of end-to-end outsourcing systems.  I am curious to know what that means.  As the Minster knows, the practice of outsourcing is one which gives rise to considerable concern for those who work in the public sector, bearing in mind that their numbers have been depleted.  I would appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the issue.<\/p><p>  I was struck by the leadership section in respect of the issue of performance.  The Minister said something about the review of the Civil Service.  This is welcome and good, but the Minister, in setting out the target, referred to a period from the third quarter of 2014 to the second quarter of 2015.  He used the wording, &ldquo;examine the contractual framework for senior civil servants to underpin an effective approach to supporting high performance.&rdquo;  That is a bit of a mouthful.  What exactly does it mean?<\/p><p>  I was struck by some of the targets set for the HSE.  The Minister might talk to us about the business case for a single integrated finance system, the work on which is ongoing and which he thinks he might complete by the end of 2016.  The HSE feasibility study and the business case for a national recruitment system were referred to.  If approved, the system will proceed to implementation.  The Minister says the work on it is ongoing and will be completed by quarter two of 2014.<\/p> <p>That raises the obvious question as to whether or not the Minister will lift the recruitment embargo.  It is all very well to have a recruitment procedure but if there is no recruitment one wonders about its merits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900008#G00800","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392830700,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I will allow the Minister to respond and will then bring the Deputy back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900009#H00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1392830700,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Yes, sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900009#H00300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1392830700,"counter":207,"content":"<p>If we have 15 minutes of questions there will be no time for an answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900009#H00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1392830700,"counter":208,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900009#H00500","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1392830700,"counter":209,"content":"<p>There is a whole series of questions there.

Politicians have to give the lead in that regard and I strongly endorse what Deputy McDonald said about that.<\/p><p>  I do not accept that the instinct of government is to protect the State, but it is to protect and support the people as best we can.  It is true that countervailing issues often present themselves.  The Deputy asked particularly about the statute law revision programme, which is in its final phase now.  As she knows, two pieces of legislation have been enacted on foot of that.  It was basically cleanse the Statute Book of redundant and non-applicable law.  That difficult job of work was undertaken initially by the Attorney General's office and latterly by my Department over the last few years. <\/p><p>  Deputy McDonald mentioned the issue of outsourcing.  No more than quangos, outsourcing is often an effective way of doing things.  Sometimes, however, it not effective or efficient.  I have cited an example before.  Wexford County Hospital used to have its own laundry.  Wexford happens to have one of the most efficient laundries in the country, Celtic Linen, that provides linen services and scrubs to hospitals around the country, as well as to hotels.  One would not replicate a laundry on a tiny scale instead of outsourcing that service to an effective provider of daily fresh linen.<\/p><p>  The idea of outsourcing is that one makes rational decisions on the most effective and efficient way of delivering a service.  We do not label one service as \"good\" and another as \"bad\" because it is delivered by a private sector worker.  All workers are of equal value, so it is a matter of making rational choices that are efficient and effective.  It also allows public sector workers to focus on things they are best at.  There will of course be cases where public sector services are utilised by the private sector because that is the most effective and efficient way of delivering them.<\/p><p>  Deputy McDonald referred to senior civil servants.  My own Department has done a lot of work on examining the contractual base for appointing senior civil servants.  Mr. Paul Reid is a practical example of that, if he will forgive me for saying so since he is here.  Mr. Reid was recruited on a contract basis to head up the reform and delivery office, with a set purpose, objective and skills base.  Similarly, other people we have employed, like the head of the office of Government procurement who has a skills base in procurement, were engaged on a contractual basis with set delivery targets.  The chief information officer was recruited on the same basis, coming from a skills set with a specific mandate to do a job of work over a set period of time that is measurable.  I think we will see more and more of that happening within the public service.  People will come in for specific timelines, on a contract to do a particular job of work.<\/p><p>  The HSE's single integrated finance system was mentioned.  In the roll-out of shared services we first looked at HR management, which is up and running and will be completed by January 2015.  The second one is the payroll shared service, which is in the process of being set in place in three locations, including the midlands and the west.  That is a work in progress.<\/p><p>  The next one we examined is the financial management shared service.  We are doing a scoping exercise on that at the moment and while I do not have the feedback on that, it is coming.  We are looking at how we have a more integrated financial management system that brings efficiencies.  There is a model in Norway that presented itself to me, but we have also looked at others to see how that can be done.  It is in the early stages of scoping to have an integrated financial system that does financial back-office supports more efficiently.  There will be subsets of that whether they are in the local government system or in the HSE.  I hope I have answered all the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900009#H00800","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1392830700,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Yes.  May I stick to the issue of outsourcing?  From what the Minister has said, and the fact that he is upskilling public service managers in the execution of outsourcing, I take it he sees this very much as a trend that will perhaps intensify within the public service.  While human beings are equal and I entirely agree with the Minister that each worker should be equal to another, I think he will appreciate that that is not in fact the case.  That is because some workers find themselves in secure employment, while others do not.<\/p><p>  What plans does the Minister have for the employment arrangements and status of work that is outsourced?  He will be familiar with all sorts of phenomena.  Even some section 39 organisations have used zero-hour contracts, but I do not believe the State should be underwriting that in any shape or form.  I am not raising that concern from a Luddite anti-efficiency position, but with a view to the workers in that sector and also the quality of service being delivered.  I note that the Minister has referenced savings on agency workers within the health sector.  He might enlighten us on the scale of those savings so far.  <\/p><p>  It seems to me that there are two things at odds with each other.  On the one hand, there is an impulse to outsource and on the other a recognition that in the case of the health service the use of agency workers is massively expensive.

It is a theme commonly spoken about among people who work in the sector and those who represent them.<\/p><p>  The contradiction I was pointing out to the Minister was that on the one hand outsourcing is not just viewed as an option, it is stated very clearly in the plan that we are upskilling managers in the execution of end-to-end outsourcing but something that is being positively promoted within the reform plan.  Alongside that there is an acceptance that agency workers in the health service are enormously expensive, that it is not the most cost effective way to proceed and that many would argue that the traditional model of a full-time employee, a full blooded public servant being paid the rate for the job is more cost effective.

The Seanad had the benefit of his wisdom recently and was very supportive of him.<\/p><p>  It appears that the way public life is reported in Ireland is that an argument on how universal health insurance might or might not be financed is based not on the issues, but on whether Ministers A an B play golf on the same golf course.  I welcome what I have read about this plan.  All of the issues should be discussed openly in the way that appears to have been the case here.  It is great when discussion is done in the open and on the issues because the Department has a watchdog role.<\/p><p>  The Minister spoke about the commitments made by the Government.  One of the commitments I recall was that the Department of the Taoiseach, which it was felt had grown too large under previous Taoisigh and under social partnership, would become a small Cabinet office.  The Department is ten times the size it was when the Constitution was drawn up.  One must wonder why the Taoiseach appoints Ministers.  Presumably, if one was to control numbers, it would be by reducing the numbers of Departments.  In the early days of the State, the small Cabinet office of the time wrote the Constitution, secured the return of the treaty ports and kept Ireland out of the war.  Therefore, it must have been a very able group of 20 in that office.<\/p><p>  In regard to capital, the Minister mentioned property.  My fear is that there are people in the property and construction sector who would be delighted to do the same thing all over again and regularly we see newspaper supplements trying to create the ingredients of a new bubble.  We are lucky we have had no money to inject capital into this area, but if we are going to start providing capital, we need appraisal procedures.  Plans must be published in advance and we must separate the promotion of a project from how it will be financed.  There is scope for reform in this area.<\/p><p>  I welcome the proposals on lobbying.  The Leader of the Seanad does not allow much lobbying.  We had to guillotine the Finance Act in the Seanad, but some of the provisions towards the end of the Bill seemed to provide for the so-called \"fiscal termites\".  These are people who seem to have a way of getting fiscal privilege for their sectors.  It seems that President Obama believes, and the same opinion was expressed in Davos, that the ability of some sectors to negotiate fiscal privilege for themselves is a major source of increasing inequality.  This is an issue of concern for all of us.<\/p><p>  The Minister's review document includes a graph on page 8 on Irish Water.  It is not a great example of reform as we still do not know the price of water or the free allowance and so on.  However, I hope the talent in the Department will ensure we get this right.  Page 20 of the document describes the new rostering in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When the Minister for transport was in the Seanad yesterday, we asked whether check points for alcohol testing could be signed off on by a sergeant rather than a superintendent, but I regret to say we did not get anywhere with that.   It is something that could be considered.  The Minister mentioned the review of the Garda in appendix 2(a) on page 64.<\/p><p>  The document refers also to the Irish Aviation Authority and the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  The decision on that was correct.  However, the Commission for Aviation Regulation was overruled, to secure a massive - over 40% - increase in airport charges, which we are now trying to unwind to get a growth in tourism.  The Minister has been criticised in regard to the 10% of bus routes to be tendered out and it has been suggested that 10% is too high.  I think it is too low.  The system began in 1932, and we are just allowing 10% to be competitive in 84 years.<\/p> <p>At that rate,  it would take 840 years to have a competitive bus business in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900011#K01400","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392832500,"counter":263,"content":"<p>We had that discussion with Deputy Mary Lou McDonald previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014021900012#L00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1392832500,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Yes.  Let us have tendering in this instance.  It seems to be an obvious example of where one would do it.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to pyrite, but according to Oireachtas briefing notes, householders in Canada with pyrite problems contacted their house insurance providers in the first instance.  The insurance providers recovered moneys from the construction industry which, in turn, recovered moneys from the quarrying industry which had supplied the defective materials.  My worry is that in Ireland it always seems to be the taxpayer who foots such bills.  Perhaps a little Canadianisation in terms of how it dealt with pyrite problems would be good.  We must also examine how we regulate accountants and banks because they specialise in landing the Exchequer with financial burdens.<\/p><p>  On the amalgamation of quangos, I appreciate the point made by the Minister.  The regulation of taxis, for example, was better when it was done separately and has disimproved since it was taken over by the NTA.  Mr. Paul K. Gorecki of the ESRI has criticised what has happened and argued that a competitive industry was taken over by an organisation with an uncompetitive ethos.  In that context, we may end up with regulation that is worse than heretofore.  <\/p><p>  I wish to refer to the deployment of teachers.  If one divides the number of teachers into the number of pupils, the average is 16, but I do not know anybody who is actually in a class of only 16 pupils.

Are the additional teachers engaged in administrative tasks rather than the task for which they were trained?  <\/p><p>  In general, I welcome the emphasis of the Department.  The Minister made reference to the change from generalist to specialist; that is the way the world is going.  We need specialists in all fields.

I agree with him that there should be a public debate on the costing of any issue.  Unfortunately, however, such a debate is often characterised on a personal basis.  I commented last weekend that engaging in the normal business of politics should not involve personal considerations.  Even party considerations are often juxtaposed into the normal workings of proper scoping evaluation and so on.<\/p><p>  The Senator referred to the property issue.  I agree strongly with him that we do not want to go back to a boom property market.  We have been thinking off-piste about how to deal with this and I have had discussions with the Minister for Finance on the issue.  The Senator makes a very valid point on lobbying and the issue of access to power, which has bedevilled all administrations, not just in Ireland but all over the world, and the fact that we need to bring transparency and openness to it.  Lobbying is good, whether by farmers, the trade union movement, employers, local community groups and so on.  People are entitled to lobby, as long as everyone knows who is lobbying whom and what they are saying.  Then, if there is a change in policy, we will know whose lobbying had an impact.  That is what we need in that context.  <\/p><p>  The Senator referred to the pyrite issue and the Canadian example, but as he knows, the original intention of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government was to levy the quarrying industry.  However, he ran into difficulties in that regard and found that it was not possible to do so.  That is the long and short of it.  We do not have the same flexibility as they do in Canada because of European considerations and so forth.  It was important to provide a sum of money - &euro;10 million was the initial sum - to deal with the pyrite problem because it was ongoing.  The people affected by it cannot get insurance; their houses are cracked and falling down; and the problem needs to be addressed.  <\/p><p>  The Senator mentioned Irish Water and the fact that we had to set a price for water.  However, we also have to know the cost of water because often we do not value the inputs and real cost of anything.  We need to set a price that is affordable, while also sustaining the new entity that will be Irish Water.  Despite many of the negative things said about Irish Water - often it is high level sound bites that determine people's views - anyone who listened to the details of the five hour presentation to the committee by the CEO of Irish Water would have a different perspective of the competence, ability, scale, scope and importance of Irish Water into the future.  It will be regarded in years to come as of equal importance to the ESB or any other of our flagship State enterprises.<\/p><p>  I thank committee members for their input.

We are all aware of the rapid urbanisation of developing countries and the consequential pressure this places on the need for housing.  This discussion of the issue of housing in developing countries is, therefore, timely as we have not discussed the theme for some time.  I look forward to the contributions of our guests on the issue.  As they will be aware, delegations from the committee travel to the developing world from time to time to observe people in their local environments and learn about how they live.  It is important for us to learn about the role of Habitat for Humanity and I am very pleased to have representatives of the organisation before us.  The principal speakers are Mr. Vincent Cunningham, executive director, Habitat for Humanity Ireland, and Mr. Kebede Abebe, national director, Habitat for Humanity Ethiopia.  Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Abebe are accompanied by Ms Jeannie McCann, communications manager.

Habitat for Humanity's vision is of a world in which everyone has a decent place to live.  Our work is anchored in the conviction that access to simple, decent housing provides a solid foundation to break the cycle of poverty and create a brighter future for all children.  Many members will be familiar with Habitat for Humanity's work in Dublin, including our renovation projects with Dublin City Council.  Deputy Eric Byrne attended the dedication ceremony for our houses in Inchicore at which our patron, President Michael D. Higgins, handed over the keys.  Constituents of members may also have travelled to our partner countries as part of our international volunteering programme.  Members may also be familiar with Irish Aid's support for our orphaned and vulnerable children programme in Zambia.  Habitat for Humanity greatly appreciates all the support it receives for these programmes.<\/p><p>  The purpose of our presentation is to discuss the reasons it is critical to prioritise housing in an urbanising world.  The pace of change in our world is dramatic.  Rapid urbanisation is challenging our understanding of poverty and how we work to eliminate it.  For the first time in history, more than half of the world's population are living in cities.  In the next two decades 95% of urban growth will be in developing countries.  It is projected that by 2050, 70% of the world's population will live in urban areas, with the total slum population set to double to 2 billion.<\/p> <p>Cities are unprepared to accommodate this growth, resulting in the rapid expansion of slums, forcing families to live in inhumane conditions when their only goal is to earn enough income to build better lives for themselves and their children.  Urgent action is needed to reduce the negative effects of urbanisation and ensure cities an become engines of growth and sustainability for all.<\/p><p> Housing is an urgent growing global issue.  Housing is more than four walls and a roof.  Adequate housing includes sufficient space, security of tenure and access to basic services such as water and sanitation.  A safe and secure home provides more than protection from the elements.  Studies have shown the positive impact adequate housing has on individuals, on their health, on their education and on their livelihood.  Overcrowded rooms, dirt floors, poor ventilation, unhealthy living conditions and doors that do not lock, all take their toll on a family's health.  Investment in adequate housing is, therefore, critical to the reduction of poverty in the future.  <\/p><p> Despite our changing world, poor housing and slum conditions are not new.  Since the industrial revolution, slum conditions have emerged in cities as poor migrants arrived to work in factories.  During times of emigration in Irish history, many of our ancestors left Ireland and arrived in the slums of London and New York in search of work and a better life.  At the turn of the last century overcrowded and dilapidated housing was rampant in Dublin and other parts of the country.  In today's economic climate many cannot access mortgage finance.  There is a growing social housing waiting list and there are also too many empty homes.  This requires urgent action and we in Habitat are ready to be part of the solution.<\/p><p> Every day in 70 countries around the world local Habitat organisations are working alongside local families and communities to improve their living conditions - building, renovating and repairing their homes.  Last year Habitat for Humanity served 124,946 families globally which is equal to helping one family every four minutes.  Our habitat colleagues such as Mr. Kebede Abede are shelter experts in their own countries.  They understand the challenges and develop innovative sustainable solutions to address their urgent growing need.  This includes building and renovating homes but it also includes incremental solutions, microfinance, water and sanitation upgrades.<\/p><p> I wish to introduce the committee to Mr. Kebede Abede, national director of Habitat for Humanity Ethiopia to explain its work there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014021900002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Cunningham","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392820200,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.  I am the national director of Habitat for Humanity Ethiopia.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to appear before the committee.  I feel honoured and privileged to be here today to speak about what we do in Habitat for Humanity Ethiopia.<br \/> I have served for 12 and a half years as a national director of Habitat for Humanity.  By profession I am a civil engineer.  When I graduated I had intended to do some private business but slowly, through my service, I realised the seriousness of the housing need and then I started to serve in this area and changed my career.  <\/p><p>  The housing situation in Ethopia is one of the worst in the world.  More than 90% of the people live in substandard housing conditions and 30% of homes do not have water and people have to fetch it from a distance, and 40% of the houses do not have toilet facilities and people have to find other places for sanitation services.  Having see it the reality is highly painful.<\/p><p>  As members are aware, housing is critical for human beings and is a place of dignity.  Families and people who do not have houses cannot have dignity.  Housing is the beginning of everything.  It is the beginning of development, it is the beginning of growth and education.  Because of this housing is one of the strongest instruments in breaking the cycle of poverty and, unfortunately, we live in a world that has not given adequate attention to housing.  Because of this, millions of people continue to live in unacceptable conditions around the world.  Poverty housing can be characterised by a number of things - houses that are leaking and have stains on the outside, houses that can collapse at any time and unbelievable overcrowding.<\/p><p>  Habitat for Humanity started in 1993.  We have served 14,000 families or 70,000 persons in the country and have diversified our services.  We have started serving vulnerable families and have introduced different innovative interventions in our work, one of which is improving construction in order that it can be done all the year round and cannot be affected by the weather or change of seasons and that we can built from local materials in cheaper ways.  When we compare the economic benefit of the newly introduced improved house, we have served more than 83,000 boxes of cement or US$930,000 which is equivalent to 13 million Ethiopian birr by constructing 1,660 houses.   <\/p><p>  I wish to share one story among many similar ones where family's life has changed a great deal.  Mr. Levin and his wife were affected by leprosy in their area of Ethiopia.  Before becoming beneficiaries of Habitat for Humanity they were living in plastic sheds, in an isolated place and were stigmatised.  They earned their living by begging.  After they got a habitat house they started to earn their living by working.  Their life has improved.  Mr. Levin said he was 65 years old but since he got a habitat house five years ago, he said he is now a five year old person not a 65 year old person.  Also on 25 January 2014, when we were giving home ownership certificates he said:<blockquote>I begged for 35 years, I never thought there was anything better than begging but since getting work and since getting a Habitat house I have completely changed.  Now I am opposed to begging.  I am proud to start living my life actively by earning through my work.<\/blockquote>  Our future plan in Ethiopia for Habitat for Humanity for the next three years is to serve 11,000 families through different interventions in housing.  Obviously we see many challenges in our work.  As the committee is aware funding is limited and also inflation is very high.  That is another challenge.  Another challenge worth mentioning is the environmental policy framework.<\/p> <p>Ethiopia does not have a housing policy and a housing ministry, and because of this, housing has not been given attention, and that makes our work a lot more difficult.  To date, we celebrate serving 70,000 people and we have introduced housing for vulnerable groups.  We are grateful that we have managed to do this with the support of Ireland.  However, the need is still great.  We hope that we continue to increase our support.  I thank the committee members for giving me this golden opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014021900003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kebede Abebe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392820800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>First, we call on the joint committee to use its influence to encourage the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Irish Aid in particular, to prioritise funding and support for governments and civil society organisations to develop and implement innovative shelter programmes that are appropriate and sustainable to the housing needs of the world's poor.  Second, we call on the committee to use Ireland's voice to promote housing policies and interventions that bring about lasting systemic change and challenge the root causes of families being forced to live in inadequate housing.  This includes discussions on the post-2015 development agenda, in which Habitat for Humanity calls for shelter to be included as an explicit, measurable priority.  Third, we call on the committee to promote opportunities for the Irish public to learn, engage and participate in global issues, including housing interventions.<\/p><p>  Tonight and every night, more than 1.6 billion people will be forced to sleep standing up when it rains because they do not have a decent roof.  They will be constantly afraid of their safety because they do not have doors that lock.  Safe shelter saves lives.

The figure of 1.6 billion people living in inadequate accommodation - to put it mildly - is a frightening statistic.  The other statistic often quoted is that 1 billion people go to bed hungry every night.  These two statistics are really a terrible indictment of the international community and communities across the world.  With increasing urbanisation, the issues of food security, climate change and space for people to live in appropriate accommodation all need to be given more attention by the public.  The briefing we got stated that we should promote opportunities for the Irish public to learn, engage and participate in global issues, including housing interventions.  That is a welcome development.  It is only at a time of crisis that there is adequate media coverage of the particular challenges facing so many communities worldwide.  If we look at Sky News, BBC, RTE and other broadcasters, we hear about climate change due to the recent flooding in England.  That is why it is getting more attention, but it should get attention at all times.  With increasing urbanisation, there is less land available for arable purposes and the production of food, and issues such as this need great attention.<\/p><p>  Am I right in thinking that Habitat for Humanity advocates on behalf of the many communities in which people are living in slum conditions, and is also a provider of housing?  Does the organisation get support through the international development aid programmes of different countries and of the European Union? Its work is extremely important and I hope it can create a better awareness of those statistics quoted in its briefing paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014021900004#C00400","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1392820800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  The briefing note stated that we are witnessing a massive population increase and said that by 2050, 70% of the world's population would be living in urban areas, with up to 2 billion people living in slums, with all the personal, health, social and economic ramifications of that.  I know that Habitat for Humanity works to construct, rehabilitate and preserve housing, but does it also work with government and state agencies to improve urban planning?  Is that part of its ambit, or is that beyond its resources?  I am conscious that the population increases; it is not just about building houses, but where and how to build them and whether they are sustainable in the long run.<\/p><p>   The importance of housing is detailed extremely well in the presentation.  We know that Irish Aid focuses primarily on hunger and health.  Do the witnesses feel that Irish Aid is doing enough to prioritise the issue of housing?  What could it do better?  The witnesses suggested that perhaps the Government here could promote shelter programmes.  Does Habitat for Humanity do any work with UN-HABITAT?  That agency is mandated by the UN General Assembly to promote socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities.  Do the witnesses feel it is achieving that goal?  Does UN-HABITAT work adequately with NGOs?  Does Irish Aid work with UN-HABITAT?<\/p><p>  References were made to housing crises, decent housing and so on.  We do not have to look far to find that.  There is a crisis in this country.  It is not on the same scale, but it is difficult to say that to families who are living in sub-standard accommodation, without proper heating.  I know of a family in my own constituency who have no electricity at the moment.  I had a woman in my office yesterday who was being bullied in her accommodation, but at 59 years of age she has no prospect of moving out because she does not have the deposit to move.  While people will welcome our involvement in projects around the world, we also need to balance our views on what is happening in our own country.  It is important that there is a voice for such people.  We want to see safe, secure housing, free from intimidation, but we also want to see that in Ireland.  It would be remiss if we did not state that there is a huge crisis in this country.  I carried out a survey yesterday in my own constituency about people trying to get housing supplement.  Of 77 households in the area looking for the supplement, 73 are over the limit, while two of the remaining owners do not accept the supplement.  There is no way forward for people in such situations.  There is no social housing coming through, nor is anything coming through via NAMA.<\/p><p>  I welcome the work being done by Habitat for Humanity.  It is positive and we need to support it, but we also need to look at what we are doing in our own country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014021900004#C00500","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1392821400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I welcome the deputation.  It was interesting to hear about the work they do.  Like other people, my original perception was that Habitat for Humanity was involved with housing in the developing world, as opposed to our world, until I learned some years ago of its work here.  One thing for the committee to examine is how shelter should be included in housing policy after the period of the millennium development goals.  This is vital because, as the deputation said, it is easily measurable.  I have two particular questions.  Within the countries in which Habitat for Humanity is based, what type of funding does it get?  Do any of the countries assist in the organisation's projects?<\/p><p>  I know of the involvement of Habitat for Humanity with Dublin City Council.  The deputation referred to being part of the solution.  In practical terms, how does the deputation envisage this?  I know of some of the work that Habitat for Humanity is doing - for example, the housing in Inchicore.  As Deputy Crowe said, there is a major problem with housing in the Dublin Central area and other areas around Dublin.  We are seeing substandard housing being let out for private rented accommodation.  We can also see the number of voids that are left in the local authority areas.  I am unsure whether there is a role for Habitat for Humanity in this regard.  I know that the organisation renovates, but is there scope for a more direct engagement with Dublin City Council, given that the deputation said the organisation could be part of the solution?<\/p><p>  Some youth groups in my area have been part of the organisation's projects.  They have been to Paraguay and Romania.  The groups were made up of young people, some of whom are foreign nationals, along with local Dublin boys and girls.  They went out to build houses.  It is one of those experiences that defines people when they come back and it was a great opportunity for them to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014021900005#D00100","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1392821400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I thank the deputation for the presentations.  I was trying to get my head around what exactly the organisation does during the presentation.  It was only when the deputation came to the recommendations that I began to get a handle on what exactly Habitat for Humanity is really trying to achieve.  Reference was made to housing solutions in Ethiopia.  I was interested to hear that the organisation has produced a template for sustainable housing using local materials.  That has relevance in the village or a small town, but does it have relevance in a city?  Deputy Crowe touched on this point.  Is the organisation adverting to a planning function?  Does it work through Governments?  How does Habitat for Humanity ensure that it deals with planning?  I have in mind countries such as India or the South American countries where there is already teeming humanity.  In these countries people are still pouring into the cities and will continue to pour in for decades to come.  At issue is how we plan cities, and it is a complex problem.<\/p><p>  One of the recommendations of the deputation half-answers my question.  The recommendation stated that Ireland should use its voice bilaterally and in international forums to promote housing policies and interventions that bring lasting systemic change.  If only we could manage that ourselves we would do very well because planning is still a major issue in this country.  Circumstances are constantly changing.  The key is probably to work through individual countries and recognise that there are different solutions in different places.  I would like this to be included as one of the objectives for the post-millennium development goals.  Then it would be up to each country to concentrate on the issue and identify their intentions rather than simply have a wave of humanity continue to come into cities.  Otherwise we will end up with the type of squalor and poverty that we still see so often.  Is it really a planning issue that Habitat for Humanity is advocating, apart from the details relating to places such as Ethiopia and Dublin?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014021900005#D00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1392821400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I welcome our visitors.  I am somewhat familiar with Habitat for Humanity and I thank the deputation for remembering the day the President came out to open what was a fine old building that had been allowed to go into disrepair.  In fact, I am keen go back and visit it along with some of the residents to see how they are settling in.  The building was almost palatial in many ways, given the height of the Georgian ceilings.  They were fine rooms and it was a fine house.  I hope it is working out well.<\/p><p>  We learn something new every day.  I did not know Habitat for Humanity was receiving Irish Aid assistance.  I am pleased because the committee often deals with the Irish Aid budget.  The organisation has targeted projects in Zambia, which is very interesting.<\/p><p>  I wish to ask the deputation about tenure agreements.  My understanding is that the people in Inchicore might have got loans and made some financial or physical contribution by working on the building.  Will the deputation explain a little about the relationship between potential tenants and owner-occupiers?  Are the tenure arrangements the same internationally?  I am unsure what happens in Ethiopia.  Do housing associations run these properties there?  Does everyone benefit from private ownership?<\/p><p>  The scale of housing is relevant.  We are familiar with Africa and the number of poor unfortunates who are emigrating illegally but who end up dead on beaches in Spain, Greece and other places.  There are huge movements of people across the continent heading this way.<\/p><p>  I am aware of some of the indigenous uses of natural resources, such as the interweaving of banana leaves and bamboo sticks in Africa, which is interesting.  The deputation is saying that the organisation can accommodate or adapt traditional building methods with building materials, using a more modern way to create greater security, sanitation and so on.  I am keen to hear how good these programmes are.  Habitat for Humanity is in 70 countries, which is fantastic.  Are they all stand-alone?  Is Habitat for Humanity a housing association, as we understand it, like Cl&uacute;id or Oaklee?

One of the figures that struck me was that the total slum population is doubling to 2 billion, a horrifying figure.  I fully support what Habitat for Humanity is doing.  I believe the situation of the planet is going to get worse and worse unless, in parallel with all these things, we confront the appalling population explosion that has taken place.  The planet simply cannot sustain it.  We are wasting our time if we do not address it.<\/p><p>  I launched Green Week in Trinity College on Monday of this week.  When I was in Trinity College the total population of the university was 3,000, but it is now 21,000, seven times higher.  Since I was born the population has almost trebled on the planet.  We cannot keep doing that.  Only providing houses is not a solution because there will be more and more people and we are going to be unable to keep up.  In tandem, something must be done about population.  People are afraid to touch the topic.  All the great religions want to breed and breed because to them it is a numbers game - if one religion has more members then another then their God is right and so on.  It is a load of baloney.  Each year I go to the United Nations launch of the report on global population.  The one word we never find in the report is \"population\".  The report refers to women in conflict, educating children and female circumcision but it will not discuss population.  Why?  It is what is underneath the tension, the wars, housing problems and everything.<\/p><p>  I congratulate Habitat for Humanity because what the organisation has done is absolutely wonderful.  I am far less interested in what the organisation does in this country than what it does in other countries because I believe we should be able to look after ourselves.  It is our responsibility.  We have vast resources and we should not be whinging or bellyaching.  I am sometimes ashamed, in the area of the city that I live in, when I see the way people behave on social welfare, coming down in dirty, soiled pyjamas, buying trays of booze and wheeling them around in prams.  I compare that with what I saw in Nairobi.  I saw people living with sewage going through their houses, with tin roofs and no furniture.<\/p> <p>They send their children out absolutely immaculate.  They have respect for themselves and look wonderful.

They have touched on a very important subject, to which there are two aspects: developing and developed countries which are very different.  I have been deeply involved for quite a long time in improving housing conditions.  In this country many thousands of people are virtually homeless because of the situation that has been evolving for several years.  Serious forward planning is required in dealing with housing provision, at least ten years in advance.  There is no sense in trying to do it a year or two years in advance.  In developing countries one has the advantage of providing good quality housing from the beginning on what is virtually a greenfield site.  It is easier and more cost-effective to do it that way.  We can learn from experience.  It is very easy to obtain dramatic results in a short space of time, using a multiplicity of agencies, taking advantage of aid and the natural environment which can be helpful or unhelpful.  Development in the United States takes place in Roman-type grids with straight lines which are simple to follow.  We do not like that system in this country and did not take that route.  In the United States they started with greenfield sites and used all of the knowledge and information available from Roman times.  We have forgotten some of the basic things learned during years, particularly about irrigation, as was seen during the flooding in the United Kingdom.  Modern engineers have forgotten these things.<\/p><p>  I have been deeply opposed to the emergence of voluntary housing.  This is not a shot at Habitat for Humanity, but 15 years ago I predicted that it would fail to address the issues involved and it did.  There was a tendency which remains to some extent to provide public authority housing by using the semi-private sector, but that did not work for a multiplicity of reasons.  We are now in the situation about which my colleagues have talked and it is too late, as the crisis is upon us.  Some like-minded colleagues and I have spoken about it in the House.  I was castigated in the media for some of the things I had said in the House 15 years ago, but these issues come back to bite us eventually and we are now trying to patch up a crisis which is not so easy to do.  Everybody believes there are houses available, that the National Asset Management Agency has them, but we do not have them in the places where they are needed, where the population is.  They are in other parts of the country where the population does not require such accommodation.  Sadly, the forward planning was appalling and we now have to live with it.<\/p><p>  A few years ago at the peak of the boom I was involved in a local authority initiative to provide affordable housing for people on the local authority housing list.  We built approximately 100 houses.  Unlike the private voluntary housing association, we did not get the sites for free or &euro;1 each; we had to pay &euro;25,000 for them.  We were able to build houses on these sites from the local authorities for between &euro;135,000 and &euro;175,000.  When they were sold to the tenants, they were on the market at between &euro;390,000 and &euro;420,000.  That gives one an idea of the nonsense that was going on and we knew full well what was happening.  There was a lot of profiteering in the business.  The State moved away from providing houses for people from industrial wage level down, those who would ordinarily qualify for local authority housing, because it was too much trouble to provide them.  That was a woeful mistake and the consequences are now being felt.  It is a serious crisis. <\/p><p>  To go back to the Romans - Senator David Norris would be an expert in this area because he soldiered with them - it is important to remember that as the standard of living and the quality of life increase in every civilisation, the population falls; whether we like it, that is the way it happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014021900006#E00400","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1392822000,"counter":290,"content":"<p>It does not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014021900006#E00500","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1392822000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>It does actually.

In Lusaka the head of the air force lives near a shanty town and he would not even allow people to use his water and they had to travel elsewhere.  What kind of commitment is given by the official states?  We often detect a sense of detachment from government representatives with regard to this type of good work.  Many NGOs have experienced this attitude in the Third World.

We know we can never solve the situation of 1.6 billion people living in poor housing by just building or renovating houses or even by sending volunteers; the situation requires many different housing interventions.  We can serve many more families by influencing policy.  Our global colleagues in Habitat International recently conducted a survey across the 70 countries in which Habitat works.  It asked each country to name the biggest obstacles in implementing the programmes.  By far the biggest obstacle was land tenure and the securing of land.  An example of where Habitat has worked to positively influence land tenure is in Haiti.  After the earthquake there was widespread devastation and millions of people were displaced, lost their homes and their lives were shattered.  However, the earthquake did not just cause a disaster, it revealed one.  The country had no building codes and land policies were very blurred.  The Ministry responsible for land was destroyed by the earthquake so all the title deeds of land ownership were destroyed and chaos ensued.  Habitat led a coalition of partners that included other NGOs, UN Habitat and many funding organisations and governments, including the United States and French Governments.  The coalition was an attempt to define the process of how land can be secured and how those policies were to be put in place.  To date, several manuals have been compiled in French, English and Creole to help local people understand how to secure land and to clarify how land can be secured.<\/p><p>  In Zambia our programme is supported by Irish Aid and security of tenure is one of the key objectives of the programme. Habitat does not build houses on land that the homeowner cannot own.  In Ethiopia and in Zambia there are many problems to do with traditional norms.  For example, women are excluded from owning land and may not know their rights.  We put in a lot of work in advocating so that women are aware of their rights and they cannot be evicted on the death of a husband.<\/p><p>  Our colleagues in Habitat International work very closely with UN Habitat.  We are involved with the working group on post-2015 currently meeting to include shelter as a measurable explicit link in the post-2015 development agenda.  It was only mentioned as a small target in the previous millennium development goals which was to decrease the number of slum-dwellers by 100 million but the reality is that slums continue to grow.  That target was not relevant.  <\/p><p>  Habitat regards its work as being part of the solution, not all of the solution.  We are very committed to working with other partners to ensure that the solution is holistic.

The NGOs are regarded as a kind of service-provider and gap-filler.  That is how we are regarded.  In most cases as government observes our work the relationship has grown stronger over time.<\/p> <p>In most cases, on the basis of the work we do, the relationship has grown stronger over time, which is very encouraging.  In the case of the slum upgrading we do in Addis Ababa, for example, the different offices of the Government have provided a range of supports, from giving us building permits to providing locations for the storage of materials.<\/p><p> There is an issue in terms of planning.  In the case of the slums of Addis Ababa, as it stands we are basically performing a firefighting exercise, trying to keep the houses from falling down on the people.  The idea of planning becomes a type of luxury and we can only prioritise the repair of dwellings.  Ultimately, however, there has to be a long-term solution to this generational issue.  That is why we are appealing to the committee to help us, as members of the international community, by adding their voice to ours.  We are hoping the Irish Government will encourage governments in places like my country to give the issue of housing greater attention.  Domestic effort is critical but, unfortunately, encouragement must come from countries like Ireland.<\/p><p> There was a question around the sustainability, durability and quality of the houses we built.  We are trying to optimise quality relative to cost, while taking account of practical issues and the question of deliverability.  At the moment, the option we have taken is to make improvements to the traditional construction systems.  Houses are built mostly from soil and wood, but people fail to do proper cladding and foundations.  This is where we have focused our improvements and they have been very successful.  Certainly, these houses are much more durable than concrete or brick houses.  They do not require a special foundation; because of their elastic nature, they can be built on settling soils, hard rocks and so on.  The quality control requirement in that regard is not too intensive.<\/p><p> We are aware of the importance of durability.  We do not build houses to last five, ten years or even 20 years.  That time is over before one knows it.  Sustainability is another issue but we are also making it happen.  Regarding the quality of engineering work, it is an issue of concern to me.  I am always very concerned about engineering education and practice.  It is a question of making engineers aware of the importance of serving poor people by providing them with housing.  My experience is that they are there to serve better-off people.  I was agonised by how poor people live, so I forced myself to change career and become involved in the service of the poor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014021900007#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kebede Abebe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392823200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I am very interested in Mr. Abebe's comments because I have studied this particular issue for many years.  In respect of the durability of the housing units, I realise different countries have different traditions, but if one is spending money in today's economic climate, value for money and cost benefit analyses have to come into it.  In the case of shanty town or slum reconstructions, to what extent is preference given to a greenfield development alongside the original site?  It is far cheaper to start afresh on a greenfield site than to attempt to overhaul an existing tumbledown structure where the money will not go any distance at all.<\/p><p>  In regard to durability, I am not sure whether the witnesses have been involved in the reconstruction effort in Haiti, to give a classic example, or more recently in the Philippines, two areas which suffered very significant devastation.  Members of the committees have visited various locations in recent years where there is a clear urgency, in appalling slum conditions, to provide a reasonable quality of housing.  How people remain calm in those situations I will never understand.  They are a breeding ground for social unrest.  It is a fundamental right of human beings to have reasonable accommodation in which to live.  It is about treating people with some type of dignity.  Durability is an important aspect of that, recognising that in some areas, residents of housing of a less durable nature have suffered very heavily, whereas more durable dwellings have been better able to withstand natural disaster shocks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014021900008#G00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392823200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman for his very good questions.  We take both approaches in serving people in severely slum conditions - mostly reconstruction but also moving some into greenfield areas.  In some locations, the Government gives us open areas on which to build.  They are nicely built, durable houses constructed in rows.  We do not have storms such as those that occur in Haiti, but the dwellings are built to withstand prevailing conditions.  In my service of 12 years, there was only one case where the roof of a house was blown away.  We discovered it was partly a result of workmanship in that specific case.  In general, however, the houses we have built are withstanding the elements.<\/p><p>  As I said, the work we do in slum areas is largely renovation.  It is essentially firefighting to save people's lives today.  There is no long-term planning; it is about putting a roof on people's houses.  The new houses we construct are durable - designed to last at least half a century, according to our estimation.  Repair of these houses using the same materials will not be difficult or costly.  Our objective is to ensure they are easily repairable, cost effective, manageable, easily extended and not susceptible to soil conditions.  They are good quality solutions and the repayments people make are used to build houses for other families.  There is an affordability issue here.  If we propose to build brick houses, for instance, people will not be able to afford them.

I refer to the fact that are no footpaths, street lighting, sanitary services or water system, roads, etc., in certain areas.  In short, it is absolute desolation.  In order to provide the services required by a modern society in such circumstances, a different approach is going to be required.  In my opinion, they would need to be provided from scratch on a greenfield site in order that one would not be obliged to circumnavigate the difficulties which unfortunately exist at present.

Its purpose is to have discussions with a number of stakeholders on domestic and sexual violence.  Members will recall that the committee invited written submissions on this topic.  Each group will be invited to make an opening statement of five minutes, which will be followed by a session of questions and answers.  Each member will be allocated a maximum of ten minutes for a question and answer session.  I would like each question and answer to be followed by another question and answer, rather than having speeches followed by speeches.  I want information exchanged quickly back and forth.<\/p><p>  We realise there are serious problems so I ask that we focus on solutions rather than outline a litany of problems, especially during the questions and answers.  We must establish where to go to find a solution and what we can do to bring about improvements and address the problems.  This approach would be far more beneficial than letting everybody know how awful circumstances are for many because we know that already.  In saying this, I do not want to sound glib.<\/p><p>  I welcome all the delegates.  I apologise for the delay as we had a number of housekeeping matters concerning justice to address.  These are quite time consuming and demanding, as one can appreciate.  I welcome Ms Fiona Ryan from Sonas Domestic Violence Charity, Ms Sharon O'Halloran from SAFE Ireland, Ms Orla O&rsquo;Connor from the National Women's Council of Ireland, Ms Fiona Crowley from Amnesty International Ireland, Ms Catherine Joyce from Barnardos, Ms Orla Muldoon from the University of Limerick, Ms Niamh Wilson from the Domestic Violence Advocacy Service, Ms Eibhlin Byrne from the Child and Family Agency, a new agency to which responsibility has been transferred from the HSE&rsquo;s child and family service, Mr. Brian Killoran from the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Ms Margaret O'Keeffe from MOVE Ireland, Mr. John Doyle from the Men&rsquo;s Development Network, Ms Margaret Martin from Women&rsquo;s Aid, and Mr. Don Hennessy, an expert in this area and member of the public.<\/p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

I was delighted to hear the committee wants to adopt a solution-focused approach to these hearings.  The truth is that those of us working in domestic violence services go about what we do from a solution-focused approach every single day because we encounter some of the most intractable and, in cases, horrendous realities.  While we offer support, our work is to help find solutions.<\/p><p>  I will begin by telling members a little about Sonas Domestic Violence Charity because many of them will not know who we are.<\/p> <p>Sonas is a domestic violence charity, one of the largest providers in the State of services to women and children experiencing domestic violence.  We work across the greater Dublin area and more recently into Wicklow, as Deputy Anne Ferris knows.  We work intensively with almost 620 women and children every year.  Probably the biggest group in our services are children, which might be surprising to many members of the committee.<\/p><p> We decided to make children the key focus of our submission to this committee, not because we did not want to tell their mothers' stories but because we wanted to present the reality of the 300 to 400 children we engage with every year, many of whom are silent witnesses to acts of unspeakable violence.  First, the children whose mothers come to Sonas for support, tend to be young.  I appreciate that members of the committee want to hear solutions but one needs to understand the extent of the problem with which we are dealing.  Two out of three children with whom Sonas works are under the age of ten, while the biggest group in our services, around one third of children, are under the age of five.  That has an impact on services.  We are dealing with very young families in many cases and we are talking about particular vulnerabilities.  As anyone involved in child welfare and protection will say, the age of the child is one of the risk factors.<\/p><p> I genuinely do not wish to distress the committee but there are harsh realities that need to be understood.  We have babies in our services who have been punched because their mothers were holding them at the time they were attacked.  We have children who witnessed their mothers being sexually assaulted, including a two year-old who was in a studio apartment at the time.  I am using clean clinical language to describe the reality of these children's lives and what they have been through.<\/p><p> I promised one of our clients that I would tell his story, so I would like to do so.  His name is Liam and he is aged ten.  He said:<blockquote>Before moving to Sonas, I lived with my Mam and my brother.  My Mam's boyfriend was really mean to all of us.  He locked me in rooms and pushed me down the stairs.  He used to call my Mam bad names and hurt her.  I remember sounds of crying, screaming and things breaking.  I used to wish I was a superhero and have magic powers so I could make him disappear.  I hit him once to make him stop choking my Mam.  I was scared but I felt I had to protect her.<\/blockquote>I am not telling the committee this to create shock because the truth is that in the services in which we are engaged, this is not shocking.  This is often a reality for many of the children with whom we work.  I am happy to report, however, that Liam and his family are doing a lot better.  His mother is getting the help she needs and he has a sports coach who thinks he is brilliant.  He wanted the committee to know that.<\/p><p> Liam's story tells a lot about what children exposed to domestic violence go through, including anxiety and physical and psychological violence.  The bottom line is that domestic violence robs children of their sense of safety and well-being at a fundamental level of their childhood.  Make no bones about it: perpetrators of domestic violence do not just target the adult woman in this situation.  More often than not, they target the child as well, or use the child for extra leverage over the mother.  We have mothers in our service who were not allowed to get up in the middle of the night to comfort their children.<\/p><p> I want to ensure we all understand the reality of domestic violence, including a person who has to flee the home they might have paid for, with their children, because it is no longer bearable and they no longer feel protected.<\/p><p> I will now talk about solutions.  We are obviously heartened by the development of the new Child and Family Agency and that domestic violence is within its remit.  We feel there is an agency there with which we can work, rather than our work being spread across many different agencies.  We hope the agency will be adequately resourced around this work.  We can talk about the realities and give platitudes, but we must resource such work and services.  We must also recognise the extent of need and understand it is a continuing requirement.  We need refuges, supported housing and safe housing.  There are different solutions for different presenting needs, and if this is not appreciated then, frankly, we are going nowhere.<\/p><p> We think solutions can be found through housing.  Sonas is probably the largest provider in this State of housing to women and children experiencing domestic violence.  Domestic violence is a leading cause of women and their children becoming homeless or becoming at risk of homelessness.  We tend to think of domestic violence purely in terms of interpersonal relationships, but we forget that a whole structural system response is required, including housing.<\/p><p> We have some solid recommendations to make in this regard.  Establishing a place of safety and a home is crucial.  The current shortage of affordable housing, particularly in Dublin, is making that an extremely difficult challenge for women.  It means women are reluctant to seek help.  I will cite an example, but the members here will know this.  The average rent allowance in the Dublin area is &euro;900 to &euro;950 for a lone parent or a family with two children.  That is the maximum one is allowed.  Rents are averaging &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,400 per month, which means there is a shortfall of &euro;350 to &euro;450.  Can one imagine being in a state of crisis and having to flee?  The person may be on social welfare and has to come up with &euro;350 or &euro;450 to avail of private accommodation.  There are not enough houses, so women and children who are experiencing domestic violence are even more at risk because of this housing shortage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392818700,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ryan for staying within the time allocated.

SAFE Ireland is a national representative voice for domestic violence services throughout Ireland.  We are working to ensure that one day Ireland can be proud to be the safest country in the world for women and children.  There are many areas we would like to present to the committee today and we are delighted therefore that some of our members and colleagues will be addressing these areas, which are housing and homelessness, impacts on children, the impact of habitual residency, particularly on migrant women, and additional barriers for migrant women, ethnic minority women and women with disabilities.<\/p><p>  I also wish to highlight our belief that to tackle the issue of domestic violence, there needs to be significant investment in primary prevention strategies and awareness campaigns designed to change attitudes and behaviours in this country.  We need to break apart the stereotypes of the victim and abuser and replace our shame culture with one of openness and care.<\/p><p>  In 2012, SAFE Ireland recorded that 8,449 and 3,606 children received direct one-to-one support from specialist domestic violence support services in Ireland.  In the same year, domestic violence services answered in excess of 50,000 helpline calls from throughout the country.  I acknowledge the work of the critical front-line domestic violence services throughout the country.  They are lifelines to women and children.<\/p><p>  Domestic violence is an enormous and horrific societal problem both globally and in Ireland.  We know from a forthcoming EU prevalence study by the Fundamental Rights Agency that approximately 10% of women who experienced a serious incident of physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner have sought support from a victim support service or refuge.  That being the case, we are dealing with the tip of the iceberg.  SAFE Ireland will be co-hosting a seminar in Dublin on 5 March that will launch this prevalence study, which is the largest of its kind in Europe.<\/p><p>  SAFE Ireland believes that the issue of domestic violence needs to be held at the highest decision-making level in Ireland until such time as we have sufficient infrastructure, investment and innovation in place to support victims, reduce prevalence and hold perpetrators accountable for their crimes.<\/p><p>  We believe it is time to stop seeing the solution to this as personal to the woman, ingrained in her choice to stay or leave an abusive, violent relationship.  We must be more consistent in holding perpetrators of violence to account.  Our current review of the legal system through the lens of women's experiences has been carried out because women told us that there has never been any criminal prosecution for the litany of crimes committed against them.  Women have told us they did not have their, in their own words, \"day in court\".  This is disturbing when on hears that the crimes committed included repeated rape, child abuse, murder of the unborn child, attempted murder, threats to kill, assault causing harm, harassment, mental torture, bullying, stalking and false imprisonment.<\/p> <p>Safe Ireland believes it is critical to have a root and branch review of the legal system to address what appear to be systemic failures.  Much of the legal system response to date has been to focus on civil remedies, which are important in addressing immediate safety issues but not designed to address the crimes committed against the victims.  Over the past six years, we have developed a substantial body of knowledge based on women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s experience of domestic violence.  Our current research of women&rsquo;s experiences of the legal system has identified eight consistent and overarching themes which form the basis of our recommendations, already submitted to the committee for consideration.<\/p><p> The emerging themes that require consideration and urgent attention are the right to be heard - collection, preservation and presentation of evidence; the consequences of the court not hearing the evidence; consistency and continuity in the application of the law; the victim and perpetrator stereotypes; the importance of good advocacy, expertise and policing; the need for a legal definition of domestic violence; why she does not just leave; and the dangers of a fragmented system.  There are 27 recommendations that flow from these themes that require our attention and consideration.  As we have developed them, we have been mindful of any unintended consequences for the victim.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the progress made by the Government in recent months to legislate for its statutory duty to care for and protect victims of domestic and sexual violence through the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla.  We also welcome the commitment by the Minister for Justice and Equality to implement the EU directive on victims&rsquo; rights by 2015, the recent publication of the heads of the child and family relations Bill, last week&rsquo;s commitment to publish a new domestic violence Bill in 2015 and the Government&rsquo;s plans to establish a family law court.  The next 12 months offers the Administration considerable opportunities to develop infrastructure and legislative change which will have the potential to make a significant and positive difference for thousands of women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sharon O'Halloran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392819300,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms O'Halloran, for your presentation and recommendations.

We represent over 180 member groups from a diversity of backgrounds, sectors and locations.  The council chairs the observatory on violence against women, providing a space for our members and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, to work collectively to eliminate all forms of violence against women, including sexual violence and prostitution.<\/p><p>  Violence against women is a violation of women&rsquo;s core human rights and it impacts on all women and all of society.  It has a devastating impact on women&rsquo;s physical and mental health, as well as being an obstacle to women participating fully in economic, social, political or cultural life.  We believe it is both a cause and consequence of women&rsquo;s inequality.  The council has submitted to the committee over 15 recommendations but I will focus on several.<\/p><p>  The European Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence recognises violence against women as a violation of women&rsquo;s human rights and recognises state responsibility to prevent its occurrence, protect victims and punish perpetrators.  In March 2012, at the 19th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Ireland accepted the recommendation put forward by Austria at the universal periodic review to sign the convention.  Ireland stated: &ldquo;Ireland can accept in principle the terms of the convention.&rdquo;<\/p><p>  More than a year has elapsed since this announcement.  The council is asking the Government to sign and ratify this convention as a matter of urgency.  In December, the observatory on violence against women launched a new publication, Violence Against Women - An Issue of Gender, and, again, called on the Government to ratify the convention.  Deputy Anne Ferris kindly agreed to speak at that launch.  This is a core issue for our members who are highlighting this in a campaign.<\/p><p>  The sexual abuse and violence in Ireland, SAVI, report was published in 2002.  To develop clear comparative analysis, a SAVI II report is required to evaluate changes over the past decade and provide an evidence base to inform contemporary responses to the issue of sexual violence.  The council calls for this research to be commissioned and resourced.<\/p><p>  Over the past several years, as Ireland has experienced recession and austerity, front-line services to women experiencing domestic and sexual violence have experienced significant cuts.  Now, as we are moving out of recession, it is important to prioritise crucial services and reinstate some of that funding.  We have witnessed an unprecedented growth in demand for these services.  It is a false economy to continue with those cuts.  We call for an increase in funding to organisations providing front-line services and supports to survivors of violence against women to offset budgets cuts in recent years.<\/p><p>  Domestic and sexual violence committed against already marginalised women is of great concern to the council.  Within that, the requirement to satisfy the habitual residence condition has particular gender implications.  The council recommends the habitual residence condition is amended to make an exception in cases of domestic violence against women, so that women can have ease of access to refuge and other support services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1392819300,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms O'Connor, for your presentation and focusing on solutions.

We welcome the opportunity to emphasise some of our key points we made in our submission to that consultation.<\/p><p>  Domestic and sexual violence is a serious global human rights concern and, from the evidence already presented today, it remains a serious human rights issue nationally too.  Accordingly, it is welcome the committee is considering how Ireland addresses these issues.  We urge the committee to place due emphasis on women and girls as those most subject to this human rights abuse.  It must be recognised that domestic violence affects women disproportionately.<\/p><p>  In our submission, we focused on one key step Ireland should take, that is signing and ratifying the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, the Istanbul Convention.  This would not only ensure that Irish law, policy and services are brought up to regional best practice standards, it would also, very importantly, bring improved accountability, as well as the sharing of good practice with other states in this region.<\/p><p>  The background to this convention is the prevalence in Europe.  In 2006, the Council of Europe conducted a regional campaign to highlight the issues.  The campaign revealed significant and concerning variations in member states&rsquo; laws, policies and supports, as well as the need for more harmonised legal standards and responses.  After several years of negotiation by justice ministries, including Ireland&rsquo;s, the convention was adopted in May 2011 in Istanbul.  It will come into force when there have been ten ratifications including by eight member states, so we are two ratifications short.  In November 2013, Denmark became the 32nd member state to sign the convention, so Ireland is coming late to the table.<\/p><p>  We urge the committee to recommend that Ireland signs the convention without further delay and takes the necessary measures to ensure its swift ratification.<\/p> <p>The convention establishes a gold standard comprehensive framework for governments to take action in this area.  Due to the fact that it is not only women who experience domestic violence, parties are also encouraged to provide the protective framework to children, men and older people who are exposed to violence within the family.  However, the Council of Europe cautions that it cannot be overlooked that the majority of victims of domestic violence are women and that violence against them is part of a wider pattern of discrimination and inequality which also needs to be addressed in the state party.  <\/p><p> The convention extends beyond domestic and sexual violence, of course, and also requires the criminalisation of forced marriage, female genital mutilation, forced abortion and sterilisation.  The convention provides for the establishment of a group of experts - referred to as GREVIO - to monitor its implementation.  Parties to the convention must report periodically to GREVIO, which may also seek information from NGOs and national human rights institutions such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  GREVIO may also conduct official country visits.  Based on the state party's report and other information it gathers, GREVIO will draft a report analysing the implementation of the convention in the state and making suggestions and recommendations in respect of any gaps or problems it has identified.   The state must submit the GREVIO report to its national parliament, thus making national parliaments and their committees a valuable partner in the monitoring process.  GREVIO's reports and conclusions are aimed at helping the state, not just criticising it.  GREVIO may also adopt general recommendations to all states parties.  I am sure the committee will agree, therefore, that this monitoring mechanism is a very important part of the convention.  As well as promoting accountability for poor practices, it will facilitate the identification and sharing of good practices among states.  This is the added value for Ireland if it is indeed serious about combating these serious human rights violations.<\/p><p> The Irish Government appears to be in favour of acceding to the convention, as evidenced by its response to the Austrian recommendation in the universal periodic review in 2012.  From replies we have received from the Department of Justice and Equality, we know that Ireland supports the provisions of the convention in principle.  However, the replies from the Department have repeatedly stated that the detailed provisions of the convention and the legislative and administrative arrangements necessary to allow signature and ratification of the convention by Ireland are being examined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900005#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Crowley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392819900,"counter":334,"content":"<p>There is a phone on somewhere.

The committee will be aware that there has been a suggestion that there is some constitutional bar to Ireland's ratification.  In the D&aacute;il last year, the Minister for Justice and Equality suggested that he needed to understand whether the barring orders provision conflicted with the property rights provision in the Constitution.  Our position is that regardless of whether further research into compatibility is required, it should not constitute a barrier to Ireland's at least signing the convention.  Ireland has signed many other human rights conventions without its domestic law being in full compliance and then moved to ratification once legal compliance is in place.  For instance, it signed the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings in 2007, only ratifying in 2010 when its laws and national action plan were in place.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, I remind the committee that when seeking election to the UN Human Rights Council in 2012, Ireland pledged to play a full role in global efforts to combat violence against women and promote gender equality.  It must now do so at home as well.  We recommend that the committee recommend to the Minister that Ireland immediately sign the convention and take necessary measures to ensure its swift ratification.  This would constitute a practical and important step and solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900006#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1392819900,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Crowley and apologise for rushing her.

This is an issue that arises quite frequently in the context of Barnardos' work with children and families across Ireland.  Over the last few years, many of our services have reported increased incidences of violence in families with which we work, which is attributable in some part to the impact of the recession and increased pressures on parents.  Other speakers have outlined the kind of violence with which families, particularly women and children, deal in the family home so I will not go into that again.  What we want to highlight is the impact of that on children.  There is a link between domestic violence and child abuse but even where children are not direct victims of violence, the emotional impact of that violence has serious consequences for their development, particularly their social and emotional well-being.  Living with that type of stress, anxiety, fear and dread has an incredible impact on their self-esteem, confidence and ability to form relationships and friendships in childhood and adulthood.  It also has serious consequences for their education.<\/p><p>  The Chairman mentioned prevention.  One thing to note is that children learn from parents, as we all know.  Situations in which children are growing up in a house with domestic violence can feed its intergenerational nature as children think that this is the norm in intimate relationships.  That is something that also needs to be looked at.  It is timely that the committee is looking at the issue of domestic violence.  We very much welcome the fact that the responsibility for this area has moved to the Child and Family Agency and are hopeful that this opportunity will increase collaboration across all Government Departments to improve responses to domestic violence for women and children.  <\/p><p>  I will outline some key areas relating to services and legal supports that we think could improve the situation for women and children.  Research shows that women are sometimes afraid to report abuse because they fear their children will be taken into care.  The child welfare and protection system has a responsibility to respond effectively to the complex needs that arise in domestic violence situations.  In particular, prevention, family and parenting support and therapeutic services for both parents and children need to be included in the range of services offered to support families and help them deal with the trauma of such violence.  It is particularly important that waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services are addressed.

Having to wait any length of time for services, particularly the year or two years that children currently have to wait, is unsustainable for them.  The delay compounds the trauma and issues caused by violence in the home.<\/p><p>  Barnardos also echoes and supports calls for the protection of refuge services for children and families and calls for a greater holistic response to domestic violence, particularly with regard to adult and child services, across areas such as housing, health, social welfare and all other relevant Departments.  We need greater collaboration and an inter-agency approach to dealing with the issues across child and adult services.  <\/p><p>  In respect of the legal system, barring orders play a key role in helping to protect women and children.  The lengthy delays sometimes experienced in granting barring orders place children at significant risk.  We support calls made by Women's Aid last year to introduce a 24-7 on-call system for emergency barring orders to ensure that women and children can get protection as soon as they need it and that they are not left in situations that are potentially harmful or life-threatening.  Last year, Barnardos welcomed the Minister's commitment to reforming Ireland's family law system.  Domestic violence needs to be given particular attention within this process, given the complexity of cases and the potentially serious impact of poor decision making on children.  <\/p><p>  As other people have mentioned, leaving situations of domestic violence can be a particularly dangerous time for women and children and issues around custody of and access to children can exacerbate the risk to both the abused parent and their children.  Listening to children and giving their best interests priority in decisions around custody and access are vital in these situations.  We welcome the inclusion of these principles in the recently published heads of the children and family relationships Bill.  Courts must be provided with independent ways to capture the voice of the child and be trained to understand the difficulty for children in sharing their views, especially in situations in which they have lived with the secrecy of domestic violence and have been told for many years not to share what has happened in the home.  Expressing their views should not be a further traumatic experience for children.  They must be given safe space and the chance to develop trusted relationships with those seeking to ascertain their views and wishes.<\/p><p>  One of the key lessons recently for Barnardos and One Family from the contact centres we run has been the importance to the courts of having an independent and trusted family assessment to inform their decisions in complex and difficult cases.  Such assessments have been invaluable in supporting courts in making decisions in the best interests of the children.  Where there is a history of domestic violence, it is vital that the courts are able to assess the risk of harm to children - either direct risk of violence during access or contact or the risk to their emotional well-being where they are being used to manipulate or attack another parent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900006#G00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1392820500,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Joyce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900007#H00100","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392820500,"counter":343,"content":"<p>May I finish on one point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900007#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1392820500,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Very briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900007#H00300","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392820500,"counter":345,"content":"<p>My point relates to mediation.

I am Professor of Psychology at University of Limerick and, along with my colleagues Catherine Naughton and Dr. Aisling O'Donnell, I have been conducting a programme of research on the impact of domestic violence, with particular reference to its implications for children.  We are a group of psychologists and have no particular expertise in the area of law or the provision of care.  We are really just here to outline findings of research we have conducted and to integrate those findings into the wider international literature, which we have done in our longer submission.  I wish to tell the committee about two studies.  The first is a recently completed study of 485 students aged between 16 and 25 in which we asked students to tell us how much exposure to domestic violence they had experienced.  What is very clear from this study is that in a normal sample of university students there is a considerable degree of exposure to domestic violence, with, at the low end, 54% of young people reporting that they had seen one parent scream or yell at or threaten the other parent occasionally, while 31.6% stated that this behaviour was a regular occurrence.  At the higher end, the question related to whether or not they had witnessed one parent kick, hit, choke or shove the other parent or pull their hair.   A total of 16% reported this behaviour as being occasional while 8% reported that it was a regular occurrence.  When we take the internationally validated measure that we have used, we find that about one in two students out of our sample have experienced multiple events that one could call domestic violence and that about 13% report regular experience of domestic violence in their own homes.  Picking up on the point made by Ms Crowley, where she has a single example, we would argue that this problem is endemic for children and young people.  <\/p><p>  We would also argue that while, as a nation, we have been concerned about the experiences of children and have put measures in place to protect them in schools and institutions, it is now time to put measures in place to protect children in their own homes.  Indeed, it is arguable that it is the place where they should be protected most.  In our longer submission we detail the large body of research that highlights the negative consequences of domestic violence for children.  If we want to address prevention into the next generation, there is no question that not exposing children to domestic violence is key.  There is considerable evidence that those children who are exposed will become victims or perpetrators.  A good first step would be acknowledging that domestic violence has consequences for children.  <\/p><p>  A second aim of that study and a second part of the analysis concerns children and young people who do well and those who do not do well.  What we find is that those who do best and have the best health and well-being are those who have strong social bonds with either peers or family members.  These are strong, positive buffering relationships with other people, be they family or peers.  When we look at our exposed group, we can see that although their well-being is poorer, one will find that where strong positive family or peer bonds are in place their health is comparable to those people who have had low exposure.  A key thing that we know from the literature is that children who have been exposed to domestic violence are often stigmatised.  One thing we need to do to protect children is to destigmatise it and find a way to support these social bonds, because if children are stigmatised when they disclose that they have come from a family where domestic violence was normative, for want of a better word, it is not likely that they will be able to build strong social bonds.  There is a strong action point in here about increasing awareness of the effect of domestic violence on children and reducing the stigma associated with domestic violence for children's parents and families more generally.  In our longer submission, we have given some ideas about how other countries have had these kinds of campaigns and interventions.<\/p><p>  The second study, which was very quick, is one we conducted with judges who were involved in custody and access cases, particularly where issues of domestic violence arose.  What one finds is that judges report that they find the decisions to be very difficult and complex and that they are not sure how to protect family relationships while not putting children at risk.  Our findings suggest that in this discretionary area of the law, there is a need for judicial education and for judges to be supported in their decision making.  Those are our main points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900007#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1392820500,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Muldoon.

The Domestic Violence Advocacy Service, DVAS, is a support and advocacy service for women at risk of abuse and violence in intimate relationships.  In our daily work, we witness the myriad of barriers women face in attempting to access safety for themselves and their children.  Some of these barriers are created by State responses, so we wish to take this opportunity to highlight two key issues that we believe underpin particular weaknesses in the State's response to domestic violence.<\/p><p>  The first example I wish to highlight refers to the 2011 housing regulations that have excluded women who are joint owners of the family home from being assessed for social housing supports.  This in turn leads to women in this situation who are experiencing domestic violence being deemed as ineligible for rent supplement.  In 2013, 12 women accessing our service who sought to leave home because it was no longer safe for themselves or their children could not access alternative accommodation because of these regulations.  Local authorities, although sympathetic to the dilemma this placed the women in, were unable to step outside of the housing regulations to make exceptions.  After prolonged periods of advocacy from the DVAS, during which the women remained at risk, four women were provided with a short-term interim payment for accommodation support by the Department of Social Protection community welfare service.  The DVAS wishes to acknowledge that at local level, the local authorities and the Department of Social Protection collaborated with us to find a solution to this problem and have agreed a local protocol.  However, decisions by the Department will continue to be made on a case-by-case basis subsequent to a risk assessment and advocacy provided by the DVAS.  This may provide a solution to those women who access our service, but there remains a concern about those women who experience domestic violence and who do not approach us or any other domestic violence service for support.  We know from a forthcoming EU prevalence study that approximately 11%  of women experiencing domestic violence might access a victim support service or refuge.  We support the recommendation made by Safe Ireland that the 2011 housing regulations be amended to ensure that all women presenting for social housing support because of domestic violence are assessed as eligible when it is clear that they cannot provide alternative accommodation from their own means. <\/p><p>  The second issue has already been addressed by Safe Ireland but I wish to take this opportunity to provide information from our service in support of its submission. Its soon-to-be-published research illustrates that even where legislation and policy are fit for purpose, their efficacy can only be assured when those charged with their application and enforcement are fully equipped with knowledge and understanding about domestic violence.  In addition, informed and evidence-based responses must be delivered within strong institutional mechanisms that are primarily focused on accountability for how victims are protected from further victimisation and harm.  Where legislation including the Domestic Violence Act and the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act have been enforced and the Garda and courts have worked together to hold the perpetrator to account, women have reported to us that their safety and that of their children have increased significantly.  Numerous other positive outcomes are then possible once this safety is achieved.  However, many of the problems lie in the inconsistent enforcement and application of legislation in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The experiences of our service users indicate a worrying level of inconsistent responses.  We have received reports of highly effective responses but we have also received a number of reports where this did not happen.  Examples of ineffective practice from our data include women who are told there is nothing the Garda can do unless they have a court order, even though they have reported a crime, women not being informed that they could make a statement even though a crime had taken place, and women understanding that they had made a formal complaint when reporting to the Garda but subsequently realising upon accessing our service that no complaint can be made until a formal statement is taken and signed by the woman.<\/p> <p>Our records also indicate a significant discrepancy between the level of crime women are experiencing and the level of subsequent prosecutions and convictions.  In a review of our case files in 2010, 64 of our service users reported a total of 157 crimes to us including assault causing harm, rape, sexual assault, threats to kill and false imprisonment.  Half of these women, 32, reported the crimes to the Garda and on 12 occasions statements were made.  There is a record of only one prosecution proceeding and no conviction of any of the perpetrators of the reported crimes in that year.<\/p><p> While our records do not provide a comprehensive overview of Garda or court responses, we assert that these records reflect the experience of our service users and of women throughout Ireland.  The effective decriminalisation of domestic violence is leading to a situation where perpetrators continue to abuse and violate with impunity and woman and children remain unprotected.  We therefore support the recommendations emerging from the Safe Ireland legal and housing research.  Strong institutional mechanisms focusing on accountability of all agencies responsible for the protection of women and children should be prioritised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900007#H00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Wilson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392821100,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I will be brief because the role of the Child and Family Agency is very much as the backdrop to the front-line services and to be a support to those services which are working with the victims of abuse in all its forms.  I am the executive manager in the chief executive's office in the Child and Family Agency.  He is committed to this problem and we acknowledge that the sector is fragile and in need of much consolidation, and that is why it is not being put directly under services but being kept within the chief executive's office.  I am joined by Ms Joan Mullan, our newly-appointed project manager, who will be the operational lead for the Child and Family Agency in designing the roadmap for services.<\/p><p>  From 1 January 2014, only the last six weeks, domestic, sexual and gender based violence, DSGBV, services have been under the remit of Tusla, as the Child and Family Agency is known.  Under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 we hold responsibility for the wider health services.  It is unique in that most of our services relate to children but in terms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence we work with all families where violence is present, not just those families where children are affected, although we all realise the effect on all children where domestic violence takes place in the home.<\/p><p>  There are many areas which we need to prioritise but we have recognised two particular areas.  We need a system of national oversight.  We work under the oversight provided by Cosc, and the national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender based violence, but the services are delivered throughout the country by a variety of national, voluntary and local organisations all with their own remits, boards and management structures.  A key challenge for the agency will be how to draw all these services together in a comprehensive response to domestic, sexual and gender based violence which is not just dependent on whether one is a child, woman or man in Clonakilty or Coolock, but ensures one gets the same response wherever one lives.  The second priority is to move from a national response to regional co-ordination and local management.  A key issue for our agency will be responses at the most local, practical level.  We do not want diktats coming nationally which do not match local needs.<\/p><p>  In 2013 we funded 20 crisis refuges, 16 rape crisis centres and 24 support services.  Crisis refuges accounted for 57% of our total budget, rape crisis centres 23% and support services 20%.  The money was spent fairly equally around the country, approximately &euro;4 million in each region.  However, within those regions it is not well-dispersed.  Some areas are very well provided with services while others have no services at all.  That will be a challenge for us.  We will need to examine how we disperse services throughout the country.  Like all services we will face reductions in 2014.  We will face a 2.5% reduction in this sector, as in our other services.  Our regional directors have been asked to examine their budgets for 2014 to reduce regionally their budgets by 2.5%, but they must make the decision where, within their region, they must make those cuts and where the greatest needs are within regions.  Where possible we are trying to address local needs.<\/p><p>  We are very conscious that we need to work with other Departments, for example the Department of Justice and Equality in terms of legislation improvement and, very importantly, with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in housing which is a major priority.  There are many challenges.  The beds we seek for people who are suffering from domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are very often used to address homelessness as well.  That is a particular problem for us and we have worked very closely with Safe Ireland on this and it has given us very good advice.  As well as Safe Ireland we have worked with Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, and these two networks have supported the agency.  A tendering process will take place in the next two months to identify what supports are required to deliver the services nationally and they will be tendered.<\/p><p>  This new agency, the drawing together of services and the fact that we will have a real national operational plan for the first time gives us an opportunity to examine a more streamlined service delivery to decide what we can do better in terms of delivering services for the children and families.  I would like to examine how we will deliver services within communities.  While I strongly believe we need to support refuges, crisis centres, etc., we have not addressed the issue for the women, men and children who are anonymous sufferers in their homes.  Are our social workers and therapeutic workers in communities qualified to recognise and deal with domestic violence in the homes where people have not sought services elsewhere?  I look forward to working with my colleagues as we go forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900008#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eibhlin Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392821100,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank the committee and its members on behalf of the Domestic Violence Coalition for the opportunity to speak on this important topic.  The Domestic Violence Coalition comprises ten nationwide front-line organisations and combines services working primarily to support women who are experiencing domestic abuse and those working to support persons from a migrant background.  The members of the coalition are Women's Aid, Adapt Domestic Abuse Services, Ascend Domestic Abuse Services, Doras Luimn&iacute;, Nasc &ndash; the Irish Immigration Support Centre, the Domestic Violence Advocacy Service Sligo, AkiDwA, Longford Women&rsquo;s Link, Sonas Housing and the Immigrant Council of Ireland.<\/p><p>  The focus of the coalition has arisen from the experiences and difficulties encountered by all its member groups in providing support and services to women from a migrant background, both from the European Union and beyond, who are experiencing domestic violence and abuse.  In all circumstances of domestic abuse the immediate safety and security of the women involved is paramount.  However, in circumstances where the woman is from a migrant background, she may face restrictions and limitations on her ability to access support and safety by virtue of her limited immigration status or her inability to access public funds because of tests such as the habitual residency condition.  These additional barriers and obstacles not only cause considerable difficulties for women seeking support, but also cause considerable fear and uncertainty for women who are considering reaching out.  This uncertainty is often used as a further method of control by her abuser.  Many of those who approach us cite a fear that they will be deported if they come forward.<\/p><p>  The problem from an immigration perspective mainly impacts upon women from outside the EU and revolves around the issue of dependence of immigration status.  Often when a person is given permission to live in Ireland based on their family circumstances, such as being married to an Irish citizen, the continuation of that status is based primarily on the continuance of that relationship.  When the relationship ends, or couples no longer cohabit, the separation places the dependant person&rsquo;s immigration status in question.  It becomes necessary at this point for that person to seek an immigration status that is independent of their former relationship.  As many of the members will be aware, there is an absence of legal provisions governing this process and the issuing of this status is more often than not at the complete discretion of the Minister and the immigration authorities.<\/p><p>  As a result of successful lobbying by the Domestic Violence Coalition the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service issued a policy statement in August 2012 that clarified its position on applications of this nature.<\/p> <p>The Domestic Violence Coalition acknowledges this positive step by the INIS and the Minister, and further acknowledges that, in the majority of cases, applications for independent status are treated sensitively and positively by the immigration authorities.  However, a number of issues remain unresolved.  There is a need to formally recognise domestic violence in immigration law.  The policies of INIS are governed by the discretion of the Minister and as such are often unclear.  Often the lack of clarity surrounding the process adds an added level of pressure, fear and uncertainty to an already very vulnerable situation.  The impending publication of the immigration, residency and protection Bill by the Minister is an opportunity to legislate for these circumstances in detail.<\/p><p> Reform of current administrative process is required between now and when legislation is possible.  The processing time for applications can vary from two weeks to six months in some cases.  We acknowledge that the Department handles applications very quickly in some circumstances, but in other cases the processing time can take a number of months, during which time the person is in a very vulnerable situation, often without an immigration status.<\/p><p> We have concerns over the fee attached to the immigration application.  Women from outside the EU who are successful in receiving an independent immigration status are then required to register or reregister their presence with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  In the majority of cases this incurs a fee of &euro;300 to be issued with a certificate of registration.  In cases where the women have no financial means or have no access to public funds, this fee is a monumental obstacle to them regaining their immigration status and getting their lives back on track.  There are a number of exceptions to paying this fee, such as those formally recognised as victims of human trafficking, but to date the INIS has refused to add victims of domestic violence to the list of exceptions.  This must be carried out with immediate effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Killoran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392821700,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Killoran to conclude as his time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900009#K00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392821700,"counter":355,"content":"<p>May I take 20 seconds to conclude?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900009#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Killoran"},{"type":"speech","time":1392821700,"counter":356,"content":"<p>That is acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900009#K00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392821700,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Reflecting much of what we have heard already, the second main concern of the coalition relates to the habitual residency condition.

The law and social policy elements have been informed by my work there.  Today I am speaking on behalf of MOVE Ireland, with which I have been working as a volunteer for the past 13 years.  I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this important discussion.  Not surprisingly some of what I have to say will echo the concerns outlined earlier.<\/p><p>  MOVE stands for men overcoming violence and is an organisation that has been in Ireland for some 25 years.  In that time it has evolved from using a mainly self-help approach to one which prioritises the safety of women and children living with or affected by domestic violence.  We work with men in a structured group programme using an accredited and recognised programme of delivery.  We recognise that domestic violence and abuse is predominantly in the context of a man being the perpetrator, and a woman and possibly children being victims.  We consider the safety of women and children as the bedrock on which we organise and develop the work we do with men.  We only work with men in a heterosexual context.  At the moment there is no service for people in same-sex relationships.<\/p><p>   MOVE offers two services, one for women partners, or ex-partners, and one for men.  When a man wants to join a MOVE programme he has to furnish details of his partner or ex-partner - that is core to the woman's safety - in order that MOVE can make contact with the woman and offer individual support via our dedicated partner contact workers, who are all women with experience in domestic violence outreach work.  These people are from external agencies to maximise safety.  These are all within accredited women's services.  MOVE has found that this can be the first time a woman will have contact with a support service dedicated to her.<\/p><p>  The first priority is to understand what risk the man may pose to the woman and any children, and what type of safety plan can alleviate this.  It is important for us to get the woman&rsquo;s account of the violence or abuse in order to fully understand the dynamics of what is happening, as we have found and the literature shows abusers will generally minimise what they do and downplay its perceived impact.  That is a core safety principle.  Ultimately it is the partner, the woman, who can best attest to whether a man has changed his behaviour.  Any information we receive from partners is used to inform our intervention but never shared or alluded to in working with the men, as this not only would be a breach of privacy, but also potentially dangerous.<\/p><p>  The MOVE partner contact is core to what we do and we work with women for at least three months after a man finishes a programme.  This is important in order to understand if change is happening and being maintained, and to refer the woman on to longer-term support services.  In this situation our partner contact workers are either working in local women&rsquo;s services or have long-standing relationships with them, and may have already introduced a woman to the wider service options available to her and her children.  Her wellbeing and safety are central.<\/p><p>   MOVE adopts an interagency approach.  This is important and consistent with best practice because it widens the information and expertise base, and also creates a unified and clear approach to working with both perpetrators and victims of domestic violence or abuse.  This co-ordinated approach is consistent with what is deemed to be best practice in the field of intervention work with men who abuse in their intimate relationships because he is getting an unequivocal message that what he is doing is wholly unacceptable and will result in sanctions.<\/p><p>  We use a dual focus in working with a man.  The first strand is that domestic violence and abuse takes place in a society which continues to prescribe gender roles for men and women.  Generally women are still conceptualised as the primary care givers and men are still at the top of the work hierarchy.  The split of gender roles creates attitudes around what a woman should provide and what a man can expect to receive.  It is impossible to undertake work with men without recognising this wider structural context for domestic violence and how it is justified by society.  We often tend to see his individual problem when it is a societal issue that demands a clear unequivocal societal response.<\/p><p>  We are talking here at the very least about potentially criminal acts and that is not given sufficient weight.  In the work we do we try to promote positive behavioural change in the man.  Core to that is getting him to recognise that what he is doing is wrong and hurtful, and has a harmful impact.  That is the assessment level when we decide whether the man is sufficiently motivated to change.<\/p><p>  While what we do is very useful and consistent with good practice, we are absolutely clear that we remain a tiny part of a very complex and intricate system which tends not to take full cognisance of the damage done to women and children in domestic violence situations.  Overall we echo the concerns already raised here.  We also recommend that the kinds of mechanisms that have been instituted under the UK Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act, particularly specialist domestic violence courts, multiagency specialist domestic violence courts, multiagency risk-assessment conferences and independent domestic violence advisors, should be considered in the Irish context.<\/p><p>  Responses to domestic violence or abuse need to be victim-centred in their approach.  These need to address where they will live, how they will survive economically and what will happen when the abuser is released from prison.<\/p> <p>In the current economic climate trying to respond effectively to women and children is quite difficult.  The Garda is a key resource for women trying to survive and leave domestic violence.  The high standards of this work must be maintained.<\/p><p> There is a need to eradicate indirect discrimination as well as discriminatory measures perpetuated through societal norms and views.  In the case of ethnic minority women there is also a need to address the complexity of how public, State and institutional practices intersect with racism and class and gender oppression.  These factors produce outcomes, which make it more difficult for women not only to disclose abuse but also to access services which support positive decision-making in very complex situations.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its time.

I am the co-ordinator of the south east domestic violence intervention programme which is a project of the Men's Development Network.  Through its work and engagement with campaigns such as the white ribbon campaign and the turn off the red light campaign the Men's Development Network supports men in playing an active role in ending violence against women.<\/p><p>  We deliver four men ending domestic abuse, MEND, programmes in the south east for men who have been violent in intimate relationships.  These programmes also provide an integrated one to one support service for the partners or ex-partners of the men in the programmes.  We have a similar structure to MOVE Ireland in this regard.  As the focus of our work is the delivery of intervention programmes we feel the most helpful contribution we can make to the committee is to provide our reflections based on our experience of working with men who are violent and abusive in an intimate relationship and their partners or ex-partners.  Our approach is supported by emerging evidence-based practice and input from trainers such as Dr. Mark Farrall of Ignition UK, Paul Wolf-Light of Ahimsa UK, Christina Dickinson of the Sensorimotor Psychotherapy Institute in Boulder, Colorado and others.  Our reflective learning has led us to review our understanding of the causes of domestic abuse in intimate partner relationships.<\/p><p>  The national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender based violence acknowledges:<blockquote>[D]omestic violence perpetrators are not homogenous and some may have multiple problems and complex needs.  These multiple problems complicate their ability to respond to interventions and\/or their motivation to change.  Therefore evaluations of perpetrator programmes should focus on what kind of interventions work best for whom.<\/blockquote>  There is clear evidence that like all behaviours, violence and abuse in intimate relationships occurs on a continuum.  The most severe form of abuse could be called intimate terrorism and is at the high end.  The continuum goes through what has been termed situational couple conflict through to respectful relationships.  For those on the high end of this behaviour the criminal justice system is appropriately the first port of call, with subsequent treatment in prison if there is a custodial sentence.  Policy and practice need to be flexible enough to respond to the variety of behaviours on this continuum, otherwise we will not serve the needs of the women, children and men in these relationships.  The cycle of violence and abuse will continue into the next relationship and or into the next generation.  Another outcome of not recognising the spectrum of behaviour involved is that we may end up seeing men moved into the criminal justice system too early or too late.  In addition, recognition of the complex nature of the issue of intimate partner violence and the continuum of behaviour allows for the development of safe and appropriate responses where the victim is male or where the abusive behaviour occurs in same-sex relationships.<\/p><p>  An understanding of individual influences and dynamics, such as the impact of early childhood trauma including domestic abuse, is essential and compatible with a focus on responsibility and holding men accountable for their behaviour.  Neuroscience has established almost beyond doubt close links between early traumatic experience with primary attachment figures and difficulties in later adult intimate relationships.<\/p><p>  Historically, policy and practice almost exclusively focussed on the perceived male desire to control women driven by patriarchal beliefs about identity and entitlement.  This has given rise to a one size fits all policy and has narrowed treatment options.  To quote a recent paper by John Devaney of Queens University Belfast, &quot;One of the weaknesses of group-based programmes is that they were originally developed by and have evolved through an ideological perspective on the root causes of domestic violence, rather than an empirical model of intervention development&quot;.<\/p><p>  There is growing evidence that intimate partner violence is often rooted in traumatic childhood experiences and related issues such as poverty, substance misuse and lack of education, which may be linked to experiencing domestic violence as a child.  Therefore, as domestic abuse is about far more than power, control and patriarchy, effective solutions need to be drawn from a much fuller understanding of the problem.  While we are conscious that responsibility and accountability must be to the fore in our response to intimate partner violence, an effective response, which will be of most benefit to the partners and ex-partners of the men and their children, must take into consideration the traumatic roots of this behaviour and develop responses based on this knowledge.  When we seek solutions we should not see perpetrators in a particular carbon cut-out image but rather examine the issues underlying their behaviour.<\/p><p>  A common misconception prevails however, that acknowledging complex influences and relationship dynamics excuses perpetrators and moves the debate away from responsibility and choice.  This need not be so.  We know that recognising complexity adds a greater challenge to already over-stretched services and increases the need for inter-agency co-operation.  It is, however, our contention that if we are to respond in a just, safe and effective way to violence and abuse in intimate partner relationships we must deal with the root causes of this violence and abuse through an approach grounded in current evidence-based research.<\/p><p>  We recommend recognising and supporting the role played by intervention programmes working to change men&rsquo;s violent and abusive behaviour in intimate partner relationships, while keeping the safety of women and children as a priority; actively supporting making visible intervention programmes part of the solution to reduce violence against women; acknowledging that while nothing justifies violence or abuse in a relationship, effective treatment models must take into consideration the underlying complex issues underpinning this behaviour; supporting the development of intervention programmes in line with current evidence-based treatment approaches, which deal with the significant impact of childhood trauma, difficulties with early attachment and other issues such as addiction on behaviour in later adult intimate relationships, as this would allow for an appropriate and safe gender-inclusive response to the issue; and supporting the development of clear referral pathways onto intervention programmes for men who are violent and abusive in relationships.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900010#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1392822300,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doyle.

Our submission, which makes 12 recommendations, deals with three main areas where we believe change is needed.  These are the extension of eligibility for barring orders under the Domestic Violence Act and the introduction of emergency barring orders when courts are not sitting; measures to address the safety and welfare of children with regard to custody and access in the context of domestic violence; and the limitations of stalking legislation.<\/p><p>  Domestic violence is a 24-seven crime which primarily happens in the home, and therefore access to protection needs to be available 24-seven.  However, this is not the case at present.  I will give the example of Sarah, who was badly assaulted at home by her husband on a Friday night and called the Garda.  The garda&iacute; were very helpful and called an ambulance but said there was little they could do as no barring order was in place, and suggested she go to court as soon as possible, which was the following Monday morning.  When she was discharged from hospital Sarah telephoned the Women&rsquo;s Aid helpline as she was afraid to go home.  There was no refuge space available and, as her husband had threatened to burn down her parents' house or sister&rsquo;s house if she went to either place, she felt she had no option but to sleep in her car until the courts opened on Monday morning.<\/p><p>  If the garda&iacute; responding to Sarah that Friday evening had been able to apply for an emergency barring order to cover the weekend Sarah could have remained in her own home before going to court.  If she had children this would have been far more serious.  As has been outlined, domestic violence is a very common context in which child abuse takes place and it has been found that the more severe the domestic violence, the more severe the child abuse will be.<\/p> <p> Our submission includes four recommendations dealing with issues where parents separate because of domestic violence and where provision needs to be made to ensure children's safety and well being, especially in respect of access.  I am happy to answer questions on these recommendations if time allows.<\/p><p> Since our first statistics report in 2003, thousands of callers to our freefone national helpline have confirmed that stalking is a serious form of abuse for Irish women.  It happened before the advent of new technology and, while new technology has added to the repertoire of tactics available to an abuser, physical stalking continues to be a serious concern, carrying with it the threat of imminent harm.  Stalking by ex-partners accounts for the largest group of victims, with the stalking beginning before separation takes place in up to half of all cases.<\/p><p> Niamh, who is 19 years of age, went out with Sean for a few months last year, but split up because he was \"too intense and clingy\".  He has not left her in peace since.  He always seems to be at the corner of her road when she leaves her house no matter what time it is and he follows her much of the time.  He calls and texts her almost every day.  After he bad-mouthed her on Facebook, she went to the Garda and was informed that it could not do anything until he made more serious threats or actually harmed her.  She was deeply shocked at this, as she is extremely frightened.  She does not go out any more than she has to.  As such, she has lost her freedom as well as her peace of mind.<\/p><p> Stalking often escalates after separation and is linked to the abuser wanting to control a partner or ex-partner, isolate her and restrict her movements.  Abusers use multiple methods to stalk and monitor women.  In our experience, the current definition of harassment is complex and hard to prove and, therefore, is rarely used to protect women.  I am referring to the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act.  We recommend that a specific offence of stalking be introduced and that it be recognised as a ground for a safety order.<\/p><p> As Mr. Killoran pointed out, Women's Aid is a member of the Domestic Violence Coalition.  Approximately 30% of women who use our services for the first time are migrants.

A couple of words that I want to introduce early are \"crime\" and \"evil\".  I have heard one but not the other.  Male intimate abuse is the most widespread form of crime in this country, but it is also the most evil form of behaviour that I have ever encountered.  All of our efforts to deal with this crime have failed because of our ignorance, our tolerance and our desire to be fair.<\/p><p>  Our ignorance is founded on our reliance on the victim to explain her experience while she is unaware of the covert tactics of targeting, setting up and grooming that are used by all psychephiles to establish and maintain mind control.  This is why I call them \"psychephiles\".  Our tolerance is founded on our ambivalence about male sexual priority, which is rife throughout the country.<\/p><p>  Our desire to be fair causes us to misdiagnose the perpetrator and to fail to recognise his psychopathic terrorism and his sociopathic lying.  It leads us to blame the victim and collude with the psychephile.  It will lead us to be groomed by the psychephile and will inevitably cause us to wilt under his persistence.  It will allow us to resist putting human rights legislation into our law and to claim constitutional support for putting property rights before victim safety rights.  It will give the word of a sociopathic liar equal status with that of the victim.  It will allow the psychephiles, who account for one in four of all men in relationships, to dictate our response.  It will eventually lead to us doing nothing to solve the problem.<\/p><p>  For a few minutes, I would like to put on record how people can do nothing energetically.  The similarities between the report of the Task Force on Violence Against Women in 1997 and a mid-term progress review of the national strategy of Cosc in 2012 are extraordinary.  In 1997, there was a clear need for more accurate and comprehensive statistics.  In 2012, a lack of consistent information limited the capacity to respond.  In 1997, there was a need for a public campaign to raise awareness and change attitudes.  In 2012, there were no hard data available on the impact of awareness campaigns on attitudes and behaviours.  In 1997, it was deemed that, through training, people would be able to work together.  By 2012, no training programmes had been developed.  In 1997, it was determined that health service providers should adopt written protocols in respect of domestic violence.  By 2012, an assessment form with domestic violence questions had not been advanced because of the industrial relations environment in the health service.  In 1997, it was recommended that specialist training be provided to the Judiciary.  In 2012, the issue of judicial training remained a high priority.  In 1997, there was a lack of comprehensive data on domestic violence, a void that the task force believed could be addressed by developing a code of practice for reporting incidents.  In 2012, there was a particular gap with regard to data on the prevalence of domestic and sexual violence.  In 1997, it was recommended that public and voluntary services and agencies work together to maximise the effective use of resources.  In 2012, Cosc found that co-ordination on issues of domestic and sexual violence was at an early stage.  If anything, its review suggested that the situation may have worsened.<\/p><p>  A solution to the problem is to stop talking, to read what we promised to do in 1997 and to make a start there.  As the President of the District Court recently stated in Cork, we need to ensure that the response of the committee becomes part of the solution and not continue to be part of the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900011#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Don Hennessy"},{"type":"speech","time":1392822900,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hennessy for being so concise and focused.

We would be making a fundamental mistake if we put perpetrators outside the room and did not engage on what is at the root of the behaviour.  We have certainly done that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900013#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Doyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392823800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I agree with Ms Wilson's comments about criminal sanctions and challenging behaviour from that route.

We did an initial review of international legislation that indicated a trend, particularly in Europe.  The trend in the 1990s was to introduce protective measures, and Ireland was at the table in that regard.

Gondolf, who did a multi-site research in 2002 and follow-up, which showed that a man was capable of changing his attitudes and behaviour.

The trauma we are discussing in this context can make girls who experience or view domestic violence believe that this is acceptable behaviour and that this is women's lot in life and it can make men think that this is the best way in which they can keep their wife in line.  These are not entirely incompatible with the two positions that might be seen as being opposite.  One can put a neuroscientific explanation for it or one can put a more social level explanation for it.  Either way, a key part of the prevention must be making sure that children understand, or somebody somewhere tells them, that these behaviours, where they see them as normative in the family home, are not acceptable and that it is not acceptable to treat others like this or to be treated like this.

We are missing a general systemic response to the problem.  I can tell the committee how it works for real.  For example, if one lives in one Dublin local authority area and experiences domestic violence one cannot opt for housing in another local authority area.  That sounds ridiculous.  I am talking about not being able to move from one local authority area to another even though it may be in the best interest of risk and safety planning.  That is a ludicrous situation.  Who does it suit?  Are we letting bureaucracy dictate safety priorities?  The truth is that we are and I am reporting what happens on the ground.<\/p><p>  We are suffering a resource shortage and this is not Sonas making a pitch for extra funding.  At present, domestic violence services are under pressure.  It needs to be recognised that women and children are being made homeless due to domestic violence even if one is a homeowner or lives in a local authority house.  This is not an alternative accommodation issue having to be taken into account because domestic violence means one must leave one's home.  <\/p><p>  I agree that the ideal solution would be for the perpetrators, not women and children, to leave their homes.  When such a measure was implemented in Australia or the UK it required a high level of police and emergency first response buy-in.  Ireland is not at that place yet.  It would be great if we were but the reality is that we still need refuges and we need a continuum.  To a certain extent - and let us be honest here - domestic violence services are being asked to take in general homelessness needs.  That is the truth of it.  The reality is that when it comes to finding a place for someone who, for example, leaves our refuge in Blanchardstown, that person ends up in homeless services because there is nowhere to put him or her.  We have a massive housing shortage.  We heard Ms Byrne from the Child and Family Agency identify the housing need.  This is not just about housing but a place of safety.  I am talking about a place where someone's risk and safety can be managed.  We have a massive housing shortage at the moment but we are not addressing the problem.  The system is not working.

Clearly, there is a shortfall in emergency refuge provision but, as Ms Byrne said and I think we would all agree, that should only be short-term and nobody should be stuck in that accommodation.  Where do women and children go?  I understand they go into homeless services.  Will the changes being made by the Department of Social Protection to give responsibility for the allocation of the housing supplement to the local authorities improve things?  We heard there is a real difficulty for a woman who jointly owns a family home.  Should barring orders not kick in at that point so that the woman can move back into her home?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900016#R00700","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392825600,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Yes.  To give the Senator an evidence base, which is a term being used a lot today, Sonas is the biggest provider to women and children experiencing domestic violence in this State.  We have more than 100 homes spread across the four local authority areas in Dublin and into Wicklow.  We think we can speak pretty authoritatively about this.<\/p><p>  Traditionally, we have come from a continuum of care model whereby people would have gone into our refuge and would have progressed through supported housing.  They would have stayed with us for two years and moved on into local authority housing or other private rented accommodation.  With the reconfiguration of services by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, with the housing collapse and with everything else that has happened, it has had a severe impact on domestic violence services.  Put bluntly, our whole national housing policy, which I do not think has a gender reference in it, is \"housing first\", but in case anyone has not noticed, there is no housing.  We are constantly told in terms of policy that housing first is the way to go, but the only choice for people leaving our refuge in Blanchardstown is to go back home with a risk and safety plan.  We try to extend our outreach service to cover them because we are committed to a continuum of care.  They can try to get a local authority house but the chances of getting one are very slim.  I think there are 10,000 people on the waiting list in Fingal County Council.  They can present to homeless services and often the only option when they do so is a hotel room with their children.  When I say \"hotel room\", let us not get any ideas about four-star service.  We are talking about a very modest standard of accommodation.  The other alternative is supported housing such as ours.<\/p><p>  However, in the Dublin region, tenants generally go through what is called a common referral process, where needs are assessed.  Through a service provider and the local authority, it is decided who goes where.  Many domestic violence survivors may have very high domestic violence needs but they may be lower on other thresholds - for example, substance misuse.  It is Sonas's position that they are getting squeezed out of the system and that, in effect, what are coming through the common referral process are the very high-end complex cases involving domestic violence, substance misuse and other forms of potential criminality.  They are really complex needs.<\/p><p>  There is a shortage of local authority provision and there are not enough private landlords.  The thrust of things at the moment is that private landlords are the way to go, but they are not there.  I hope that helps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900016#R00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1392825600,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I have a question on criminal law, which is a huge issue.

I was very struck by Ms Martin's statement that the PSNI is collecting all of the data on domestic-violence-related offences.  Examination of breaches of barring orders is the only real mechanism for assessing the level of prosecution here.  There are so many others but they come under general assault.  Have we seen an increase in risk to women and children since the 2002 change to emergency barring orders?  Is there some change at which we should be looking in regard to the barring order law?

In terms of the Senator's question on specialised domestic violence courts, we set out to review them and to see what models there were.  We discovered that there are multiple models across the world and that in the wrong hands they could be very detrimental to victims but in the right hands they could be very beneficial.  In the UK, we spoke to a judge who oversaw one of the specialist domestic violence courts and to a judge who had responsibility for the mandatory training of all magistrates in England and Wales.  Both of them were able to highlight the benefits of each of the systems.  We either have one or both.  The reality is that we have a very small country and a very small court system.  We do not want domestic violence to be further ghettoised, but we want to address the fragmentation.<\/p><p>  Some of the case studies in our research refer to women who have had 64 appearances in the court system - not in the criminal court system but in the civil one.<\/p> <p>There are significant failings in the system.  The legislation is not being implemented consistently across the country by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and judges.  That is one of the problems.  A potential solution is the one family one judge model, which we are also discussing.  It has major benefits in terms of the perpetrator not being able to what we term \"forum shop\"; in such instances the perpetrator is given a warning by a judge, but the following week he jumps the list and picks another judge to hear his case.  Then 64 case appearances later the victim is still trying to be heard.  One of the caveats - this is where the victims' rights directive is critical for many of the recommendations we are making - is that a victim gets stuck with a judge who does not have the expertise.  We have seen two such cases, in which this was very detrimental.<\/p><p> On a point of clarification, I will comment on the breakdown of funding for support services and refuges.  We represent all services across the country.  Refuges provide an extensive range of support services.  We need to be careful that when people look at the cost of a refuge, they realise that not only do the refuges around the country provide supports for women in refuge but also the whole range of services provided in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014021900016#R01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392826200,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I was pipped at the post.

I was big enough at 16 years of age to be able to do this.  I left the house in 1976, but I believe the violence continued.  As he was getting older, he was not able to do it after that.

I do not know how the treatment and reform programme works in cases that took place in the past.  What was perpetrated at the time was an absolute assault, a criminal act.  We need to treat it as a criminal act.  I have seen cases in the past couple of years and saw a case in which the house was taken apart.

That is when the bar is set.  It should not be a case of having to consider where the woman and her children will be housed; the criminal is the person who should be removed from the house.  That would a solve the housing problems.  If the perpetrators of these crimes knew there would be a criminal charge on foot of their actions, we might eliminate between 50% to 60% before they start.  A major issue for local authorities is that a couple may be the joint owners of the family home and one cannot go on a housing list if one owns a house.  This is a major challenge.  We should focus on those who respond to the call for help.  It should be a criminal offence and I hope this will happen in my lifetime.

What was noteworthy was that the Ombudsman decided to instigate a section 102 public interest investigation, subsequent to a general sweep of the offices.  When two technical and electronic anomalies were identified at the time, there was no suggestion that technology exclusively within the access or remit of the State would be required.   It is only subsequent to the investigation being conducted that a third anomaly was found.   It was suggested then that the \"know how\" for the 3G device would be something available at government level.

The wording used last week was \"potential threats\", and in the final report it was referenced as \"anomalies\".  There were two issues that arose prior to the section 102 investigation.  The first, if I could describe it in non-technical terms, seems to be that a Wi-Fi system which had been acquired by GSOC either late in 2007 or early 2008 had never been used for anything, was connecting to something external and remote, as the report from Verrimus states.  As matters stood by the end of September, all GSOC seemed to know was that its Wi-Fi was connecting to something external.  There are three security company reports, which I received subsequent to my statement to the D&aacute;il.   That is all GSOC knew.  However, it had never been used.  The Wi-Fi system did not connect to any of GSOC's information systems.  There was nothing about that information which indicated what impact this was having, but it was described as a vulnerability.<\/p><p>  The second issue, to which I will return later, was the telephone conference call system.  There was a conference call telephone, which I believe was also never used, or certainly was not used during the lifetime of the current Commission.  It had only been used for conference calls rather than ordinary telephone calls.  There was a description of a test whereby some signal was sent down the telephone, and we were told three seconds later that the telephone rang.  These were the only two issues.<\/p><p>  When I met Simon O'Brien, together with both of my officials, I had a detailed conversation as to why at that point an investigation was commenced into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That was the only group into which the investigation could have been commenced.  The explanation never went any further than that these two vulnerabilities, anomalies or potential threats had been identified.  No more was said about that in the brief to me.  I am open to correction by committee members, but I do not think that was expanded upon further during the course of the deliberations for the committee.  The Deputy is right to say that there ultimately was a reference to a whole series of background issues, but it was not expanded beyond those two issues.<\/p><p>  There was a conversation about the proportionality of the decision-making process in deciding at that point to invoke a section 102 investigation.  In subsequent correspondence I have had with the Commission, I further raised that issue and the explanation really has not gone beyond that.  The Deputy is right to say that if there were issues of concern arising out of the report - I take it genuinely that GSOC had issues of concern - I would have thought that certain other steps could have been taken.  For example, the security company indicated that when it made the first report - I do not fully understand this and it is one of the issues that can be dealt with by the judge dealing with it by way of inquiry - the company stated that it did not have time to find where the remote connection to the Wi-Fi was coming from.  I thought it would have been reasonable, before an investigation begins, to have the company take that time and to see if something can be identified.<\/p><p>  The second occasion the security firm visited seems to be around 24 or 25 October, which is referenced in the second report.  At that stage, the company seems to be identifying a connection to a Bitbuzz network.<\/p>  <p>It is only the final report, dated 16 December, which pins that matter down.  I am happy to reference specifically what it says.  However, it would have made some sense, before commencing that investigation, to have the security firm take the time to see where the connection came from.<\/p><p> The final report and the section 103 report may have been received in my Department late on Thursday evening or maybe Friday morning but I only saw it on Friday.  The final report references that it was identified that the Wi-Fi system was connecting to another Wi-Fi system through Bitbuzz and that was located in a business premises close to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission offices.  It was not clarified any further.  I asked my officials to seek clarification on that matter from GSOC.  We were informed on Tuesday morning of this week.  I imagine Brian Purcell can give the committee the exact time but I gather it was sometime between 9.45 a.m. and 10.15 a.m.  We were informed that the system was connected to a Wi-Fi system operating out of the Spar shop on the ground floor of the same premises occupied by GSOC where there is an Insomnia coffee area and a counter arrangement whereby people can sit and use their equipment and connect to Wi-Fi.<\/p><p> There are several issues here.  It may be, however, given the anxiety members of GSOC had that they may have prematurely commenced the investigation.  I have no wish to be critical of that but there is specific provision in section 102(4) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act which indicates that there must be something that indicates Garda involvement.  At that point I was not aware, and certainly I have not been informed by GSOC, of what it was about those two matters that indicated Garda involvement of any nature.  That is genuinely still unclear to me.  It is no clearer to me following the correspondence I have had with the commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900004#C00500","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392826500,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Minister, the committee members have an eight-minute window each.

I believe Simon O'Brien and the other members of GSOC have fairly set this out not only at this committee but elsewhere.  There has been contention between the Garda and GSOC.  I would be surprised, frankly, if there had not been.  Clearly, there will be tensions between a police force and the body that has oversight of that police force and this is replicated throughout the world.  My job and obligation is to ensure that public confidence is maintained in each and that there is a sufficient relationship to ensure, for example, that GSOC can do its work properly.  This is why after publication of the reports that were touched on in this committee last week, I had meetings with the Garda Commissioner and GSOC.  I have got on well with both the members of GSOC and the Commissioner.  It was my job to try to ensure that there was better engagement between them in future.  The putting in place of new protocols had been a subject of discussion between both bodies.  It was my view that the discussion was going on too long.  As a result of my intervention the discussions were progressed at greater speed and, as mentioned, in September of 2013 they signed off on new protocols.  These have only been in place for some months.  I know that Simon O'Brien commented on those protocols.

The Minister also failed to disclose to the D&aacute;il the reasoning behind the launching of that investigation.  At the same time, the Minister dismissed any reasoning as being completely baseless innuendo.  Why did the Minister do that?

I expressly said in my script that GSOC had commenced an investigation.  I then proceeded to detail the outcome of the investigation.  I assumed - and I am repeating what I said in the D&aacute;il last night - that Deputies were familiar with the relevant legislation and certainly that the Opposition spokespersons were.  The only section of the Act under which GSOC could have itself commenced an investigation without having received a complaint, was section 102(4), which is the public interest investigation.  There was no suggestion GSOC had received a complaint from anybody.  There was no suggestion that the Garda Commissioner had asked it to investigate anything or that I had asked it to investigate anything.  I made the simple statement that GSOC had commenced an investigation; that certainly did not result in my anticipating that for political reasons, people would come along and suggest that I misled the D&aacute;il.  It was the only method that GSOC could have deployed in commencing an investigation and there is no mystery about it.<br\/>What I was doing in the House last Tuesday week was summarising the information that I had received.  I could have not only referred to section 102(4) of the Act but I could have referred to the relevance of section 98 of the Act and the relevance of section 103 of the Act but I did not do so.  In dealing with the section 103 matter I made a reference to the fact that I had not been informed of these matters, that I learned of them in the <i>The Sunday Times <\/i>report and that I had never received a report on them from GSOC.  If I had wanted to be legally technical I would have cited the specific provisions of section 103 of the Act.  What I was trying to do was to detail for the House my knowledge of the matter and of the events but not to engage in some sort of legal treatise on the sections of the Act.  I have no idea why this is an issue of any controversy because it was the only section that could have been deployed.<br\/>The Deputy asked me what was the reason I was given for GSOC commencing the section 102 investigation.  The only reasons I was given were the two reasons I referenced in my response to Deputy Mulherin.  I was given no other reasons and that is why there was a conversation involving myself and Simon O'Brien and with two officials present from my Department, in order to see if there was anything else to be said about it.  We did have concerns about the proportionality of GSOC making that decision at that moment.  It may have been appropriate, with further technical advice, to have made the decision at a later stage, but in circumstances where there was nothing at all to indicate Garda involvement, it was difficult to understand why that decision was made.  The Deputy is right in that he has listed all sorts of bodies and he asked whether it could have been the Revenue Commissioners or Customs and Excise or the Defence Forces.  I would equally ask whether it could have been some foreign agency or whether it could have been based on what we have learned was happening in England, whether it could have been a journalist or anybody else.  I am not suggesting it was but I am just saying there was a lot of &quot;could it have been&quot;.  The only body which GSOC has a statutory remit to investigate is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The section of the Act has to have some purpose; it cannot simply be a case of, &quot;We think it might be, therefore we are investigating&quot;.  There has to be some substantive reason for doing it and it remains a mystery to me as to why at that moment in time, that decision was made.  <br\/>The Deputy asked why did I make a comment about baseless innuendo.  If the Deputy reads my speech, he will see what I said on last Tuesday week was that for the preceding 48 hours - I emphasise that time period - the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had been subject to baseless innuendo which arose out of the way the matter found its way into the public domain.<br\/>I refer Deputies - I apologise if I am being somewhat lengthy in my reply but it is relevant to the issue - to the interview that Mr. FitzGerald gave to &quot;Prime Time&quot; on Tuesday evening after I made my statement.  He was asked a variety of questions by Miriam O'Callaghan and I will not go over them all.  He was asked about the issue of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  My reference to baseless innuendo was not that GSOC made baseless innuendo but that arising out of the report in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>, there was a myriad of public discussions suggesting that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - and that there was definitive evidence - had been engaged in surveillance with GSOC.<br\/>Miriam O'Callaghan asked Mr. FitzGerald, &quot;In your statement last night [this is GSOC statement in its press release] you said there was no evidence of Garda misconduct.  Why would you say that in the first place if you were not thinking that?&quot;  He replied, &quot;Because the reason we said that last night and that I am happy to repeat it here now, is that it is part of the public discussion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann this evening and all over the airwaves the last couple of days people are pointing the fingers.  May I say it is unfair of people to point fingers at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the basis of anything we have said or done&quot;.  Miriam O'Callaghan then said, &quot;But your statement last night did that&quot;  Mr. FitzGerald said, &quot;No, our statement last night was meant to try to clear that up and say we did not find evidence of Garda misconduct because the public discourse seems to be pointing in the direction of finding the [Garda] guilty of this thing when we are saying quite clearly and categorically and in no uncertain terms, we found no evidence to point to that direction and for people to suggest that, you know, they were up to something.  We're the people that did the examination; we're the people with the evidence; we do not have any evidence to point in that direction&quot;.  It is quite clear that Mr. FitzGerald was of the view that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was being the subject of baseless innuendo, not by GSOC but in the commentary that continued through and even past the statement I made to the D&aacute;il on Tuesday week last, and that similar commentary has continued right up to the decision made by the Cabinet which we announced.  <br\/>I will deal with the final matter in the context of the questions I was asked.<\/p>  <p>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked what the Garda Commissioner told me when I asked him what information he had which gave rise to suspicions that the offices were under surveillance.

I am advised that what he has stated is not the reason the investigation was initiated, and I am surprised the Deputy is saying that Mr. O'Brien was trying to backtrack last week.  Mr. O'Brien was quite clear last week on the matter that ended up in the public domain on Sunday last.  He said there was a document that had leaked from GSOC's offices which contained some inaccurate factual matters that gave rise to the suggestion that the security sweep it had done in September was the result of a senior garda knowing something he or she should not have known.  I am paraphrasing what was said.  Mr. O'Brien said that this was completely untrue but he was predicting that a story along those lines would appear in The Sunday Times or another newspaper the following Sunday.  Lo and behold, that story did appear in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>last Sunday.<br\/>In the briefings I have received since last Tuesday week from GSOC, it is clearly set out that Mr. O'Brien had some type of conversation with some of the employees of GSOC in the summer of 2013 which seemed to be misunderstood by two employees.  This misunderstanding is quite serious because it sets the scene for an aspect of this whole matter which the committee has not had the opportunity to explore.  It is an issue I do not want to comment on beyond just setting out what I know.  It is for the judge dealing with these matters to address.  What Mr. O'Brien said was that two members of GSOC were under the impression, wrongly, that the commission's security systems had already been breached and something confidential was known by an individual by whom it should not have been known.  Mr. O'Brien said this was not true or accurate and had led to a misunderstanding, which misunderstanding fed its way into the report that was received from the security firm, Verrimus.  He is right in that because the reports I have received reference it.<br\/>In terms of the brief given to Verrimus, Mr. O'Brien understood the brief - as the explained it to me and to the committee, although other things were then added in - was set out on the basis that GSOC had not had a general security sweep done since 2007.  Other security matters had been done since but a security sweep of a general nature had not been done.  The commissioners though of doing this on their appointment but did not get around to it in 2012.  It was finally done in 2013.  I believe it was Mr. O'Brien's understanding that it was being done for general reasons of ensuring the security of GSOC's offices, which is eminently sensible and something that should be done with some regularity.  It is something that should happen in the Garda, in GSOC and in Departments.<br\/>However, it seems that Verrimus was led to believe when it commenced its work that there was already a breach of security in GSOC when, in fact, there had not been.  I would have thought Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh would understand that Mr. O'Brien said that what he anticipated would appear last Sunday was inaccurate.  It has seemed like the Deputy is placing great reliance on it; he referenced it last night in the House.  If he accepts that Mr. O'Brien said this was untrue, that a mistake was made, that employees of GSOC were under the wrong impression and this impacted on the work done by Verrimus, then I do not know why the Deputy should then discount what Mr. O'Brien told the committee about the matter.  That is where the issue is.

This issue arose at an extraordinarily early stage last week when people were demanding that there be some form of inquiry.  I met with Mr. O'Brien and received a brief from him in writing and GSOC issued a statement.  If one looks at it in the round, what occurred, based on the information I had, was that a security sweep was initiated by GSOC.  What was termed \"Anomalies\", \"potential threats\" and \"vulnerabilities\" were identified.  The commission independently decided to commence an investigation.  A GSOC investigation can only be into Garda misconduct; it cannot be into anything else.  GSOC concluded, as the commissioners said in their press release, that there was no evidence of Garda misconduct.  That was GSOC's conclusion.<\/p><p>  On other occasions where GSOC investigated matters and found evidence of Garda misconduct it has reported properly and extensively on that misconduct.  There has never been a call for an inquiry into the outcome of GSOC deliberations where it found evidence of Garda misconduct.<\/p>  <p>The conclusions of GSOC have been accepted, whether by the current Government or that which preceded it.  At that stage, confidence in GSOC would have been seriously undermined if it had been decided, because it had independently commenced an investigation and found no evidence of Garda misconduct, that an inquiry be conducted.<br\/>The criticism on this issue has dissipated since I circulated the brief furnished to me by GSOC.  The commission also concluded that there was no definitive evidence of technical or electronic surveillance at its offices.  Effectively, it did not establish that surveillance had taken place but it had established the fact that there was no Garda misconduct.  I am afraid some people may have been disappointed that there was no evidence of Garda misconduct.  The issues quite properly addressed by Commissioner FitzGerald to which I referred earlier continued to be aired publicly for quite some time.  Unfortunately, during the course of the four-hour hearing before the committee, I think matters became somewhat confused.  Following on from that, I received the three technical reports from Verrimus.  I received, and read, on Friday last the section 103 report.  I engaged in correspondence with the commission to seek to clarify matters.  I sent it a very detailed letter, received a response and subsequently wrote to it again.<br\/>As a result of my concerns regarding the technical matters and because it appeared, when I received the section 103 report, that neither what had occurred in respect of the WiFi issue nor the conclusions reached by Verrimus had ever been adequately explained to me or to this committee, wisdom indicated that a peer review should be carried out in respect of the documentation and conclusions relating to the technology.  That peer review was carried out and I only received the report relating to it yesterday.  I briefed Cabinet on all of these matters and expressed my concerns about them.  I did so because there were now two technical reports - which were contradictory in places - and because it would be a matter of great seriousness if GSOC had been under surveillance.  One of the technical reports stated - on the basis of the peer review - that there was no evidence at all of surveillance.  I was firmly convinced no one would believe that.  I do not know which is true.  I do not have the technical knowledge and I can only report the information I am given.  This had been a continuing controversy and I was not happy with the responses I received to the correspondence I sent.  I was of the view that greater clarity was required.  In addition, the content of the section 103 report gave rise to other concerns.  As a result, I briefed Cabinet on the matter.<br\/>I was very anxious that no impression be created to the effect that if an inquiry was held, this would for some reason give rise to my avoiding coming before this committee.  I will be perfectly frank and state that one of the considerations was that had the inquiry been announced yesterday, I was concerned someone would suggest that it was only taking place to avoid my coming before this committee.  As a result of the level of public discourse in respect of this matter, the major difficulties to which it was giving rise in the context of GSOC getting on with its work and credibility issues relating to public trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC, I concluded that we had gone beyond the point of it being a matter of an inquiry because GSOC had reached a particular conclusion.  It was now an issue where myriad information - some of it contradictory - was available and I was of the view that it would never be cleared up without a judge being appointed to address it.  This is the reason why we reached that decision.  I am of the view that it was the right decision.<br\/>The terms of reference will be finalised by this evening.  All sorts of comments have been made to the effect that I am going to develop those terms of reference and that I have some nefarious motive in respect of this matter.  The terms of reference are essentially being drawn up by the Attorney General.  They will come through the Department in the usual way as a result of the fact that I am the line Minister.  The terms of reference will be agreed by Cabinet on the basis of the recommendation of the Attorney General.  That is the normal way in which these matters are dealt with.<br\/>I was asked if I received the same information as this committee.  The answer in that regard is not precisely.  Expansions and additional comments were made during the course of the committee's hearing.  Some of those expansions and comments were somewhat confusing.  One of the commissioners was asked whether the outcome of their investigation exonerated the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the reply that was given was that it neither did or did not exonerate the force.  In view of what had been said on &quot;Prime Time&quot; with regard to the conclusions reached, I can well understand how that created confusion.  It was quite proper that in his opening presentation to the committee, the chairman of GSOC referenced issues of tension between himself and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is right that GSOC be fully independent and free to publicly comment on issues of concern.  He referenced all of that, which seemed to be a lead-in to the suggestion that this is why the security sweep took place.  Later on he clarified that matter in the quote to which I referred earlier.  He did not preface it to me in that way and that reference is not in the brief.  There was something of a variance between the information I received and the way matters developed.  However, I totally and genuinely understand that in the context of the four hours of questioning which took place.<br\/>The section 103 report clearly should have been furnished to me much earlier and well before the matter leaked to <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>.  That report contains information that neither this committee nor I had in our possession.  There are genuine issues in respect of that matter.  I hope I have answered the questions the Deputy raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900007#F00800","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392828300,"counter":491,"content":"<p>The Minister's explanations just do not add up in the context of what we understand him to have known last week as against what he said in the D&aacute;il.

The briefing he received from GSOC - which he was in possession of when he made his statement - says that the investigation was launched on the basis that the acting director of investigations in GSOC was of the opinion that, to the extent that these threats could be proven, section 102(4) engaged and that such surveillance may have originated with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In other words, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission told the Minister that it may be under surveillance and that such surveillance may have been undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is why it launched the investigation.  Why did the Minister not admit that last week?

However, it was addressed in the documentation I received.  I think I mentioned at an early stage to Deputy Mulherin that two operatives within GSOC mistakenly believed that something had found its way into the public domain when this should not have happened and that this was the result of something said by a senior member of the Garda.  This then seems to have contaminated the brief that Verrimus was given because it was informed that there had been a breach of security when apparently as far as Mr. O'Brien is concerned, and I presume the other commissioners agree with him, there had been no breach.  There was talk of various things being discussed in the public domain but, ironically, the only breach of security for which there is substantive evidence is the document leaked to <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>.  Nobody has suggested that this is a matter of surveillance and it is clearly not a matter of surveillance.  For an organisation like GSOC which investigates very serious issues, it is of crucial importance that the integrity of its information systems is maintained.  A leak of any information from it regardless of whether it is as a result of surveillance or documentation going out in other ways is a serious matter.  I know that is something GSOC is investigating.

The terms of reference are designed insofar as is possible to get at the full truth of all of this.  In the context of the terms of reference, I should say that not I but the Attorney General has been in contact with the retired High Court judge who it is anticipated will undertake this task.  When the terms of reference are announced, we will announce who that judge is so that the judge being appointed is satisfied that the terms of reference are appropriate.  Of course, if there is a difficulty with the terms of reference and the judge asks that they be extended in some shape or form, I could not imagine that there would any difficulty about doing that.  I would certainly bring any such proposal if it came to me or through the Attorney General to Cabinet.  I think it would have to formally come through me.  It would be taken to Cabinet and I could not see any circumstances in which Cabinet would not agree to that.  Indeed, I think there is precedent for this in the past.<\/p><p>  The procedure we are adopting in appointing a retired judge to conduct an inquiry of the nature proposed is not particularly different to the procedure adopted by previous governments to arrange for an inquiry to be undertaken on difficult or controversial issues or where a matter of a factual nature is in dispute.  There is no mystery about this.  Of course, we are talking about a retired member of the High Court.  His or her brief will be to deal with the matter entirely independently.  There would be no point in appointing a retired High Court judge not to do that.  Neither I nor any other member of Cabinet, member of this committee, Member of the D&aacute;il or Seanad nor anyone else in the broader community will have influence of any description.  The judge will go about his or her work and will be provided with any technical back-up systems required.  I was asked about that earlier and omitted to reply to that question.  He or she will also be provided with any secretarial assistance required.  I presume the back-up technical assistance will be of a nature that is entirely independent and nobody can cast aspersions in any way to suggest that it will be less than independent.  <\/p><p>  Perhaps there was some suggestion yesterday evening that the technical back-up might be provided by members of the Defence Forces.  Of course, in an ideal world, they have great expertise in this area but I know the moment that was suggested, someone would say that I am Minister for Defence and that it is inappropriate that members of Defence Forces become engaged.  For fear that this would be perceived as some indirect interference by me or influence from me over the process, technical experts must be identified who belong to neither of the companies involved.

I am very anxious that we get back to a space where there is full public confidence in GSOC.  It does a very important job.  I spent an amount of my time in this Parliament many years ago talking about the need to ensure we had accountability where there were allegations of Garda misconduct.  I would have, on behalf of my party, proposed a motion in the D&aacute;il a long time ago seeking to have an inquiry into allegations of Garda misconduct in Donegal.  Some five months later we had the Morris tribunal.<\/p><p>  I have always believed that there is a crucial need to have a watchdog body.  It is very important there is full public confidence in what it does, that its systems are secure and that its information is secure.  So, I hope that issue is addressed in a manner in which it is resolved.<\/p><p>  Every organisation at some stage has some issue surrounding leaks, no matter how good the organisation is.  No organisation, no matter what functions it engages in, does not at some stage in its life have a problem of this nature.  So, I am presuming that GSOC is addressing that.  It will be addressed and it will not be an issue ultimately that will impact on public confidence.  I hope that is the case.<\/p><p>  Regarding Deputy Nolan's first question about the public interest inquiry, I have addressed that already.  There is nothing I can add to that.  Among all the myriad of different issues here, it is an issue, of course, that may be addressed by the judge who is going to look not just simply at that, but at a whole range of other issues.  I have said that, when I met Mr. O'Brien, both myself and my officials raised with him - in a subsequent meeting my officials would have had with GSOC members, they also raised it, I am advised - the proportionality of the decision made at that moment to commence that investigation.  At this stage I cannot add to what I said previously.  There is a question mark about whether, at that moment, there was enough to indicate that it warranted commencing an investigation into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not know of evidence beyond a concern that two what were called \"anomalies\", potential threats or whatever had been investigated.  In fairness to GSOC, it did not know what was causing the Wi-Fi problem, the telephone issue that the Deputy asked me about.  The information I was given was that a test was undertaken on the telephone - I referenced this in my D&aacute;il statement - and that, three seconds later, there was a call back.  The report, the brief I received and the conversation I had were along the lines that GSOC tried to investigate this further and could not find anything.<\/p><p>  The other information that I had was that this was some sort of telephone apparatus that was only usable or ever could be used for conference calls.  Now, I have not seen it, but this was my understanding of it.  In fact, it had not been used for anything, certainly not by the current commission.  The information was that a sound signal was sent down the telephone and three seconds later it rang back, but the information also was that a telecom companies check had been done.  There was no identifiable telephone call of any description recorded into GSOC's offices from any external source.  Yes, at the time based on the report that GSOC received, it was something of a mystery, but what it was all about was not clear.<\/p><p>  It is one of the issues that the Rits report has addressed.  It has produced what I could describe as a theory as to why this happened, and I am very happy to let a judge address these issues with Verrimus, Rits and whatever expertise is there and work it out.  The theory is that there was no finding of any external telephone call - this is the Rits theory and I am putting it in non-technical terms - because there was not one.  The suggestion is that there was somebody undertaking surveillance, some spook out there who, when this sound came down the telephone, decided to ring back, which is a little bit difficult to understand.  The Rits version of this is that when one sends a signal down a telephone of this nature, apparently in GSOC's offices there is some sort of telephone console at the reception area which the telephone receptionist would use to distribute telephone calls around the offices when they come in to the different members of GSOC.  So, the Rits theory is that all that happened was the signal was sent down the telephone, it hit the console and it caused a reaction which made the console telephone back up the line.  The signal bounced back up and it caused the telephone to ring.  It was nothing to do with external telephone calls or surveillance at all.<\/p><p>  Looking at that piece of advice, apparently this test was tried another time and that reaction did not happen, according to the Verrimus report.  I cannot adjudicate on the technology of this, but there is a possibility there is nothing sinister about this at all.<\/p>  <p>Again, because of the seriousness with which this issue has been taken - I think in fairness, Deputy Boyd Barrett and I think Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh made reference to that matter - I want this looked at by a High Court judge.  I do not have the technical knowledge to adjudicate between the two reports.  It may well be the case that there was nothing sinister about it but it may be the case that there was something sinister about it.  In fairness to GSOC, it was never suggested to it that it could have resulted from this telephone consul aspect, it was said that this could not be explained.  I have now been given an explanation.  We will have to see what the judge makes of it and what the technical advisers to the judge make of it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900012#L01200","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392831300,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and call Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900013#M00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1392831300,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the Minister.

Way before he was in this House it was the type of body that I wanted to see in place.  That is one of the reasons why, for example, we had to set up the Morris tribunal.  It was because there was no body that existed that could independently investigate allegations of misconduct by the garda&iacute;.<br\/>When we had the Abbeylara inquiry I was a member of the justice committee that commenced that inquiry.  As the Deputy will know, it ended up in the courts because members of the garda&iacute; were unhappy that a parliamentary committee conducted that inquiry.  I have spent a large amount of my time, unusually, in the High Court and the Supreme Court arguing why an Oireachtas committee should be able to undertake that work.  The Supreme Court and the High Court took a different view.  Why did I do that?  I believed that where there are serious concerns about Garda failure it is important to have independent oversight.  <br\/>All I want to see out of this is restored public confidence in GSOC.  Now GSOC is the watchdog.  There is a difficulty - I am not saying that it has happened in this case - that if something goes wrong with the watchdog then who watches the watchdog?  We cannot have a myriad or series of organisations in place.  Difficulties have arisen out of this issue and we have appointed a judge to deal with it.  I hope that at the end of it, whatever the difficulties are, they will be identified.  If there is learning required by GSOC, by the Garda Commissioner, by myself or by anybody arising out what is determined by the judge then that learning should be implemented. <br\/>It was referenced I think earlier, but nearly two and a half weeks ago - that was Monday fortnight and before any of this controversy broke - I issued a press statement which is on my Department's website.  In view of my anxiety to ensure that GSOC can properly carry out its functions I made an announcement - among other announcements - that we were going to amend the legislation in regard to GSOC.  I said I was going to bring before Cabinet proposals to address some of the issues necessary with regard to GSOC.  The Act has existed for a number of years and GSOC itself is seeking amendments.  That is why in the Cabinet decision yesterday, in addition to the work that is going on in my Department to prepare amendments, we said we wanted the justice committee to take submissions and make recommendations.  What is brought before Cabinet will be the result of an inclusive consultative process.  Why am I doing that?  It is because I want GSOC to do its work and to be able to do so and I also want the public to have confidence in that work.  <br\/>I shall speedily answer a couple of other questions.  The Deputy referenced what knowledge I have that the security sweep was required because of comments by the Garda Commissioner.  We addressed that issue a long time ago.  I do not know whether the comments of the alleged senior member of the Garda were the Garda Commissioner's or not because I have not asked him, nor have I asked GSOC.  GSOC has said this it is fiction, that there was a misunderstanding by two operatives in GSOC, that there was no comments made by a senior garda despite the report in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>that indicated someone had breached GSOC's security.  GSOC said that a document had been prepared in error that indicated that.  The document prepared in error, and I think Simon O'Brien referred to it, was basically whatever document contained the request to Verrimus that it undertake work because it seemed to have indicated that there had been a breach.  This was then repeated in the GSOC reports.<br\/>The Deputy asked was it the Garda Commissioner?  I think the <i>Sunday Independent <\/i>addressed this, referred to the Garda Commissioner and addressed why this was not accurate.  I had no engagement with the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, and that did not come from any leak or conversation I had with the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>before someone suggests it to me.  That part of it - I hate to use the word because people have been using it in other circumstances - was a puff of smoke.  Simon O'Brien himself said a mistake was made within GSOC.  I do think it is unfortunate that if one is going to have a security sweep undertaken the company one asks to undertake the sweep is not given careful instructions.  It is unfortunate that the remit it was given was based on a misunderstanding within GSOC.  I would hope whatever created that is addressed because I think that it is very important if a security sweep is being undertaken - in fairness to the company undertaking it - that its brief is clear and it is not resulting from a misunderstanding within the organisation that gave the brief. <br\/>The question was asked if there was any authorised surveillance on GSOC.  I presume the question is have I authorised surveillance on GSOC.  Of course I have not. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900013#M01800","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1392831300,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Deputy Healy-Rae can ask one last question.

Last week I was really concerned.  Based on the knowledge I had up to Thursday, I was really concerned that if we had an inquiry into this matter, it would suggest a lack of confidence in GSOC.  GSOC had investigated, reached conclusions, terminated the investigation and had found no definitive evidence of surveillance or of Garda misconduct.  Since then I have received all the additional information.  We have the \"techie\" information conflict, there is additional information which I received from GSOC in the 103 report, there is correspondence which I have had with GSOC, and there has been the ongoing public controversy with claim and counterclaim, allegation and counter-allegation.  This is debilitating and has an impact on the capacity of GSOC to get on with its work.<\/p><p>  There are continuing claims that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in some way or other had GSOC under surveillance, even though GSOC has said what I have recounted.  This has a capacity, if things continue the way they are going, to impact on public confidence in the Garda and GSOC.  Some of the people who have accused me of being the cause of all of this are the people who have been raising all of the questions in regard to all of this.  Every day there is a new series of questions but the real issues are the additional information that came to me, the conflict in the technical advice and the obvious situation that had arisen whereby it did not seem it would be ensured, without a judge being appointed, that this issue would be finally addressed in a context that people could be assured that the outcome was independent, with no political claims or charges and nobody being accused of being on one side or another.  I am on no side.  My only interest from the start has been to establish the truth of what happened and the implications for the Garda and GSOC.  We must establish whether there was Garda involvement, whether GSOC was compromised, and most important of all, whether GSOC now has the security systems in place necessary to ensure there are no potential threats and that it has the expertise to judge that.  The appointment of the judge, based on the way in which this matter developed following on from the hearings before this committee, is the correct decision.  I hope it will bring clarity to bear on it.

Having listened to the evidence given last week, it is my understanding that the three commissioners took it upon themselves to leave GSOC office and speak in private in coffee houses to avoid any electronic or e-mail contact.  When the Minister appointed Mr. Simon O'Brien as chairman of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission we were informed that Mr. O'Brien was the territorial police commander in the Metropolitan Police in the United Kingdom, commanding police across 11 boroughs in north-east London with a staff of more than 9,000 reporting to him.  Not only did he have extensive experience of policing at a senior level, but he also had an excellent knowledge of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the policing environment in which it operates.  In his evidence to the joint committee, Mr. O'Brien stated: &quot;GSOC has been put in the grave position where a secret document has been put in the public domain.&quot;  He also stated, in reference to the covert nature of surveillance, the following:<blockquote><br \/>If one is the subject of surveillance and one has any knowledge of that surveillance, the surveillance is failing... we have no precision; we have suspicion.  We have suspected activity and nothing, in my view and professional judgment, would have got past the threshold test to say we had an offence.<\/blockquote>Mr. O'Brien is a policeman of long standing.  The three commissioners had serious suspicions that surveillance was being undertaken.  In addition, Verrimus has today stood by the evidence in the initial report, which the Minister, unlike members, has seen.  The Minister outlined what he was told by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Did the Verrimus report specifically identify the anomalies as threats?  We have been informed that there was no innocent explanation for at least one of the anomalies.  It is important, therefore, that we examine that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900015#O00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1392832500,"counter":609,"content":"<p>We will try to elicit a response on that.

We have heard much hysteria, spin and hype in the past couple of weeks on the issue which is not helping the situation.  GSOC has been in the dock for not reporting to the Minister and the Garda.  The situation has been likened to the suggestion that the victim of the crime was to blame for the crime because it did not report to the Garda.  I believe it did not report to the Garda because, initially, it believed it was the Garda who had it under surveillance.  Subsequently, everything has changed to a position where GSOC, the Minister and the Garda have all cosied up to mend the fractured relationships that certainly exist between GSOC and the Garda.  Perhaps I can stick to the facts for a few minutes.  Three different potential security breaches were identified between September and October.  We all know that modern surveillance techniques ensure that the presence of interception cannot be definitely established.  I have checked with security firms and they will tell one that.  However, in one of the three instances, the possibility that GSOC was not bugged was rated at close to nil by Verrimus.  I think it said that the possibility that GSOC was bugged was \"close or nil\" or \"nil to 1%\", but I am near enough to it.  This was stated by the countersurveillance company which discovered it.  This is a company that has worked around the world and is reported to do a good job when it goes in to do something.  We know this to be a fact.  Everything beyond that fact is speculation, well-grounded speculation by many people, but speculation nonetheless.  The implications of that particular fact is enormous not to mention particularly sinister.  It is not simply a question of asking people to move on.  That, to me, is patronising, it is offensive and an insult to the intelligence of the Irish people.  If one looks at exactly what Verrimus has said, the vast majority of people believe something happened in GSOC.  I do not care if it has changed its mind.  I believe, based on this security analysis, that something has happened.<\/p><p>  The Minister is responsible for overseeing justice, security and policing in our country.  Can the Minister say with such certainty - and he said it so quickly - that there was not Garda involvement in the alleged bugging?  If that is the case, would the Minister have information that someone else was responsible?  We all know that the Americans are putting surveillance on everybody.  We also know that the systems that were used or put in place were systems that are used by governments.  If the Minister was quick to come out and say that there was nothing, that the Garda did not do it, I come back to what Verrimus said.  The Minister is in conflict with Verrimus.

I was simply reporting to the House what I was told.  It did not matter what GSOC concluded on this issue, because we have had a week of allegations that the Garda must have had GSOC under surveillance, despite GSOC stating that there is no evidence it was under surveillance.

The answer, based on the report, is that there was not.  Was there some device out there which might possibly access telephones attached to the UK network and that were registered in the UK?

It has been a long hearing so far.  When the chairman of GSOC came before the committee and was asked why he decided not to inform the Minister or the Garda Commissioner under section 80(5) or section 102 of the 2005 Act, he said that he believed it was the right thing to do at that time.  The Minister does not seem to agree with that assessment by the chairman of GSOC.  In his private meeting with him and with other members of the commission, did the Minister ask him the reason he felt he ought not inform the Minister or the Commissioner?  Did the chairman elaborate any reasons for that?<br\/>In his statement last night, the Minister said the following.<blockquote>The chairman, in his presentation to the joint Oireachtas committee, clearly did not accept that the technology referred to could only be obtained by government agencies, despite the statement to this effect in their security consultants' report.  I did not reference it in my speech to the D&aacute;il last week as the chairman clearly placed no reliance on that advice and this is clear from his own comments to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.<\/blockquote><\/p>  <p>I assume those comments that the Minister referred to are the responses from the chairman to questioning from me at the hearing last week, when he said: \"This is the world that we live in and kit that used to be only in the hands of government agencies can be replicated.\"  I am keen to know whether, during the Minister's meeting with the ombudsman commission last week, The Minister or any of his officials at the meeting asked the chairman of the ombudsman commission or any other member of the commission about their views on the Verrimus report findings in respect of whether the specialist firm indicated this level of technology was available only to government agencies.  Did any member of the commission voluntarily express the view on the Verrimus report that the commission placed no reliance on its advice?  If so, could the Minister elaborate some more on what was said to him privately at that meeting?  I assume that as the Minister for Justice and Equality and as the Minister for Defence the Minister regularly gets briefings from technology experts in the Army, the police force or from outside parties such that he could have reason to question the credibility of Verrimus and its findings.

I gather Verrimus has not done any work for Departments, at least not to my knowledge.  This is important if we are to rely on the report from Rits, which seems to have been hastily put together.

I am keen to finish the other questions Deputy Creighton raised.  During the course of the peer review, Rits had some queries about the equipment in the GSOC offices.  A request was made to the GSOC offices to clarify some matters relating to equipment.  As I understand it, the clarifications were provided.  I do know the outcome of all this but I took the view, bearing in mind the level of concern about these issues, the complexity of the matter and the nature of the reports I received, which I examined carefully, that it was important to have that engagement.  It was no more than that.<br\/>Deputy Creighton also highlighted that when the chairman came before the committee, he detailed or referred to not giving me information.  What he actually said is on page 6 of the transcript:<blockquote>With regard to why the results were not reported, the report was in my possession only just prior to the Christmas break.  I had to think very carefully about the need to report matters to the Minister and other parties.  At the time I made a strategic decision not to report what could be described as suspicious activity that did not meet the threshold of an offence ... My decision-making at the time just prior to Christmas looked at the potential damage that could be done to public confidence if these suspicious activities were in the public domain.  We had opened an investigation under section 102(4) and the threshold test was achieved, but, by definition, any likely offence might involve a Garda member.<\/blockquote>I will stop there for one moment.  I do not know that the threshold test was achieved or why, by definition, any likely offence might involve a Garda member.  These conclusions were reached in the absence of evidence.  That is a matter for the judge to look at.  Clearly there was a view that there were vulnerabilities and potential threats and the conclusion was reached to invoke section 104(2).  The chairman went on to say:<blockquote>The level of public disquiet about allegations that garda&iacute; might be involved in that type of activity was immense.  I took the decision alone not to report at the time.<\/blockquote>Later on he states that he regrets not informing me.  I have no wish to make any more of it than it is.  The commentary from both myself and An Taoiseach with regard to me not being informed arose in circumstances whereby this matter came into the public domain in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>, whereby it was presented in a particular way and whereby I received no briefing.  Under section 103 of the legislation there is a word &quot;shall&quot;.  Section 103(1) suggests the Minister shall be briefed when an investigation of this nature takes place.  Section 103(2) contains provisions which allow GSOC to determine, in particular circumstances, that it will not brief me.  I have heard Members saying this means the commission did not have to brief me.  What it actually means is it did not have to brief me if GSOC, as a collective group, met and made a decision that one of the specific provisions under section 103(2) was invoked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900018#R01000","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1392834300,"counter":670,"content":"<p>Do you wish to clarify something, Deputy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900018#R01100","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1392834300,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I am well aware of that but that was not my question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900018#R01200","speaker":"1186"},{"type":"speech","time":1392834300,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I am not aware that happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900018#R01300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1392834300,"counter":673,"content":"<p>Deputy, has your question been answered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900018#R01400","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1392834300,"counter":674,"content":"<p>No, my question was specifically in respect of the decision of the ombudsman not to inform the Minister and whether, in their private meeting, the chairman elaborated on the reasons for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900018#R01500","speaker":"1186"},{"type":"speech","time":1392834300,"counter":675,"content":"<p>No, he apologised.

The Information Commissioner disagreed with the Department and a High Court case is pending to resolve the matter.  Is that the type of precedent we are looking at here?  The difficulty is that the inquiry the Minister is setting up seems to have no powers whatsoever and no statutory basis.  The Minister has acknowledged that it will be able to invite people to take part, \"invite\" being a very significant word in this context.

I truthfully replied to those questions.  If I had taken the position that I did not believe I should reply, I would have been accused of being evasive.  However, when I reply to the questions I am legitimately asked, I am then accused of beating up on GSOC and impugning its independence.<\/p><p>  I have consistently said that it is of huge importance that GSOC, as an independent watchdog in respect of allegations of misconduct against the Garda, should operate with absolute integrity and independence.  The independence it has is that it independently investigates matters without fear or favour and with no ministerial interference.  However, the issue we are discussing has given rise to a whole range of problems.  This committee is inquiring into these problems and the committee has asked me about particular issues.  One of the issues relates to the powers exercised under section 102 of the relevant Act, the relevance of section 103, and whether I ignored in its entirety any issue that arose in that regard or whether I had any questions to raise and, if so, if I raised them.  I have responded as truthfully as I can and this matter will be dealt with ultimately by a High Court judge.<\/p><p>  I indicated earlier the real problem in all of this.  There are a lot of good people working in GSOC.  They have a statutory role to play, their powers are set out in statute and they have statutory obligations to comply with.  GSOC is a watchdog body.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na performs its functions and the commission performs its functions as a watchdog.  There is a very interesting debate going on away from this particular controversy, not just in this country but elsewhere, which can be summed up in the phrase: \"Who watches the watchdogs?\"  This is not any more a suggestion that the watchdogs are not doing their jobs properly than it is a suggestion that the bodies they have to watch are not doing their job properly.  However, a difficulty arises with a watchdog body where questions come up such as have arisen in this instance.  If the watchdog has certain statutory obligations and if an issue arises relating to its compliance or otherwise with those obligations, does one stay schtum and say nothing or does one reference them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900020#T01200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1392835500,"counter":717,"content":"<p>The Minister surely would stay schtum in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900020#T01300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1392835500,"counter":718,"content":"<p>The DPP is entirely different because it has no statutory reporting obligations to the Minister for Justice and Equality.

The Garda Commissioner also has an independent statutory function.  He set out a series of questions in respect of what were obviously matters of concern to him.  Subsequently, a meeting took place between the Garda Commissioner and the chairman of GSOC.  I am not - any more than the members of the committee - privy to the conversation that took place between them.  It seems that is where matters rest.  Quite clearly the Garda Commissioner had concerns that the press release GSOC issues was open to misinterpretation.  Again, in fairness, Commissioner Kieran FitzGerald of GSOC addressed those issues on the \"Prime Time\" programme.  If anything confirms that they are open to misinterpretation is that for the past nine days there have been suggestions - despite GSOC's conclusions - that the Garda was surveying GSOC's offices.  GSOC has stated there was no evidence of Garda misconduct but the issue keeps coming back.  It is clear the Garda Commissioner had concerns.  Commissioner Kieran FitzGerald tried to address those concerns, very articulately, on \"Prime Time\".  The matter was then revisited before this committee and the waters became somewhat muddied as a result of the manner in which some issues were addressed.<\/p>  <p>Deputy Wallace, as he is entitled to do, is still raising the same issue.  In the context of the Commissioner's questions, it seems to me the Commissioner has said no more about it.  I can only assume that in the conversation that took place between himself and Simon O'Brien that issues of concern were addressed.  It is important that both individuals, as leaders of the separate bodies, have some area of discretion and engagement that does not involve interference by me as Minister.  What happened happened and I cannot add to that.<br\/>The Deputy asked if I can confirm whether I share the Commissioner's confidence that there were no rogue elements of garda&iacute; involved in the surveillance of GSOC's offices.  I do not know how many times this has come around in a circle.  I would come back yet again to what commissioner Kieran FitzGerald said on &quot;Prime Time&quot;.  He said they were the people investigated, they found nothing, they did not find either rogue elements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or anyone else in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaging in surveillance in their offices.  That was GSOC's conclusion, not the Commissioner's conclusion.  The Commissioner then made the statement he made.  It seems that both bodies are <i>ad idem<\/i>on that issue but it keeps on coming up.  All I can hope is that, in fairness to both bodies and in the interests of ensuring there is public confidence in both bodies, any remaining doubts about these matters, or if there are issues out there that no one has addressed, would be identified by the High Court judge.<br\/>Deputy Wallace and I do not agree frequently on some things but I absolutely agree with him that it is of huge importance that GSOC does its work.  Of course I read the Kieran Boylan report and of course I had concerns and I think I must have answered questions on this in the D&aacute;il.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn probably put questions to me on this issue in the D&aacute;il and, I am sure, Deputy Niall Collins, who is not with us, asked me questions on this issue in the D&aacute;il.  A number of things arise and I do not want to get into the detail of that report.  One of the responses the Commissioner would have given was that there was more than 50,000 documents, from memory, that GSOC obtained during the course of that investigation and that created enormous administrative issues within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but GSOC complained that matters had not been dealt with promptly, that it took too long for responses and too long for information to come to it.  That is, as I said right at the start at a very early stage, why I had a meeting, following the publication of that report, with the Commissioner and Simon O'Brien.  My recollection is that we met on more than one occasion around these issues, but I am open to correction on that.  It resulted in new protocols being put in place  - which were signed off on in September last - which were designed to ensure that within discrete periods of time information sought by GSOC is provided to An Garda Si&oacute;ch&aacute;na.  Also, I put in place a troubleshooting mechanism, which did not previously exist, to provide that should GSOC say it is having difficulties or should there be a suggestion that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not responding when it should, that both a representative of GSOC and a representative of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would meet, under the chairmanship of an official in my Department, and any issues that had caused difficulties would be fully voiced and it would be ensured they were addressed.  However, adding to all of this, as the Deputy knows, there are suggestions that there should be various amendments to the legislation relating to GSOC.  We have been working on that within my Department and have been looking at it for some time.  That is why last Monday fortnight before all this started, we announced that I would bring proposals to Cabinet.  I will not now bring them to Cabinet until the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality Committee has completed its deliberations.  If it comes up with proposals that may be additional to matters we are going to address, we can consider them for incorporation into the submissions to Cabinet.  The idea is to strengthen GSOC's position but also it is important that it operates in a manner that ensures there is public confidence in it and that there is absolute integrity to its information systems.  It is important to note that  once the judge has reported it may be the case that something will emerge from his report that would influence also any legal changes that maybe required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900021#U04000","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392836700,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Wallace for a final question.

GSOC has produced the Kieran Boylan report and its annual reports and it has - as it is entirely appropriate and as it is entitled to do, when necessary, as was referenced last week - voiced public criticism of matters of concern.  It is not toothless, it has been independent, assertive and has raised issues.  The chairman of GSOC, despite the wish of some Members of the House, and not under any pressure from me by the way, has expressed absolute trust in me in my engagement with them.  It was confirmed, I think it was by Kieran FitzGerald, at a very early stage in his interview on \"Prime Time\", something that a lot of people have chosen to ignore for the past week, that the presentation I made in the D&aacute;il last Tuesday week accurately reflected the briefing I had received from it.  That was said as well.  I have a very simple view which I expressed at an early point.  It is important that this body gets on with its work and that there is public confidence in it, and the work we are doing is looking at how we ensure any blockages in that work can be addressed.<\/p><p>  On the issue of PULSE, that was an issue of discussion arising out of the Boylan report.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC engaged with each other on producing a new protocol, they set out how these issues would be addressed under the new protocol and they were agreed on how they would be addressed, but then we got to the issue of referring the ticket charge matter to GSOC.  It seemed to me blindingly obvious that in the context of addressing that issue it was necessary not only that the two members of the garda&iacute; who are seconded to GSOC and under its command can access PULSE but that any members of GSOC engaged in that investigation could do so because it was important that they could see what was on the PULSE system, what information was available and what conclusions could be drawn from it.  I concluded, because this was an issue to which I had been giving a substantial amount of thought, despite the protocols being in place, that we should in the future ensure that GSOC would access PULSE, as appropriate, and that is now in place and that is what is happening.  If I had no concerns about GSOC operating, if I wanted GSOC to be a spineless body, or a toothless body, which is the phrase the Deputy used, none of those decisions would have been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900022#V01500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1392836700,"counter":791,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.

If I am brief, I would like the Minister to be brief, so I can come back in with some more.<\/p><p>  It is strange that, unlike GSOC, the Garda Commissioner is solely accountable to the Minister, and that he did not deem it appropriate to ask Mr. Martin Callinan to account for his actions over the course of the past two weeks.  The review will be fully co-operated with by GSOC and the security companies involved.  Will the Minister and the Garda Commissioner co-operate with it?  Why was it not given a full judicial role with powers of compellability rather than just being allowed to ask questions?<\/p><p>  With regard to the issue of authorised surveillance, the Minister responded to Deputy Healy-Rae that he had not instructed any surveillance of GSOC.  I want the Minister to categorically and unequivocally give an assurance that no one in the Garda, the Defence Forces or the Revenue Commissioners, the authorised agencies for such actions, carried out any surveillance on GSOC.  Will he agree that it stretches credibility somewhat that the Garda Commissioner has said there is no basis for any garda involvement in any surveillance, which the Minister verified he did not challenge him on?<\/p><p>  I contend that from the beginning the Minister has sought to minimise and trivialise these issues.  He has misrepresented the view of GSOC on multiple occasions this afternoon.  He repeatedly said it had given no evidence of Garda misconduct.  That is absolutely correct, but is an entirely different matter from exonerating the Garda or from saying - as the Minister said, inaccurately - that Kieran FitzGerald had said on &ldquo;Prime Time\" that nothing had been found.  GSOC and Verrimus said no such thing.  What was actually said was that one of the anomalies - the Minister referred to them as so-called vulnerabilities and feelings, which reminds me of the Garda Commissioner speaking about so-called whistleblowers - constituted evidence to substantiate a potential breach of security in the offices of the Garda watchdog.  The chances of one incident being benign were described as close to zero.  There is a valid analysis of this which says that on detection that device ceased to exist.  That is a plausible explanation.<\/p><p>  Points have been made about the Wi-Fi.

The Garda diversion programme is hugely successful, keeping young people out of the courts and providing alternatives to deal with young people who get into trouble with the law.

Some confusion certainly was created as a consequence of the very important, probing and legitimate questions were asked of members of GSOC at this committee on this day last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900026#Z04000","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1392839100,"counter":943,"content":"<p>Was the issue regarding Kieran Boylan raised by the Minister, I am sorry but I did not-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900026#Z04100","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1392839100,"counter":944,"content":"<p>No.  At no stage-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900026#Z04200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1392839100,"counter":945,"content":"<p>-----by Simon O'Brien?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014021900026#Z04300","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1392839100,"counter":946,"content":"<p>At no stage was it suggested to me that the sweep undertaken had anything to do with the Kieran Boylan matter.

I will briefly set out the background to and recent developments at the National Sports Campus.  NSCDA was established on 1 January 2007 under the National Sports Campus Development Authority Act 2006.  The principal functions of the authority are to: develop a sports campus at Abbotstown; furnish and equip the campus; manage, operate and maintain the campus; and encourage and promote the use of the campus by professional and amateur sports people and members of the public.  In 2008, through consultation with all relevant stakeholders in Irish sport, NSCDA commenced the preparation of a master plan to include: a national field sports training centre; a national indoor training arena; athletes' accommodation; sports science and medical facilities; and all-weather pitches for community use.<\/p><p>  This master plan, which has secured the full support of all key stakeholders, was granted full planning permission in 2009.  In light of the changed Exchequer and public resource environment brought about by the economic downturn, the development of the campus in its entirety as originally envisaged was no longer deemed feasible.  As a result, the authority adopted a strategy aimed at ensuring an incremental development of the campus.  This focused on three broad elements: to commence works on the community aspects of the master plan, to bring forward a cost-efficient scheme to develop the national indoor arena and to progress the field-sport elements through a partnership approach with the various national governing bodies of sport, NGBs.<\/p><p>  As members will be aware, the first element of the campus to be put in place was the National Aquatic Centre, which was opened in March 2003 and hosted the aquatic events of the Special Olympic World Summer Games that year.  Since then, the centre has gone from strength to strength and has welcomed over 7 million visitors, while consistently ranking in the top four paying visitor attractions in the State.<\/p> <p>In 2013 more than 858,000 visits were recorded at the centre and our swim academies attracted an average of almost 2,300 children learning to swim per week.<\/p><p> In addition to the completion of the master plan, during the ten years since the opening of the NAC, the authority has also put in place new office accommodation for the FAI, the Irish Institute of Sport and, most recently, a new Irish sport headquarters, which houses 19 different national governing bodies of sport.<\/p><p> During 2013, there was considerable activity with regard to developing sports facilities.  In October last, and following consultation with Horse Sport Ireland and Pentathlon Ireland, we completed work on the National Horse Sport Arena, located within the walled gardens of the Abbotstown grounds, and a national modern pentathlon centre, which provides a dedicated training facility for fencing and shooting.  These facilities together with the NAC mean that the campus is now the only location in Europe catering for all five modern pentathlon disciplines on a single site.<\/p><p> To complement the diving programmes at the NAC, we have also developed a national diving training centre, incorporating an indoor dry diving area.<\/p><p> In addition to facilities for high-performance and elite training purposes, our master plan also provides for facilities which, like the NAC, are aimed at participation and recreational level sport.  In December last, we opened our new all-weather multi-sport synthetic pitches.  This facility has been very well received, not only within the wider sporting community, but also in the local community.  In the coming weeks we will commence development of two multi-sport grass pitches, which will be similarly used.<\/p><p> We have also recently completed the renovation of a former farm residence to provide on campus athlete accommodation for the Swim Ireland high-performance programme, which is centred at the aquatic centre.  Plans for the refurbishment of a further residence will be progressed in 2014.<\/p><p> The national indoor arena contained in our master plan is generally viewed as the key missing piece of sporting infrastructure in the State.  It comprises a national indoor athletics training centre, national gymnastics training centre, and national indoor training centre.  It will also include covered synthetic pitches.<\/p><p> The 2014 budget provided for a special allocation from the sale of a new national lottery licence to enable the development of the national indoor arena to commence in 2014.  Prior to this announcement, and in order to speed up the delivery of vital training facilities, the authority had engaged with the Irish Sports Council and Irish Institute of Sport to bring forward proposals for a high-performance training centre.  This will include additional medical, strength and conditioning, boxing, and athlete services areas.  Notwithstanding the decision to commence the national indoor arena, it is intended that this project will proceed later this year and be completed in the third quarter of 2015.  This will have a significant impact on high-performance training in advance of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.<\/p><p> As mentioned, we have worked very closely with the four main field sports to establish a framework for the development of their respective facilities contained in the master plan.  This strategy involves the authority putting in place basic infrastructure and access to the identified sites.  Each facility will be developed by the individual NGB on the basis of the existing master plan.  In agreement with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the authority will provide limited matching funding of up to &euro;500,000 to each body.  This strategy involves the individual NGB taking responsibility for programming of the facilities but also allows the use of the facilities by the authority.  The agreement of the four NGBs was secured in 2012, and it is intended that works on the GAA and FAI facilities will commence in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> The authority continues to engage with sports organisations and NGBs to bring forward proposals for additional sports facilities, as well as possible options for new office and headquarter accommodation.<\/p><p> To support the day-to-day operation of the campus, the authority has a wholly-owned subsidiary, NSCDA (Operations) Limited.  While the main focus of the company was for many years the NAC, it is also responsible for the management and operation of our new sports facilities, the office accommodation on site, and under an agreement with Fingal County Council, the operation of Morton Stadium in Santry.<\/p><p> As mentioned, 2013 was a remarkable year for the NAC.  Despite the difficult trading conditions, visitor numbers reached over 850,000, compared with 813,000 in 2012.  Record attendances were regularly broken at the swim academies, with total enrolments of almost 9,200 children.  The centre also provides free hours to Swim Ireland enabling it to develop its high-performance programme.  It is estimated that the value of such free pool time to be almost &euro;550,000 per annum based on normal pool hire charges.<\/p><p> In 2012, we played host to a number of international squads and individuals in the run-up to the London Olympic Games, with more than 190 athletes using the facility.  As a result, the potential use of the facility by teams competing in the Commonwealth Games later this year is being pursued.  The centre also plays host to a number of non-aquatic athletes and squads as part of their overall training programmes.<\/p><p> The centre has won a number of industry awards, as well as the Q-Mark for leisure centres and was short-listed for a Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland award.<\/p><p> The authority has had an opportunity to review the general scheme of the proposed sports Ireland Bill 2014.  As the proposed Bill encompasses all relevant provisions of our existing legislation, we do not see this impacting our objectives.  Sport Ireland can only lead to a more cohesive structure for sport development and delivery in Ireland.  We look forward to sport Ireland continuing the roll-out of world-class facilities in the years ahead, and to maintaining the high standards of service delivery for which our campus and staff are known.<\/p><p> I invite members of the committee to visit the campus if they so wish and I would be happy to answer any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900003#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Conway","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392802800,"counter":978,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the committee for their invitation to discuss the heads of the sport Ireland Bill and also to discuss developments in sport that are happening in the country and internationally.  We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee, which allows us to outline to the members the activities of the Irish Sports Council in the context of the development of the 59 national governing bodies under our aegis, including the three major field sport organisations.  We have been working with them in recent years in developing their organisations, developing their capacity and developing participation within the phenomenal array of sports being conducted here - apart from our own national sports.<\/p><p>  Last week we announced a package of grants amounting to more than &euro;27.5 million for the NGBs at an event attended by more than 150 people representing all our national governing bodies.  Those present included their chief executives, national coaches, high-performance coaches and administrators.  I believe we have a truly exceptional level of expertise that has developed in recent years in sports administration and international coaching for NGBs, particularly those NGBs involved very successfully in world European and Olympic competitions.<\/p><p>  I also acknowledge the successful efforts of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, in securing a budget of &euro;42.5 million for the Irish Sports Council for this year.  We all appreciate the financial difficulties the country is undergoing and will into the future.  This allocation represents a significant and large investment in our national sport.  The capital programme will also continue into this year.  Mr. Conway has already outlined the truly exceptional development at the National Sports Campus, which was only a dream a number of years ago, but is now becoming a reality.<\/p><p>  In the next fortnight we will announce the grants to the three major national field sports, the Gaelic Athletic Association, Football Association of Ireland and Irish Rugby Football Union.  That will be announced after our council meeting on 4 March.<\/p> <p>In addition, we are successfully implementing the programmes of the 32 local sports partnerships, LSPs, which operate very successfully throughout the country.  Despite the difficulties in recent years they have managed to raise 50% of their funding from local authorities and private sector commitments.  We have also been particularly emphasising the development of the national trails office, which is an operational unit.  People who have used trails throughout the country have seen how successful they are.<\/p><p> We are also concerned with increasing participation in sport and improving performance by Irish people.  Last year we had 67 medal winners in European and world championships, which is the highest we have achieved in any single year.  In this sense we are beginning to see successful delivery of the investment the Irish taxpayer has made in Irish sport in recent years and the development of the national governing bodies in regard to increasing capacity and professionalism.  This has also been assisted considerably by the two organisations under our aegis, namely, the Institute of Sport based at the National Sports Campus and Coaching Ireland operating out of the University of Limerick campus.  The operational and structural infrastructure of Irish sport is beginning to come together and deliver considerable achievements nationally and internationally in all competitions.<\/p><p> In recent years we have invested heavily in the women in sport programme.  The high-performance programmes have particular funding commitments.  We have been as transparent as possible in the context of sport investment and we have a copy of a document for all committee members which outlines all of the grants provided in Irish sport, how we spend our money and participation.  If committee members have further questions we will be happy to answer them.<\/p><p> In the coming months we will examine other major issues from a strategic point of view, which may feed into the legislation.  They are not specifically addressed in the draft heads as they exist, but they are vital components from a strategic point of view and they have national and international ramifications.  One of these issues is adventure activities.  We have been asked by the Minister to examine this matter and a member of our council, Mary Dorgan, deals with adventure activities.  This area requires oversight by way of registration and we are working on it.  We hope to have a report for the Minister by June.  The issue may have to be addressed or alluded to in the legislation because it has been raised for a considerable period of time without being addressed.  We are only waiting for an adventure sports accident to happen.<\/p><p> An issue developing at the Council of Europe which needs to be addressed but which is not addressed in the draft heads is manipulation of sports competitions and anti-corruption measures in sport.  It may need to be discussed when we reach Committee Stage.  This covers match and competition fixing.  It is an international issue and we cannot be immune to this consideration.  We could be one of the first countries to institute legislation to criminalise any activity in this regard.  It is a strategic issue which must be addressed.<\/p><p> At present the Oireachtas is addressing the Betting (Amendment) Bill.  It is an area which still needs to be addressed in the context of a potential income stream for the funding of sport, not alone operationally but also with regard to campus and sporting facilities.  I am not in any way taking from the emphasis of the Bill on the horse and greyhound racing industries.  These are nationally important industries, but so is the online and remote betting which takes place on 80% of sporting activities outside of horse racing and greyhound racing.  It is an opportunity which should not be lost in terms of trying to provide additional funds for development and making operational and physical capacity provisions for sport which would not be a burden on the taxpayer.  An EU report on the funding of sport was completed in December .  It is an issue the committee should examine and perhaps this Bill is an opportunity.  I appreciate the Betting (Amendment) Bill is well under way, but the opportunity should not be lost to examine how we may be able to fund our sports in future without placing a further burden on the taxpayer in this regard.<\/p><p> Mr. Treacy will address certain issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900004#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Mulvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392803400,"counter":980,"content":"<p>I will comment on some of the draft heads of Bill.  The council is pleased its anti-doping recommendations are reflected in the draft legislation.  The proposed Bill would see strong information sharing between sport Ireland and other agencies such as the Irish Medicines Board, the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is important this is included in the legislation as it is in line with international legislation.  It is definitely a step in the right direction.  The council has been at the forefront in the fight against doping in sport, working closely with international agencies such as the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, and the Association of National Anti-Doping Organisations, ANADO, to ensure best international practice is implemented at a national level.<\/p><p>  Substantial legislative and operational changes on child protection have been made.  The council has done a huge amount of work and has a strong track record in this area.  We provide advice, support and training to national sports governing bodies and local clubs with an emphasis on creating a positive culture for children in sport.  The council is a resource for sport in the area of child welfare and welcomes its prominence in the new legislation.<\/p><p>  The high performance function has been enhanced and the strategy of the council is paying off in terms of medal return, as the chairman outlined.  More than 200 podium places have been achieved since 2010.  The new legislation specifically outlines the need to support high performance athletes in achieving excellence in sport.  This highlights the work of the Institute of Sport, operating out of the National Sports Campus, which delivers world class services to coaches and athletes.  More than 2,500 hours were provided by institute service providers to Irish athletes in 2013, a major investment of expertise delivered directly to the best sports people in the country.<\/p><p>  We are pleased to see a function to develop coaching at all levels in sport, and acknowledgement of the coaching education programmes.  Good coaches develop a life-long involvement in sport, and Coaching Ireland has worked closely with the governing bodies to ensure improved standards in coaching at every level of sport.<\/p><p>  It is important and welcome that the function relating to increased participation mentions participation at a local level in particular.  The LSPs have a specific remit to promote participation in sport at a local level, and to reach hard to access groups such as women, older people and people living in socially deprived areas.  It is worth noting the council has a significant impact on the level of sports participation through the 107 bodies we fund.  The national governing bodies and the LSPs engage with hundreds of thousands of people through sport every day.  Through the creation of a genuine sporting culture we can influence the wider community and promote healthier living through physical activity.<\/p><p>  The Irish Sports Monitor has recorded increases in participation.  We saw a major jump in participation rates from 34% to 46% over the three years to 2011.  Figures on sedentary behaviour fell from 16% in 2009 to 13% in 2011.  If these numbers can be sustained in the long term, we will have achieved something important and unique in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The recession has been good for sport and sport has not missed the opportunity.  The council places the national governing bodies and LSPs at the heart of Irish sport.  They are not specifically referenced in the draft legislation but they will be the key partners and collaborators of sport Ireland.  We invest in these organisations to ensure they deliver for their members.  This investment is not only financial.  Our new organisational capability building programme is proving to be effective and popular.<\/p> <p>In total, 55 organisations, including 34 national governing bodies, NGBs, are committed to a process of annual planning, measurement and review with respect to building capacity over the next five years.  The target capacities include corporate governance, project management, risk management, leadership, change management and strategic planning.  A great deal of good work has been done in terms of organisation capacity with the governing bodies of sport and local sports partnerships, LSPs.<\/p><p> I welcome the reference to the new role of Sport Ireland in the areas of education and information, which has been highlighted among its functions.  The council carried out a significant amount of work in terms of anti-doping education, a code of ethics and coaching among other programmes.  This will be an important operational area for Sport Ireland as it embarks on its new remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900005#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Treacy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392804000,"counter":982,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Treacy.

Besides our discussion on the heads of the Bill, updating us on their organisations' activities has been helpful, but perhaps they might expand further.  The Chairman has covered a lot of ground, but the witnesses identified some of the benefits in this extensive legislation.  They referred to the powers, anti-doping, etc., all of which are important.  However, I am yet to be convinced.  I understand the necessity of bringing the bodies together from a strategic point of view, as Mr. Mulvey stated.<\/p> <p>I do not get the sense that the public or people involved in sport will see any great difference as a result of this merger.  I think it has more to do with the Government's agenda in relation to the abolition of quangos.  When in opposition the two parties in government created huge hype around organisations like those presenting here today and other State agencies or entities, giving the impression that there was something bad about them and we needed to rid ourselves of them.  The reality is that most of those organisations do important work.  I would like to hear more about how in the delegates' view sport will benefit from the two agencies being brought together.  Mr. Benton made the point that the remit of the agency will now be broader in terms of dealing with other facilities around the country.  That could be done relatively easily by giving the National Sports Campus Development Authority more extensive jurisdictional powers than it currently has.  I am not against the amalgamation or the legislation but I believe the case for the merger of the two organisations has not been made to the extent that it might, other than it being a follow through on this quango reduction crusade, which the Minister, Deputy Varadkar and others championed when in opposition.<\/p><p> Reference was made to governance and so on.  An issue that arose previously for the Irish Sports Council was that of conflict of interest among board members, in respect of which an investigation was launched and the council ended up in the courts.  The council was to some extent admonished by the judge when as a result of the injunction the investigation had to be stood down.  Does this legislation provide an appropriate mechanism for dealing with such an event were it to arise again or with any concerns which either organisation might have?  For example, does the legislation provide a mechanism which puts the agencies on a sounder footing in terms of proceeding in relation to specific issues that arise and does it clarify what is and is not acceptable, what is and is not a conflict of interest and so on?  I have read the relevant section and based on my understanding of the issue that arose previously, from my reading of it in the newspapers, it is not entirely clear to me that what is provided in that section would resolve that issue were it to arise again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900006#H02700","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392804600,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>On the final issue raised by Deputy Dooley, I do not wish to get into that as I believe it has been amicably resolved between the parties concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900007#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Mulvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1392804600,"counter":1010,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900007#J00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392804600,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>In a general sense, one of the issues about corporate governance is best addressed by the letters of appointment.  It is recommended that people appointed to boards have specific letters of appointment which elaborate on their duties, obligations, responsibilities and expected behaviour.  Up to now letters of appointment to boards simply set out the term of the appointment and little else.  Current letters of appointment in respect of the Irish Sports Council are as recommended by Paul Turpin.  I believe it is a useful mechanism that people appointed to State boards are made fully cognisant of their responsibilities and duties.  There needs to be more elaboration around that.<\/p><p>  The wider issue in terms of corporate governance for members of boards is their reporting function.  Currently, the decision around this is by virtue of law through the Minister rather than any other mechanism.  I do not disagree with the point in relation to the dispute resolution.  We are bringing together the four dispute resolution bodies in my area.  It is hoped legislation in this regard will be enacted by the Oireachtas by the end of the year.<\/p><p>  There is a cull of quangos policy about, much of which is appropriate and proper given the amount of overlap of functions.  In our case, there are only two sporting bodies and a decision has been taken to amalgamate them.  Up to now, we have worked well.  The Irish Sports Council as an entity has worked extremely well, as has the NSCDA.  There is a complementarity between us in so far as we inform each other.  There are no great staffing issues.  As outlined by Mr. Benton and Mr. Conway the Irish Sports Council has only four staff.  We have 39 staff.  The only reason we have 39 staff is because we brought in Coaching Ireland this year.  Our equivalent in Northern Ireland has almost 90 staff.  The operational efficiencies are minimal.  Not much , even in terms of savings, will arise as a result of the merger.<\/p><p>  Much of the powers being given to sport Ireland are replicated from the previous configuration of the council and campus.  I do not believe the Department proposes to divest itself of the capital programme.  To a large degree this is a bringing together, not so much from a policy point of view but from an operational point of view, of two bodies that operate in different spheres.  The campus authority operates largely in the commercial high procurement, high cost facilities area, particularly around the campus, which it is doing very successfully and efficiently.  The council is more about funding the non-governmental bodies, NGBs, managing as best we can in a remote way the operation of NGBs in creating organisational capacity for them and, as stated earlier, carrying out audits.  We audit a number of governing bodies each year just to satisfy ourselves that the money we have expended to them is being appropriately spent.  That is an external audit.  We carry out our own internal audit on moneys we have provided to NGBs.  We have engaged in more oversight of agencies over recent years because, as a State organisation distributing &euro;42 million, we are aware of the need to ensure we not only receive value for money but that the money is spent appropriately and properly.<\/p><p>  Mr. Treacy and I have to date met approximately 15 of the non-governmental bodies at which we outlined their corporate and audit responsibilities.

I do not want to get into the specifics of it but our job in discussing the heads of this Bill in consultation with those affected is to consider how it can be strengthened to assist in addressing any potential issues that may arise.  Perhaps the council could reflect with its legal advisers on what can be done to strengthen the legislation in this regard and could then report same back to the committee, which could be addressed by members by way of amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage.  The purpose of discussion on the heads of Bills in committee is to ensure we do not have to return to the process of amending what is enshrined in law.

Perhaps the committee can recall us when we have a more considered view on this.<\/p><p> We are addressing this Bill in light of the fact that nearly all of it is already enshrined in legislation.  There is some elaboration, and one of the reasons I raised some of the strategic issues not in the Bill is the idea of whether it is time for us as a country to consider issues occurring internationally.  There is a domestic issue around adventure sports that must be registered, if not licensed in some way.  We cannot be immune to match fixing, which happens in all major international sports, and the examples are listed.  There is also the matter of funding and how the Irish Sports Council in particular will be funded.  Will it be exclusively through Exchequer grant or can we get some money from the online remote betting that is ongoing, not only on the sports we are funding but in other areas too?  Some 80% of funding coming from betting is outside of horse and greyhound racing.  A European committee has discussed this and perhaps the debate should include its document.  If the Exchequer cannot make up the money under pressure, people are making money from sport in other ways but are not contributing to the cost of presenting sport or putting on events.

I have been around the scene with all of them for many years, as Mr. Benton and I go back to Drimnagh Castle and Mr. Treacy and I competed on the track.  I was a member of the board of the Irish Sports Council some years ago and Mr. Conway is the new kid on the block with regard to the National Sports Campus Development Authority.  I was in Abbotstown a couple of weeks ago for the opening of the pitches, and as a former sports person, I was really excited about what is happening up there.  I hope we will not have to wait many more years for the indoor facilities for the other multi-purpose sports to be installed.<\/p><p>  The presentations indicate this is a big step forward for Irish sport and a good news story.  The great work done with the campus development authority in Abbotstown must be highly commended.  Mr. Barry O'Brien held a position there.  There is also ongoing work at Santry stadium.  The Irish Sports Council was established in 1999 and I have seen a phenomenal transformation in sport in Ireland in that time.  The national governing bodies must step up to the plate now as they have been given the opportunity to look after their own high performance planning and development.  The athletes are being well looked after financially when they meet the criteria, and they are well looked after medically.  Taken with the work of the Institute of Irish Sport, there has been a fantastic transformation in Irish sport, and I say \"well done\" to everyone here on that.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Benton indicated, this is not just about the sports campus in Abbotstown or Santry stadium but rather Ireland as a whole.  Is there any opportunity for minority sports in Ireland which may not have facilities or funding to provide them?  Other major sports such as Gaelic football get funding from the Exchequer, and there will be a presentation in that regard next week.  Is there an opportunity for the new authority to meet personnel from the GAA and ask about opening its facilities in Ireland for local communities?  We speak about healthy living and increasing participation but many towns and villages in Ireland do not have facilities.  There are GAA facilities in most areas so this could be an ideal opportunity for the new body to consider such a plan rather than focusing on Abbotstown or Santry.<\/p><p>  Mr. Treacy referred to education and we hear much about physical education in schools.  Is there an opportunity for sport Ireland to consider how to empower the implementation of physical education in schools under the new umbrella?

As he knows, the campus was on a life support machine for quite a long time and the challenge facing the authority was to bring on stream the much-needed facilities on a cost-effective basis.  We have been quite successful in doing so.  Mr. Conway has indicated how we carried out various developments by recycling many existing buildings.  The FAI headquarters is in a refurbished building and the 19 national governing bodies in the sports headquarters also occupy a refurbished building.  The equestrian arena consists of the walled garden being brought into very effective use.  The facilities for pentathlon, as well as fencing, shooting and the rest, are also in a refurbished location.  They have been very cost-effective developments providing high quality facilities.  The big breakthrough came with partnership arrangements with the major sports, with &euro;500,000 promised to each in matching funds, and we know the GAA and the FAI will spend multiples of that.  We are still negotiating with the IRFU and the hockey body with regard to their development.<\/p><p>  The Senator specifically asked about the arena and a hope that the facilities will be brought on line.  With the funding put in place, it is planned to start work this year.  We have come from the blocks very fast and there are professional design teams in place to work up the necessary procurement documentation.  Our timeframe puts the on-site start before the end of the year.  To accelerate the bringing on line of facilities at the institute, we are separating them from the arena.  That work will also start before the end of the year.  I am quite excited about what is happening on the campus.  The Minister has taken us off the life support machine and put us through whatever rehabilitation process was required.  We are now competing at a top level.  The prospects are good.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked about what is happening nationally and there is a great opportunity to examine requirements.  It will be part of the brief of sport Ireland to see what is needed nationally.  My comments refer to facilities specifically, and that will be an important part of the brief for sport Ireland.  The Senator asked particularly about organisations like the GAA, and in my experience there is much happening at a local level at GAA facilities.  That is not always publicised but I am familiar with areas where there is a range of ongoing activities.  More of that should be encouraged and sport Ireland will be in a position to do that.  The same applies to the FAI and what it does.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked about minor sports that are not in a position to pony up money.  He can see what we have done with the pentathlon, shooting and fencing, as well as diving.  We have not required people to make a certain level of investment but there are arrangements where they contribute on a so-called community commercial basis.  That ensures they get the required facilities at minimum cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900008#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Benton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392805800,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>In terms of minority sports, the national indoor arena gives them an opportunity to showcase their national championships.  Currently, governing bodies of sports are trying to find a home for their national championships.  We have athletics in Morton Stadium and we have the Aviva Stadium, Croke Park and so forth.  There is no opportunity for certain sports to showcase and plan their national championships.  In our research with all the governing bodies, more than 20 national governing bodies have been consulted about their requirements for an indoor arena.  We have put 1,500 bleacher seats into that arrangement, so that is their normal national spectator turnout.  We are giving them an opportunity to showcase their sport, and it has been very well received.  Gymnastics Ireland, in particular, has no national facility at present.  If one goes to a gymnastics club, and my daughter participates in gymnastics, the club must pull out the mats and pull them back in.  How is that supposed to enhance or develop that sport?  The national gymnastics centre is the one-stop-shop in gymnastics facilities.  We are also making sure that the sport can be showcased in the national sports hall so it has a venue in which to showcase.

While the amalgamation might have emerged from the policy on rationalisation of Government agencies, I see it as a no-brainer, at this stage.  Having worked on the campus authority for the last number of years, I consider this an obvious development.  What we do on a daily basis is inextricably linked with the Irish Sports Council.  Anything that addresses the fragmentation of effort must be welcomed.  The Federation of Irish Sport, which represents all of the bodies, is very strongly in favour and sees significant advantages in a single voice for sport working very closely with the Department.  It is important to record that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900009#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Benton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392805800,"counter":1019,"content":"<p>I wish to make a few points in response to Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  With regard to minority sports, indoor facilities are critically important for many of those small organisations, so they have an indoor space to hold their competitions.  David and I have discussed this quite a lot.<\/p><p>  I echo what Sean Benton said about the GAA.  It works in the local community.  We are conducting a Get Ireland Walking initiative at present with organisations such as the HSE, the GAA and the Irish Heart Foundation.  The GAA is opening up walking routes around its playing fields.  It is basically getting its members active again when their playing days are over.  It is something the GAA is very much aware of in terms of making sure the facilities are available for the community.<\/p><p>  PE in school is an old chestnut.  My view is that there is not enough time for it in primary school.  There is a very good curriculum in place but not enough time is given to it.  It is similar in secondary school.  Without a shadow of doubt, there is no time and no priority, and that is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills.  It is not prioritised.  If we are seeking to have a culture of physical activity in this country, it must start in primary and secondary schools.  It is not for the sporting children who are very good at sport, but for the children who might not feel sporty or might not have the confidence to involve themselves in physical activity.  The PE curriculum plays a key role in enhancing the skills of children at primary level, so they have the confidence to continue to play sport when they go to secondary school.  That is the critical issue.  I believe there is a cultural shift around physical activity in this country, because there is a great deal of activity taking place.  However, the piece we must put in place is to ensure that nobody is left behind and that the skills are given to all the children in every primary school throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900009#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Treacy"},{"type":"speech","time":1392805800,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of the two bodies for their presentations.  I have seen massive improvements in the facilities.  I have been to the National Aquatic Centre on a number of occasions.  Unfortunately, I could not attend the Abbotstown launch but I would have loved to have been there.  The facilities there are fantastic.<\/p><p>  Many questions have been answered by the witnesses on the work both bodies have done up to now on the complex and its expansion.  The plans for the future are fantastic and will enhance sport.  There was a reference to funding from the private sector.  The bodies are funded by the Government, but do the witnesses see a further role in expanding the contribution from the private sector?<\/p><p>  Will there be a loss of identity with this merger?  Everybody appears to be happy with it, but will the roles of the individuals in each organisation change?  Will they continue to focus on the areas on which they have been working?  The witnesses spoke about expanding roles and the areas they can examine.  I have been involved in karate all my life; I have always been interested in that sport.  It is a minority sport.  It is not recognised in the Olympic Games, but there is a possibility it might happen in the near future.  I was at the disco dancing in Ashbourne recently and there were hundreds of children at it.  Do the witnesses envisage these types of activity being included as well?  These big competitions are taking place all over the country.  Is there a bigger role in that regard?<\/p><p>  I agree that there should be a single recognised voice for sports.  It is important for conveying the message as we should all sing from the one hymn sheet.  It is in the interests of everybody to get the sports facilities and to have a voice that we can recognise and consult.  Is there much duplication?  Can duplication be cut as a result of the merger?  The witnesses say there are not many savings as a result of the amalgamation.<\/p><p>  I agree that reaching out to the schools is an issue that must be examined further.  As John Treacy said, there are different areas in the schools.  Not every child is interested in activities, but we must have programmes in the schools whereby children do exercise of some description.  It need not necessarily be sport related.  They can do other things in the schools.  Do the witnesses see a role in pushing that further?<\/p><p>  On the issue of match-fixing and doping, the witness says we need legislation.  Could she give us a better idea of what is required?  It need not be now, but perhaps she could give us some idea of how that can be done and put into a legislative format.  It could be forwarded to the committee.  When this Bill is being considered we can raise the issues.  It is an important area.<\/p><p>  Child protection is a huge issue.  Obviously, every sporting body has its rules.  Does the Irish Sports Council have a way of monitoring that?  Does it have an input in that regard, given that it is funding different groups?  Does it ensure that everything is above board in these bodies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900009#L00400","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392806400,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>Deputy Ellis has asked a number of questions, and my colleagues Mr. Treacy and Dr. May can answer some of them.<\/p><p>  Both of us are saying that the synergies that can be achieved by having one body are inarguable in the sense that there are two bodies in sport and it is time to amalgamate them.  It is also time to develop that capacity.  In the future it will bring organisational strength from the point of view of all of the disciplines and will give us a totality of focus.  There will, under the Bill, be a separate committee for the national campus development.  As I recall, that particular functionality will continue as a particularly discrete function of the future sports Ireland. <\/p><p>  The other capacity issues are important.  I will always have the view that one needs interchangeability within an organisation whereby people can grow in the job and do not become specialists in just one area.  One must try to move the specialism around.  We are a small body and when we are amalgamated we will still be a small body.  Under the employment control frameworks we are ten staff down without replacements and we are losing people to international bodies.  Therefore, people need to be able to double up and treble up in some cases.<\/p><p>  A lot of the issues relating to oversight and integration of sport have emerged over the past number of years, such doping, match fixing and child protection, which was the last issue mentioned by the Deputy.  We have programmes for as many as those as we can.  We put the programmes in, we put the training programmes in, and we remind national governing bodies of their obligations - that is legally, morally, socially and to the sport itself.  The national governing bodies of the sports have themselves addressed some of the issues that occurred in the past in these areas.  I do not want to go into those cases because they have been a matter of law in the past, but they are well known to us all.  The bodies have really taken on board lessons from incidences of child interference in an inappropriate way and put in more robust mechanisms of vetting in accordance with the law and in the interest of the sports themselves.  We have come through a bad period.  One can never fully legislate for such unfortunate incidents, but they are under notice.<\/p><p>  Dr. May has clearly done an extensive doping programme.  It was so extensive that the international body, the World Anti-Doping Agency, constantly relies on us for our standard.  We are one of the world's standards on anti-doping.  I think our child protection laws are as robust now as we can get them in the sense of what has occurred - unfortunately a practice in the past. <\/p><p>  With regard to the utilisation of facilities, there is great potential in the local sports partnerships to bring people, sports and facilities together.  There is no point in funding high-cost facilities throughout the country without their being made available, in so far as is reasonably possible, to sports, particularly sports that do not interfere with playing pitches, such as running tracks on the side of pitches or other all-weather opportunities.  More bodies are beginning to realise that State investment in capital programmes comes with a price - that it is for the community and the sport or the sport and the community.  The standard approach of the National Sports Campus is that one multiplies the multiplicity of activities possible with the facilities available.  To a large degree the seed money for all of these is taxpayers' money.<\/p><p>  I am concerned about how we can maintain a high level of activity in all of our sports in the future.  Sometimes we forget in this country - I have learned this over the past two or three years in the sports council - that Ireland is involved in an enormous number of sports.  That is apart from our national games, which are not effectively played on a national basis in any other country.  Ireland must compete internationally and is obliged, or our country demands, to have a presence at European and world level - a podium finish if possible, but certainly a presence.  All of the sports have the ambition to produce champions, apart from participation. <\/p><p>  We have the function of recognising, promoting and funding talent and providing the facilities to develop that talent.  We also have a responsibility from cradle to grave to provide activities.  Mr. Treacy has outlined a number of them that we have, including \"Operation Transformation\", trails and cycling.  Last year 49,000 people had membership of an athletics club and 20,000 people were in cycling.  The upward trajectory is good, but one needs to be part of a programme or plan.  That does not just happen, but must be developed and brought out.  Sport is not all about competition; it is about community, family, physicality and the health issues attached.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan has been involved in sports promotion in the primary school sector. <\/p><p>  I wish to raise one issue which is probably connected to my previous occupation.  I am appalled at the phenomenon of sporting facilities in universities, third level institutions and secondary and primary schools being closed for four months of the year due to an insurance issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900010#M00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Mulvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1392806400,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900010#M00200","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392806400,"counter":1023,"content":"<p>These facilities are probably in the elite class, but people cannot use the pools, pitches, tracks and gyms during those times.

The National Sports Campus and the aquatic centre found that a very large participation base was needed to offset any of the costs and so on incurred by the facility.  However, that also give us the opportunity to have the high performance swimmers training at the same time as participation and there is a great pull-push factor when that happens.  The participation rates in our swim academies have gone from strength to strength.  We see that in Morton Stadium in Santry also.  We see high participation rates in Cumann na mBunscol and so on because we run the facility in a way that opens the door to mass participation which offsets the operational cost of high performance delivery.<\/p><p>  In terms of the national horse sport arena, we have engaged with Horse Sport Ireland on developing that facility.  One of the affiliates of that facility is the RDS.  We see our base as a training facility where we have had high performance training over the past few days on the site itself.  We do not see ourselves as going into competition with the RDS by hosting events and so on.  That is its primary focus.  There is quite good synergy between us.

Tax relief is available on contributions made to universities and educational institutions.  We have, for example, the O'Reilly Hall, the Sutherland School of Law and so forth.

We need to be able to develop facilities like those at the RDS, Millstreet and Cavan to develop the horse sport industry.  A lot of competitors at the Olympic Games in London two years ago were Irish horse sport exports, including a horse ridden by a member of the British royal family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900012#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Mulvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1392807600,"counter":1039,"content":"<p>I apologise for rushing the delegates, but we are pressed for time.

I am delighted to hear Deputy Ann Phelan talking about the local sports partnerships, LSPs, which do fantastic work in working with socially disadvantaged people.  This weekend we are organising \"Operation Transformation\" 5 km runs; there will be 5,000 participants in the Phoenix Park and 3,000 in Blarney Castle and the LSPs are hugely involved.  Last week I was in Sligo where the LSP is organising another cycle event.  The economic impact assessment of last year's event showed that it had brought &euro;400,000 into Sligo in one weekend.  The LSPs work with people who are out of work and help them to link with sports organisations and clubs.  They have a huge role to play in that regard.<\/p><p>  There is enormous synergy between us and the campus.  There is no duplication because we are very clear on the roles of the two organisations.  We work hand in hand, which is the way it will always be.  There will be a real focus on doing the best job we can for Irish sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014021900012#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Treacy"},{"type":"speech","time":1392807600,"counter":1041,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions, but the delegates can send the answers to the committee later because we are under time pressures.
