I welcome the initiative to enhance the role of the Oireachtas committees in the Estimates and budgetary process.  I am happy to hear inputs from committee members that could assist the Government in formulating the education and skills element of the budget.<\/p><p>  The enhanced budgetary role of the committees, together with the new performance budgeting format of the Estimates process, are important elements of the commitment to improve this process and make it more open.  I am happy the Department is involved in the pilot project regarding the whole-of-year budgeting process.  Notwithstanding the inevitable teething problems, I hope the lessons from the pilot will lead eventually to a wider and more productive engagement in the Estimates process.<\/p><p>  Under new arrangements, the budget this year will be announced on 15 October, also moving forward the other elements of the budgetary calendar.  This earlier date presents particular challenges for the education sector, given that the academic year only starts in September when a clearer picture of the student population for the year ahead emerges.  My Department will be required to make an earlier call than usual on the projected expenditure position for 2013 and its likely impact on requirements for 2014.  This will require close attention in the lead up to the budget.<\/p><p>  Budget 2013 saw the identification of savings measures on current expenditure amounting to some &euro;90 million on the Department of Education and Skills Vote, increasing to &euro;103 million in 2014 and to &euro;123 million in a full year.  These measures were taken to ensure overall expenditure on the Vote remained within the ceiling set as part of the comprehensive expenditure review.  They also facilitated funding for additional initiatives on the Vote and the offsetting of emerging cost pressures on the pay side.  These initiatives included funding for the literacy and numeracy strategy in schools, junior certificate reform and the continued roll-out of 100 Mbits broadband to second level schools.  Important funding was also provided for extra places under the labour market education and training fund, Momentum, and the Springboard programme.<\/p><p>  The Estimate for 2013 also made provision for up to an additional net 900 teachers in schools in September 2013, clue to increasing demographics.  These demographic drivers are likely to be of similar scale for 2014.  While the savings measures announced in budget 2013, and in earlier budgets, will have follow-through effects in 2014, committee members will see that I am still required to identify measures to yield a further &euro;44 million in current expenditure savings next year.  I will also be required to take account of further upward pressures on expenditure that may emerge in 2014.  While it is very early to make strong projections at this stage of the year, it is anticipated that the last of the payments to be made under the redress scheme will impose upward pressure on the 2014 ceiling.<\/p><p>  In addition, I will need to take account of the surge in demand for resource teachers in schools.  Members will recall that I recently authorised the National Council for Special Education to retain the level of resource teachers available to students with special educational needs at the 2012-2013 levels.  The costs of additional resource teachers will have to be met from within the ceiling for 2014.<\/p><p>  My Department will also have to pay close attention for 2014 to expenditure on superannuation payments which account for over &euro;1.1 billion, 13% of current expenditure, on the Vote.  The scale of this expenditure, over which I have effectively no control, means that even slight increases in retirements can have a significant impact on other areas of the Vote.<\/p><p>  The 2014 expenditure ceiling for the Department will also be adjusted to take account of savings arising from the implementation of the Haddington Road agreement.  This adjustment will be determined in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Securing additional savings of &euro;44 million and containing upward expenditure pressures next year, while continuing to seek to protect front-line education services, will be a difficult challenge.  The budgetary arithmetic for 2014 already takes account of extra savings that will accrue in that year as a result of decisions taken in previous budgets.  These decisions include increases in the third level student contribution up to 2015; reductions in the levels of capitation payments to schools and to higher education institutions, also up to 2015; and savings from adjustments to the staffing schedule in small schools up to 2014.<\/p><p>  The Department has sought in the briefing material provided to give some perspective regarding the savings requirement for 2014.  It shows that 78% of current expenditure is on pay and pensions, which covers the pay costs of approximately 94,000 staff in education and goes towards the superannuation costs of some 41,000 pensioners.  Apart from the payroll adjustments arising from the Haddington Road agreement, securing further savings on pay expenditure on my Vote will essentially require reductions in numbers of staff in education.  Discounting for demographics, it can be seen that significant staff numbers have already been withdrawn from all levels of the education sector, as a result of measures announced in previous budgets.  Nevertheless, if further savings are to be found in this area, the maths is simple, if the resulting impacts are not.<\/p><p>  The key elements of non-pay expenditure are also set out in the slides provided.  Effectively all elements of non-pay expenditure have been the subject of budgetary adjustments since budget 2009.  Making further adjustments in these areas, which are already close to the bone, will certainly present challenges to the continued delivery of quality education services.<\/p><p>  Efforts to improve the delivery of education and training services continue. The new education and training boards will soon be responsible for the delivery of local education and training on a much larger scale than ever before, when they assume control of the 16 F&Aacute;S training centres later this year and during 2014.  SOLAS, Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Oideachais Leanunaigh agus Scileanna, will be formally established before the end of this year and will provide a national strategy for the wider further education and training sector, including those services delivered by the education and training boards.<\/p><p>  I am also anxious to progress implementation of the national strategy for higher education, so that we can have a higher education system providing a high quality education for increasing numbers of students.  A key priority will be the establishment of a new relationship between the State and the 39 publicly funded higher education institutions to make sure graduates are being provided with the skills needed for the social and economic well-being of the nation.  A proportion of public funding to the institutions will be set aside as performance funding in this regard.<\/p><p>  The determination of the overall budgetary strategy for 2014, including adhering to the deficit targets that were set by the ECOFIN council in 2010, will be finalised over October.  While we would prefer that education and skills expenditures were insulated from further reductions, the reality is that the savings measures necessary to regain economic equilibrium will have to be secured across all areas of government.<\/p><p>  I hope I have sketched out for members the challenging backdrop to the formulation of the Department of Education and Skills Estimate for 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071700004#C00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1374062700,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for this presentation.  The material provided to the committee is very useful as it gives breakdowns in expenditure and savings.  This is a welcome engagement.<\/p><p>  Looking at the menu of potential cuts to save &euro;44 million, one can see they will hurt and impact on education services.  Does the Minister have a breakdown of the impact of the additional resource teachers that will be employed?  I note the figure of &euro;44 million in cuts has not been updated, as the Minister indicated it might be, to take into account these costs.<\/p> <p>What is that cost?  It is a cost that should be found elsewhere but the Minister has indicated that it is his intention to do that.<\/p><p> The Minister also referred to certain savings relating to the capital assets test option in his projections of options on the table.  I might ask for more detail on what is involved in that.  Figures have been provided.  How have they been arrived at and what type of measures would be required to hit those targets that have been identified?<\/p><p> In respect of last year's budget measures and their impact, a significant part of the Minister's budget savings last year were to be taken from the reserves of VECs and the institutes of technology sector.  From my engagement with the sector I believe this is having a very significant impact.  We are finding that many of our institutes of technology are struggling to make ends meet as a result of the continuing reduction in funding to them.  Does the Minister have any plans to repeat that or to assist those that are finding it difficult?  <\/p><p> Does the Minister have any more detail in respect of the impact of the Haddington Road agreement and what the reduced costs relating to his Department will be?  He has indicated that the vast majority of his budget is fixed cost based on staff payments, therefore, the Haddington Road agreement is significant in respect of the Department costs that may decrease.  What is the impact of that?  Since education has such a high proportion of fixed costs and staff costs and, therefore, would take a much higher proportion of the benefit of the Haddington Road cost reductions, surely we should not have to look at any cuts in the upcoming budget?<\/p><p> In respect of the debt situation in our primary schools, we had a meeting two weeks ago where we heard representatives from primary school management associations.  The Catholic Primary School Managers' Association indicated that according to its calculations, up to 60% of primary schools will be operating in the red this autumn.  That is because of the removal of the minor works grant and other issues.  Has the Minister any plans to address that because it puts the burden back on families to raise funds to make up that deficit which is not a sustainable situation?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071700004#C00300","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374063300,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and officials and thank them for attending.  Every Minister will make a case as to why their Department should not have to make such large adjustments and argue their corner.  Has the Minister made that case? We are looking to the future to try to break this cycle we seem to encounter every 30 years where we go bust as a country.  Education will form a major part of breaking the 30-year cycle we have had since the foundation of the State.  Can the Minister go back and make a case that we cannot afford to cut &euro;44 million from our budget this year because the long-term costs would be detrimental to the State?  What efforts have been made to date and could the Minister make further efforts to reduce that figure?<\/p><p>  Along with detrimental costs to society, one area from budget 2012 that is still impacting and about to impact further relates to small schools.  The highest tier of that adjustment is about to kick in for the forthcoming academic year.  Even at this stage, could that be reviewed, could there be a row back from implementing that highest tier and could we stay at the second tier announced in budget 2012?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071700005#D00200","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speech","time":1374063300,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and officials for being here.  It would be ideal if we could insulate the education budget from any adjustments this year.  There has been much success in the past number of years in the maintenance of class sizes across the board.  Special education has effectively been ring fenced and there have been developments regarding the pay and pensions issue within the education budget, which takes up a large chunk of it.  Much has been protected.  Overall expenditure on special education is &euro;1.3 billion.  I know this can be a difficult and delicate subject to raise but we have an imbalance where schools in slightly more affluent areas get a disproportionate amount of the resources and schools in my constituency with a poorer demographic do not seem to be getting the same cut of that &euro;1.3 billion because they do not have access to private psychological assessments.  Is there any sense that we need to reform that expenditure to ensure that those who really need that expenditure get it?<\/p><p>  Deputy McConalogue touched on the capital assets test.  I have not seen the figure but I think about &euro;330 million, if not more, is spent on student grants every year.  Again, there is a problem in that system in that it does not funnel the money to those who really need it because we do not have a test that adequately takes in the assets of somebody who has a magician of an accountant, who can maintain their child's maintenance grant despite the fact that they have large assets.  There are two large elements there could be investigated.  <\/p><p>  The debate around fee-paying schools is sometimes more emotive than based on reality.  There is no figure of &euro;90 million that can be easily yanked from the fee-paying sector because these schools do not get capitation grants because if this was to happen overnight, a number of them would come into the system and it is as not as easy as saying that there is &euro;90 million that could be easily spent somewhere else.  It is not as simple as that.  However, we must focus on the 92% of schools within the free system that are totally dependent on the State.  If we were to ask them to feel the pinch, we should do so.  Notwithstanding the fact that it is not as simple as taking &euro;90 million away from the fee-paying sector and putting it somewhere else because it would not work out that way, there would be some savings that could be made by disproportionately increasing the pupil-teacher ratio as we have been doing in the past number of years.<\/p><p>  I do not come to this trying to find easy answers.  The suggestion that special education resources are not going to where they are most needed, that student grants are not being spent the way they should be or the issue of fee-paying schools are difficult subjects to raise but we are in the business of asking hard questions and finding solutions.  In terms of class size, what we have achieved so far must be maintained.  The money spent on special needs assistants and resource hours must be maintained.  Everybody across the board must make the point that we value the teaching and the professionals involved in our education system who are dealing with huge pressures, undergoing huge change and reform, are being asked to do much more and are dealing with children, students and families who have suffered hugely in the past number of years.  They are holding everything together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071700005#D00300","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1374063300,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the three Deputies for their questions.  I will ask the Minister of State to come in if he wishes to address some of the issues that have been raised.  As a background to this, we are very conscious in the Department that we are asking everybody in the system to do more with less, that there are many pressures and that many families are under pressure.  Schools and the education community are no different.  In many cases, some second-level teachers are operating in difficult circumstances because of the nature of the contracts they have.<\/p><p>  I will turn to the specific queries that were raised by the three Deputies.  I will take them in the order in which I received them.  In response to Deputy McConalogue's question, we are still operating on the figure of &euro;44 million.<\/p> <p>If the full 500 teachers are required to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>in special education resource teachers, we calculate that, as of now, it is of the order of &euro;22.5 million.  We will not know that for definite until September and it is a rough calculation based on the average cost of a teacher multiplied by 500.  We had provisionally put into the 2014 figures revenue of approximately &euro;6 million, coming from a saving on grants due to the asset tests.  That has not been finalised or completed yet and I do not expect we will make much progress on it for this year.  That is a problem.<\/p><p> On examining the reserves for the Vocational Education Committees, VECs, Education and Training Boards, ETBs and the institutes of technology, we were always aware that some of those institutions might be more stressed than others and less robust in their funding than others.  There will be discussions with all of them individually on how we will proceed.  Letterkenny Institute of Technology has a particular, once-off difficulty with which the Deputy is probably familiar, having spoken to those in the institute.  The impact of the Haddington Road agreement is a very good point and we will make it.  We have not yet had the detailed discussions.  We are being credited with &euro;51 million for 2013 but no figure has been agreed for 2014 or 2015.  That is a work in progress and any support the committee can give us would be very helpful.<\/p><p> I was interested to hear what Deputy McConalogue said about the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association, CPSMA, deputation that appeared before the committee.  I was not aware of that precise figure of 60% in the red.  We will certainly examine it.  If there are proceedings from the committee it would be useful for us to get them.  I was not directly aware of it.  I have made the case with the Taoiseach and others to try to get some degree of ring-fencing for education.  We are the only part of the public service that is continuing to recruit additional people because of the demographics.  That is not the case in other areas, although there has been some slight reduction as a result of yesterday's Cabinet announcement.  I will continue to make the case.  On small schools and the implementation of the third year of the alteration in the pupil-teacher ratio, I will not change it.  It will proceed.  There is much internal money in the smaller school sector in some respects and everybody must contribute to the savings.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raised three specific issues.  The special education allocation of &euro;1.3 billion is just &euro;100 million less than what we put into third-level education in its entirety.  That is why I have asked Mr. Eamon Stack, the chairperson of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to head up the special working group which will report to me at the end of September this year, regarding getting a different allocation model for resource teachers, SNAs and resources to schools.  Those who know how it would function tell me it will take at least two financial years before I will have an operational model.  It is proposed to profile the school and make the resources available to that school as opposed to an individual's diagnosis unlocking access to resources.  That would be controversial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071700005#D00400","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374063900,"counter":16,"content":"<p>It would be a great reform if it could happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071700006#E00200","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1374063900,"counter":17,"content":"<p>It would be controversial.

We have received correspondence from people, many of whom have borrowed money.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul talked about making money available for such a diagnosis.  It needs to be examined and I have asked Mr. Stack to do so.<\/p><p>  We have not got agreement on the introduction of the capital assets test for student grants.  There are two kinds of capital asset tests: assets that a household may possess irrespective of the economic activity of the household; and working capital required for running a farm or small business.  I make a very clear distinction between the two.  During a debate I received a telephone call from a person in the south west of the country, not in Deputy Griffin's constituency, who indicated that a person had qualified for a third-level grant although one of the parents had more than &euro;300,000 in prize bonds.  The current assessment is purely an income assessment so there is some room for equity.  A rough calculation more than a year ago of the saving was of the order of &euro;6 million.  This is not a precise figure.<\/p><p>  There are 55 fee-paying schools in the country.  The standard pupil-teacher ratio in the free post-primary schools is one teacher for every 19 pupils.  As a result of last year, the reduced ratio for fee-paying schools is one teacher for every 23 pupils.  That may be looked at again.  As Deputy McConalogue said, given what we are charged to do, we must examine everything and cannot ring fence one particular part of it.  All of it is stressful and I have received strong representations from across the spectrum on this.

I was given a definition of working capital as cash required to run a business, and some businesses have a cyclical nature.  Most of the revenue for a bookshop comes in between September and December, which is when the vast bulk of books are sold in this country.  There are businesses which by their nature are cyclical but have fixed costs requiring payment throughout a 12 month period.  Anybody in a business of a cyclical nature, whether a farm or another business, must have cash reserves to function.  A capital asset which generates an income is also in this area, for example a property generating rent above and beyond mortgage repayments becomes an asset.  There are clear definitions in economics and accountancy which can measure this.  We have made a clear distinction in informal discussions but no decision has yet been made on it.<\/p><p>  With regard to young teachers and new teachers, in our education system at post-primary and primary level we have a public private partnership between the State and school patrons.  The State pays the salaries of teachers, sets the curriculum, and provides for the inspectorate at primary school level and the junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations at post-primary level.  The private sector patrons hire the teachers and manage the schools.  The patrons used to provide much of the infrastructure but now this is provided by the State.  It has been continually brought to my attention that in many cases retired teachers are being brought back from retirement and hired as substitute teachers, in some cases for quite a long period of time.  We have issued circulars which reflect my concern that any vacancy should be made available to young teachers, but we cannot direct schools to do this because as part of the private public partnership contract it is in their side of the house.  Even though all primary schools teachers, including principals and young staff, are in the same union, namely, the INTO, which has frequently stated young teachers rather than retired teachers should be hired for substitute work, it is a decision we can wish to have changed but we cannot do anything directly to make it change because it is not part of our side of the equation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071700008#G00300","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1374065100,"counter":49,"content":"<p>We will now move on to programme A.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071700008#G00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1374065100,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Another question about young teachers was asked with regard to their position under the Haddington Road agreement which so far only affects primary school teachers.

An expert group is to be established to consider and report on the level of fixed-term and part-time employment in teaching having regard to the importance for teachers of employment stability and security.  This is a problem in the primary sector but is an acute problem at second level where teachers receive a small number of hours and it can take quite some time before they have a sufficient number of hours for a decent salary.

We have not changed the ratio at primary or second level because it is part and parcel of front-line services.  Frankly, what we aspire to do and what we must do are two different matters.<\/p><p>  The history of this should be understood.<b><\/b>It dates back to 1907 with the <i>Ne Temere<\/i> decree, which the Vatican imposed on this country but not on Germany, for example, which had a mixed population of Catholic and Protestants.  Under the decree, a person of the reformed Protestant faith who married a Catholic needed to give an undertaking that he or she would have all of his or her children reared in the Catholic religion.  Prior to that, culture and custom were that the children of a marriage followed the religion of their parents &ndash; daughters followed mothers and sons followed fathers.<\/p><p>  When the free schemes were introduced by Donogh O&rsquo;Malley in the mid-1960s, they recognised that many people in the reformed Protestant faith felt that, given the numbers, the <i>Ne Temere<\/i> decree was a form of forced conversion and that they would lose their families.  They wanted their children to be able to socialise and be educated with other members of the reformed church tradition.  Given the low density of numbers across the country, boarding schools became necessary to facilitate this desire.<\/p><p>  The Department and the Ministers of the time set up a block grant for the reformed church, called the Secondary Education Committee, SEC, of &euro;6.5 million currently, which is given to the Protestant community to provide for fees for Protestants who cannot afford the schools&rsquo; fees.  The community administers it.<\/p><p>  Some have repeatedly asserted to me that there is an animus against the Protestant church on the part of the Government, but that is not the case.  There is a legal opinion to the effect that we cannot knowingly subsidise one religion over another.  It is prohibited by the Constitution.  We have within the SEC a mechanism through which we can address the issue of access, as it is a right of a parent to send his or her child to a school of his or her choosing, all other factors being equal.  The role of parents as the primary educators is recognised in the Constitution.

Over the lifetime of this Government and the Minister's period in the Department of Education and Skills, in what direction is funding going?  Does he envisage putting forward proposals to address the issue of third level funding?  The funding of third level institutions has been decreased by the guts of 20% at a time when student numbers have increased by 20%.  There was some wastage in the system but now the reduction in funding is severely impacting on the quality of the service being provided.  The Minister has indicated that he will increase the registration fee annually by &euro;500 to the year 2015.  I am aware of a landscape document and a clustering arrangement between institutes of technology and the universities to try to bring about greater collaboration and effectiveness and efficiencies but so far that is as much as the Minister has indicated he will do.  During the previous Government's term in office the Fine Gael Party had a document on a proposed loan scheme.  Prior to the election, the Minister had indicated he would not increase the registration fee, but his position has changed and the registration fee will increase every year until 2015.  How does he propose to deal with fees?<\/p><p>  The Minister made a recent announcement on the IT sector, with the door being opened to two proposed universities in the south east and the south west.  They must hit certain benchmarks, such as increasing the quality of education on offer and the overall facilities at each institution to achieve the potential to reach the university status.  That will cost money, yet there is no parallel outlay or programme in place that will enable them to reach that.  That being the case, it would be very difficult to reach without some type of collaborative effort to see how they would be supported financially.  They are stretched to maintain the quality of the product as opposed to developing it.<\/p><p>  The Minister has often said that if were at the starting point today, he would not start with 18 institutes of technology but he is now proposing potentially technological university status for two institutes of technology, both based in the south, one in the south east and the other in south west.  There is no national regional approach.  In this case the Minister is starting from a blank page as such.  How does he stand over two new potential universities in the south and none in the north west or no potential development in the north west?  I acknowledge it is up to the institutes of technology to come forward with a proposal but that is the landscape that is being developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071700011#K00400","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1374066900,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Thank you Deputy.  The previous Government asked Dr. Colin Hunt to head up a national review committee on a strategy for higher education and it published its report in January 2011.  The report was finished in August but it got delayed for a variety of reasons.  I was in opposition at the time but I welcomed the report.  It was a very useful piece of work and while I did not necessarily agree with everything that was in it I was certainly not going to commission another report if I had responsibility for education.  We had to get on with the job of modernising third level education.<\/p><p>  What has happened since then is that there has been a very significant modernisation and reform in initial teacher education.  There were 19 institutions delivering education for teachers, mostly owned for historical reasons by religious organisations.  They have been reconfigured into six clusters and are proceeding to integrate and to rationalise and improve.  The most advanced is St. Patrick's in Drumcondra, which has linked up with DCU, Mater Dei and the Church of Ireland College of Education.  The 14 institutes of technology were asked to envisage where they would see themselves in the future and that report has recently been published.  Three colleges, the institutes of Technology in Galway, Sligo and Letterkenny, have decided to form an alliance which may evolve into something more than that and they are now proposing how they will do that.  They will report back to the HEA.  Three clusters of IOTs have decided they would like to aspire to become a technological university and meet the criteria set out by the HEA in a separate publication.  The first is DIT in Dublin with both Blanchardstown and Tallaght coming together to merge into a single entity and to move to improve their operational performance to the point at which they would be recognised as a technological university and meet these international criteria to which the Deputy referred.  Kerry and Cork, CIT and Tralee Institute of Technology, have come together and indicated they would like to become a technological university and they have until Christmas to indicate to the HEA how they propose to meet the criteria and do that journey.  Likewise Carlow IT and Waterford IT have said something very similar.  We will await to see what operational plan they propose with regard to reaching the standard of the threshold set for them.  The remaining ITs in Athlone and Dundalk have entered into structured relationships - Athlone has a structured relationship to Maynooth and Dundalk to DCU on how they would co-operate.  Limerick IT has decided it wants to stay as it is and not change but to consolidate its own operation.<\/p><p>  It is important to understand that whereas we fund the primary and second level education at 100%, much of the funding of third level education comes from other sources, from research grants, donations of one kind or another.  For example UCD and Trinity would get at least 40% of their income from sources other than what is set out in the Estimates.  That needs to be understood.  The rationalisation of the 14 IOTs and rationalisation within the universities through regional clusters, which is another component of the Hunt report, will provide some savings or reveal overlapping and duplication.  I want to see the picture before we start looking at making additional resources available for the third level institutions.<\/p><p>  There is no doubt that the third level sector is facing a financial challenge and for that purpose I have started a sustainability programme.  We are looking at the issue of sustainability.<\/p> <p>First, I want to see what rationalisation and efficiencies we can get, now that modern technology and transportation links and other aspects of the improvement in our country's infrastructure can be used.  For example, while every institute of technology may need to have an engineering department, it is possible we could consider specialisation of one type of engineering in one institution as against another.  If, for example, in the modern languages sector in the universities, Galway, Limerick and Cork had French, German and Spanish departments, it could be decided that if one wanted to do a masters in any one of those languages, it would be done in a particular university.  Each of the universities in question could offer a masters in one of those languages.  That is the kind of proposal we should consider.<\/p><p> I am not a professional educationalist and there may be arguments as to why that is not the way to do it.  However, people now have the opportunity and possibility, through distance learning and better travel links, of exercising those kinds of options and getting those kinds of efficiencies.  Until such time as we see what the real operating cost base is of a modernised infrastructure of third level colleges, universities, institutes of technology and related colleges, we will not decide on funding.  I want to see that platform first and will then look at funding and what needs to be done about it.<\/p><p> The one change I have made - reference was made to it - is that the registration fee will rise from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000 over four years, ending in 2015 at &euro;3,000.  The increment is &euro;250 each year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071700011#K00500","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374067500,"counter":121,"content":"<p>On the issue raised by Deputy McConalogue, the Department used to break down expenditure under eight headings, but this has now been reduced to four headings.

International university rankings are like tourist guides.  They highlight different aspects of universities.  The United States have ranked their universities for a long time.  The rankings are like league tables and can be manipulated according to what one wants to try to emphasise.  For example, more marks can be allocated for research than for something such as the pupil-teacher ratio.  The tables can be constructed in different ways.<\/p><p>  Now, because international third level education has become a major, global commodity, these rankings cannot be ignored.  Depending on how we count, there are 15,000 or 13,000 universities in the world.  The higher number includes colleges of further education.  All of Ireland's seven universities rank - subject to correction - within the top 600 in the world.  Therefore, we are very much up there.  In terms of individual rankings for different kinds of activities, such as business schools, the Smurfit business school is highly ranked.  I do not know the exact ranking offhand.  The English department at Trinity College is ranked either 14th or 15th in the world.  <\/p><p>  The Shanghai index was put together in China by the Chinese education authorities to see what it would need to get its universities up to the level of those in the United States.  In that regard, a large focus of attention is on the amount of research money that goes into them and also on the quality of the teaching staff.  One of the indicators is how many Nobel prize winners are on the staff.  This has led to certain distortions in the rankings.  I learned recently that Singapore intends to get the University of Singapore into the top 50 and that it intends to spend accordingly.  It is a bit like buying a player for a football team, like buying Ronaldo or whoever.  A university can get a Nobel prize winner to be on the staff on terms and conditions negotiated privately with that person, but the teaching component and interaction with students is not necessarily specified.  However, in terms of ticking boxes for the rankings, that sort of thing will happen.<\/p><p>  The European Union has embarked on a ranking system of its own and I have encouraged all of the European countries and institutions in that.  Rankings are now a fact of life, but they do not tell the full story.  Frequently, they do not tell the full story as to the quality of the educational experience for most students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071700012#L00500","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1374067500,"counter":125,"content":"<p>They seem a bit like league tables for second level schools, which in no way get across the message about teachers who help pupils who might not otherwise have made it through the education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013071700012#L00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1374067500,"counter":126,"content":"<p>It may be inappropriate to raise this issue, but the implementation of the distance criteria in regard to school transport is causing untold problems in rural areas.

The conclusions of that report, which were found to be sane and rational, are now being implemented.  The overarching conclusion was that the State should provide transport for children to the school that is nearest to their home, which, irrationally, had not been the case.  We are now at a point where, for the foreseeable future, we will provide transport to the school nearest to the home.<\/p><p>  When we came to implement the measure, we had to choose between being dogmatic and inflexible and saying to parents with children who were already in a school that was not their nearest school, that they should remove their child from that school, or whether to be flexible and allow them leave them in that school.  We decided that if a child was already at a particular school, we would allow them complete their full education cycle in that school.  That is how this anomalous transitionary phase has arisen, where older siblings are in one school and entitled to transport to that school, but younger siblings are not entitled to transport to that school.<\/p> <p>The only concession we can make is to say to the incoming children that we will provide them with a concessionary seat on that bus if it is available, while that route continues to operate.  Once the older children are through the school cycle, that opportunity will cease to exist.  That route will cease to exist and a route which may already be in existence will be available to that family to the nearest school.  That transition phase will take three to four years - it is already in place for one year - and these anomalous situations will arise.  We do our best to accommodate the other siblings through the concessionary option.<\/p><p> Up until last year, a child in the primary system who was eligible for transport was paying &euro;50 and a child who was ineligible but was accessing a concessionary seat was paying &euro;200.  We equalised those and made it &euro;100 across the board, which has helped a lot of parents.  It is because we have been flexible and as supportive as we can to parents during that transition phase that has caused those anomalies to arise.  Once those children are worked out of the system, we will then have a very straightforward, very simple and very fair system whereby every child will be eligible for transport to their nearest school and children from families in receipt of a medical card will have their transport provided free of charge.

There are some situations where a secondary school is stretched beyond capacity while other schools are within capacity and which students are currently attending.

That would draw them away from the school where there is space.  That defeats the purpose because if we are to follow that through, the school that is oversubscribed would have to build new classrooms in order to accommodate them, and the school which already had the space and in which the capital was already invested, would lose those students.

The tradition has been that students from both villages go to Moville Community College, which was built about ten years ago.  The two secondary schools in Buncrana, which are nearer to them, are oversubscribed and Buncrana College has submitted an application for a new campus.  The school has been putting in temporary accommodation over the years and there is no longer room on the existing site for such accommodation.  There are about 30 students in Ture and Muff who are currently attending Moville Community College, and they are being told by the Department that if they went over a hilly road, they would be closer to Buncrana than Moville.  That is not a sensible route to take if there is any frost at all.  A bus would not take that route either.

In round figures, the top figure in 2016 to 2017 - the first academic year after the next general election, to bring it close to home - will be an extra 46,287 primary school places.  A three stream school will have 24 classrooms multiplied effectively by 28 which gives the number.  We are now building schools to accommodate 600 plus.  At post-primary level the net increase will be 21,000 by 2015 to 2016.  That is 21 community post-primary schools.  The schools we are building now have a capacity for 1,000 and the inspectorate in the Department is clear that it does not like the teaching environment that a school with more than 1,200 pupils generates.

I look forward to the opportunity to answer as many questions as I can from members, but before doing so, I wish to give them a brief overview of the work undertaken following the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, otherwise known as the ISI, including an update on our current targets and when we believe we will be in a position to accept initial applications for relief as part of the new debt solutions introduced under the Personal Insolvency Act.  Having done so, I will highlight a number of points on why these new reliefs introduced under the Act are both necessary and have the potential to be a very important response in addressing the overall problem of personal debt that we as a country face.<\/p><p>  Since my appointment as director designate of the ISI at the end of October last year, a number of key milestones have been passed.  These include the enactment of the Personal Insolvency Bill at the end of December last year; the formal establishment of the ISI in March this year by the Minister for Justice and Equality; the launch of the ISI information campaign in April this year; and the publication in June this year of regulations governing the authorisation of personal insolvency practitioners and approved intermediaries - the people who will actually offer face-to-face advice and assistance to insolvent debtors.<\/p><p>  In addition to these key milestones, in establishing itself the ISI has also met a number of organisational targets which I have set out in some detail in my statement and which I will summarise for the committee.  They include the following: the development of a business plan; the recruitment of staff; the identification of offices for the organisation; the identification of necessary amendments to the legislation; the putting in place of the corporate governance structures one would expect an organisation of this type to have in place; the development of ongoing stakeholder engagement, given that it is important we speak with all stakeholders, of which there are many, to try to ensure as best we can that these new arrangements will work; the development of guides for members of the public in order that they understand what is involved; the development of a website and information line; and the roll-out of various courses for personal insolvency practitioners and approved intermediaries.<\/p><p>  We have also carried out in-depth research and published guidelines on reasonable living expenses, as required under the legislation.  In addition, we have scoped out what will ultimately be a very significant IT system to ensure we operate the new arrangements in an efficient and effective manner.  We have been working on the development of an extensive list of the documentation required of us under the Personal Insolvency Act which, for example, includes the prescribed financial statements and various application forms.  In doing our best to meet all of these targets my team and I are acutely aware of the importance of being in a position to accept applications for these new debt reliefs as soon as possible.  I have no doubt that there are very many cases across the country in which people find themselves unable to pay their debts, often through no fault of their own, and are waiting for the ISI to open its doors in order that they can finally deal with their debt problems which until now may have appeared insurmountable to them.<\/p><p>  When I speak to my counterparts in the Insolvency Service of England and Wales, the Insolvency Service of Northern Ireland or other organisations in other jurisdictions, they speak to me in terms of years when referring to their experiences in setting up an organisation such as this, or even in rolling out a new service within their existing business.  I have a somewhat similar conversation with those involved in the regulation of persons practising in the financial services area who, again, talk in terms of years rather than months.  However, notwithstanding these facts, I am pleased to confirm that the ISI, following its establishment in March, hopes to be in a position to accept applications in mid-August.  For that to happen, however, three things need to occur before then.  First, the ISI needs to begin authorising practitioners and approved intermediaries.  We hope to begin this process by the end of July.  Insolvent debtors will then be able to meet authorised practitioners straightaway.  However, I do not want to create false expectations.  It is likely to take a number of weeks before we reach a critical mass of practitioners throughout the country.<\/p><p>  Second, the ISI needs to have its IT system fully operational.  This system has been developed by the IT division of the Department of Justice and Equality and I have been assured that the entire system will be handed over to the ISI by the end of this week for complete end-to-end testing which will involve the assistance of the MABS, potential practitioners and the Courts Service.  Any delay in the hand-over of the system will have a knock-on effect on the date on which we can begin to accept applications.<\/p><p>  Third, we need the remaining provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act to be commenced, together with the passing and commencement of various amendments contained within the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I understand these amendments should be commenced shortly.  I also understand the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill passed all Stages in the D&aacute;il this morning.<\/p><p>  All of this should mean that the first debt relief notices will begin to issue in early September this year, as will the first protective certificates that will cover those applying for a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement.  As the committee will be aware, the debt settlement arrangement and the personal insolvency arrangement process is a two-stage process.  At stage one the protective certificate offers a 70-day window for practitioners to develop a proposal to the satisfaction of the debtor and creditors.  This should mean that the first debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement will issue during November this year, approximately 70 days after the first protective certificate is issued.<\/p> <p>It is worth pointing out that when the protective certificate is issued at the beginning of September, debtors will be protected from any action creditors subject to the protective certificate may be inclined to take about the arrears they are owed.<\/p><p> I wish to turn to the debt reliefs and why they should play an important role in helping insolvent debtors to deal with their difficulties.  The first arrangement is a debt relief notice which will allow for the write-off of qualifying debt up to &euro;20,000, subject to a three year supervision period.  This is primarily designed for those with very little income and very few assets.  Approved intermediaries will advise debtors applying for a debt relief notice and will primarily be available through MABS offices throughout the country.  The features of the debt relief notice are very similar to those which apply to debt relief orders which have operated successfully in the United Kingdom for several years.<\/p><p> The second arrangement introduced by the new Act is the debt settlement arrangement which provides for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt, with no maximum or minimum limits involved over a period normally expected to be five years.  Once again, similar solutions are available to insolvent debtors in other jurisdictions which work efficiently in addressing debtor and creditor issues.  The success of the individual voluntary arrangement schemes in the United Kingdom which are broadly similar to the debt settlement arrangement here gives me confidence that it will be a success.<\/p><p> The third and final arrangement, the personal insolvency arrangement, will facilitate the restructuring or settlement of secured debt of up to &euro;3 million, a cap which can be increased with the consent of all secured creditors, and the settlement of unsecured debts without limits, over a period normally expected to be six years.  To my knowledge, this arrangement goes further than those available in other jurisdictions in that it addresses secured debt.  Given the difficulties the country faces with property debt, such a feature is essential.<\/p><p> There has been much speculation as to whether this arrangement will be a success or whether banks shall choose to vote against many proposals developed through the process.  I stress that the debt settlement arrangement and the personal insolvency arrangement are voluntary, designed to take into account the interests of a debtor and his or her creditors.  It is likely that in the vast majority of cases a practitioner will be able to make a proposal that is in the interests of the debtor and the creditor.  The reality is that these new arrangements offer an efficient and an effective means to tackle problem debt in a controlled manner short of bankruptcy.  While security is recognised in bankruptcy, the reality is that in the vast majority of cases bankruptcy is bad news for the creditor.  It is costly and, in almost all cases, likely to crystallise negative equity in full.<\/p><p> With regard to bankruptcy, as the committee is aware, the Personal Insolvency Act contains provisions to amend certain elements of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, the main change being the introduction of an automatic discharge from bankruptcy after three years rather than the 12 years which applies at present.  I expect these provisions to be commenced shortly.  <\/p><p> The committee is also aware that the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill contains provisions for the transfer of the Office of the Official Assignee who, in effect, manages all bankruptcies to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  The official assignee has been working closely with the ISI in recent months to ensure his office, once transferred, will have sufficient resources to deal with the significant increase in bankruptcies envisaged in the coming months and years.

If a person already had a base level of legal or accounting qualifications, he or she was higher up the ladder than others without such qualifications.  We also identified other skill sets such as the ability to negotiate, given that the person concerned would ultimately be trying to reach a voluntary arrangement between parties, and the ability to deal with people in what could often be very distressing situations.  Through our regulations we set out what somebody had to be able to bring to the table to be a practitioner.  Qualifications and experience are set out, as are other requirements with regard to professional indemnity insurance, having client accounts which were clearly separate from the accounts of the firm or individual and various other matters one would typically expect to find in an area which was regulated.

We considered that it was extremely important to ensure people knew the Act and all related areas inside out in order that they would be able to give the right advice in their role as a PIP.<\/p> <p>This may not have been expected.  It is certainly not the norm, but we felt strongly that it was necessary for people to attend the courses for the reason mentioned - that is, in the absence of courses, people could act in the space of PIPs without providing the advice and attention required by the role.<\/p><p> Regarding the distinction between a PIP and an approved intermediary, the latter will advise someone applying for a debt relief notice.  His or her role is to assess the situation of the debtor who comes in through the door and recommend whether applying for a debt relief notice is a good idea.  If it is, the intermediary will hold the debtor's hand through the process, explain its various stages and make an application on his or her behalf.  After the application is made, however, and assuming the debt relief notice is granted, the intermediary's role ceases and the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, kicks in with a three-year supervision period for the debt relief notice.<\/p><p> This process is different from the other two reliefs, which are dealt with by a PIP.  The initial stage is similar, in that the practitioner advises the debtor of his or her options and helps him or her through the application process, but the practitioner sticks with the arrangement for the five, six or seven years that it lasts.  They will carry out annual reviews and handle client moneys.  For example, if a debtor can put &euro;100 aside every month for the next seven years, that money goes to the practitioner unless otherwise provided for in the proposal and he or she distributes it to the creditors.  Practitioners have a more extensive role than approved intermediaries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071700004#C01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374067200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>As opposed to an individual, can an agency or not-for-profit organisation register as an approved intermediary?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071700005#D00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374067200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>It can be a corporate or an individual.

When the process kicks in, at what point will people be able to opt into any of the three options, or can they look at them and walk away?<\/p><p>  The voting arrangements are quite complex.  Many people will have arrangements with some of the people to whom they owe money and no arrangements with others.  When we talk about secured debt, there may be a tendency for banks or larger institutions which are already receiving money to vote against an arrangement, to the disadvantage of other creditors who may be receiving nothing at all.  If creditors vote against the arrangement, is the process without prejudice or can it be used subsequently in court cases?  In other words, can a person say he or she came to the process in good faith and tried to settle with his or her creditors but they refused and the only reason he or she is there is because of the creditors' unwillingness to engage?  In regard to secured debt and the family home, how, in terms of insolvency and settlement, does Mr. O'Connor see a benefit for someone whose ultimate ambition is to get the burden of debt off his or her shoulders over a number of years and stay in his or her family home?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071700007#F00100","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374068400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Deputy Murphy's first question was how a person would know which arrangement was best for him or her and what was the point of no return.  In terms of which is the best solution, we have published guides, together with some sample cases, which are on our website and which, hopefully, will help to inform debtors broadly at a high level about what is involved.  However, it is the advice he or she will get on a face-to-face basis with the practitioner that will be very specific to his or her circumstances, identifying the options open to him or her and, ultimately, what option in the opinion of the practitioner is in his or her best interest.<\/p><p>  Let us say it is recommended to a person that a personal insolvency arrangement is the best way forward.  The person always has the option to pull out of that process at any point prior to the establishment of the personal insolvency arrangement, which could be a period of 70 to 100 days.  If he or she does so, he or she will not have the option of applying again for a period of 12 months, but beyond that there are no consequences.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned that a person entering into one of these arrangements may have pre-existing arrangements with one bank but not with another body.  In effect, what these arrangements do is supersede any other arrangement or deal one might have entered into with creditors.  Once the practitioner is appointed, the protective certificate is issued, the slate is wiped clean and the practitioner starts again to identify what is in the best interest of the debtor and what is in the best interest of the creditor.  If any creditor believes he or she is being unfairly prejudiced, there is the option for him or her to go to court and to make that point to the judge.  In terms of that unfair prejudice test, I would see that as being very similar to what exists currently in examinership on the corporate side, under which one looks at what one would get in a liquidation.  In this case, what the unfair prejudice test amounts to is what would one get in bankruptcy.  In the vast majority of cases, bankruptcy would always be worse for the creditor than what a practitioner might propose.  In fact, a practitioner should not propose anything that would not meet that test.   <\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned secured debt and the family home.  The personal insolvency arrangement itself has very specific protections in regard to the principal private residence to the point that a practitioner is not required to put a proposal together which requires the debtor to sell or move away from the principal private residence unless the running costs of that home are disproportionately large.  There is in-built protection in the actual arrangement in regard to the principal private residence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071700007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1374068400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Will Mr. O'Connor give us a summary of the whole area of publication, the Credit Bureau and so on?

I welcome Mr. O'Connor to the committee.  First, in regard to the appointment of personal insolvency practitioners, the Minister for Justice and Equality, in response to my parliamentary question yesterday, stated that the ISI had received more than 90 applications to date.  Both the Minister and Mr. O'Connor are on record on the expected number of cases that will come before the ISI - some 15,000 cases in the first 12 months, ranging from personal insolvency arrangements and debt relief notices to bankruptcy.  Not all of the 90 practitioners who applied for positions as personal insolvency practitioners may be sanctioned, but with a staff of approximately 90 to deal with 15,000 cases, each practitioner will have a caseload of 166 cases.  Is there sufficient interest among practitioners in working on cases for the Insolvency Service of Ireland?  Will the service be fit for purpose?  Is there a sufficient geographical spread of applicants?  How many personal insolvency practitioners would be required to meet the expected caseload of 15,000 cases?  Will Mr. O'Connor be able to ensure there is a geographical spread so that the practitioners are not concentrated in one area and are spread throughout the regions?<\/p><p>  We have a rough idea that the service will start in mid-August.  We have discussed the potential flaws and setbacks.  The heads of the Bill were published 18 months ago and the enactment of legislation is in the political domain.  People are anxious to know when the Insolvency Service of Ireland will be up and running.  Mr. O'Connor was appointed in October last year.  Will he give an indicative date of when applications can be made?  Will the ISI be operational on 7, 14 or 20 August?  Is there any certainty about the commencement date? <\/p><p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland is tendering for legal services.  The applications for tender are open until 7 August.  How certain can the ISI be of having a service up and running when the applications only close on 7 August and it will take time to scrutinise and award the contract and put the successful tender in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071700008#G00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374069000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I will answer the questions in the order they were asked.  The Deputy's first question relates to the number and geographic spread of personal insolvency practitioners.  I think it is important to understand where we are in the process of receiving applications.  The regulation setting out the qualitative requirements of a practitioner were published at the end of June.  The regulations in terms of what is required in terms of handling client moneys and other areas were only published last week.  While there was the ability for some to apply while waiting to see the final piece of the jigsaw, others may well have waited until this week to apply.  The number of applicants in the Minister's reply to the question tabled by the Deputy was probably true 24 hours ago, but I can now say the number has risen to over 100.  As the Deputy can see, we are starting to get to a certain volume in the number of applications.<\/p><p>  I referred earlier to the courses that we have looked to the various professional bodies to provide.  They have told me that several hundred people attended the first tranche of courses.  I also asked them how many of those who attended went to the further stage of sitting the exam, and again, several hundred did so.  I would be confident of the numbers over time, but I would like to manage expectations.  We will not have the critical mass on 1 August, but over a number of weeks I believe we will get to the point at which we have a good geographic spread and a sufficient number of practitioners.<\/p><p>  I should also state that the headline number of authorised practitioners may not necessarily give an accurate reflection of the capacity within the personal insolvency practitioner industry.  The reason is that some practitioners may be sole practitioners, in its truest form, and they are likely to be dealing with a couple of dozen cases in a given year, but other practitioners are likely to invest heavily in this area in order to deal with a higher volume of cases while maintaining fees at a low level and so on.  Therefore, if one is not aware of the mix of practitioners, it does not give a good guide as to the actual capacity.<\/p><p>  The reason I cannot give the Deputy a definitive date is that the moment I have confidence that everything has been lined up and we are ready, we will go.  We will not wait a further day.  In my opening statement I said we would be ready in mid-August, which to me means within the first couple of weeks of August.  I will do everything to ensure it is as early as possible; however, because everything is in flux and we are trying to do it all as quickly as possible, I do not have a specific date.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is correct that the legal service went to tender.  That has no bearing on when we will be in a position to accept applications.  Our role in terms of assessing a case that comes into the ISI is to ensure it is in compliance with the legislation.  That is very much an operational challenge for the ISI.  There is no legal input into that.  We would require a legal adviser, as any organisation would, in terms of our ongoing business.  It would have no bearing on the applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071700008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1374069000,"counter":255,"content":"<p>A number of statutory instruments went before the Joint committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, but unfortunately they did not come before this committee.

He or she will contact a practitioner by telephone and arrange to meet.  The practitioner may contact the person in advance to advise him or her to bring certain supporting documentation in order to ensure the meeting is efficient.  The practitioner will have a statutory duty to go through various stages in the process of assessing the situation.  In effect, the practitioner will carry out a financial health check on the debtor's position.  Having done that, the practitioner will go through the various options that may be available to the debtor, one of which might be to try to do a deal directly with the bank.  That would be most likely if all the amount the debtor owes is to a single bank.  It may be achievable to go down that route.  In other situations, the practitioner might simply say that if the person adjusts his or her expenditure, he or she may be able to meet a rescheduled set of repayments, and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071700008#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1374069000,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I am aware of the process, but as time is limited, can Mr. O'Connor deal with the case in which the practitioner's proposal is rejected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071700008#G00600","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374069000,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Let us fast forward to the point at which it is rejected.

I want to highlight that the Minister was very clear that it is possible for a PIA to keep a borrower in his or her house and to include a substantial write-down of the mortgage to a sustainable level, and if there is no public good to be served by this person's being in a process for six years, there is no reason he or she could not exit.  Indeed, the Minister suggested that it would be appropriate for that person to exit the process with the write-down intact after just three years.<\/p><p>  I ask Mr. O'Connor to give his opinion on why anyone would not continue to use the bankruptcy system in the UK, where the total period for discharge of bankruptcy is one year, with the potential for a payment order for another two years.  This compares to three years of bankruptcy here and the potential for an additional five years.  My understanding of the UK system is that not only is it one year compared to three years, but if a person has been in arrears for six months, the magistrate will take that into consideration as part of the 12-month period.  A person who has been in arrears for six months could move to Belfast, Derry, London or Manchester and be back here, discharged of all debt, in just six months.  This is not meant to be a leading question, because I am genuinely interested.  Why would people avail of the new bankruptcy regime here if they had the wherewithal to get to Belfast or Derry for six to 12 months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071700011#K00300","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374070800,"counter":303,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct to state that anyone is free to choose whether to travel to the UK to avail of the bankruptcy regime there.  From a financial perspective, a person would be no better or worse off.  A bankruptcy trustee in the UK should act pretty much in exactly the same way as the official assignee here, and a bankrupt person loses all assets and income streams other than what is required for reasonable living expenses.  Equally, the kind of protections that might exist here with regard to a principal private residence or a pension may not extend to the UK.  That is a factor to be taken into account.  To avail of the UK one-year term of bankruptcy, it must be established that a person's main centre of interest is in the UK, and that will take a number of months, probably around six months.  The one year actually becomes 18 months when this is taken into account.  One is then comparing 18 months with the three years to see which is more attractive.  For people with a family and a home here or with other ties to Ireland, I believe the differential is actually quite small, particularly when the financial outcome is the same whether in the UK or in Ireland.  There have been a number of high-profile cases in the UK.

These are utterly tragic situations in which parents who have paid off their own mortgages and who are in their mid-60s or even mid-70s are now in danger of losing their home.

As of now, the success rate of IVAs is very high.  That is notwithstanding the fact that creditor support of 75% is required, which is far higher than what is required in this country.  More than 90% of cases that are put to creditors for a vote are passed.  The reason is that over time, creditors have become comfortable with how they operate.  Equally, they have made it their business to ensure practitioners know what is acceptable to them.  What creditors are ultimately saying is that here is a way in which this problem loan can be dealt with efficiently and effectively.  The alternative, which is bankruptcy, will give far less, be more costly and take longer.  They are satisfied because they are familiar with the way in which the process works.  They are satisfied because they contribute to a representative forum which ensures that practitioners know what they want as creditors.  They have faith in the proposals before them and they tick their internal boxes.  Therefore, they vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  That is what I am trying to achieve in my stakeholder consultations, albeit in a much shorter time.

They said they did not do debt write-downs and that they would not disregard debt.  They want every pound of flesh they can get from their creditors.  That was the impression the majority of the banks gave when they came before the committee, but that is not the case on the ground, as the banks are making deals with people, some of them significant.  To some degree the attitude of the banks was based on the fact that they felt the legislation was skewed more in their favour rather than towards the protection of creditors.<\/p> <p> In terms of the way the legislation is being presented and what he has seen happening in the United Kingdom, which is the nearest legal and banking system with which he is working, is Mr. O&rsquo;Connor satisfied that the legislation will work to get people out of the distress in which they find themselves?

Equally, I would point out that in very many cases problem loans currently in arrears could be dealt with short of any debt write-off.  That might mean terms are extended, interest rates are reduced or other measures are put in place.  However, situations will arise where somebody is insolvent and the only solution to his or her problem involves debt being written off, and a practitioner is only doing his or her job if the proposal in those circumstances includes debt being written off.  If the bank or any other creditor votes down that arrangement for the reason that debt is being written off, in all likelihood the person will go to bankruptcy and in bankruptcy all the negative equity is written off, which could be much more substantial than what a practitioner is proposing.  Whatever about statements that might be made, when they have a proposal from a practitioner in front of them they must look at what the alternative might be, and in bankruptcy it is likely that far more debt will be written off.  I would be confident, therefore, that these arrangements would be passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013071700014#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1374072600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Is Mr. O'Connor in regular contact with, say, the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the banks?

In fact, they may not even require debt write-down.  What they may require is debt restructuring.  I am not too sure I agree with Deputy Donnelly's comment about 30% of income going towards debt and nothing else.  If one is living in a &euro;2 million house and 30% of one's income is going to service the mortgage, one must look at living in a different type of house.  I think the blanket approach of 30% across the board is a very simplified one and does not stand up.  The vast majority of people who are meeting sustainable mortgages are not in that 30% category and are probably over it, but they are still meeting their bills.  <\/p><p> There is a group of people who would have what one might call significant unsecured debt.  It is a legacy of the Celtic tiger period, when a person would go to the credit union after a wage increase, be it through benchmarking or overtime, and use this to borrow more money instead of paring down debt.  Because of the extra couple of grand a year, their credit union debt went from &euro;5,000 up to maybe &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000.  The same person could have a credit card debt that went up because the ceiling on his or her credit card was increased from &euro;5,000 to &euro;15,000.  Likewise, he or she probably got a holiday loan from a bank and a car loan for finance through a car agency.  They have the bones of &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 out there.  The difficulty with that debt is that it is short-term and high-interest debt that must be dealt with alongside mortgage debt.  The real difficulty is the interest rate that applies to it in many cases.  If that &euro;50,000 could be put on an interest rate of 4.5% or 5%, people would be in a very steady position.

It is important that people hear the measured tones with which he engaged with us this afternoon.  He has a huge task ahead of him.  On behalf of the committee, I wish him every success with it.  It is in everyone's interest that his agency is a huge success, because making sure the Insolvency Service of Ireland operates well is very much part of the recovery of this country.  I wish him the best of luck for the future.  Today was Mr. O'Connor's first time before the committee. I am sure there will be other opportunities for seeing him again and we may invite him to appear before us towards the end of the year or at the start of 2014 to see how things are progressing.  His invitation today was very much in the context of the 25% target for the banks at the end of the second quarter of this year, so it is critical that the service is up and running over the summer period, as we approach quarter 3, for the target of 15%.

I would like to list the recommendations that came from the conference.  The first recommendation is for African governments and parliaments to ensure the protection of land rights and address the negative effects of large investments in land by foreign investors.  The second recommendation is for MPs to work with NGOs, the private sector, local communities and researchers to establish the facts about large investments in agriculture and land grabs, to review legislative frameworks and to monitor the implications of FDI on agriculture.  The third recommendation is that African MPs should design policies to protect small farmers and pastoral communities at the national and regional levels, and to facilitate space for dialogue between communities to prevent conflict and adapt to climate change.  The fourth recommendation is that African MPs should create incentives to trigger investments in sustainable agriculture, respecting customary land-holdings and ensuring the right of women to the land to make livelihood viable.  The fifth recommendation is that African political actors should create consensus on a common regional negotiation position to discuss trade agreements with regional blocs such as the European Union, instead of negotiating on a national basis, because Europe must not exert unfair pressure on African countries regarding trade agreements.  The sixth recommendation is that European and African MPs and MEPs should work to ensure EU bio-fuels policy is not based on the acquisition of large pieces of land.  They should seek alternatives to bio-fuels and limit the use of land for bio-fuels to 5%, to be phased out thereafter.  They should also note the FAO voluntary guidelines on land tenure.  The seventh recommendation is in line with the legal obligation in the Lisbon treaty for European MPs and MEPs to reinforce policy coherence of the EU and European countries in their external policies towards Africa.  MPs and MEPs should ensure appropriate processes are in place to identify instances of incoherence and analyse all legislation for its potentially negative impact on development priorities.<\/p><p>  The eighth recommendation is that development donors should support awareness-raising and identifying of best practices among African and European parliamentarians to tackle crucial problems in land insecurity, water scarcity, chronic hunger and gender inequality, especially when accessing land-holding opportunities.  They should take initiatives to ensure equal access to nutrition within households.   The ninth recommendation is for European countries, governments and parliaments to ensure that transparency and enforcement are applied to companies that remain involved in illegal exploitation and land grabbing, including investigating and bringing to justice the European companies identified by the UN Panel of Experts on Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources as being involved in illegal practices, and to put into place adequate mechanisms to ensure the full implementation of the EU timber regulation, which entered into force in March 2013 and which still lacks implementation in the majority of the EU States.  The tenth recommendation is for African governments to meet the Maputo Declaration commitment to allocate and spend 10% of national budgets on investments in the agriculture sector, to ensure adequate resources are available to fight poverty and food insecurity.  The 11th recommendation is for European MPs and MEPs, as influential leaders in resource-importing states, to support their African peers in their actions to strengthen their oversight capacity.  The 12th and final recommendation is for all European and African countries to consider establishing joint monitoring teams for their future relationships and mutual development.  I will have a copy of these recommendations for everybody shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071700002#A00500","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1374076800,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am pleased to have this opportunity to meet with the committee today to bring members up to date on foreign policy developments in recent months.<\/p> <p>I propose to focus on three areas in my opening statement: discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council for the second quarter of 2013 and a forward look to the Council on 22 July; Ireland's recently concluded Presidency of the Council of the European Union and specifically the achievements in the external policy area and priorities for Ireland's membership of the UN Human Rights Council.<\/p><p> During the period of our EU Presidency, the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council remained as busy as ever.  In particular, developments in regard to countries in the Middle East and North Africa region which are undergoing transition continued to feature prominently on the EU's foreign policy agenda.  Most attention focussed on the ongoing crisis in Syria, though developments in Egypt and Lebanon and the EU's overall response to the \"Arab Spring\" were also the subject of extensive discussion in the Foreign Affairs Council.<\/p><p> At the meeting of the Council next Monday, a heavy emphasis on Middle East issues is again likely.  Under the southern neighbourhood item, the Council will discuss developments in relation to the Syrian conflict and the situation in Egypt following the military intervention which removed President Morsi and his government earlier this month.  Committee members will recall that there was an extensive discussion of Syria at the May Council.  It unfortunately did not prove possible to get agreement to renew the arms embargo.  Apart from this, however, all elements of the EU's current sanctions regime against Syria were renewed.  In line with the political declaration adopted at its May meeting, the Council is committed to reviewing its overall policy on Syria before 1 August.  It will do so on the basis of an oral report by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on developments in respect of the planned Geneva II peace conference which the US and Russia, in conjunction with the UN, are seeking to advance.<\/p><p> The overall situation in Syria remains dire, with no early end in sight to the military conflict and the humanitarian situation on the ground continuing to worsen.  A political resolution remains absolutely essential.  The US, Russia and the UN are working to advance the Geneva II initiative.  Realistically, however, it is likely to be the autumn at the earliest before any peace conference takes place.  The main Syria opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, SNC, has now elected a new leader, Ahmed Jarba.  However, given military advances by the regime in recent weeks, the SNC is for the moment unwilling to contemplate participation in Geneva II until such time as it is in a militarily stronger position.  Geneva II remains the only realistic hope for achieving a political breakthrough which might end the conflict.  I have no doubt that the Council, through the High Representative on Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Catherine Ashton, will wish to reiterate the EU's full support for this effort.<\/p><p> Turning to Egypt, the situation there remains of great concern and will be a major item of discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council.  I have already made clear my views on the events which resulted in the removal from office of President Morsi and his government.  I believe that no one who truly subscribes to democratic values can view with equanimity the military takeover which has taken place in Egypt.  The primary emphasis now, however, must be on what the EU and the international community can do to assist the Egyptian people to emerge from this current crisis and to keep them firmly on the path of transition towards stronger democratic institutions and improved governance in Egypt.<\/p><p> In common with our EU partners, the Government strongly believes that the only solution to the situation with which we are now confronted in Egypt is to promote a fully inclusive process of political dialogue and reconciliation aimed at the swiftest possible restoration of democratic rule and civilian-led government.  All political forces, including of course the Muslim Brotherhood and its political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, must be encouraged to sit down together and work out a credible timetable for early parliamentary and presidential elections as well as any necessary constitutional reforms.<\/p><p> The security situation in Egypt remains tense and highly volatile.  All sides have a duty to act with restraint at this time.  I would encourage the interim authorities to undertake conciliatory measures to defuse the crisis, including the release of all political detainees and the re-opening of media stations which were closed following the military's intervention.  Fundamental freedoms and the rule of law must also be clearly upheld.  Egypt and its people are experiencing a difficult transition to full democracy.  Ireland and its EU partners want to provide whatever support we can for the Egyptian people as they undergo this transition.  I should add that my Department and the Irish embassy in Cairo are keeping our travel advice under constant review.  For the moment, my Department is recommending against any non-essential travel to Egypt with the exception, however, of the Red Sea resorts, where the situation remains stable.<\/p><p> Next week's Foreign Affairs Council will consider the Middle East peace process over lunch.  There was an in-depth discussion of recent developments at the June Council, though no conclusions were adopted on that occasion.  It remains unclear at this stage whether conclusions will be adopted at next week's Council or exactly how wide-ranging a discussion the High Representative is planning.  The primary focus at present is on the US Secretary of State's efforts to get substantive negotiations between the two sides resumed.  Ireland and its EU partners strongly support these efforts and appreciate greatly Secretary of State, John Kerry's personal commitment to this work.  We understand that he is continuing to work on proposals which might form the basis for a resumption of talks, though no details have yet been released as his talks with both sides are continuing and there is a possibility that he may visit the region again over the coming days.<\/p><p> Ministers will be paying much attention to the US initiative and its prospects in their discussion next Monday.  However, I also consider it important that the Council should address the deteriorating situation on the ground, which is a serious obstacle in the way of a resumption of meaningful peace talks.  There is much that the EU can, and should, do in order to provide momentum and leadership in the Middle East peace process.  We should seek in particular to persuade Israel to come forward with meaningful confidence-building measures and to desist from its destructive settlement policy.  I therefore hope that the Council can engage in a wide-ranging discussion next Monday which will address the Middle East peace process in its entirety.  There are strong expectations in the region and more generally that the EU would play a more active role.  Any conclusions adopted should be comprehensive in their scope.  Time is moving on and the real fear is that continued inaction on the Middle East peace process will only heighten tensions, including on the ground, and imperil whatever prospects may exist at present for political progress.<\/p><p> Finally, on Middle East issues, the Council is due to discuss over lunch the current situation in Lebanon, which has been greatly impacted by the crisis in neighbouring Syria.  Although the Lebanese Government and political parties are endeavouring to keep their country out of the crisis, they are finding this very difficult as political tensions rise and violence related to the crisis spills over into northern Lebanon and into Beirut itself, where there have been bombings targeting Hezbollah strongholds in recent days.<\/p><p> In considering the current unstable situation, the Council may also be asked to examine a proposal made by one partner that the EU would designate the military wing of Hezbollah a terrorist organisation.  During the extensive discussion of this issue at working level in Brussels under the Irish Presidency, consensus did not prove possible among the EU member states.  It remains unclear whether consensus will be possible if the proposal is now raised at political level.  The High Representative and EAS are continuing efforts to fashion proposals which might provide a basis for compromise and obviously Ireland would welcome and give serious consideration to any such proposals which may be presented.<\/p><p> At the May Foreign Affairs Council, foreign affairs ministers discussed the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, over lunch as part of preparations for a planned discussion on defence issues at the European Council in December 2013.  This followed on from the decision taken by the European Council in December last year which set out the parameters of this discussion.  At that European Council meeting, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton, was tasked with developing proposals and actions in the identified areas.  The High Representative's interim report is expected to be published before the end of July and will feed into the discussions on CSDP at the December European Council.  In the meantime, preparatory work is being undertaken in various formal and informal fora on the three clusters.  At their discussion in May, Ministers agreed on the need to improve planning and management of CSDP missions to make them more effective.<\/p><p> In a discussion of Afghanistan at the June Council, Ministers took stock of the current security situation there following an announcement by President Karzai on 18 June about the final stage of the hand-over of responsibility for security from ISAF to the Afghan National Security Forces.  They confirmed also the EU's commitment to state-building and long-term development and stressed the importance of the Afghan Government's fulfilling the commitments it has given.  Ireland supports continuing international efforts to develop Afghanistan into a peaceful, self-governing democratic nation, based on respect for human rights, including the rights of Afghan women, and respect for the rule of law.  Our contribution to this process is made through support for humanitarian programmes and the deployment of civilian experts and members of the Defence Forces to international missions in Afghanistan.<\/p><p> We do not underestimate the daunting challenges facing Afghanistan in the period ahead.  The international community must coordinate closely to maximise the impact and effectiveness of what we are doing.<\/p> <p>Improving the day-to-day lives of the Afghan people is central to securing the people's support for their Government, removing the arguments for the illicit narcotics trade and undermining those who would advocate terrorism.<\/p><p> I will provide a brief report on the situation in the western Balkans.  Croatia was formally welcomed as the EU's 28th member state on 1 July.  I attended the celebrations which took place in Zagreb.  I highlighted the importance of European Union membership for Croatia.  The entry of Croatia into the Union demonstrates also what is possible when a country holds steadfastly to the difficult reform processes necessary for accession.  The western Balkans was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in June, where the focus was on the negotiations in the Belgrade Pristina Dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo.  The determination of the Serbian and Kosovan prime ministers to find a workable solution to normalising bilateral relations is to be commended. The dialogue, which was actively and ably facilitated by High Representative Ashton, resulted in an agreement on 19 April and an implementation plan on 21 May.  The June European Council agreed to open accession negotiations with Serbia and the General Affairs Council agreed a negotiating framework for a stabilisation and association agreement with Kosovo, the first stage on the path towards EU membership.<\/p><p> Foreign Affairs Ministers have over the past year focused increasingly on the global challenges which we all face.  They have considered how EU foreign policy can contribute to tackling these.  The April meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council discussed the issue of energy security,<b><\/b>which is essential to economic development and competitiveness.  Ministers agreed on the need to pursue efforts to diversify our sources of supply and to develop our transport infrastructure.  EU foreign policy has an important role to play in this regard, not least in terms of our relationship with key partner countries.<\/p><p> At our meeting in June, we discussed EU climate diplomacy in the presence of Commissioner Hedegaard.  We adopted conclusions which restated the EU's support for a new legally binding climate agreement by 2015.  Climate change impacts particularly on the most vulnerable countries and is intrinsically linked with sustainable development.  The Ministers agreed on the need to ensure coherence with the post-2015 development agenda.  I also took the opportunity to brief my counterparts on the very successful Dublin conference on hunger, nutrition and climate change, which I co-hosted with former President Mary Robinson last April, as part of our Presidency programme.<\/p><p> The July Council is also expected to adopt conclusions on EU water diplomacy.  The conclusions acknowledge the potential security risks associated with the competition for water resources and set out the objectives for future EU engagement in water diplomacy, with particular reference to areas such as the Nile basin and Central Asia.<\/p><p> Myanmar-Burma is continuing to undergo a process of long-awaited transformation.  Despite the undeniable complex challenges which remain, I have been encouraged by the manner in which the situation in Myanmar-Burma has improved in many respects.  Ireland has always remained ready to respond positively to genuine progress towards democratisation and respect for human rights.  Ireland stands ready to share its experiences and to assist the process of democratisation in Myanmar-Burma in whatever way possible.<\/p><p> From a development co-operation point of view, Ireland's recent experience in Asia is highly relevant to Myanmar-Burma.  To this end, officials from my Department undertook a scoping mission in early July which focused on progressing development and other bilateral links between Ireland and Myanmar-Burma.  This included an assessment of options for a small number of niche areas in which a development programme supported by Ireland could have an impact and be a response to local needs.  There was close liaison with EU partners during this mission.<\/p><p> At the last Foreign Affairs Council Ministers decided to lift all sanctions against Myanmar-Burma, bar the arms embargo and the embargo on equipment which might be used for internal repression.  We also had a short discussion about the outstanding areas for progress which need to be addressed by the Government of Myanmar-Burma, such as addressing ethnic conflict and extremism and improving humanitarian access.<\/p><p> The Eastern Partnership featured on the agendas of the April and June Council meetings in preparation for the Vilnius summit on 28 and 29 November.  It will also be discussed at our meeting next Monday.  In particular, Ministers will hear reports on the state of play of the negotiations for association agreements and free trade agreements, known as DCFTA agreements, with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova.  It is almost certain that agreements with Armenia, Georgia and Moldova will be initialled at Vilnius.  The association agreement and DCFTA with Ukraine may also be signed at Vilnius if that country has fulfilled the conditions laid down by the December 2012 Foreign Affairs Council.  Following the Council, there will be a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers with Eastern Partnership Foreign Ministers which will include a round- table discussion on expectations for the Vilnius summit and beyond.<\/p><p> The Foreign Affairs Council has also maintained a focus on African issues and Mali was the subject of intense discussions in the early part of the year.  Ireland played a significant role in facilitating meetings on the crisis in Mali in our capacity as EU Presidency, including hosting important meetings of EU Development and Defence Ministers.  The April Foreign Affairs Council adopted a further set of conclusions on Mali which welcomed the commitment by the Malian authorities to implementing the road map for transition.  In a further recent positive development, an interim peace agreement was signed between the Malian Government authorities and Tuareg militant groups on 18 June, paving the way for presidential elections on 28 July.  This is very welcome.  We are consistent in our view that the crisis will not be resolved through military action alone.  In this context we are pushing for full implementation of the political road map agreed by the Malians.  The holding of presidential elections at the end of this month is an important step.<\/p><p> The Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes region continue to face one of the most complex and enduring humanitarian crises in the world and developments in the region will be discussed at the July Foreign Affairs Council.  Ongoing instability, human rights violations and violence in the east of the DRC, continue to displace hundreds of thousands of people internally and across borders into Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda.  The challenges facing the DRC require the support of the international community, not just in terms of traditional humanitarian interventions but also longer term strategies which aim to build the lasting capacity and increase the ability of communities to withstand future shocks.  Furthermore, the situation demands the attention and political support of the international community and regional actors.<\/p><p> In this regard, I have voiced Ireland's strong support for the appointment by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of Mary Robinson as his special envoy to oversee the implementation of the peace, security and co-operation framework agreement and the leadership offered by the United Nations in this renewed effort to break the cycle of violence in eastern DRC.  I also recognise the constructive role the European Union is playing in the region.  The EU is working through political and diplomatic engagement and development co-operation programmes in support of implementation of the peace, security and co-operation framework agreement and the strengthening of the UN peace-keeping force, MONUSCO.<\/p><p> Ireland is a significant humanitarian donor to the DRC.  In 2012 alone, Ireland provided over &euro;10 million in emergency and longer-term development funding to the country.  Thus far in 2013, Ireland has provided &euro;3.8 million in funding, with much of this directed at the provision of emergency food, water, health and protection to vulnerable groups in eastern DRC.<\/p><p> The current situation in Somalia will also be discussed by the July Foreign Affairs Council.  The continuing fragility on the ground was tragically underlined by the attack on the UN compound in Mogadishu last month by the Al Shabaab terrorist group, which claimed 15 lives.  The EU is implementing a comprehensive strategy for the Horn of Africa which was adopted in 2011 and which covers the entire region, including Somalia.  It addresses all dimensions of the crisis including conflict, underdevelopment, and issues related to governance and human rights.<\/p><p> The EU's support in the area of security includes our funding for the African Union peace-keeping mission and direct engagement through a number of Common Security and Defence Policy missions including the EU training mission, EUTM Somalia, which is building the capacity of the Somali national security forces to enable them to take over responsibility for security and law and order.  Ireland is providing the commanding officer and a significant contingent of personnel for EUTM Somalia.  Ireland has contributed more than &euro;41 million to efforts to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Somalia and the region.  We are committed to continuing to provide support and help in this area.  We have also indicated, in the context of our new policy on international development, One World, One Future, which has a strengthened focus on fragile states, that Ireland will examine other opportunities for assisting Somalia's recovery in the period ahead.<\/p><p> I will provide a brief report on Ireland's recently concluded term as Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, attended the committee last month to discuss the development aspects of Ireland's Presidency.  Accordingly, I do not propose to re-visit that topic.  Rather, I will focus my comments on achievements in relation to the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  As regards the work of the Foreign Affairs Council, Ireland's overriding priority during the Presidency was to support the work of the High Representative, Catherine Ashton and the European External Action Service.<\/p> <p>A key feature of this support role was the substitution function which I undertook, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, and former Minister of State, Deputy Creighton.  During the six months of the Presidency, we replaced the High Representative on a total of 18 occasions at meetings with third countries and the European Parliament.<\/p><p> From a policy perspective, the Presidency played an important role in co-ordinating complex EU positions, including at working groups chaired by the Presidency and not least at committee of permanent representatives to EU, COREPER.  Ireland organised and hosted a number of very successful informal meetings at ministerial and official level.  These focused on the Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, and Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, issues and included the \"Gymnich\" or informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers which I co-hosted at Dublin Castle on 22 and 23 March.  The meetings to which I refer provided an opportunity to discuss sensitive issues away from the more formal environments which obtain in Brussels or Luxembourg.  They also provided us with an opportunity to showcase Ireland and demonstrate our commitment to the European project.<\/p><p> During its EU Presidency, Ireland worked to advance the human rights agenda, including the effective implementation of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights, which was adopted by the Council of the European Union on 25 June 2012.  Key elements from the action plan which featured during our Presidency included two new sets of EU guidelines on human rights.  The first of these relates to the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief, while the second relates to the promotion and protection of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex, LGBTI, persons.  Ireland was extensively engaged in the drafting process of both sets of guidelines, and I was particularly pleased that they were adopted at the final Foreign Affairs Council of Ireland's Presidency on 24 June.<\/p><p> In the context of disarmament and non-proliferation issues, Ireland made a substantial contribution to a successful outcome at the Third Review Conference on the Chemical Weapons Convention, which took place in The Hague in April.  During its Presidency, Ireland also worked closely with the EEAS during the negotiations at the UN in March which led to the adoption of an arms trade treaty on 2 April in New York.  Ireland was in the first wave of countries to sign this new treaty when the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, attended a special signing ceremony at UN headquarters in New York on 3 June.  The Government will move to ratify the treaty in the second half of the year.<\/p><p> During its Presidency, Ireland placed a particular emphasis on strengthening the EU's capacity in the areas of conflict prevention and resolution.  We worked closely with the EEAS and the European Parliament on the organisation of a joint conference in Brussels in May on \"The EU as a Peacemaker\", which I was pleased to address and at which I stressed the importance of joined-up action at EU level to assist in the prevention and resolution of conflict across the globe.  This conference brought together over 200 high-level experts from the EU, the United Nations and civil society to examine how the EU's capacities in the areas of conflict prevention and mediation can be strengthened.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, last November Ireland was elected to the Human Rights Council, the UN's principal human rights body.  This was the first occasion on which Ireland stood for election to the council.  It was an especially hard-fought election and our success represents a major endorsement of Ireland's international standing, particularly in the context of our advocacy of human rights across the globe.  Our period on the Human Rights Council began on 1 January 2013 and will run until December 2015.  As a member of the HRC, Ireland will continue to prioritise engagement on country situation resolutions as well as on thematic human rights issues which are of concern to the Irish public.  Ireland's approach to membership of the Human Rights Council will be guided by the pledges and commitments made during our election campaign, which reflect our well-established human rights priorities. These include but are not limited to: defending the universality of human rights; freedom of expression, particularly on the Internet; freedom of religion or belief; LGBTI rights; the promotion and protection of human rights defenders; women's rights; and combating discrimination and gender-based violence.<\/p><p> At the September 2013 session of the Human Rights Council, Ireland will present two new initiatives.  The first of these will relate to civil society space, while the second will relate to child mortality.  The new initiative on civil society space will emphasise the importance of the protection of this space in the context of the promotion and protection of all human rights, as well as elements which create, strengthen and ensure an enabling environment in which civil society can operate.  The initiative on child mortality is intended to support the much needed engagement of the human rights community in ongoing efforts to strengthen accountability in respect of children's health.  The aim of this initiative will be to highlight this important issue and to request the elaboration of technical guidance on the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce child mortality.  This follows on from similar previous work on maternal mortality.  I look forward to continuing my engagement with this committee on these and other human rights concerns during the course of our Membership of the Human Rights Council.<\/p><p> I will be happy to reply to any questions members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071700002#A01100","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374078000,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Before opening the floor to members, I wish to pose one question.  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, the committee recently visited Jordan, Palestine and Israel and met the Foreign Ministers in each jurisdiction.  People in Jordan and Palestine are treating the Middle East peace process and the initiative taken by US Secretary of State John Kerry as urgent.  They see that latter as offering a great window of opportunity in the context of something happening in respect of Israel and Palestine.  When we visited Israel, one obtained the impression that the sense of urgency or priority to which I refer was absent.  Yesterday's announcement by the European Union was to the effect that all future agreements between it and Israel must exclude the Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.  How significant is the latter in the context of the overall Middle East peace process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071700005#D00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1374078000,"counter":464,"content":"<p>It is a very clear signal on the part of the European Union at a number of levels.  In the first instance, it is an indication that we are quite unhappy with the situation as it currently obtains - which we want Israel to address - and that we want to encourage both sides to engage with the peace initiative.  Yesterday's decision largely relates to the funding of projects by the European Union.  The essence of the agreement is that funding will only be provided in respect of projects in areas that are within the 1967 borders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071700005#D00300","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1374078000,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his detailed presentation.  At the select committee's meeting in respect of the Revised Estimates, I had the opportunity to compliment the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, the former Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, their colleagues in the Department and all the relevant officials on a successful Presidency.  The commitment shown by the officials to whom I refer was extremely important in this regard.<\/p><p>  Ireland's membership of the Human Rights Council is a very progressive development and I welcome it.  I also welcome the T&aacute;naiste's indication that the two initiatives on which he will focus in respect of the September meeting relate to civil society space and child mortality.  These are extremely important issues.  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, the universal periodic review, UPR, involves a review carried out over a four-and-a-half-year period in each EU member state.  In light of this country's long-standing commitment to ensuring that human rights are placed at the centre of its development co-operation programmes, its role within the Human Rights Council and the fact that it is an active participant in the UPR process, does the Government plan to incorporate recommendations from the latter process in its bilateral development co-operation programmes?  I see this as a mechanism to promote UPR recommendations to greater effect and it is something which might be worth considering.<\/p><p>  We have discussed the situation in Syria on Question Time in the D&aacute;il and at all of the committee's meetings in recent months.  The T&aacute;naiste described the situation as &quot;dire&quot;.  Unfortunately, matters have been escalating and in excess of 100,000 people have been killed and millions more have been displaced.  The T&aacute;naiste stated that this will again be a major subject for consideration by him and his European counterparts at the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.  The European Union has lived up to the pledges it made in respect of this matter.  However, has there been any improvement in the context of the major powers and the international community in general honouring the pledges made with regard to the provision of humanitarian aid?  Has progress been made in the context of ensuring that such aid reaches those who most need it?  Some months ago there were reports that the Assad regime was directing this aid to its own supporters.<\/p><p>  At the end of 2011 the T&aacute;naiste stated, &quot;The Assad regime must make way for a genuine political transition&quot;.  At that point, it appeared that a political solution would be found among the opposition groups and parties in Syria.  In reply to a recent parliamentary question I tabled the T&aacute;naiste stated:<blockquote>Promoting a power-sharing agreement between the Syrian authorities and the opposition is clearly the only way to end the violence and to respond to the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people for peace and democracy.  Ireland and its EU partners will continue to work hard to achieve these vital objectives.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>Is that Government policy and is it EU policy as well in terms of how it is envisaged a resolution could be achieved?<\/p><p> In his remarks the T&aacute;naiste also mentioned that the EU would probably review its policy before 1 August.  He said he was not confident about a Geneva II conference taking place until the autumn.  We all know the urgency of the situation.  There was some hope at the time the US Secretary of State, Mr. Kerry, and his Russian counterpart made a joint statement that we might have a conference sooner rather than later.  Based on the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s script, is he pessimistic about when a conference would be held?<\/p><p> The holding of a hunger and nutrition conference in this country in April under the Presidency was a welcome development.  I am aware the T&aacute;naiste will work closely with his Lithuanian counterparts during their Presidency.  It would be desirable if they would ensure that climate change, bio-fuels and a potential Council conclusion on the area would continue to be given priority during the Lithuanian Presidency.<\/p><p> As the Chairman said, when Senator Kerry was appointed Secretary of State in early January, if not previous to that, the number of visits he made to the Middle East gave some hope that momentum would be created to get the negotiations going again.  Time has elapsed and I gather from the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s contribution that he is worried about the lack or loss of momentum in recent months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071700005#D00400","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374078600,"counter":467,"content":"<p>There are a lot of questions for the T&aacute;naiste.

I pay tribute to the officers and staff of my Department, both in Dublin and in Brussels, and to the officers of the Department of the Taoiseach for the work they have done.<\/p><p>  On the universal periodic review, UPR, the implementation of the UPR recommendations is taken on board in our partnership with developing states and the recommendations inform our approach to our development relationship with states.<\/p><p>  The European Union is the biggest contributor of humanitarian aid to Syria and the surrounding countries <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> the refugee crisis.  From memory, approximately &euro;1.25 billion has been committed by the EU.  There has been some improvement in respect of countries honouring pledges but there is still a long way to go.  The current situation is that more than 93,000 people have been killed.  In excess of 6.8 million Syrians require immediate humanitarian assistance within the country.  More than 4 million people have been internally displaced and more than 1.6 million Syrians have fled for sanctuary to neighbouring countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.  The countries hosting displaced Syrians have shown great generosity but they have limited resources to meet their growing needs.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been a leader in terms of the international humanitarian response to the crisis.  In recent weeks the Government announced a further humanitarian assistance package of &euro;1.65 million, bringing our overall assistance to almost &euro;10 million.  To date, EU member states have contributed &euro;1 billion in emergency funding and recently announced an additional &euro;400 million in response to the deteriorating situation.  I welcome the collective agreement made by G8 leaders when they met in County Fermanagh last month to provide an additional &euro;1.5 billion in humanitarian assistance.  That was in support of the latest UN appeal for &euro;5.2 billion, which represents the largest such appeal that has ever been launched by the UN.<\/p><p>  On the policy position, Deputy Smith is aware the situation in Syria has moved on significantly since 2011.  The international response has not been as we would have liked.  At all times we wanted to see a much more robust UN position adopted.  It was not possible to get a strong UN response because of the exercise of vetoes at the Security Council.  A succession of attempts have been made at getting a political resolution.  The most recent before the current one was conducted by Dr. Brahimi.  The advantage of the Geneva II process is that it involves both the United States and Russia.  It is clear that for the process to work the participants in the conflict must be willing to participate in it.  It does not appear as though the conference will be convened prior to early autumn at the latest but it is still the only prospect for a political solution to be found.<\/p><p>  The hunger and nutrition conference was a priority for us during the Presidency.  I have briefed the foreign Ministers on the conclusions which emerged from the conference and that will inform the way in which we will approach discussion on the issue of hunger and nutrition at the Foreign Affairs Council and also at the United Nations later in the year.<\/p><p>  On the efforts the US Secretary of State is making to try to get talks under way again on the Middle East peace process, he has been deeply engaged in the process.  We very much welcome the initiative taken by the US Administration following the last presidential election and the appointment of Mr. Kerry as Secretary of State.  In March, President Obama spoke directly to the Israeli public about the need for renewed engagement.  The Secretary of State has made repeated visits to the region and held extensive discussions with Israeli, Palestinian and regional leaders.  He has already made five or six visits to the region in the space of three months.<\/p><p>  The European Union is supportive of the effort.  I have discussed the matter with the Secretary of State, Mr. Kerry.  We must also assert the priorities of the EU on the issue.  When we come to discuss the matter on Monday I expect that we will be updated by the High Representative on her information as to where the initiative of the Secretary of State, Mr. Kerry, is at this point.  We will also consider such issues, for example, as guidelines on settlement products and consider the situation on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071700006#E00300","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1374078600,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste.  He referred to the settlements in Palestine.  I welcomed his comments following the meeting with the so-called elders during the Presidency.  He stated that the Israeli settlements in Palestine are illegal and the products from them should be treated as illegal in the European Union.<\/p> <p>There was an agreement on an EU ban on those goods.  Our Government adopted the position that legal opinion indicated that would be difficult, despite the fact that many organisations have an alternative legal view in that regard.  In a recent parliamentary reply, which was probably not written by him, the T&aacute;naiste stated that the importation of settlement goods into the EU was a less significant issue than stopping settlement growth and that EU trade with Israeli settlements was not significant.  The value of the trade with the EU is &euro;230 million.  That is not an insignificant sum but, more important, EU imports from illegal settlements are 15 times those from Palestinians.  It is a crucial issue.  The illegal settlements in the Jordan Valley region are only economically viable because they can export to European supermarkets.  What the T&aacute;naiste stated does not add up.<\/p><p> The Chairman referred to the EU directive that prohibits grants, funding, prizes and so on.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to expand on that because it represents a moving from rhetoric to action in that regard.  Is the T&aacute;naiste confident that will be fully implemented?  Does it cover the areas of economics, science, culture, sports and academia?<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste mentioned Syria.  Twenty-five out of 27 member states were in favour of renewing the embargo.  Britain and France appeared to have got their way in that regard.  In other conflict zones such as Iraq there are private companies involved in training, etc.  Basically, they are an alternative to the army in terms of troops on the ground.  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware of that happening in Syria?<\/p><p> On the arms embargo, we are told that no EU country has formally sent weapons.  Is that the T&aacute;naiste's view of the situation on the ground?<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the deteriorating situation in Egypt.  Language is very important.  The EU was talking in terms of military intervention but the T&aacute;naiste spoke earlier about military take-over.  Does he regard what happened in Egypt as a military coup?  Is it difficult for a country like Ireland to say that a military coup occurred in the country?  Has Ireland publicly called for President Mursi's release?<\/p><p> Regarding the Human Rights Council, the T&aacute;naiste spoke in terms of freedom of religion or belief and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, rights.  Again, the EU adopted a strategic framework and action plan.  The T&aacute;naiste hoped that would be covered under the Lithuanian Presidency but the difficulty, according to the 2013 Rainbow Europe index, is that Lithuania is one of the worst countries in the EU in terms of laws and policies to protect LGBT people.  EU figures also indicate it is the worst country in the EU in that regard.<\/p><p> During the EU Presidency guidelines were issued on overseas EU missions committed to during the Irish Presidency, which referred to freedom of assembly without excessive political and administrative obstacles and police protection in the event of public hostility.  That is in respect of EU missions but there does not appear to be a similar view taken on EU member states.  There is a gap in that regard.<\/p><p> Regarding LGBT rights in Russia, draconian legislation has been introduced against the LGBT community under which information that views LGBT people in a positive and neutral light is banned.  An example of that is the attack by the authorities on the recent gay pride march in Moscow.  Does the T&aacute;naiste see that as a Human Rights Council issue?<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste mentioned Hezbollah in regard to one member state.  He might put on record the name of that state.  He spoke also in terms of a proposal to designate the military wing of Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation.  I would be interested to hear from where that is coming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071700006#E00400","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374079200,"counter":471,"content":"<p>On the issue of illegal settlements, we would support a ban at EU level on settlement goods entering the European Union market.  What is being developed by the High Representative and the External Action Service is a set of guidelines for the labelling of settlement products, which we support.  Work on that is well advanced and our intention is to work with that.<\/p><p>  On the reference in the parliamentary question, which I do not have before me, the issue is not so much the impact from an economic and a trade point of view of the labelling of settlement goods but to send a clear message from the European Union about the illegality of the settlements and the necessity to halt settlement activity in the context of trying to get discussions going on a peace initiative.<\/p><p>  On the issue of the arms embargo and the discussion that took place on that at the Foreign Affairs Council, all of the sanctions against Syria, which included the arms embargo, came up for renewal.  That requires unanimity at the Foreign Affairs Council; foreign policy decisions at the Foreign Affairs Council are decided by unanimity.  It was clear in the course of that discussion that unanimity would not be reached on the renewal of the arms embargo.  There was unanimity on the renewal of all the remaining sanctions but not on the arms embargo.  It was agreed that there would be a further review of the position prior to 1 August, and I expect that we will discuss that on Monday.  My understanding is that as of now, no member state has supplied arms to the Syrian opposition but it is an issue that will come up for discussion on Monday.<\/p><p>  With regard to Egypt, the point I made is that we stand for democracy.  Our support for what happened in the Arab Spring and in the transition was to have democratic regimes respecting the rule of law and human rights in place across north Africa, including in Egypt.  A military take-over flies in the face of that, and we must be clear in saying that.  We have called for the release of all political prisoners, and that includes President Mursi, but it is more than that.  It is not just about giving our view on a military take-over.  There must be a transition to democracy, and that transition to democracy must be a real transition that clearly respects the rights of all citizens in Egypt, including women.  Getting to that point is complicated now.  The European Union has an important role to play in that regard.  We also must be mindful of the economic circumstances that have given rise to the difficulties in Egypt, for example, the degree of poverty and the economic problems that country faces.<\/p><p>  Regarding the application of human rights standards throughout the European Union, that is a condition of EU membership.  There are criteria for membership of the European Union, which involve human rights standards.  Incidentally, that has been the subject of discussion at the General Affairs Council.<\/p> <p>During the course of our EU Presidency, I received a letter from four foreign ministers who sought a discussion on how the EU is dealing with the application of democratic standards in human rights issues within the EU itself.  We have had much discussion in Europe about the application of economic conditions and standards, but the issues of democracy and human rights standards are also conditions of EU membership.  Under my chairmanship, the General Affairs Council commenced a discussion process on that issue, which will continue into the autumn.<\/p><p> As regards the designation of Hezbollah, the issue arose following a bomb attack in Bulgaria which is being investigated by the Bulgarian authorities.  Arising from that, one member state asked that the designation of Hezbollah would be considered by the Council.  It is being discussed at COREPER level and I expect there will be a discussion on it at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071700007#F00200","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374079800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Olivia Mitchell first, followed by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071700008#G00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1374079800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his wide-ranging presentation.

The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that the July Council is expected to adopt conclusions on EU water diplomacy.  He also said that the conclusions would acknowledge the potential security risk associated with competition for water resources.  That is a big understatement given that water is fundamental to progress on any front.  Lack of access to water - in a place such as Lake Chad, for example - can be largely for environmental and economic reasons but also for political reasons.  It has been suggested that it can be used almost as a weapon of domination.  There are suggestions that it may be happening in the Middle East.

How many more people have to die in Syria, or leave the country for neighbouring refugee camps, before some real action is taken?  As the committee discovered when it visited one such camp, there are huge problems.  The refugee camps are putting an enormous strain on neighbouring countries.  It is all very well to talk about unanimity and a political solution, but it is becoming increasingly clear that only a military solution will bring it to an end.  We know who has the superior military strength in that situation, but what is being said about the use of chemical weapons and scud missiles?  There is no doubt but that, as the situation continues, there will be further radicalisation of certain elements within the opposition.<\/p><p>  Who is talking to Mr. Assad and who is trying to work with him on a political solution?  Or is he only listening to the Russians and Iranians?  If, as could happen, there is to be a military solution in his favour and Assad wins, are discussions taking place on what will happen to the population in Syria?  There are major issues concerning the Syrian population.  What is Ireland's view on the designation of Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist organisation?<\/p><p>  When the T&aacute;naiste brought the conference on climate change to his counterparts, what was their view on our support for the reduction to 5%?

Deputy Mitchell asked about water diplomacy and security.  On Monday, I expect that the EU's High Representative will provide an update on recent policy developments on water security.  The discussion on this issue is part of an increased focus by the High Representative and EU foreign ministers on integrating non-traditional security challenges into the common security and defence policy, particularly concerning conflict prevention, mediation and crisis management.  This was the subject of a lengthy discussion at the informal meeting of foreign affairs Ministers that was held in Cyprus during their EU Presidency last September.<\/p><p>  Essentially, one examines the areas that have the potential to give rise to conflict.  We were mindful at that stage that there was an issue in central Asia, for example, concerning two countries where the flow of water was diverted, dammed or halted, and which gave rise to tension.<\/p><p>  The EU has at its disposal a unique range of policies and tools - including development, trade, security and diplomacy - which can enable it to play a significant role in this regard.  That is the objective of regular Foreign Affairs Council discussions on this issue.  As global demand for natural resources, including water, continues to increase, so does their potential role concerning inter and intra-state conflict.  That is why Ireland supports the effective management of water resources in countries like Ethiopia, for example, where we actively contribute to the development of water infrastructure through the productive safety nets programme.  <\/p><p>  Deputy O'Sullivan asked about Syria.  There are no superlatives left to describe the horror of the situation there.  Almost 100,000 people have been killed, that we know of, and in addition we must also consider the extent of displacement.  What can be done?  One step would be for the international community to respond as one, but it has not been able to do so due to the veto being exercised by two countries at the UN Security Council.  Deputy O'Sullivan said that we are witnessing this slaughter and she asked how many more people must be killed before some intervention action is taken.  That was the rationale and argument we had at the Foreign Affairs Council in respect of renewing the arms embargo.<\/p><p>  Some member states have argued that in a set of circumstances where the Assad regime has available to it a huge amount of weaponry, the answer is to equip the opposition forces.  There are a number of difficulties with that.  The first is that it would increase the militarisation of the situation on the ground.  One would not have control over where those weapons would end up.  There is a very fractured nature to the opposition, although I know that the Syrian National Coalition is together.  However, by increasing the amount of arms one is increasing the potential for a huge civil war, which could go on for a very long time.  It would have major implications for destabilisation in the region.<\/p><p>  It is well known that we would wish to have seen the arms embargo continued.<\/p> <p>I very much regret it was not possible to get unanimity on it.  The only show in town in getting some progress on Syria is the Geneva II conference.  That has the advantage that it involves the United States and Russia.<\/p><p> The issue of Hezbollah has been extensively discussed at official level in Brussels in recent months.  To date, no agreement has been possible, despite extensive efforts in the relevant working groups that Ireland chaired during its EU Presidency.  Several countries, including Ireland, have expressed concerns about the potentially destabilising impact of designation.  There are also concerns about other impacts.  Discussions are continuing in advance of the Foreign Affairs Council meeting next Monday with a view to reaching a compromise on this difficult issue.  We are engaging constructively in those efforts to reach an agreed EU position.<\/p><p> I have noted the point made by Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan on Myanmar-Burma.  During the visit of Aung San Suu Kyi, we agreed to renew our diplomatic relations with Myanmar-Burma.  The Irish ambassador to Vietnam is also designated ambassador to Myanmar-Burma.

I read recently that the Americans are now interested in engaging in discussions with the Taliban which has resulted in talks between the Americans and the Afghan Government being scuppered.

At a recent meeting in Dublin Castle, the current high representative, Mr. Valentin Inzko, conceded to me that they had made mistakes and that they had expected progress with the Croats and the Serbs moving towards European Union membership but it did not materialise.  Does Ireland have a position on Bosnia-Herzegovina?  Does the EU now recognise that its policies there have been a failure and its response needs to be reconfigured?<\/p><p>  I remember meeting some constituents from Myanmar-Burma celebrating the release of Aung San Suu Kyi in November 2010.  They were refugees here and were Muslims who had been persecuted by Buddhists in Burma.  I have seen reports that the ethnic conflict there is getting worse in certain regions.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm we have had programme refugees from there and how many there are?  How are we handling this complex issue?  There are 136 ethnic minorities in the country, so it is not a plain cakewalk.<\/p><p>  I did not hear Cyprus mentioned in the presentation.  I am shocked at the silence around Cyprus and Famagusta, a ghost city which is lying mothballed because of the conflict there.  What is Europe doing about this issue?  Are there discussions on the plight of this city?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071700009#H00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1374080400,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He knows that I am not an unqualified admirer of this Government or its policies.  When I give praise, it is thought out, however.  I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste on his nuanced response to recent events in Egypt.  It was very significant.  The Morsi regime may be unattractive.  It was incompetent and failed to deal with the economy.  It had obnoxious views about women and all the rest of it.  However, the lead general in the overthrow of the Morsi regime was one of those who proposed forced virginity tests on those protesting in Tahrir Square.  It is a very complicated situation.  When we talk about democracy, it is remarkable that over the past 30 years every time an Islamic regime has been legitimately elected it has been subverted by the West.  It happened in Algeria, Libya, disastrously in Iraq and Palestine.  All these regimes were elected by a mass vote of the people but then the West got in and undermined them.  They may be horrible regimes.  They may contain people about whom we might have reservations.  I certainly have reservations about the ones who supplanted them, however.<\/p><p>  It is ludicrous for us to talk about democracy unless we are prepared to face the history in the region.  If we had not stuck our noses in and made a bags of it - if one is allowed to say &ldquo;bags&rdquo; - maybe the regimes would have worked and have been tempered by the experience of government.  Has the Minister sought and received support from any of our EU colleagues for his stance on Egypt?  I doubt there will be unanimous support for his stand but it was courageous, dignified and 100% warranted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013071700009#H00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1374080400,"counter":481,"content":"<p>Ireland has been very clear on the need for a strong inclusive political process to help resolve the conflict in Afghanistan.<\/p> <p>That includes dialogue with the Taliban.  We are in agreement with the emerging consensus that dialogue with the Taliban is necessary as part of the overall effort to convince Taliban leaders to relinquish the armed struggle and to reintegrate into Afghan society.  One key challenge in bringing former Taliban closer into that process will be to maintain and advance the gains made over recent years in the area of human rights and in particular women's rights.  Any political solution must also respect the spirit of the Afghan constitution and be compatible with internationally accepted standards of human rights.  That said, there is still the fear that while there may be talks with the Taliban at one level as part of the peace process, it may not speak for all of the fighters in the field.  We must be particularly mindful of statements made by the Taliban spokesperson that fighting will continue despite the recent opening of a Taliban office in Doha.  We must involve the Taliban in the process but that process must be on terms that clearly respect human rights and are about bringing an end to the violence.<\/p><p> In June 2012, the government and political leaders of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the European Commission agreed to a road map which, if implemented, could lead to the conditions for a credible application for EU membership.  Important elements in that road map include an amendment to the constitution of Bosnia-Herzegovina to make it compliant with the Sejdic-Finci ruling of the European Court of Human Rights and establishing an effective co-ordination mechanism on EU affairs among the levels of government of Bosnia-Herzogivina.  Implementation of the Sejdic-Finci ruling is essential for a decision of the European Council on the entry into force of the stabilisation and association agreement for Bosnia-Herzegovina.  While the timetable for that road map has slipped, the commitments entered into by the political leaders of Bosnia-Herzegovina remain valid.  I did say in response to a D&aacute;il question recently that I believed that there needs to be a review of the EU position on Bosnia-Herzegovina.<\/p><p> As I mentioned earlier, a scoping mission recently visited Burma-Myanmar.  It focused on progressing development and other bilateral links between Ireland and Burma-Myanmar.  The mission included an assessment of options for a small number of niche areas in which a development programme supported by Ireland could have impact and respond to local needs.  In terms of our relationship with Burma-Myanmar, we are at quite an early stage.  If we can get a programme up and running, we will then be in a much better position to assess the situation on the ground.  Otherwise, we are relying largely on the reports coming through the EU and which are publicly available.  <\/p><p> The situation in Cyprus remains a concern.  We want to see the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions and continue to call on Turkey to comply with those resolutions.  I understand that there have been contacts between the parties under the aegis of the UN and we look forward to positive developments emerging from that.<\/p><p> In respect of the point made by Senator Norris, we believe in the universality of human rights and have a very consistent position on them irrespective of the country concerned.  It is important that political progress is made in Egypt.  There will be a lengthy discussion on this on Monday.

What other plans are being put in place to deal with the worsening crisis or to assist those neighbouring countries?  Has consideration been given to trying to relocate some of these people to other parts of Europe?  It was roughly this time last year when we spoke about the potential peace process in Syria.  I remember that at the time I asked the T&aacute;naiste whether there was a plan B and referred to the possibility of military intervention.  The T&aacute;naiste replied at the time that military intervention would lead to an escalation of militarisation and thereby make the situation worse and that our national position is that if we put more arms into the situation, we will increase militarisation and move away from trying to find a political solution and the number of casualties will increase.  At that time, approximately 19,000 people had been killed.  Today, that figure is close to 100,000.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have a different view today?

I note that the T&aacute;naiste intends ratifying it in the second half of the year.  I would encourage him to do so as soon as possible.  Given the standing of Ireland on human rights issues over many decades, other countries look to us so we give an example and lead when we do that.<\/p><p>  I had a meeting in the past few days with the UN ambassadors from Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Argentina.  The issue of the International Criminal Court was discussed, in particular the Kampala declaration.  What is our position on the Kampala declaration?  We are anxious that as many countries as possible support the declaration, sign it and see that it comes into full effect.<\/p> <p> With regard to Syria, the Chairman and another member mentioned that the indication we got when we were in the Middle East was that this war will go on for many years.  We saw the sad effects of it on individuals and families, many of whom are destitute as a consequence.  They are living in the best conditions that can be provided, but appalling conditions when one looks at Zaatari refugee camp.  Last July there was nobody there and the camp was just being established.  The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, said when he was there in January there were only 15,000; now there are 120,000.  The effects that will have on Jordan, one of the few stable countries in that region, and particularly on Lebanon, which the Minister mentioned, are mind-boggling.<\/p><p> At a recent meeting I attended, Turkish parliamentarians expressed their concerns that the war in Syria might engulf the region.  They are particularly concerned about Turkey and how it might affect them.  They made the following suggestion, which I will put to the T&aacute;naiste without evaluating it myself.  They felt the effort and initiative with Russia and the US is very important to try to bring closure to that conflict and not allow it to go on for ten years.  They said it would enhance the prospects of success if Iran, Turkey and Israel participated with Russia and the US.  The inclusion of some of the countries to which they referred surprised me and I queried them but their honest opinion was that these countries would assist and that having them involved would promote the prospect of a resolution.  The T&aacute;naiste, with his officials, can evaluate whether they would concur with that.  I am giving this to the T&aacute;naiste for what it is worth, as I received it.<\/p><p> I appeal that we in Ireland would do our utmost, with the international community and our EU partners, to try to ensure that war does not continue, as people in the region feel it will, almost indefinitely.

One could feel the tension of people who had been displaced from their homes, some of them in very traumatic circumstances.  The UN has appealed for &euro;5.2 billion, its estimate of the cost of supporting the humanitarian effort just to the end of the year.  This is a major burden on the countries, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.  The Minister of State, Deputy Costello visited refugee camps in Jordan.  There must be a mobilisation of international effort to provide support and finance.  One of the issues that must be considered is where this is going in the long term and the amount that will be required to address this humanitarian crisis.  The loss of human life and the suffering of the Syrian people must end.

I welcome the opportunity to address the committee on the issue of youth justice.  Given my direct accountability to the Oireachtas as Ombudsman for Children, it is appropriate to raise my concerns with this committee on the detention of young people in Oberstown and the transition from using St. Patrick's Institution as a place of detention for 16 and 17 year old boys.  I understand that the committee has had occasion to discuss the detention of children in Oberstown with the chair of the board of the detention schools.<\/p><p>  In addition to our presentation today we have set out a chronology of the actions of our office.  It is appendixed so the committee members can see the actions our office has taken in this regard since its inception in 2005.  I will place my comments in context with some background.  When the Oireachtas passed the Children Act in 2001, it put in place a modern youth justice framework incorporating a number of fundamental children&rsquo;s rights principles.  These include the need to divert young people away from the criminal justice system as much as possible, the use of community-based sanctions and using detention as a measure of last resort.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the most recent action taken by the director of the Irish Prison Service and the Minister for Justice and Equality in closing St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  Although this is a very welcome development, we must not forget that calls to close St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution have been made for more than 28 years dating back to the Whitaker report in 1985.  In 2009, our office took the unusual step of consulting with 35 people under the age of 18 in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution to find out their experience.  This was unusual in the sense that the Ombudsman for Children Act at that time did not allow for me to accept complaints from children in St. Patrick's.  However, an alternative provision of the Act gave me the authority to consult with any group of children and young people and to highlight matters of concern to children and young people.<\/p><p>  It was abundantly clear to me when my team and I talked to the young people in St. Patrick&rsquo;s in 2009 that the problem was not merely one of accommodation, but a culture that was detrimental to the young people detained there.  I had no previous personal experience of prisons before entering St. Patrick&rsquo;s.  I found it a very oppressive environment and the tension between the young people and some staff was palpable.  It felt like an intimidating environment for the young people.  I recall the expressions of fear and anxiety from some young people very vividly.  Some of the children reported feeling unsafe, cold and hungry.<\/p> <p>One described being locked up for 23 hours in a cell on protection and described the cell as: \"F...king freezing!  A padded wall, no clothes, only a pair of Y-fronts... for days.\"<\/p><p> At the conclusion of the project, I called for the closure of the prison as a place of detention for young people.  There was further questioning by international monitors of children's rights, namely, the UN Committee Against Torture and the Council of Europe, on the findings of our report and the conditions in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  We must reflect on why it has taken 28 years to finally get to the point of closing an institution described by the chaplains as a monument to State failure.<\/p><p> The 2012 report of the Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, published earlier this month, also found very disturbing incidents of non-compliance with human rights standards.  For example, one prisoner who had been moved to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution that day was in a cold and dirty cell where the toilet was filled with excrement.  The inspector found the young person crying in bed because he had been refused permission to make a telephone call to his father.  He described the prisoner as afraid.  I hope that as we move to a new era of youth justice in Ireland with the closure of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, we will also see an end to the culture of disbelief when faced with such accounts.<\/p><p> The Government has decided that Wheatfield Prison will be used in the interim to accommodate 17 year olds.  I visited Wheatfield Prison last week and met the governor and director of the Irish Prison Service to discuss the proposed move.  It appeared to me the facilities and, more importantly, the culture in Wheatfield Prison are significantly better than those in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  However, we must not lose sight of the fact that irrespective of the conditions obtaining in the prison, we are moving children from one prison to another.  Wheatfield is an adult prison, and an adult prison is no place for any child under the age of 18.<\/p><p> I referred to St. Patrick's Institution because it is significant with regard to getting young people out of prison that the Oberstown project is progressed.  Oberstown is designed to be a children&rsquo;s detention school rather than a prison.  The difference is that in a custodial environment one is locked up, but in a detention school children should receive therapeutic intervention and education which will enable them to return as active members of our communities.  When the Minister for Justice and Equality established the Thornton Hall project review group in 2011, I made a number of recommendations to it.  These recommendations included moving 16 and 17 year old boys to Oberstown on a phased basis to afford staff the opportunity to become accustomed to the new cohort of young people; to put in place a project manager to oversee the transition, ensure the project happens and act as a link between St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and Oberstown; and to enhance the skills and capacity of staff in Oberstown as part of the transition.<\/p><p> One of the reasons I emphasised the importance of putting in place a project manager and examining staff capacity was that I was aware of industrial relations issues identified in Oberstown at the time.  A further industrial relations challenge arose when the decision was made last year to begin detaining 16 year old children in Oberstown.  I received a solicitor&rsquo;s letter on behalf of a group of staff in Oberstown setting out their concerns regarding this move, to which the group of staff in question was opposed.  The main concern set out in the letter I received was that staff in Oberstown were not trained to deal with 16 and 17 year old boys.  In light of the concern expressed to me regarding the capacity of staff in Oberstown, I was disappointed to read in the most recent annual report of the inspector of prisons that a proposed initiative to have care staff from the detention schools work alongside prison staff in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution was not facilitated.  The skills gained from such a period of work could perhaps have addressed some of the concerns outlined to me regarding staff capacity in Oberstown.<\/p><p> A further concern has come to my attention in the past week regarding the reorganisation of existing units in Oberstown.  This change has arisen from the need for a greater number of beds for boys than had been anticipated.  As the committee is aware, this matter recently entered the public domain as a number of judges were unable to remand boys to detention due to a lack of space on the particular days in question.  The concerns raised with me about the girl in detention in Oberstown are that her mobility and recreational opportunities are restricted.  The young person in question is not going to be able to have the type of life she should because she is the only girl in a campus of teenage boys.<\/p><p> I am a pragmatist by nature and I am not opposed to pragmatic solutions to capacity problems in Oberstown, but such solutions must not come at the expense of young people&rsquo;s well-being or the need to observe the relevant care standards.  We must take care not to place institutional interests ahead of the interests of children.<\/p><p> I do not wish to give an entirely negative assessment of the current situation.  It is only fair to say the improvement in youth justice has accelerated under the Government due to four key efforts, namely, capital investment in the Oberstown facility; the fact that since May last year 16 year old boys are no longer sent to prisons; the extension of the investigative remit of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children since July 2012; and the closure of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  All of these are significant developments which should make young people&rsquo;s experience of detention much less intimidating.  I have never suggested anything other than that young people who commit crimes must pay the price, which is the loss of their liberty, and beyond this a sentence is not to instil a sense of fear in any child or young person.<\/p><p> I hope the momentum will be maintained and Members of the Oireachtas have an important role to play in this regard as legislators creating a more modern youth justice system.  It is important that we continue to monitor it.  The roadmap for the development of a child-based youth justice system was set out by the Houses in the Children Act 2001.  The current reforms are an integral part of realising this vision and ensuring children will not be detained in a prison.  I trust the committee will continue its engagement with the key stakeholders in this area to ensure the reform process does not falter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374073200,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Logan for her very comprehensive remarks.

The change in emphasis with regard to children's detention centres as opposed to prisons is positive.  The interests of children must be paramount.  We must avoid creating another St. Patrick's institution.  Will Oberstown have adequate staff and will they be suitably trained?  What measures are required in this regard?  The proposal for Oberstown staff to shadow St. Patrick's staff for a period was not implemented.  Has a training needs assessment been carried out at Oberstown?<\/p><p>  The number of hours lost to sick leave across the three schools on the campus between 1 September 2012 and 28 February 2013 is significant.  At Oberstown girls school the figure was 460 hours, at Oberstown boys school the figure was 261 hours and at Trinity House school the figure was 1117 hours.  This was before the new roster was introduced in February.  Are more recent figures available?  Is there an increase in the number of assaults, sick leave and breaches of health and safety?  The Ombudsman for Children paints a negative picture as do staff working in Oberstown.  How does this impact on the well-being of the children there and have such impacts been measured?  Has the Ombudsman for Children spoken to the children there as she did to the children in St. Patrick's institution? If not will she do so?

Current capacity at Oberstown is 52 and there are more than 220 staff.  There is no doubt that the children at Oberstown have challenging behaviours and one would expect there to be more staff than in other care environments, but the question of whether levels of competence and capacity need to be upskilled as opposed to additional staff provided should be put to the board of Oberstown.

I have received letters asserting that people are unable to look after 16 year olds and 17 year olds.  As someone who has worked as a public servant for 31 years, I have never heard of anyone being trained to look after children only up to the age of 15 years.  It is possible that the staff are viewing the situation through their own experience at Oberstown.  As there have always been girls there up to the age of 18 years, we are referring specifically to boys.  In my experience, there is no difference between a 15 year old boy and a 16 year old boy.  I have worked with children for 30 years.  I am unsure as to why this distinction was ever allowed to develop.  I would challenge it.<\/p><p>  I have no question about any change for any staff.

As someone who is an experienced public servant and manager of large organisations, an increase in sick leave is usually a symptom of something else.  I would be cautious and encourage the committee not to respond immediately by demonising any client group.  In this case, it is children who have committed crimes, but it could be any group of vulnerable adults.  It does not matter whether one works in the public sector.  If one is a social worker, one expects to be confronted with families that are vulnerable.  As a nurse in an accident and emergency department, one expects to meet abusive clients.  If one is a social care worker in an environment where children are in conflict with the law, it is a reasonable expectation that the children will be challenging.<\/p> <p>It is a matter of being competent, trained and upskilled to deal with the situation.<\/p><p> Reference was made to assault leave but I caution against using the children as the reason.  Perhaps we should explore a little bit further why this is a symptom of an organisation that clearly does not work as a single body, in that there are three siloed institutions on one campus.<\/p><p> We speak to children all of the time.  Sadly, the children at Oberstown and St. Patrick's Institution sometimes have the same profile as the children contained in the child death review report compiled by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon and Ms Norah Gibbons.  They have been known to the care system and State for many years.  Most who are sent to both places on remand are in care of the State.  There is a quite a strong connection between how we provide for children in our child protection system and what happens to them after they have been in conflict with the law.  Children who have poor family attachments also have problems with mental health, drugs and substance abuse.  These are risk behaviours and, when they converge, children are more likely to get involved or be in conflict with the law.<\/p><p> I wrote down Deputy McLellan's last question on the capital project.  I have no fears about it, as the Minister has been demonstrative in her statements on the Government's commitment to ring-fencing it.<\/p><p> Deputy Healy was the next to ask questions and asked whether we were going in the right direction.  I am confident about that, which is why I referred to the Children Act 2001.  It is very good legislation that is thought of highly internationally.  People believe it is a very good vision for a youth justice system.  The system should not be about sending children to prisons and detaining them for lower level crimes, but dealing with them in the community under supervision while keeping detention as a last resort.  I support the legislative and policy direction.<\/p><p> As to whether the timeframe is acceptable, it is probably unfair.  It is easy for me, at a distance, to say what the timeframe should be.

She has addressed numerous issues.  Our paths have crossed many times on various issues.

I would be very supportive of Deputies Naughten and Dowds in their advocacy of preventative measures, which are very important.  It is important that we do not end up putting all our resources into the wrong end of the spectrum.  Although we are talking about Oberstown today, the profile of children is as Deputy Dowds said.  It is the same group of children coming from the same estates and our orientation should be much more towards preventative measures at an early stage.

An important aspect for any young boy growing up is to have somebody he can follow and look up to.  Unfortunately, as we divert things away from upstream, look back down to the preventative situations and cut funding there, it makes it harder for them to find the right person to look up to and, unfortunately, they look up to their peers, which is natural.  However, if those peers are going in the wrong direction, it makes it much more difficult to turn the direction of their lives.<\/p><p>  What one finds in Oberstown and places like is young people who still have an opportunity within that system to turn their lives around, to come out in a different way and to be rehabilitated, for the want of a better word.  St. Patrick's was literally the old fashioned borstal and the opportunity to rehabilitate and change and to find therapeutic and educational opportunities were lost.<\/p><p>  One of the complaints we got from St. Patrick's was of a young boy who had been in and out of detention since he was 15 years of age and who had been doing a very good job in Oberstown where he got the opportunity for therapy and education and he was moving towards the leaving certificate.  However, as soon as he turned 17 years of age, he was put into St. Patrick's because that was still the law.  Within a number of days of being in St. Patrick's, he was unfortunately caught in a violent situation and the disciplinary action of the staff was that he lost privileges and, therefore, educational and therapeutic opportunities were lost.  The same situation will happen again because 17 year olds will be put in Wheatfield.<\/p><p>  As we start to make progress with these young people in Oberstown - the set-up is as good as we would like it to be - they will still be moved to Wheatfield, which is unfortunate.  We want to make sure we change that.  The idea of one good adult, which is what Headstrong promotes, can turn a child's life around.  Oberstown can be one of those last stops before the life is harder to turn around.  That is what we are trying to promote here.  Over the past 100 years, Ireland has locked up behind walls all of our problem situations.<\/p> <p>This is one of the few that are left and we have to clear the dust out and start again - three settings on one site that are totally closed off and totally institutionalised.  Even using the word \"institutional\" is very backward.  We must have a situation in which we can blow the cobwebs away and start afresh with a campus manager.  A campus manager should have an opportunity to start afresh in order to give those young people a new opportunity that will turn their life around.  That is what we should be doing as opposed to creating career criminals, which is what has happened up to now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071700006#E01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374075600,"counter":535,"content":"<p>How confident is Dr. Muldoon about the commonality of common policies to be shared by institutions?

I will be serious instead.<\/p><p>  The original proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interests by means of criminal law was communicated by the Commission to the Council on 12 July 2012.  Its aim is to replace what is known as the PIF Convention of 1995 and its protocols.  The proposal contained a requirement for member states to criminalise various forms of fraud and corruption which damage the financial interests of the Union along similar lines to the 1995 convention.  The Commission's proposal went further in addressing procurement-related offences, encompassing VAT, requiring mandatory minimum sentences, and requiring minimum prescription, or Statute of Limitations, periods.  Most controversially, the Commission's proposal was based on Article 325 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU.  A majority of member states, with the support of the Council's legal service, objected to Article 325 as a legal base for criminal law measures as they are of the view that such measures must be based on an article within Title V of Part 3 of the TFEU, encompassing Articles 67 to 89, inclusive, concerning an area of freedom, security and justice.<\/p><p>  Following lengthy negotiations at working group, counsellor and committee of permanent representatives, COREPER, level, the Justice and Home Affairs Council, on 6 June, agreed a Council general approach on the proposed directive.  I will now deliberately embarrass somebody who is sitting close to me by pointing out that this agreement was the result of very substantial work undertaken to resolve what had been a very difficult issue at European Union level during the course of the Irish Presidency.  I am guessing that a member of my Department who is in this room is blushing at this stage.  The Government has decided that Ireland should opt in to this general approach in accordance with Protocol 21.  Under Article 29.4.7, the approval of the Houses is sought to that end.<\/p><p>  The general approach is significantly different from the Commission's original proposal in a number of areas.  The scope excludes VAT and is limited to expenditure in the form of grants and subsidies or cases where intention to make an unlawful gain or cause a loss can be proven.  Procurement-related offences have been removed.  There are no mandatory minimum prison sentences, only minimum levels of maximum sentences.  The prescription provisions are significantly modified.  Most importantly, the Council agreed the general approach on the understanding that the legal basis for the measure would be Article 83(2) of the TFEU.  On foot of this agreement, the Council noted that 6 June would mark the commencement of the opt-in period for Ireland and the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 3 of Protocol 21 to the treaties.  The general approach will form the basis for the Council's engagement in trilogues with the European Parliament and the Commission.  The three-month period in respect of the proposal will expire on 6 September.  The various changes of approach were necessary to effect agreement between member states and allow the instrument to proceed.  As in all such cases, it was about finding a ground upon which member states, or at least a majority thereof, could generally agree.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the draft directive is to move the basis for criminal laws to protect the financial interests of the EU from the 1995 PIF Convention to a basis under the provisions of the Lisbon treaty.  There is an added significance to the proposed directive in that Article 86 of the TFEU provides for the possible establishment of a European public prosecutor's office, EPPO, which would have responsibility for investigating and prosecuting offences against the Union's financial interests.  Participation in EPPO, if a proposal is advanced, will be optional for member states.<\/p><p>  I will now set out the key provisions in the Council's general approach to the proposed directive. Article 83(2) is the legal base for the measure and is set out in the Preamble.  VAT revenues are excluded, in Article 2, from the definition of the Union's financial interests as they are matters internally for member states.  The definition, in Article 3, of fraud affecting the Union's financial interests is limited to expenditure in the form of grants and subsidies or cases where intention to make an unlawful gain or cause a loss can be proven.  To clarify the legal jargon, the intention here is to ensure that where funding is provided by the European Union it is used for the purposes intended and is not fraudulently misused.<\/p> <p> Article 4 provides for fraud-related offences affecting the Union's financial interests, namely, money laundering, corruption and misappropriation.  It also provides a definition of \"public official\", which has a particular relevance for those offences.  Article 5 addresses incitement, aiding and abetting and attempt to commit offences.  Article 6 addresses the liability of legal persons.  Article 7 requires that offences are punishable by criminal penalties.  It will be a matter for member states to define serious offences in domestic law but these must be punishable by a maximum penalty of at least four years imprisonment.  That is a maximum rather than a minimum meaning that an appropriate sentence could be handed down by a judge who might bear in mind the overall circumstances relating to any alleged offence of which someone is convicted.<\/p><p> Article 8 requires that the commission of offences as part of a criminal organisation shall be regarded as an aggravating circumstance.  Article 9 addresses sanctions for legal persons.  Article 10 relates to the freezing and confiscation of the proceeds and instrumentalities of offences.  Article 11 requires member states to assert jurisdiction over offences committed wholly or partly in their territory or by their citizens.  Article 12 requires a prescription - Statute of Limitations - period of at least five years for serious offences.  Recital 19 clarifies that this is without prejudice to member states, such as Ireland, the UK and Cyprus, which do not set limitation periods.  We do not have formal limitation periods and if someone commits an alleged offence and if evidence is available, he or she can be prosecuted in respect of that offence five, ten, 15 or 20 years later.  This, of course, is subject to the views of the Supreme Court - as detailed in case law - with regard to issues of delay and prejudice.<\/p><p> Article 13 refers to the recovery of sums unduly paid.  Article 14 is intended to ensure that the imposition of administrative sanctions provided for in Council Regulation No. 2988\/95 relating to the Union's financial interests will not be prejudiced by the proposed directive.  Article 15 provides for co-operation with the European Anti-Fraud Office.  Article 16 provides for the replacement of the 1995 PIF convention for those member states participating in implementing the directive.  Articles 17 to 20, inclusive, deal with transposition, reporting on implementation, entry into force and the usual formalities.<\/p><p> The following are issues which arise for this country.  While the original Commission proposal contained some elements of concern to Ireland, such as mandatory minimum sentences and a legal base other than in Title V of Part 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the general approach agreed by Council does not, we believe, present any significant difficulties for us.  Much of the content of the proposed directive replicates the PIF directive of 1995, which was provided for in Part 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud offences) Act 2001.  While a preliminary examination of the proposal in its current form indicates that Part 6 may need to be replaced, it is not envisaged that the replacement provisions will be substantially different to those actually contained in Part 6.  When negotiations have been concluded, the final text of the instrument will be examined in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General in order to establish the precise legislative requirements necessary to give full effect to the directive in Irish law.  As already stated, because this is a directive rather than a regulation and in so far as it addresses issues for which we have not yet legislated, we will ultimately be required to introduce domestic legislation.<\/p><p> The proposed directive will bring the law in this area under the framework of the Lisbon treaty.  It will further harmonise the approach across the EU to the criminalisation of fraud affecting the Union's financial interests.  The interests of Ireland, as a member state, will be better protected by this measure and by our participation in its negotiation and implementation.  Effectively, therefore, I am asking the committee to agree that we should opt-in and participate in the negotiations that will be undertaken with other member states in order to bring forward the final version of this proposed instrument.  I am of the opinion that we should proceed as I have outlined and I commend the motion to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013071700003#C00500","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374066600,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

In the context of this matter, the term \"JHA\" refers to justice and home affairs.<\/p> <p>I realise we use acronyms and letters and if one is not familiar with them it can sound a little odd.  I thank the committee for making time available to discuss this motion today.<\/p><p> The motion relates to the exercise by the State of the option which Ireland has to take part in the adoption and application of the proposed regulation and the repeal of the decisions to which I just referred.<\/p><p> The legal basis for the Commission proposal is to be found in Articles 88 and 87(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Article 88 of the treaty provides that Europol shall be governed by a regulation to be adopted by the ordinary legislative procedure.  Article 87(2)(b) provides that the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, may establish measures concerning support for the training of staff, and co-operation on the exchange of staff, on equipment and on research into crime detection.<\/p><p> In consequence, the terms of Protocol No. 21, which we share with the United Kingdom, whereby we have three months to exercise our option to take part in the adoption and application of relevant measures, apply.  I am advised that the three month period will expire by 30 July.  Accordingly, if we are to exercise our option within the required timeframe in respect of this measure, it is necessary to obtain the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas before that date.  Members will be familiar with the procedure in relation to protocol measures  - we just dealt with one - since a number of proposals which attract the provisions of the protocol have come before this committee of the House in recent years.<\/p><p> The proposal - as presented by the Commission - concerns two existing EU agencies, Europol and CEPOL.  Europol's role is to support national law enforcement bodies in their fight against serious crime and terrorism.  Europol does this by exchanging information between national services and providing analysis of data to assist national services.  The European Police College, CEPOL, facilitates co-operation between national police services by organising and conducting training with a specific European and international dimension.  The draft regulation is, as regards Europol, the first substantial overhaul for the organisation since its inception: the Council Decision of 2009 was an institutional and legal update but did not present a change to the core business of Europol.<\/p><p> Following publication of the proposal at the end of March, during the course of the Irish Presidency, many member states expressed outright opposition to the proposed merger of Europol and CEPOL.  In short, there is a real concern on the part of member states that the merger of CEPOL into Europol may adversely impact on police training given the primary intelligence focus of Europol.  During the Irish Presidency, we facilitated discussion of the proposal at ministerial and senior official levels.  These discussions focused, in particular, on the issues arising from the proposed merger.  At the meeting of the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg that I chaired in June, there was significant opposition to the merger and it was clear that no agreement would be forthcoming on this aspect of the proposal.  Accordingly, the Irish Presidency asked the Commission to reflect on the outcome of the discussion and to reconsider the matter.  In the meantime, the Irish Presidency decided that formal consideration of the matter at working group level would concentrate on the proposal as it relates to Europol and that the merger issue need not be considered given the clear majority of member states already opposed to it.<\/p><p> The first working group meeting was held in June under the Irish Presidency.  The Lithuanian Presidency will continue the examination of the proposal.  No consideration will be given to the merger issue.  The member states expect the Commission to put forward alternative proposals in relation to CEPOL in due course.<\/p><p> The proposal aims to align Europol with the requirements of the Treaty of Lisbon, increasing its accountability; enhance the supply of information by member states to Europol; provide that Europol will take over and build on the tasks currently carried out by CEPOL &ndash; clearly, that will not be happening; reinforce the data protection regime applicable to Europol; and improve the governance of Europol.<\/p><p> I wish to briefly comment on each of these aims.  The first one is making Europol more accountable.  The regulation aims to ensure that Europol's activities are subject to the scrutiny of both the European Parliament and the national parliaments.  This objective will be achieved by providing that the European Parliament and the national parliaments receive information and reports and that the executive director and the chairperson of the management board can meet with the parliaments to discuss Europol issues.  In addition, the European Parliament will have statutory functions in relation to the agency's budget and work programme.<\/p><p> The next aim relates to enhancing the supply of information.  The regulation will strengthen the obligation of member states to provide data.  It is also proposed to redesign how the agency processes data to ensure that Europol is better placed to link and analyse data in order to identify trends and patterns.  All of this will be achieved with the highest data protection standards possible.  I will give members an example of the type of data I am talking about.  It may well be intelligence information relating to the activities of individuals engaged in international terrorism.  There may be a need for information to be exchanged between Europol and police forces in Europe.  That would be a classic example of information exchange that would contribute to law enforcement in individual member states.<\/p><p> In regard to training, as I already mentioned, the Commission has proposed that Europol will build on the work of CEPOL and assume new responsibilities in relation to police training.  However, member states expect the Commission to put forward alternative proposals.  Much of the discussion on this issue during the Irish Presidency was that member states were concerned that if CEPOL was subsumed into Europol the main focus would be on obtaining and exchanging information and that the training function of CEPOL would in some way receive less priority or be downgraded.  I am not sure that would have occurred in reality but that was the concern expressed by member states.<\/p><p> The proposal reinforces Europol's data protection regime.  Access by member states to personal data will be on a \"hit\/no-hit\" basis.  Accordingly, data will only be supplied in response to a separate follow-up request.  Processing of data on victims and witnesses will be prohibited unless strictly necessary.  Rights of access to data will be reinforced.  Any person can seek compensation for unlawful data processing.  The European Data Protection Supervisor will supervise the processing of data by Europol.  National data protection authorities will continue to enforce the rules relating to the input and retrieval of data by member states.<\/p><p> In terms of improved governance, the board will be responsible for the budget and working procedures and, in order to streamline the decision-making process, the board will be empowered to establish a smaller executive board.  <\/p><p> In the context of the text of the regulation, I do not propose to go through it in great detail but it is appropriate to present an overview.  Chapter 1 contains the general provisions.  Article 1 provides for the establishment of the agency, to be formally known as the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation and Training -Europol.  Article 2 provides for definitions of terms used elsewhere in the text.  Article 3 sets out Europol's objectives, foremost of which is to support and strengthen action by competent authorities in the member states in preventing and combatting serious crime affecting two or more member states, terrorism and forms of crime which affect a common interest covered by a Union policy.<\/p><p> Chapter 2 which deals with tasks related to law enforcement co-operation contains five articles.  Article 4 provides for the agency's tasks.  These include collecting, storing, processing analysing and exchanging information and preparing threat assessments.  The agency will also provide technical support to member states' cross-border operations and investigations.  Article 5 provides that Europol may participate in joint investigation teams.  Article 6 provides that Europol may request member states to initiate criminal investigations.  However, the decision to initiate investigations will rest with the member states.<\/p><p> Article 7 provides for member states' co-operation with Europol.  As is the case now, member states will establish national units to act as the liaison body between Europol and the competent authorities in the member state.  Article 8 provides for liaison officers to be assigned to Europol.  Currently, both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners have liaison officers based in Europol headquarters in The Hague.<\/p><p> Chapter 3 concerns tasks related to training for law enforcement officers.  Articles 9, 10 and 11 relate to training.  Again, I have to make the point that this aspect of the proposal will not now be considered by member states.<\/p><p> Chapter 4 deals with the organisation of Europol.  Articles 12, 13 and 14 deal with the composition and functions of the management board.  Each member state shall nominate one member and the Commission will be able to nominate two.  Article 15 provides that the board shall adopt an annual work programme and multi-annual work programme, both of which are to be forwarded to the European Parliament, the Council, Commission and national parliaments.<\/p> <p> Articles 16 to 18 provide for a chairperson to be elected by the board, meetings of the board, which must be at least two per year, and voting rules, with decisions to be made by a majority of members.  Article 19 provides for an executive director to be appointed by the management board.  The executive director will be responsible for the day to day administration of the agency.  Article 20 provides for a scientific committee for training, which will be an independent advisory body to guide the scientific quality of the agency's training work.  As with other sections dealing with training, this aspect of the proposal will not be considered.<\/p><p> Articles 21 and 22 deal with the executive board which, if established, will prepare decisions for adoption by the management board.  It will also have functions relating to the follow-up of findings and recommendations stemming from evaluation reports and assisting the executive director in the implementation of decisions of the management board.  The executive board will be composed of the chairperson of the management board, one representative from the Commission, and three other members of the management board chosen by the members.<br \/><i><\/i>Chapter 5 deals with the processing of information.  Article 23 provides that Europol can only process information that has been provided by member states, in accordance with their national law, by Union bodies, third countries and international organisations, where agreements have been entered into with them, and by private parties in accordance with Article 29, which I will come to.<\/p><p> Article 24 sets out what Europol can do with the information.  It can process information for the purposes of cross-checking information to identify connections; analyses of a strategic or thematic nature; and operational analyses in specific cases.<\/p><p> Article 25 provides that a member state, EU body, a third country or international organisation providing information determines the purpose for which it shall be processed.  Article 26 provides that member states shall have access to and be able to search all information which has been provided in accordance with Article 24 for the purposes of cross-checking and strategic and thematic analysis.  Regarding information provided for operational analyses in specific cases, member states shall have indirect access on a hit\/no hit basis.  Article 27 provides that Eurojust and OLAF should have access to Europol information on the same basis.<\/p><p> Article 28 provides that Europol has a duty, in certain circumstances, to share information irrespective of any access restrictions.  For instance, Europol will supply information in the interest of preventing an imminent terrorist attack.  That is something I mentioned earlier.<\/p><p> Chapter 6 deals with relations with partners.  Article 29 sets out the procedures whereby Europol may establish relations with other Union bodies, third countries and so on.  Articles 30 to 33 provide for the transfer and exchange of data.  <\/p><p> Chapter 7 deals with data protection safeguards.  Articles 34 to 48 set out in some detail the data protection safeguards to be put in place. These are comprehensive and are designed to ensure the best possible regime of data protection consistent with Europol's mission.  Provisions cover processing of data, time limits, security, rights of access and rights to rectification, etc.<\/p><p> Europol will have a data protection officer who, in the performance of his or her duties, is obliged to act independently.  Each member state will designate a national supervisory authority with the task of independently monitoring the transmission and exchange of data between the member state and Europol.  In addition, the European Data Protection Supervisor will monitor and ensure the application of the safeguards contained in the regulation.  Article 46 sets out the duties and powers of the supervisor.<\/p><p> Chapter 8 deals with remedies and liabilities.  Article 49 provides for a right to lodge a complaint with the European Data Protection Supervisor.  Article 50 provides for a right to bring an appeal against a decision of the supervisor to the Court of Justice.  Articles 51 and 52 deal with liability.<\/p><p> Chapter 9 deals with parliamentary scrutiny.  Articles 53 and 54 deal with parliamentary scrutiny.  The chairperson of the management board and the executive director will appear before the European Parliament to discuss matters relating to Europol.  It also provides that Europol will be obliged to provide the European and national parliaments information relating to threat assessments, strategic analyses and general situation reports.<\/p><p> Chapter 10 deals with staffing issues.  Articles 55 to 58 deal with financial provisions.  Articles 59 to 63 deal with implementation of the budget, presentation of accounts and so on.<\/p><p> Chapter 12 deals with various miscellaneous provisions.  Articles 64 to 72 cover a number of miscellaneous matters: Europol's legal status, the location of Europol, which is in The Hague, privileges and immunity, evaluation of Europol every five years, and the conclusion of a headquarters agreement between Europol and the Netherlands, the country in which the agency is based.<\/p><p> Chapter 13 deals with transitional provisions.  Articles 73 to 76 set out transitional arrangements concerning the board, senior office holders and the budget.<\/p><p> Chapter 14 deals with final provisions.  Articles 77 and 78 replace and repeal various measures, and Article 79 provides for entry into force.  Essentially, the proposal seeks to create a Europol that is fit to address the challenges of supporting and enhancing EU law enforcement co-operation for the next ten to 15 years, similar to the original Europol Convention that provided the functional framework for its first 15 years.  <\/p><p> Ireland is broadly supportive of the proposal.  Our participation in Europol is vital to our national interest, and we look forward to continuing to play an active role with the agency.<\/p><p> I hope the committee will support the motion to exercise Ireland's opt-in to the negotiation of this proposal.  It is essential that we continue to actively participate in Europol.  I need hardly add that any points raised by members of the committee on the European Commission proposal will be noted and will be taken into account during the negotiation process.  I thank members of the committee for hanging in there for what was a very long presentation about an agency that does some interesting work in respect of whose structure is being updated and in respect of which I hope a very good regulation will be put in place when the deliberative phase of this process is complete at European Union level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013071700004#D01600","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374067800,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It argues that the existing data protection system within Europol is very strong and it believes what is proposed in the regulation is weaker than what is already in place.  The definition of the types of crimes Europol can examine has changed to a more broader definition.  The concern would be that we have regular data protection in Ireland but can we ensure that whatever information we pass on to Europol with regard to Irish citizens is protected?  It greatly concerns me that this supervisory body, whose function is to examine all of this, has its own concerns.<\/p><p>  Apart from criticisms the body has a number of practical proposals.  It speaks about the need for joint supervision of this entire area, including the national data protection agencies.  It does not support the idea of the Commission making the European data protection service solely responsible for the supervision of Europol; it believes there must be joint supervision.  On the basis of its criticism and also of advice from my colleagues in the European Parliament, our party could not support the current proposal and we will push for a vote on it tomorrow unless the Minister can convince us otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013071700006#F00300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1374067800,"counter":589,"content":"<p>In fact the exact opposite is happening.  First, the data protection issue will be subject to the jurisdiction of the European Data Protection Supervisor'<\/p> <p>In practical terms, that would be - in the context of our own data - the equivalent of our domestic Data Protection Commissioner.  That would be a normal way of ensuring data protection, to have the main body which deals with that ensuring data protection.<\/p><p> In the context of the proposal, there is a range of things worth referring to.  The proposal basically reinforces the autonomous data protection regime applicable to Europol's activities.  It strengthens rather than weakening it.  For instance, the individual's right of access to personal data is reinforced.  Any individual can turn to Europol for compensation for unlawful data processing or an action incompatible with the provisions of the relevant regulation.<\/p><p> The role of Europol's data protection supervisory authority is in fact enhanced and strengthened, it is not weakened.  The European Data Protection Service, EDPS, would be competent for the supervision of processing of personal data by Europol.  Contrary to the previous data protection supervisor, the EDPS meets all the criteria on independence laid down in the case law of the European Court of Justice.  It is important that data protection does have oversight from an entirely independent individual or body.  <\/p><p> In addition, there are full enforcement powers vested in the EDPS, which ensure the effectiveness of data protection supervision.  The processing of personal data on victims, witnesses, persons different from suspects, and minors is prohibited unless strictly necessary within the terms of the regulation.  This also applies to data revealing racial and ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or beliefs, and trade union membership.<\/p><p> Access by member states to personal data held by Europol for operational analysis is based on a \"hit-no hit\" system.  An automated query of the member states produces an anonymous hit - that is, information on a match with the data stored at Europol.  The related personal or case data is only provided in response to a separate follow-up request subject to appropriate safeguards.  As I understand it, this measure will not weaken data protection.  In fact, it will strengthen it for citizens and will provide a better regime than is currently provided for.  I can assure the Deputy that is something we would want in representing Ireland's interests in the context of the negotiations that will take place at EU level on the final form of this measure.  If we identify any frailty concerning data protection, we will do what we can to have it addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013071700006#F00400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374068400,"counter":591,"content":"<p>The joint supervisory body will have an important function in overseeing all of this.  The proposal refers to the fact that the existing regulations are strong and robust.  It was stated that the level of data protection introduced by the proposed regulation, in view of the new competences of Europol, is a clear retrograde step compared to the existing level of data protection set out in the Europol Council decision.  This is also the assessment of all national data protection authorities.  That is strong criticism.  It is not like some left-wing conspiracy.  These are people who want to protect the integrity of the institutions.  I have concerns about the proposal.  Has the Minister engaged with this assessment?

I am not asking the committee to support this regulation in its present form.  I deliberately went through what it contains and I have already sign-posted some of the matters contained in it that will not be accepted.  One of the focuses of the Irish EU Presidency was whether or not CEPOL would be integrated within Europol.  That will not happen.  We still have a measure that provides for that, although it will not be progressed.  We have two choices as a State.  We either opt in at this stage to the deliberations that are taking place, so that we can make our contribution to remedy any frailties in the proposed regulation by proposing any necessary amendments and engaging in that process, or we do not opt in.  If we do not opt in, we are officially excluded from the development and improvement of the measure.  The opt-in is to allow us to engage.  At the end of the process we have an option to stand aside.  We can see what happens at the end of it and then simply opt in to adopt it at a later stage.  Then, however, we will not have had any opportunity to make our views known or to influence the outcome.<\/p><p>  We are already part and parcel of Europol and are engaged with it.  Europol does very important work and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can access Europol's database, particularly in dealing with international crime issues.  Apart from terrorist issues, I am referring to drug crime.  International drug gangs are bringing drugs from one part of Europe to another.  Some bring drugs into Ireland, while others use Ireland as an access point for other parts of Europe.  On occasion, one sees newspaper reports of co-ordinated police action in three or four EU states to bust a drugs gang.  Such busts often take place as a consequence of co-ordinated exchanges of information, not only directly between police forces but also using Europol's facilities.  It is very important that we should remain part of that.<\/p><p>  It is not my view that the directive, in its current form, is perfect and should remain unchanged.  During the Irish EU Presidency the two big issues were, first, whether this measure would proceed and, second, if it did, would the CEPOL proposal be a part of it?  There was a lot of controversy about that and it was the focus of attention. <\/p><p>  I would urge members of the committee, including Deputy Mac Lochlainn's party, to support it.  We are seeking support to opt in to the negotiation process so that we can contribute directly to any discussions necessary to improve the provisions.  It is our reading of this that in a number of ways it reinforces and improves data protection, but if there are frailties in the data protection area we will obviously have regard to the submission that the Deputy referred to.  We will also have regard to our own internal assessments.  We will bring that discussion into the negotiations which will take place under the Lithuanian EU Presidency for the instrument to be agreed in a final form.  If we opt out, however, we cannot participate in that discussion.

This is a unique procedure to Ireland and the UK.  No other EU member state has this.  An instrument like this would normally be negotiated at Council level and at official level for agreement to be reached between Ministers on the form of the proposal as agreed by member states at government level.  The democratic check on that is twofold.  If a Minister does something quite daft, they are accountable to their parliament.  The accountability issue is the European Parliament.  It is now a co-decision maker which is why we have specialist committees in the European Parliament to deal with justice issues.<\/p><p>  Instead of Ireland being automatically part and parcel of the justice area, we have an opt-in and opt-out position.  Some of the justice matters dealt with by continental European Union member states are incompatible with certain constitutional safeguards.  These are all areas of co-operation between member states.  We preserved the opt-in to ensure we would not find ourselves compelled to be party to something we could not be.  For example, there is an EU measure regarding matrimonial property after a divorce.  We have a specific provision in our Constitution relating to divorce.  Accordingly, we cannot automatically be a party to matrimonial property arrangements agreed at European level if they are incompatible with our constitutional article on divorce.  Another reason is our judges do not have investigative functions such as those in France or Italy.  There are areas of criminal law that are simply incompatible between a common law jurisdiction and a continental one.<\/p><p>  The decision is not about the committee endorsing the specific directive and its provisions.  It is about agreeing in principle we should opt in because Ireland should continue to be part of Europol.  The Government has the responsibility to negotiate.  Then there is the accountability to European Parliament.  No instrument can be adopted without the European Parliament&rsquo;s agreement.  We have been doing this for some years.  With every such instrument that I have presented to the committee, when there is an opt-in, I have not asked the committee to adopt it in its final form.  There has not been an instrument that we have opted into which has not been amended and improved through the negotiation process at European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013071700008#H00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1374069000,"counter":599,"content":"<p>This whole process is deeply worrying.

Their concern was that training would suffer if CEPOL were merged into what is a criminal intelligence agency.  In other words, the criminal intelligence aspect of it would be prioritised while the training side would be downgraded.  Personally, I do not believe that would have happened.  However, this is the European Union.  We had detailed engagement with member states on this issue at the June Council meeting that I chaired.  There were a small number of member states which supported the merger.  If I had not been in the chair, I would have equally been supportive of it.<\/p><p>  The Commission argued that a merger into a single agency, headquartered in The Hague, would create synergy and efficiencies.  The overriding concern of member states was that Europol has a particular and important function.  It is not involved in training which CEPOL does.  It was believed that in merging the two, priority would be given to the research and data exchange side.  There was a suggestion to co-locate the two agencies in the one building.

However, we should not forget that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deals with what I describe as State intelligence issues.  There is a crossover.  If our garda&iacute; are dealing with subversives in this country, they would have intelligence on subversives.  People who engage in international terrorism are effectively committing crimes.  They might murder someone or blow individuals up so intelligence or data in these areas is a relevant issue.  In the context of Europol, this proposal does a number of things.  It modernises Europol's data processing structure.  The goal is to enable Europol's analysts to swiftly identify all the links between sensitive data and patterns in criminal activities.  If those criminal activities are terrorist activities, that is intelligence, if one wants to put it another way.  If, as a result of examining sets of data, it can be predicted that someone might blow a dozen people up on the streets of London or that somebody in this country might be assassinated, this is intelligence.  There is no dividing line between police work and intelligence.  Modern police work in this State is based on good intelligence.  Having targeted operations is based on having the intelligence regarding who to target and knowing what they are going to do so one cannot easily divide those things.<\/p><p>  It is important that Europol operates in a manner that is appropriate.  That is why there are data protection provisions in place.  I come back to what Deputy Mac Lochlainn said.  I understand his frustration about this but this is the structure on which the EU is based and on which our engagement is based on the justice side.  It is not within my power to change that structure.  As the Chairman said, the negotiation on this instrument will go on for some time.  On the basis that we opt into it and will be engaged, I am happy if members of the committee came back to us some time in September having further examined this instrument and made suggestions as to improvements that could be made to it.  Obviously, they can be assessed by us in the context of the work we will do in the negotiation process on the instrument.

The current definition states it means a person who is not and never was a practising solicitor or barrister.  I am proposing that the Institute of Legal Costs Accountants will be able to nominate a lay person to the authority under section 8 owing to the relevant expertise a nominee is likely to bring to it.  It is not impossible that such a nominee might previously have been a practising lawyer.  These amendments will allow for formerly practising barristers and solicitors for five years to be considered for nomination as a lay person.<\/p><p>  While it is essential to ensure the authority will not suffer from regulatory capture by the legal professions, I do not think it unreasonable to allow some scope for persons with legal experience in the past but with no ongoing affiliation with the professions to be nominated as lay persons where they have additional expertise.

There is no national standard for cooling-off periods.  For some people who cease to be politicians, there is never a cooling-off period.  I do not know.  People have engagements in different professions but there are certainly people who might at some stage have been practising barristers or solicitors or engaged in other areas of life.  Indeed, one could have a legal cost accountant who in a former life was a practising member of the legal profession but has not been a practising lawyer for many years.  I did not want to entirely close off people who clearly were not practising barristers or solicitors from the possibility of an appointment.  The period of five years is not a magical number.  It arose by looking from a common-sense perspective at what would be an appropriate period of years during which somebody did not practise.  I have no particular emotional or theological attachment to five years.  This engagement gives us an opportunity to reflect on that.  The suggestion is that it be five years.  That is the amendment we are now making.  I have no difficulty with members giving further thought to that if they believe the period should be longer.  I do not think it should be shorter.  There would clearly have to be a gap between someone being a practising lawyer and assuming the possible status of a layperson.  I am happy to say that when we come back on Report Stage, if Members of the Oireachtas have a cogent argument as to why it should be a somewhat longer period, I would be very happy to listen to it.  This seemed a practical number of years.  In the context of former civil servants or Secretaries General in various Departments, there is now an ethical standard that suggests that for a period of time - I cannot recall whether it is one or two years - one does not take up a position that would be in conflict with one's former career.  There are some new provisions relating to Ministers.  If Deputy Collins has a different view, I am happy to engage on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013071700003#B00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1374049800,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Before the Minister moves off that point, it is not under our area of responsibility but there is legislation being discussed and I attended a conference on the Registration of Lobbyists Bill.

Under the guise of laypersons, we do not want it to become top-heavy with lawyers and undermine the balance we have tried to provide, so five years provides a period of time in which somebody would be substantially disconnected from their former life and one would have the layperson-lawyer balance.  That is why I would be reluctant to reduce the period.  It would be an issue of increasing the period if members thought that would be appropriate.  One must remember that this is a regulatory body for the two professions and there is a particular balance we are trying to maintain.<\/p><p>  In respect of Deputy Collins's first question, a regulatory impact assessment for the Legal Services Regulation Bill will be made available in advance of the resumption of Committee Stage after the summer recess.  The issue of the regulatory impact assessment at that time will enable it to take account of the development of the Bill since its initial publication in 2011 and up to this autumn.  Work on the Bill will continue over the summer and on the resumption of Committee Stage, I will be tabling a series of important amendments in respect of the remainder of the Bill.  We want to factor the regulatory impact assessment oversight into that, which is important.  This approach is best to ensure that the regulatory impact assessment is concurrent with the actual progress and contents of the Bill as amended or proposed to be amended rather than simply being out of kilter with its development in being based on the Bill as published.  Doing it this way also shows some respect for the very interesting and varied submissions we have received and for what we propose to take on board.  I hope approaching the matter in this way will also facilitate members of the committee in our further deliberations on Committee Stage.  The alternative would have been to produce an assessment on the Bill as published.  We have gone substantially past that point and this is a better way of dealing with this.  Work is still being undertaken on amendments that have not been finalised and I want what we do to reflect that so members of the committee will understand not simply where the Bill started but where we hope to take it and the backdrop to some of the amendments that are being proposed.  I hope that proves helpful to the committee.<\/p><p>  In the context of what we are dealing with today and without going into the generality of it, we are dealing with a variety of issues on which I think there is a united view on the changes to be made.  It may not be that the exact changes are specifically agreed.  Despite all the controversy generated, I have always been of the view it is very important that there is no doubt about the independence of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  It was never my intention as Minister to be engaged in its day-to-day work or interfere with it but insofar as people had concerns about that, the amendments with which we are dealing today seemed to be relatively straightforward in their intent to copper-fasten the independence issue without having to produce a regulatory impact assessment prematurely to include that when work is still being done on the later sections of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013071700003#B00400","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1374049800,"counter":659,"content":"<p>Clearly we will not get very far today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013071700003#B00500","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1374049800,"counter":660,"content":"<p>This is an important point as it is a challenge for all of us because of the time squeeze and when the amendments have been made available to us.

It is a challenge for us on this side to participate meaningfully and for others beyond the committee who will want to make submissions to the Minister and the Department on foot of the amendments when they are published.  Where are we with the rest of them?  It is not best practice to just publish them in as short a period of time as the first group of amendments.

Unfortunately, in the context of the pressure of work involved between Departments and the Office of the Attorney General, it is often not possible to do it differently.  In the context of where we are at the moment, ongoing work is being done on the amendments and will continue during the summer.  I cannot give a definitive time-frame at the moment but I hope that before we restart on Committee Stage members will have at least a week to see amendments in advance of the resumption of Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  We must always remember that Committee Stage is one part of the process.  We come back on Report Stage and if people consider that amendments have not been adequately teased out or do not have the time to tease them out, we always have an opportunity to revisit issues on Report Stage.  I do not want to constrain it beyond that because having been in this House for many years, it has been rare that one would have Committee Stage amendments published weeks in advance of Committee Stage.  It is not because I want to be unhelpful.  It is simply because the demands and constraints on the Office of the Attorney General mean that I cannot give a definitive date as to when particular amendments will be made available to me.

I appreciate the Minister has moved to deal with the concerns around the independence of the authority but I ask him to go a little further.  My amendments seek a total of 13 members on the authority to give a broader scope.  I do not insist on what I have presented and I acknowledge the Minister has made different additions.  Similar amendments have been tabled by Deputies McGrath and Collins and the Minister.  The number of members should increase to 13 to broaden the scope of the board and of the contributions to it.  I commend the fact that the Minister has dealt with the issue of independence.<\/p><p>  I am also seeking that the chairperson does not necessarily have to be from the lay or legal backgrounds.  The chairperson will be elected by the authority's members.  Reports should be made to the Oireachtas.  I am trying to enshrine the authority's independence in the legislation but I appreciate that the Minister has dealt with that.  However, I only ask to him to increase the number of members to 13 with the composition up for discussion and agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013071700004#C02800","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1374050400,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I strongly endorse Deputy Mac Lochlainn's comments on the membership numbers.

When the Bill was published in 2011, concerns were raised about the issue of how the members of the new authority would be appointed and the independence of that process.<\/p> <p>These concerns emanated largely from the fact that the Bill, as published, drew heavily from standard provisions relating to State bodies whereas the legal services regulatory authority is a different type of entity.  Immediately after publication of the Bill, therefore, I made clear my intention to remove any unnecessary ministerial consents or involvements in the appointment or functioning of the new regulatory authority.  This first amendment makes it a requirement that an Oireachtas resolution be passed prior to the formal appointment of members of the authority taking place.  Those members of the authority are now to be nominated by independent bodies, as we will see in my later amendments.<\/p><p> The device of using D&aacute;il and Seanad resolutions prior to the making of important appointments has other precedents on the Statute Book.  For example, this is how the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is appointed under section 65 of the Garda Act 2005.  It acts as one of a suite of safeguards being proposed in today's amendments by me against the albeit unlikely scenario of any given Government of the day interfering with or arbitrarily interfering with the modalities of nomination and appointment to the new regulatory authority.<\/p><p> With regard to Government amendment No. 11, the original provision at section 8(3) provides that among those members to be appointed to the authority are persons who have expertise in regard to one or more of a range of matters, including the provision of legal services, the maintenance of standards in professions regulated by a statutory body and the needs of consumers of legal services.  The proposed amendment to subsection (3) is a small but important one.  It is based on an advisory counsel's opinion that more specific criteria in regard to eligibility for membership, such that all members must have some of the qualities identified at section 8(3), are required.  The effect of the amendment is that not some but every member of the authority will have relevant expertise.  This was always the intention, so it is a tidying up of that provision.<\/p><p> Government amendment No. 13 amends subsection (4).  It belongs to a suite of amendments that are at the centre of what I would like to achieve here today as they bolster with legal clarity the independence of the authority from Government.  The approach I wish to take has been influenced by written and verbal submissions from the Law Society, the Dublin Solicitors Bar Association, the Bar Council and several other key interested parties from whom we received submissions.  It therefore meets most, if not all, of the concerns that lie behind the similar amendments being put forward by the Opposition today, which closely resemble those proposed by the Bar Council.  We are in agreement, therefore, that a separate nominations process of selecting members to the authority is desirable.  Such a process will allow the new body to be sufficiently independent while ensuring, under the criteria set out in the Bill, the members have the required and relevant experience and expertise.<\/p><p> Deputies will wish to note that, according to section 8(3), members of the authority should have expertise in regard to one or more of the following matters:<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) the provision of legal services;<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) legal education and legal training;<br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) competition law and policy;<br \/>(<i>d<\/i>) the maintenance of standards in professions regulated by a statutory body;<br \/>(<i>e<\/i>) dealing with complaints against members of professions regulated by a statutory body;<br \/>(<i>f<\/i>) business and commercial matters;<br \/>(<i>g<\/i>) the needs of consumers of legal services.<\/blockquote>I kept these criteria in mind while selecting the nominating bodies I believe are best suited to the task of finding the right people for the authority.<\/p><p> There will still be only 11 members of the authority, six of whom will be lay persons and five of whom will be nominees of the legal professional bodies and their close affiliates.  The bodies represent a balance between meeting the representative needs of legal professionals, the needs of consumers of legal services and the needs of an authority which will have both a dedicated research as well as a regulatory function or remit.  The nominating bodies for the lay bodies represent the consumer, academia and the protection of civil, legal and human rights aspects of the authority's remit.<\/p><p> In terms of the non-lay members of the authority, I have borne in mind the fact that there are significantly more solicitors than barristers in the State - a factor of five to one.  First, I have removed my ministerial entitlement to nominate a member of the authority.  Then, rather than simply increase the number of nominees from the Law Society, I have chosen to designate the Legal Aid Board as an additional nominating body and to require it to nominate a solicitor.  In addition, I have reduced the Bar Council's nominees from two to one but I have given the Honourable Society of King's Inns a nominee as a counterbalance, following representations from that body.<\/p><p> The proposed new subsections (5) and (6) are an attempt to ensure gender balance in the context of the new approach to nominations from the regulatory authority.  They are partly based on statutory precedent in the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999, which sets out the requirement for an appropriate gender balance for appointments to the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland.<\/p><p> Having addressed my amendments, I now want to address the Opposition amendments Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, 12 and 14 to 17, inclusive.  I am opposing these amendments on the basis that the issues they address are already being dealt with in the relevant Government amendments.  I want to thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn for acknowledging that we are addressing this important issue of ensuring that no question mark can hang over the independence of the authority when it is up and running.<\/p><p> Practically all of the Opposition amendments have been previously considered as they were submitted pretty well verbatim by the Bar Council in its March 2012 document on proposed key amendments to sections of the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.  I am satisfied the Government's amendments to section 8 put to rest the concerns raised on publication of the Bill regarding the actual and perceived independence of the authority from Government.  I believe the nominating bodies chosen represent a balance between meeting the representative needs of the legal professionals, the needs of consumers of legal services and the needs of the authority.  In addition, section 8 now provides that the members of the authority shall be appointed by Government, but only following a resolution approving such appointment being passed by both D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p> The new section 9, entitled &quot;Term of appointment of members of Authority&quot; reproduces much of section 8(6) to subsection (15) in the published Bill.  The disqualification for office of a member of the authority is now covered in a discrete section 10 and the provisions governing the removal of a member of the authority are now covered in section 11.  In reality, with regard to these sections, there are only very slight differences between the Deputies' suggestions and the amendments that I have tabled.  The drafters have, in preparing the new sections on these issues with my Department, given them renewed clarity of expression.  I would, therefore, urge that the suite of Government amendments in regard to the appointment and other aspects of the new regulatory authority be supported in their entirety in meeting those concerns that have also largely informed the relevant Opposition amendments.<\/p><p> Having said all of that, I want to thank members of the Opposition for the amendments they tabled and for their very constructive engagement with Committee Stage and the manner in which they are approaching the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013071700004#C03200","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374051000,"counter":694,"content":"<p>We are discussing a group of ten amendments.

Why would the President of the High Court be given that role?  This involves lay people who will be appointed by a series of bodies whose engagements are quite clear in the areas of expertise they have.  They are not bodies that are directly part and parcel of the legal profession.  They are separate from it but they should have sufficient expertise to identify appropriate nominees based on the criteria provided.  I am not sure it is appropriate that the President of the High Court be put in a position where he or she must make these decisions.  If the President of the High Court were to make these decisions, there would be no accountability.  I am not suggesting that the current President of the High Court would do anything inappropriate, just as I know when the issue arose as to the modalities of appointments most members did not believe that I would do anything inappropriate in the nomination of individuals, despite some of the brouhaha and allegations made by some campaigning against the Bill who initially did not want an independent legal service authority at all.  We cannot assume that people in the future will always make the right judgments about these things.  One cannot have a situation in which the courts are independent but the President of the High Court would nominate individuals to this body who would not be accountable if they got it wrong at some future date, which is not impossible.<\/p><p>  The Houses of the Oireachtas would have absolutely no role of any description.  Indeed, if they tried to play a role, they would be accused of interfering with judicial independence.  It is crossing the boundary that we should not cross in respect of separation of powers.  I also think that the public wants an assurance that the lay people are nominated without any influence good, bad or indifferent from, if I could put it this way, the legal professions, the Courts Service or the Judiciary in any shape or form.  There has to be a perception of the true independence of our judicial system.  I hope that would not be misinterpreted in any way as to be critical of any member of the Judiciary or the President of the High Court.  It is important that there is a lay nominating process that is separate from our courts system and from the legal professions.  That is why we have travelled this route.  That is why, in circumstances in which people are nominated and ensuring that there is a mix of independence and some oversight, it is correct to adopt the procedure that we have for the Garda Ombudsman Commission, whereby the nominees must be accepted by way of D&aacute;il resolution.  That provides an area of accountability that ensures that the nominating bodies will feel constrained in years to come to abide by the eligibility criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013071700006#E00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1374051600,"counter":699,"content":"<p>The nominating body system is a good one with oversight by the Oireachtas.

The professions themselves have had lay people chairing certain committees on occasion for the same reason.  It is appropriate that the chairperson be a lay person, but I am interested in what the Deputy had to say about the members themselves electing who might be the chair.  There could be problems with this because I would have concerns the body could start off in a divisive way where, for example - and I am not saying this would happen - all of the representatives of the legal profession wanted a particular individual as chairperson but all of the other lay persons other than this individual wanted someone else.  It could sow the seeds of dissension from day one in the manner in which the authority operated.<\/p><p>  In the context of the lay people being independently nominated, it was felt an appointment of one of these as chairperson is an appropriate way to go so there is no lobbying or pressure put on people who have only just met each other, as the first members of the authorities, to determine who should chair.  This could be a matter of considerable difficulty at the start of the body, as a group of people which has just come together may not be able to make a judgment as to who should be the appropriate person to chair.  They may not know each other sufficiently well.  There are inherent difficulties in it being an election process.  It would be different if these were people who had worked together for a long period of time, for example on a committee, and after years working together were going to elect, perhaps by secret ballot or otherwise, who their chairperson should be.  This is a way to ensure no one can suggest the Government is in any way interfering because the nominees are independent of the Government, but an appointment is made to avoid difficulty and dissension with regard to the day-to-day interaction between members of the authority or at meetings because they start off with some God almighty row as to who should chair it.

While people may have different views on different issues I hope the authority will not divide with the nominated members of the legal professions on one side of an argument and all the lay people on the other.  I hope the internal workings will be quite different.  Should there be a difference of opinion ultimately on an issue and a vote is taken, quite clearly the chairman, who will be a lay person, will have a casting vote.

provisions of the Bill.  For drafting reasons, existing subsections of section 8, as published, have been drawn into this new section 9, the side note of which reads: &quot;Term of appointment of members of Authority.&quot;  Two aspects of the proposed section 9 are significant, in that they differ from the published Bill.  First, it has been enhanced, in that it includes a provision for the staggering of appointments.  The staggering of appointments device echoes similar provisions in the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011.  It provides that, at the inception of the authority, five of its new members will be selected by the drawing of lots to have only a three-year renewable term.  All other members will have a four-year renewable term.<\/p><p>  The consequence of the provision is that there will still be a number of experienced members on the authority when the next group of new members are nominated.

These amendments are proposals that have previously been considered, as they were included in the Bar Council's March 2012 submission.  In essence, the amendments seek to provide for oversight of the legal professions rather than direct regulation of the legal professions - they are essentially designed to bring us back to the legislation relating to the legal ombudsman - which is the specific objective of the legislation and is central to this legislation.<\/p><p>  These amendments run counter to Government policy as expressed in the Bill and its provisions for independent regulation of the legal professions.  The Opposition amendments also fundamentally alter the functions of the authority while echoing others.  It should be remembered that the programme for Government, entitled \"Government for National Recovery 2011-2016\", undertakes to \"establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints\".  These are shared commitments under the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland, aimed at removing restrictions to trade and competition relating to the legal professions and legal costs, namely, to establish an independent regulator for the legal professions, to implement the recommendations of the legal costs working group and to implement the outstanding Competition Authority recommendations to reduce legal costs.<\/p> <p>The Bill therefore provides for the independent regulation of the legal professions rather than the supervised self-regulation model that the Bar Council is anchored to and which the Opposition Deputies seem to prefer, notwithstanding the much higher confidence of the public in independent regulation.  This is precisely why an early decision was taken by the Government not to implement the Legal Services Ombudsman Act 2009, which was built on the wrong model of supervised self-regulation.  The point of departure from the policy perspective of this Government is therefore independent regulation and not supervised self-regulation.<\/p><p> At this point I reiterate the continued urgency in the advancement of this Bill.  The updated memorandum of understanding on specific economic policy conditionality for Ireland of 3 June 2013 includes a specific undertaking under the title of legal services reform that once the relevant legislation has been enacted, the authorities would take appropriate measures to establish the legal services regulatory authority in an expedited fashion.  The action is to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2013 for the 13th review under the troika programme.  The June 2013 staff report of the European Commission was critical of the delay and enactment of the Bill and gave the opinion that legal services costs have, for the most part, failed to adjust during the economic crisis, with legal services remaining &quot;sheltered from competition and a drag on the economy's overall competitiveness&quot;.<\/p><p> The recent troika mission to Dublin again emphasised the need to realise the modernisation and reform measures contained in the Bill and the early establishment, on an &quot;open for business&quot; basis, of the new regulatory authority.  The amendments tabled by the Deputy run entirely counter to that.  The proposed Government amendment No. 29 to section 9(2)(<i>a<\/i>) is intended to allow the authority to make recommendations to the Minister following its review of the issues listed in that section rather than leave them gathering dust on a shelf.  Matters such as the admission requirements to legal professional bodies and the availability and quality of education and training opportunities etc. will not be directly under the remit of the authority but will be monitored, and any action that needs to be taken to address any concerns of the authority may be flagged.<\/p><p> I oppose amendment No. 30.  Keeping under review the admission requirements of the Law Society relating to the solicitor profession and that of the Bar Council relating to the barrister profession are important functions of the authority and I do not intend deleting them; otherwise we would be accused of having no measurement of any nature of the state of the legal professions in real time to inform the authority's regulatory functions.<\/p><p> Government amendment No. 31 is proposed with regard to section 9(2)(<i>a<\/i>)(ii), and it responds to a concern about the original drafting formulation voiced by the heads of the law schools and specifically the University College, Cork, faculty of law, which provided the proposed drafting solution.  They were concerned that the provision might result in the authority overstepping the mark between it and aspects of both academic freedom and quality assurance that are enshrined in the Universities Act 1997.  There was also some concern that universities were singled out for mention when there are many other types of education institutions providing legal qualifications.  I am happy to support the amendment as it allays their concerns but does not detract from the authority's foreseen reviewing, in a very general sense, of the availability and quality of legal education.  It is not intended to duplicate the existing academic standards regime with universities or colleges concerned.<\/p><p> Government amendment No. 32 is a minor technical amendment to correct a typographical error.  Proposed Government amendments Nos. 33 and 34 are minor amendments designed to make the authority's monitoring function a little more meaningful by allowing the authority to make recommendations to the Minister.  I draw the attention of Deputies to the importance of the full independence in the manner of operation in the regulatory authority, which is not simply an oversight body with the professions doing the matters themselves.<\/p><p> Deputies may note that the insolvency regulations published for personal insolvency practitioners detail the various professionals who might perform that role, as well as others, and the eligibility criteria, audit oversight mechanisms and issues surrounding indemnity insurance.  With the regulations as published, both solicitors and barristers are among those included as individuals who can operate as personal insolvency practitioners, and their function in practical terms exists between debtors and creditors.  Whatever differences exist between Deputy Niall Collins or Deputy Mac Lochlainn and me with this Bill, we can agree that the function is essentially to mediate between debtors and creditors to see if a debt settlement resolution is possible.  I was surprised to note a report in one of our Sunday newspapers that the Bar Council might intend to block barristers from performing that function, which is contrary to competition and not in the public interest.  If ever we needed an indication that there is a need for an independent regulatory authority to be confirmed, it was done in recent days and we must ensure proper competition in the area.  In fairness to members of the legal profession - both solicitors and barristers - they have the facility to use their skill sets through constrained and limited different business models that currently exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013071700008#G01900","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374053400,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I do not know if the following is the opinion of the Minister or whether he was quoting from a troika report.

We all know how the recession has affected legal practices, with some being closed and others being downsized, with resulting job losses.  In our deliberations we must keep a sense of proportionality, as some high-end or high-profile cases may be reported but under the veneer is an industry that services the country in every village, town and city across Ireland.

There is also an issue of public confidence.  The model we are seeking to implement replicates the approach taken in Australia, although it is not identical, rather than the British model.<\/p> <p>I do not think anyone has sold the British model as an ideal to be adapted in other jurisdictions.  We are a different jurisdiction and should take a different approach.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Mac Lochlainn on one issue.  Let us take the Law Society as an example.  I think it has, in recent years, done what it can do to ensure it has a complaints system that seeks to deal with complaints made in a rigorous fashion.  There is a problem with a professional body determining complaints made about a member of its own profession.  It is the old issue: not only should justice be done, but it should be seen to be done.  There should be no suggestion of bias.  I am not suggesting there is, but there is a public perception of concern.  In the past there have been issues of concern surrounding the manner in which some complaints are dealt with.  I am not going to cast any stones because I do not know whether all of the concerns expressed are right.  Part of the troika's requirements included the implementation of reform.  The Government made a decision that was in the public interest.  It decided there should be independent oversight of the two professions and an independent complaints structure about which no one can raise issues with regard to vested interests or a bias in the decision-making process.  This is the correct way to go.<\/p><p> I regard the process that we are engaged in, because no one has a monopoly of wisdom in these things, as very valuable.  We have had a lengthy consultative process.  I would have liked to commence Committee Stage earlier, but the work that had to be undertaken on the insolvency Bill delayed matters, as the Office of the Attorney General was not in a position to deal with it.  We will continue to tease out issues through Committee and Report Stages.<\/p><p> I believe this model is in the public interest.  It can give public confidence in the manner in which complaints are dealt with, but it is much broader than that.  It looks at other areas relating to the legal professions, including the provision of new business models and what may need to be done to ensure they can have in place any changed or appropriate regulatory structures or codes of conduct.  It looks at a whole range of things that could not happen without having an independent regulatory authority.  If matters were simply left as they are with an oversight body, such as the Legal Services Ombudsman, operating then the only role really would be what has already been done by the professions at present. <\/p><p> This also brings together a unified complaints system that applies to both branches of the profession, the solicitors' profession and the Bar.  In public terms, there is more visibility and understanding of the approach taken by the solicitors' profession than of the Bar.  Obviously, I am familiar with both approaches.  Where complaints are made about members of the legal profession there should be consistency in how they are approached.  Similar issues arise.  I know that there are discrete issues that may presently arise in relation to solicitors that will not currently arise in relation to members of the Bar.  There are other areas where they overlap.  On occasion a complaint may be made by a client about a solicitor and a barrister who are both engaged in one area of litigation and jointly representing a client.  If a complaint is made now, the complaint against the barrister is dealt with under one structure by one particular disciplinary body and that against the solicitor is dealt with under another structure by the solicitors' disciplinary body.  In those circumstances, surely it is in the public interest, and in the interest of the members of the legal profession, to take this course of action, because not all complaints that are made are valid.  Many spurious complaints are made against members of the legal profession who have absolutely done their best for their clients.  On occasion, complaints are made by clients who have not told the full story to the legal professionals representing them and then blame the legal professionals when something goes wrong.  I think a consistency of decision-making on complaints by one body, where the complaints may involve both branches of the profession arising out of one issue, is important.  This structure provides for that.  <\/p><p> Finally, I wish to return to something that Deputy Niall Collins said, which I absolutely agree with.  In the current financial climate there is absolutely no doubt, in recent years, that various solicitors' practices have found themselves in far more difficult financial times than has been the case in the past.  There are many solicitors, in the 2008-10 period, who lost their jobs as firms contracted.  We have - I am open to correction if the figure is wrong - more than 1,000 young solicitors who are unemployed.  Many members of the Bar who are fully and properly qualified are departing the Bar because there is no work available to them.  I am not suggesting that every solicitor earns huge amounts of money.  I quoted the troika, who took an oversight view of fees being charged in, I think, some general and commercial areas.  It rightly or wrongly formed the view, which I was reciting, that legal fees generally in some areas have not decreased.  I am personally aware, as I am sure the Deputies are, of firms that have hit hard financial times and have reduced the charges they issue to clients whom they represent.  I would not want to be misrepresented in any way; I am not suggesting, across the legal professions and solicitors who are in every town and city in this country, that everyone is doing terribly well.  There are many who are not doing well.  There are many in difficulties.  There are young solicitors who cannot get jobs at the moment.

The authority's work programme has three main elements, which are network management, commercial activities, and network improvements.<\/p><p>  Network management includes tunnels, motorways, traffic centres, weather station operations and the like and rehabilitation and renewals work, particularly of pavement, signage, structures and lineage and maintenance.  Network management, particularly as it relates to operations, has grown considerably in recent years.<\/p><p>  Our commercial programme mainly relates to tolling and to public private partnerships, PPPs.  Our tolling business employs hundreds of staff, mainly outsourced, and has almost 1 million account holders.  The most recent developments include compliance with the European electronic toll service directive, which provides for pan-European tag interoperability, the full implications of which are still not entirely clear.  Network improvement activity is very dependent on the funding available to us.<\/p><p>  We discussed the improvements programme when we were before the committee last November so I will not repeat all of the detail.  However, the main funding stream, which covers network renewals such as pavement and bridge rehabilitation as well as improvement projects, has been reduced by about 83% from peak and in fact was halved from 2012 to 2013 alone.  One impact of this is that the funding available for rehabilitation work this year is less than is required to maintain the network in a steady-state condition.  Should the underfunding persist, the cost ultimately will exceed what it would have done to carry out the work in a timely manner.<\/p><p>  A positive development since our last appearance is that we are proceeding with new PPP schemes with the Government having committed to fund the State's costs.  The Newlands Cross upgrade, the dualing of a section of the N11 between Arklow and Rathnew and the construction of an online service area near Gorey have started detail design and construction.  The procurement of the very large Gort to Tuam scheme is well advanced and the procurement of the New Ross bypass and Gorey to Enniscorthy upgrade, which includes the Enniscorthy bypass, is under way.  Unfortunately, the funding being made available to the authority for the coming years is such that there is no scope to undertake other improvement works on the national roads network.<\/p><p>  The authority has always had a significant role in improving road safety and the network improvements in recent years have been enormously successful in reducing deaths and fatalities on the national road network.  In addition to our traditional statutory responsibilities under the Roads Act, there are two EU directives on road safety for which we have been designated primary responsibility &ndash; the tunnels directive and the roads infrastructure safety management directive.  The tunnels directive has been with us for some years, and has been fully implemented for some time.  I am pleased to advise that in this year's programme, we are making excellent progress in implementing the relatively new infrastructure safety management directive.<\/p><p>  We have, as requested, kept these opening remarks brief but will be happy to answer questions as best we can on any particular schemes or indeed on any other matters of interest to the committee.

Public servants are often criticised in this House and outside it, but Mr. Barry is certainly one of those who deserves credit for the way in which he interacts with us.  I am not buttering him up to give him a kick, lest he might fear that.<\/p><p>  The Vice Chairman raised the issue of underfunding.  Can Mr. Barry quantify the gap between what the authority is getting and what it needs to maintain the network to the level at which it just gets by, or what it needs to maintain the network to prevent it from deteriorating to a point at which it costs much more to upgrade?  There was a seven-year rolling programme, possibly for non-national and secondary roads.  It was certainly always the case that local authorities would identify a rolling seven-year programme.  That was extended before without any major impact.  It would be helpful if Mr. Barry could give us some guidance on that.<\/p><p>  I know Deputy Kitt wishes to raise the issue of the Gort to Tuam scheme.  It is a really important part of the need to roll out the Atlantic corridor connecting Limerick and Galway and assisting Galway in its hinterland.

I ask Mr. Barry to consider a further round of discussions and conciliation.  Having spoken to them, I feel they are a very genuine group of people.  They know the road is going ahead, but there is work that can be done.  In the past the NRA has worked with local communities in a way that ensures people are not unnecessarily or inordinately discommoded.<\/p><p> Has the NRA provided the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport with any plan as to the levels of funding it will need to retain the network over the next five years?

The maintenance budget covers day-to-day work such as removing graffiti, grass cutting, etc.  That budget is down on previous years and is less than we or the local authorities would like to see, but if everything in that budget is not done, it is not particularly worrying and we can deal with it.  We are concerned about capital maintenance, the renewal or rehabilitation of elements of the road network that wear out over a period of years.  Pavement is the single biggest of those but it also applies to bridge structures, lineage and other elements of the network.  That renewal work is best done on a continuous cycle before the road begins to break up and serious deterioration occurs.  It is cheaper to do it on a progressive basis, doing preventative work, rather than waiting for it to deteriorate.  For example, if a pavement deteriorates and is left unfixed, water will run into the courses below and eventually one ends up with a much bigger job than if one had replaced the pavement in time.  It is better to do this work at the time, as for any householder it is better and cheaper to maintain their home instead of letting it deteriorate.<\/p><p>  There are no safety implications in the current year with the current spending levels.  We have prioritised the available money and are directing it towards those surfaces where the friction coefficients have deteriorated below thresholds.

There are shades of grey in this.  If we have a few years of the current funding level we will see a reversal of much of the good work done in recent years.  We are in contact with the Department on it.  I appreciate that everybody is looking for money from the Department of Finance and we all understand the Government has to deal with a very difficult situation so we are not raising this issue as a complaint about this year's situation.  We are one of many organisations that could do with more money, but we are flagging the situation because we do not want to sit here in a few years' time with this committee and have people ask why we did not flag that.  The choices being made here have implications.<\/p><p>  On the Gort to Tuam road, the Government announced a PPP stimulus programme around this time last year.  As part of it, the Government committed to pay the State's costs for three road PPPs, one of which was the N17-N18 Gort to Tuam project.  That allowed us to reactivate a competition that had been under way for some time but had not got very far because we did not have the money to pay for the State's input to it.  We have reactivated it and are at a point with the preferred bidder that we are collectively engaged with potential debt-funding organisations.  The PPP funding structure is typically that the promoter of the scheme, the PPP company, puts in a proportion of the costs involved in developing the scheme out of its own money - an equity contribution - and borrows the larger part of the balance from various debt-funding organisations such as domestic and international banks.<\/p><p>  The European Investment Bank usually contributes to Irish PPP schemes and will contribute to this one.  International banks walked away from the Irish PPP market some years ago.  To fully debt-fund the N17-N18 scheme we need to get contributions from offshore banks, because the scale of it is beyond the capacity of domestic banks to fund, although they are participating.  The alternative fall-back plan is that the National Pensions Reserve Fund will commit the balance of the debt funding.  Our first objective is to get the international funding.  Those efforts are under way and we should know by September or October this year whether the balance of the funding can be got from that source.  If not, we will be looking to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700004#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1374050400,"counter":825,"content":"<p>There was a suggestion that this would commence before the end of 2013.

We share the sense of urgency about getting it done, although it is taking time, and we share the view of its importance and necessity.<\/p><p>  On the Newlands Cross flyover, every time we do work, people benefit and people are discommoded.  I would never understate the impact on people who are discommoded, whether landowners, neighbours or others.  I am very sympathetic to anybody who is suffering.  For most people who are badly impacted by a new road there will be compensation measures through some combination of land acquisition or accommodation works.  There are others who do not have land taken but are in the neighbourhood and may suffer from it.  There are no statutory provisions that allow us to make payments to those people.<\/p> <p>This is a planning issue that is much wider than just the NRA but it is rather the same as the planning blight situation which we have talked about previously in this forum, where local authorities might have corridors reserved for a long time, thereby affecting people negatively, and where there is no provision to make payments to those people.<\/p><p> We can only work within the statutory provisions, and the provisions are as they are.

I concur with the remarks of Deputy Dooley about the NRA's availability to attend.  Some of the other semi-State organisations involved in transport would do well to look at how the NRA relates to the committee.<\/p><p>  There is an ongoing issue in regard to subcontractors.  While the NRA might not have a direct input into this, the D&aacute;il yesterday passed the Construction Contracts Bill.  Yet, in the last week, I have taken telephone calls from people involved in the construction of a major national road project in the south who have not been paid and do not look likely to be paid by what appears on the can to be a very reputable company, which gets a lot of work from local authorities that is funded through the NRA and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  To be honest, I believe it is reprehensible that we still have a situation whereby moneys, which Mr. Berry has acknowledged are very scarce, are channelled from the NRA through local authorities or directly to contractors but are not ending up with the people who do the work.  I do not know how comfortably that sits with Mr. Barry or the NRA.  I spoke to a contractor last week who knows colleagues who have not been paid for over 12 months on projects that are finished.  The local authorities and the NRA do not want to know about him - nobody wants to know about him - but the main contractor has been paid.  It seems the main contractor is open for business and free to be contracted again by the NRA and the local authorities.<\/p><p>  There is a moral issue to this scandalous situation.  I have a good mind to name the contractor in question, perhaps not in this forum but in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  At the end of the day, local authorities and the NRA have a moral obligation to try to protect innocent subcontractors who have to try to put food on the table for their families.  These major contractors, which are hoovering up work that the NRA is funding all over the country, are walking around scot free and nobody seems to be taking any initiative to deal with this.  I find that stomach-churning.  I would like to get Mr. Barry's comments on that issue.<\/p><p>  The second issue is one I have raised previously with Mr. Barry.  I am perplexed as to how certain roads are identified for investment and others are not.  To take Limerick, where I am from, it has three major national primary routes which have not had one cent spent on them for the past 20 years - the N21, the N24 and the N69.  The N21 is probably the busiest tourism corridor in the west because it channels practically all of the tourist traffic into and out of Kerry, but nothing is spent on it.  Without taking from it, I would like to know on what basis the New Ross to Enniscorthy road was chosen.  Does it convey more traffic than, for example, the Limerick to Cork road, the Limerick to Waterford road or the Limerick to Tralee road?  Are there criteria by which the NRA selects these corridors for investment?  I would suggest that one area in dire need of investment, and which would show some semblance of joined-up thinking in regard to transport investment, is the road that links the deepest port in the country to the national road network.  However, not one cent has been spent on the N69, certainly in my lifetime, with the exception of taking out a few bins and the like.  Mr. Barry might explain how the PPPs and the capital investment programme that are currently included in the envelope were selected at the expense of other projects.  Cork and Limerick are the two largest urban centres in the west and south and they are linked by a glorified cattle track.  From an economic development point of view, surely that area was more deserving than places elsewhere that do not link the same level of population.<\/p><p>  My final point concerns a perennial issue I have raised with Mr. Barry previously and to which he alluded a short time ago.  Who is responsible for the maintenance of sterilisation orders on land that is not currently attracting any investment and is unlikely to attract it?  I am thinking specifically of the N20-N21 Adare bypass, which has been the subject of jiggery-pokery on more than one occasion in terms of routes being moved at a time when there was money in the country.  Now, there is no money and there is a kind of semi-sterilised corridor.  The landowners are greatly affected and cannot build a henhouse on the land, yet they are told they must go on the never-never to wait for something that might never come.  Who is responsible for the maintenance of that sterilisation order and under what statute are they maintaining it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700005#G00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374051000,"counter":835,"content":"<p>First, with regard to main contractors and payments to subcontractors, I share the views the Deputy has expressed about the moral implications and the immorality of subcontractors not being paid for work done.  I am sure the local authorities would share that view.  However, although we may now have it with the Construction Contracts Bill being passed, what we have lacked is the ability to do anything about it.  I was not aware the Construction Contracts Bill had gone through but I know that, at earlier stages, it included provisions that allowed subcontractors who were not being paid to essentially attach payments going through.  We will ensure, of course, that the Bill as passed gets implemented on road schemes.<\/p><p>  In the absence of that measure, as we have discussed in this committee on previous occasions, the local authority, the NRA and other State agencies have no <i>vires<\/i>, no role or no way of interfering in the contractual relationship between the main contractor and the subcontractors.  One can look at something and say one does not like it and that it is wrong, but one has to have a statutory basis to do anything.  We have not had the statutory basis.  Nonetheless, we will implement the Construction Contracts Bill as passed - I can guarantee the Deputy that.<\/p><p>  On the prioritisation of route corridors and where they come from, over the years the primary prioritisation has come out of national development plans and governmental policies.  For example, the national development plan in 2000 included the basic principles of delivering the motorways between Dublin and the other major cities - it included more detail than that, of course, but that was the genesis of that particular prioritisation.  That development plan was updated and superseded by Transport 21 some years later, which in turn was superseded by the National Development Plan 2007-13.  The strategic prioritisation and, very often, the identification of specific routes comes out of policy documents and policy plans led by the Government.<\/p><p>  Occasionally, we will be given direction on specific routes and we will be given money that is dedicated to advancing specific routes.  Beyond that, the prioritisation is done through the application of the project appraisal rules and guidelines which are published by the Department of Finance and which are added to by the Department of Transport for application as they apply to agencies within the transport family.  Through those, potential schemes are assessed under what one would consider the standard headings, which include economy, safety, environment and so on.  There is a standard framework for evaluation, and it is through it that evaluation of competing projects is done.  Within those, the values that are ascribed to certain aspects are not decided at our discretion within the authority, but we are given values to use.  For example, we are given values to use for the cost of a death or the cost of an accident.<\/p> <p>We factor in those values and carry out those assessments for each project.  Projects such as those currently included in the PPP programme are a very long time in gestation.<\/p><p> With regard to the introduction last summer of the Government's stimulus programme, the range of projects to be selected will be those that have completed or almost completed the statutory processes.  The committee will be aware that getting a project to the point of proposing it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la takes years.  Bringing a project through An Bord Plean&aacute;la can take as little as nine months but in some cases it can be three or four years before a project has completed that process.  For the Government to proceed or for us to propose a project for a stimulus programme, in general we are considering those which are relatively advanced in the programme.  For example, the Gort to Tuam road, the New Ross bypass and Gorey to Enniscorthy were clearly ones that could be delivered.  They had completed the statutory process, they all give very high economic return on the investment and they are all of strategic benefit and not just of local benefit.  The Gort to Tuam road is on the Atlantic corridor, while the Enniscorthy to Gorey road is on the N11.  Connecting Rosslare by dual carriageway as far as Belfast has been a strategic plan for this country for a very long time, and similarly New Ross and the east-west corridor.  There are large volumes of traffic through New Ross and it has large and very costly traffic jams at all times.  There is no question as to whether these are worthwhile projects.<\/p><p> Without wishing to be argumentative, I would take issue with Deputy O'Donovan's suggestion that we have not invested in the Limerick region in recent years.  I direct his attention to the southern ring road, to the Limerick tunnel and the continuation to Ennis.  I am not suggesting that more investment is not needed and I am not discounting-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700005#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374051600,"counter":837,"content":"<p>That was not the point I made.

The approval by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the upgrade to the M50 included a condition that the road authorities in the area must produce a demand management scheme within three years of the road opening.  The third anniversary of the opening of the last section is coming up later this year.  The road authorities are obliged under the planning permission to produce this work.  The road authorities are primarily the four local authorities, Fingal, Dublin city, south Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  The NRA also has a role because it is the road authority for a couple of kilometres on a section of the M50.  We have collectively commissioned this investigation.  It shows a fairly compelling argument that traffic will grow quite considerably on that road as the economy recovers.  There will be a choice in future years either to manage the demand for space on the road or to face considerable congestion.  To manage demand on a road requires engineering measures and smarter travel plans, for example, but the primary method of managing demand is down to fiscal measures, which translates to tolling.  The report is not finalised but we fully agree with the recommendation that there will be a choice in the future between additional tolling and possible variable tolling with higher tolls at peak hours.  Otherwise, the outcome will be a return to congestion on the road.<\/p> <p>There will be no progress in this regard for some time, however, because the Minister has directed that there be no additional tolling during his term in office.  It is not a report that would necessarily have led to immediate action in any event.  It will be published later this year and the analysis will be there for everybody to see and discuss.<\/p><p> The Narrow Water bridge project, which will link counties Louth and Down, is not part of the national road network and we do not, therefore, have any direct involvement.  I understand the likely outturn costs of the project are somewhat higher than initially anticipated.  The construction tenders have been submitted and it will probably be on hold until all of that is sorted out.  I cannot give a more definitive status update because, as I said, it does not come under our remit.<\/p><p> Deputy Dessie Ellis observed that the programme of motorway construction in recent years, linking Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and so on, did not extend to the north west.  We have been catching up a little on the N4 between Dublin and Sligo.  An application in respect of the very bad section of road between Castlebaldwin and Collooney will be going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for approval later this year.  That will tee it up for the future.  It had been intended that the development of the A5 in Northern Ireland would have a significant benefit for Donegal, particularly the north of the county.  We are all aware of the position in regard to that project.  We are not directly involved in it but as it proceeds in the future, we will be engaging with our colleagues in the North in the context of the State funding that will go into it.  We have a very good relationship in general with our counterparts in Northern Ireland.  We meet from time to time to discuss developments generally, as well as co-operating on specific cross-Border issues.  In the case of the A5, for example, there would be a co-ordinated approach in respect of the crossing between Lifford and Strabane.<\/p><p> Planning issues and funding in regard to regional and local roads are outside our remit.  In the case of the additional &euro;50 million allocation, unfortunately we did not see any of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700006#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374052200,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates from the National Roads Authority.  It has been clear over the years that there is sometimes a vast difference between neighbouring counties in terms of their approach to the planning and progression of road development projects.  Deputy Patrick O'Donovan referred to the Limerick situation.  I find it hard to comprehend how Kerry can be 20 years ahead of its neighbouring county when it comes to road infrastructure.  One need only consider the state-of-the-art road from Abbeyfeale and onward into Kerry.  When one crosses the county bounds into Limerick, however, one encounters bottlenecks and various other blockages, including in busy urban areas like Newcastle West and the important tourist town of Adare.  It is quite bewildering.  Likewise, when one crosses the boundary into County Cork, passing through Macroom and proceeding further east, it is the same scenario.<\/p><p>  It is difficult to understand how such discrepancies arise in a small country like ours and why there is not more continuity in terms of the progressive development of infrastructure.  What is the role of the NRA in overseeing and co-ordinating proposals for land acquisitions and other planning issues as put forward by the various local authorities?  Is there a need for more joined-up thinking and action, and does the NRA have a liaison role in that regard?  The discrepancies to which I referred should not be happening on a small island.  Is there already a job of co-ordination for the NRA in this respect or is new legislation required to assign it powers to that end?<\/p><p>  I take this opportunity to compliment the NRA on all its good work in County Kerry, its co-operation with interested parties and allocation of moneys to various projects.  The latest example is the Tralee-Dingle road which only last week saw Mr. Barry paying a visit to the county.  He has been down on several occasions to oversee the launch of a range of very welcome developments which are very important for the county in terms of attracting investment, for the tourism trade and for people who commute between the various towns.  What is the latest information on the further development of the Tralee-Dingle road?  I understand there is an issue with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which Mr. Barry might explain.  I also compliment the NRA on the further progress that has been made in bringing the Tralee bypass project to fruition.  Will Mr. Barry indicate what progress has been made on the acquisition of lands and general progression of the proposed Farranfore bypass and the upgrading of the Tralee-Killarney route?  I understand a funding allocation is due for the Ring of Kerry.  I would like to see investment in that strategic route further enhanced into the future.<\/p><p>  What is the NRA's policy regarding accident black spots?  I understand there is a programme of priority action for such locations around the country.  Will Mr. Barry comment on that?  He may be aware of the stretch of road between the towns of Castlemaine and Milltown which has seen 30 incidents in recent years, the most recent last week at a place called Cluainmore.  I have been in contact with Mr. Barry on this issue, as well as Mr. Noel Brett of the Road Safety Authority and Kerry County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700007#J00200","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1374052200,"counter":844,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy that we are under pressure of time and there are several members waiting to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700007#J00300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1374052200,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I urge that funding be provided to address this particularly hazardous black spot.

Notwithstanding his response to Deputy Dessie Ellis, Mr. Barry will not be surprised that I intend to focus on the north west.  He mentioned a particular black spot on the N4 in Sligo.<\/p> <p>Has money been ring-fenced for the improvement of that stretch of road or is the NRA awaiting the outcome of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la process?  Another road about which I am concerned and to which I am sure Deputy Michael Colreavy will also be referring is the N16.  What, if anything, is happening with this road?<\/p><p> I have every sympathy for Deputies Tom Fleming and Patrick O'Donovan, particularly as my wife comes from Castletownbere.  I fail to see why there has not been any development of the link road to the town.  I was astonished to read recently that plans for a bypass of the area had been withdrawn.  I do not know what happened in that regard but perhaps Mr. Barry might comment on the issue.<\/p><p> I referred to the issue of road maintenance at our previous meeting with the NRA.  At that meeting Mr. Barry expressed some concerns about the amount of funding that would be available in the next two to three years to ensure the great work done in developing the road network would not go to waste and that all routes would be maintained.  Is he satisfied that the message in this regard has got through to the Government and that the budget for maintenance will be sufficient in the coming years?  There was some discussion in recent months to the effect that the Government might be releasing moneys for capital investment projects.  Is the approach of the NRA in this regard proactive or reactive?  Does it have a wish list ready?  I do not believe it does because it must react to what occurs.<\/p><p> Last night on the Adjournment in the Seanad I raised the issue of the invasive weed Japanese knotweed.  This came about as a result of a letter to a national newspaper from a woman in County Kerry who stated this ubiquitous weed was proliferating at quite a rate and damaging the environment as a result.  It is an extraordinary weed which just seems to grow continually and there is a particular method for eliminating it.  I understand the national road network is subject to intrusion by this weed.  Does the NRA deal with Japanese knotweed in a way which ensures the environment will not be damaged?  Great work can be done in maintenance, but this weed can undermine entire stretches of road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700007#J00600","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374052800,"counter":849,"content":"<p>Is it correct that we each have three minutes in which to ask four questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700008#K00200","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1374052800,"counter":850,"content":"<p>Members have two minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700008#K00300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1374052800,"counter":851,"content":"<p>To what extent do health and safety policies and practices, signage, etc., contribute to the cost of projects?  Will Mr. Barry provide a percentage figure in this regard?  Has the NRA calculated the amount of money which comes back to the Government in VAT returns, etc.?<\/p><p>  The second matter about which I am concerned relates to the NRA's role in the tendering process for road improvements or realignments.  What discretion does the authority have in this regard?  My specific concern is that companies from outside the jurisdiction, workers of which are paid less than their counterparts in this country, would be at a competitive advantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> Irish companies.  Is the NRA allowed to take into account as part of the process of awarding contracts the need to retain existing jobs and create new ones in this country?  How does Ireland's cost per kilometre for realignment compare with that in other EU countries?  To what extent has this cost either decreased or increased since 2009?<\/p><p>  As Senator Paschal Mooney predicted, I very much welcome the work on the N4 between Collooney and Cloonamahon.  There are 30 white crosses at various locations along the side of that road and we never want to see a 31st being erected.  The N16-A4 route is a national disgrace.  Successive Governments have promised to take action on this road which runs from Belfast to Sligo and Galway and is completely not fit for purpose.  I understand special EU funding is available for cross-border routes under the TEN-T programme.  Such funding would allow the authorities in the Six Counties to bypass Enniskillen and it could also be spent on upgrading the N16.  However, the NRA's website indicates that the N16 Glenfarne to Blacklion and Glenfarne to Glencar realignments and the Sligo to Glencar project have been suspended.  I am at a loss to understand what is happening in this regard.  The previous Government, which held two of the three seats in the constituency, one of which was occupied by a Minister of State, promised that these projects would proceed.  The position is the same with the current Administration, which also holds two of the seats in the constituency and, again, one of them is occupied by a Minister of State.  However, no one seems to be taking the N16 project seriously.  That is simply not good enough because the route is a national disgrace.  I probably should be criticising the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in this matter as opposed to anyone else.  Unfortunately, as he is not present, Mr. Barry must be the subject of my ire.  If the criteria relating to this matter include traffic flows and the cost multiplied by the number of deaths and accidents, it is logical that traffic travelling from Belfast to Sligo will use a longer but better route.  The self-fulfilling prophecy in this context is that if that happens, the N16-A4 will just disappear off the map altogether.  That would be neither right nor just.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700008#K00400","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1374052800,"counter":852,"content":"<p>The Deputy's point is well made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700008#K00500","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374052800,"counter":853,"content":"<p>If I may, I would like to say a little more about the major programme in the context of where we stand on projects more generally because this answer would be repeated in response to specific questions on certain projects.  As stated, from last year to this funding levels have been cut by approximately 50%.  This cut is accommodated not simply by reducing capital maintenance-type activities but also by greatly reducing the funding available for new build and improvement projects.  Members may recall that when I came before the committee in November, I indicated that last year quite a number of smaller local improvement schemes were under construction throughout the country.  These projects have either been completed or will be during the remainder of this year.  They are not going to be replaced by new schemes under construction because the funding does not permit this.<\/p><p>  On many of the routes mentioned, including that from Limerick to County Kerry, the N16, etc., I would like to take members back to the strategic programme that was Transport 21.  I accept that it first appeared some years ago, but it set out that the NRA, with funding from the Government, was charged with upgrading or building the strategic infrastructure network in the first instance.  This involved developing inter-city motorways such as the M3, constructing the Waterford bypass and various other projects.  The work to which I refer constituted the first phase of Transport 21 and it was intended that as these projects were delivered, we would move on to address the many problems affecting the remainder of the primary road network and the national secondary road network.  However, as we approached the end of the development of the strategic motorway network, funding ran out.  As stated, we understand we are not being picked on in this regard, but our funding has been significantly reduced year on year in the interim.  Consequently, we have not been able to proceed with other projects.  In the context of the N16 and the projects in west Limerick on which work is not proceeding, I must inform members that virtually all major projects have been suspended.  The exceptions are those projects which are funded by private finance through public private partnerships.  There are a number of such projects and they are advancing.  Unless there is a change in our funding position, we will not be taking any major scheme, regardless of whether it relates to the N16 or some other road, to construction in the next couple of years.<\/p><p>  Huge investment was made in roads in County Limerick.  However, most of this was in roads in Limerick city, in the first instance, and connections from there to places such as Dublin, etc.  We had moved on to trying to address some of the problems between Limerick and County Kerry, but An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused us permission to build the Adare bypass.  We did not withdraw our application in that regard; it was actually An Bord Plean&aacute;la which refused permission and it stated the construction of the Adare bypass was interconnected or linked with the construction of the M20 from Limerick to Cork.  Limerick County Council applied for permission to proceed with the Adare bypass as a stand-alone scheme.  This application was submitted at the same time as that for the M20 upgrade.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la took the view that when the application relating to the latter scheme was withdrawn, it would not grant permission for the Adare bypass.<\/p> <p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la has given its decision and there is not much that we or Limerick County Council can do about it.  That is not to say there will not be other ways of addressing traffic problems in west Limerick, but without funding, nothing is going to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700008#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374053400,"counter":855,"content":"<p>What is the position on the Macroom bypass?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700009#L00200","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374053400,"counter":856,"content":"<p>It has been with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for some time.

Infectious weeds are dreadful and they are everywhere.  The funding from the National Roads Authority goes to the local authorities.  However, as of this year the NRA is taking direct responsibility for the maintenance and operation of the dual carriageway and motorway network.  With our contractors, we will be tackling infectious weeds on the dual carriageway network.  I agree with the constituent who spoke to the Deputy that some of the weeds are very invasive and extremely difficult to deal with and if they are not dealt with, they can lead to long-term problems.  We will tackle the issue.  The National Roads Authority will work on the problem on the dual carriageway network, while local authorities will manage it on the single carriageway network.<\/p><p>  I cannot give an answer on the health and safety policy contribution to project costs.  Safety issues, in particular, give rise to much of the work we do, but I cannot give a figure for how much one could attribute to health and safety issues.  VAT on design and build work is payable at a rate of 13.5% and 23% on services.  That is the proportion of our budget that goes in VAT payments.<\/p><p>  On tendering processes and levels of discretion, typically, the processes used in tendering are set by ourselves and the Government Contracts Committee, in particular, which gives the standard forms of contract and conditions of contract to which we all work.  Individual competitions are run, usually by panels, to avoid bias and make sure everything is transparent and above board.  It is illegal to discriminate against entities simply because they are from outside Ireland, if they are from within the European Union.  Part and parcel of our EU membership is that businesses and companies from other EU countries can do business here, just as Irish companies do such a great job in doing business in other countries.

The issue is perhaps not so much the minimum wage but the registered agreements.  We engage in an audit activity for national road projects to make sure contractors are making their pension payments for their workforce and that they are paying in accordance with the registered agreements.  The recent decision that the registered agreements are unconstitutional throws this up in the air a bit and I am not quite sure how it will work out in the future.  I expect a broad direction to be given by the general Government contracts committee to the public sector on how to deal with the issue.<\/p><p>  On costs in this country versus those in other EU countries, it is very hard to judge costs for minor improvement works, but we have data for the cost per kilometre for motorways and Ireland is one of the lowest cost countries in Europe.  The delivered cost per kilometre for motorways in Ireland is well below the typical cost in other countries.  It is even well below the cost in eastern European countries where they have much lower labour costs, but, nonetheless, the industry in this country has become extraordinarily efficient.

They have met the bypass group on countless occasions, the Minister and before that my father also.  I understand the NRA will this week select a consultant who will put together the management plan, taking into account the report produced on foot of the Minister's request.  Where do the delegates wish to see this go?  Specifically, is there a timeframe in which they would like the management plan to be drawn up?  Who will be the consultant?<\/p><p>  Mr. Barry can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand the NRA can make an application for a road project.  Is this something it has examined?  Would it consider making the application for the bypass?  The project has been refused permission previously and a second refusal would be detrimental to the project, but having the NRA behind us would lend stronger support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700010#M00200","speaker":"1180"},{"type":"speech","time":1374054000,"counter":873,"content":"<p>On a peripheral issue, Senator Michael Comiskey asked me to mention the N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin and the N16 Manorhamilton to Enniskillen projects.

We realise that is not possible in the current economic climate.  However, I am here to talk about another issue.  <\/p><p>  I am a Donegal man.  I welcome Mr. Barry and Mr. O'Neill.  I will not give them the Donegal single transferable speech, namely, that it is the forgotten county and that we get nothing, but the work the NRA has done in linking the major intercity routes has been fantastic.  As a Donegal man, I have no problem acknowledging this because the motorways from Dublin to Cork, Limerick, Galway and Belfast are phenomenal infrastructural projects.  In County Donegal the infrastructural work done on the Clar Barnes route, the bypass in Donegal town, the N56 and the Derry to Letterkenny road has to be acknowledged.  I also acknowledge the strong working relationship between Donegal County Council and the NRA.<\/p><p>  The next chapter will be exciting and Mr. Barry alluded to it in terms of the strong working relationship the NRA has with the Roads Service in Northern Ireland.  Great work is being done on the proposed joint working relationship on the Lifford-Strabane bridge.  The key desire for people living in the north west concerns the ambitious but realistic project of linking Letterkenny with Dublin.<\/p><p>  Mr. Barry and my colleagues mentioned the A5, in respect of which there is an Executive commitment at Stormont.  I am not asking Mr. Barry to comment on this, as it is an internal consideration.  That the habitats directive was not complied with is a disappointment.  Mr. Barry will not be commenting on this either, but I hope there will not be a further delay and that the project will be fully realised.  The disappointing aspect is that the momentum was interrupted and the word on the street is that the project has been shelved, but I know it has not been; rather, it has been delayed.  We must work jointly on it.<\/p><p>  We need to have a construct around a single-tier plan.  I do not know if the proposal is on Mr. Barry's desk yet, but we have a proactive Donegal national roads design office, NRDO, which is willing to consider designing a route from Aughnacloy to Dublin in collaboration with the Westmeath roads design office.  This is not to be parochial in terms of the north west or County Donegal; rather, it is about being able to get into one's car on a Tuesday afternoon and travel to Dublin in two and a half hours without having to drive at speeds of 40 to 50 km\/h, as is currently the case.  I ask the NRA to examine ambitious and realistic plans in Donegal County Council where the NRDO is looking to work in partnership with others to develop the route between Aughnacloy and Dublin, because it will not be acceptable to have a good infrastructural link between Strabane and Aughnacloy and not to have a complementary route between Lifford and Letterkenny and Aughnacloy and Dublin.  Bypasses have been built.  There is a two-plus-one carriageway at Castleblayney, but it is still not acceptable when one sees what is happening between Limerick, Galway, Cork and Belfast and Dublin.  It will not be acceptable to have two-plus-one carriageways.  We must be ambitious.  While I accept we must be realistic, this is about reconstructing an infrastructure on the island that was in place decades before us with reference to the Victorian railway lines.  This is the post-Victorian rail period and we are looking at reconstructing the island.  There are gentlemen in this room involved in the peace process, with me, and they have attended the Joint Committee on the Good Friday Agreement.  The peace process is not just an aspiration; it is about reuniting our people, in which roads infrastructure has a role to play.  Mr. Barry's organisation has an exciting role to play and I look forward, through the Joint Committee on the Good Friday Agreement, to working with him.  I ask him to examine the plans and proposals on the table from Donegal County Council and also the NRDO in County Donegal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700010#M00500","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1374054000,"counter":876,"content":"<p>A question was raised at a previous meeting by Senator Terry Brennan, who is not present, about lighting on motorways.  If I am interpreting him correctly, he stated there was more lighting on motorways than anywhere else in the country.

Mr. Barry might address that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700010#M00600","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374054000,"counter":877,"content":"<p>Certainly.  Deputy Michael P. Kitt asked if I would write to him on the points raised by him.  I will do so.<\/p><p>  Regarding the N17 and N18, the use of the word \"could\" in the letter to the Deputy should be taken as no more than the normal caution.  Regarding a three and a half year construction period, the contractor will be entitled to take up to three and a half years to build it, but we all hope he will do it faster than this when the time comes.<\/p><p>  On the Slane bypass, Deputy Helen McEntee should be aware that, with Meath County Council and the people of Slane, we are very unhappy about the traffic situation in Slane, both from a safety point of view and also for the town.  Far too much traffic is passing through it.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la rejected the original planning application, essentially on the grounds that the proposed road would be visible from Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne.  Consequently, the bypass would only be allowed if there was no appropriate alternative available.  It was not satisfied that there was no appropriate alternative available.  It referred in its commentary to tolling and traffic management plans.  It acknowledged that it had no role in implementing traffic management systems and regional transport policy, but, nonetheless, it stated something along these lines would have to be done.  It made the valid point that some of the traffic problems in Slane resulted from traffic diverting from other routes to avoid tolls.  We have since explored the extent of this problem.  It is not news to anybody that that is the case, but we have concluded that adding tolls on the N2 would help to alleviate the congestion in Slane.<\/p> <p>It could take up to 40% of the heavy goods vehicles out of Slane, which would be a significant contribution.  I appreciate that there is no desire to introduce new tolls, but it is a possibility.<\/p><p> Meath County Council is planning to produce a traffic management plan for Slane, for which much of the fundamental analysis has been undertaken.  We have undertaken some of it, while the council has also carried out some of it and the data are available.  The council will produce a traffic management plan and it will be for it to decide whether to implement such a plan, perhaps on a trial basis to see if it would work.  I cannot see any basis for going back to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and stating, \"We told you before that a traffic management plan would not work and you did not accept it, but we are here again saying the same thing.\"  We would just get the same answer from it.  That would not work very well in achieving the end objective.  Therefore, the council will develop the traffic management plan, but I do not know what its timelines are.  I imagine it will take months rather than years, but it will develop the plan.  It is not up to the NRA which has no role in deciding whether the council should implement it.  That is between council officials and councillors there.  If the traffic management plan requires extraordinary measures that would not normally be allowed on a national road, we will co-operate and offer support, given the difficult and unusual circumstances involved, but we will see how that unfolds.  The NRA could certainly make a direct application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but the same considerations would apply.  We were clear on the last application and if there is a future application through Meath County Council, we will be clear that the NRA is supportive of it, but Meath County Council must go through the other steps before we can get to that point. <\/p><p> We will certainly look at any proposal coming from our good friends in the regional office in County Donegal.  It is an outstanding office which does great work.  We will examine what can be done there.  A lot of good work has been done on the Lifford to Letterkenny connection and the crossover from Lifford to Strabane has been approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In addition, some work has been done on the Aughnacloy to Dublin corridor.  I understand what was said and eventually it will be a full corridor.  Earlier the committee heard all of my comments on the status of major schemes generally.  We do not have too many major schemes in planning and development.  We are unlikely to add a major development to the planning stream until such time as there is some prospect of being able to deliver it beyond that point.  However, we will talk to the regional office constructively to see what it has in mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700010#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374054600,"counter":879,"content":"<p>Once a project goes through the planning process and if planning permission is granted, is there a time period within which the work must be commenced or completed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700011#N00400","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374054600,"counter":880,"content":"<p>There is a time period in which the notice to treat must be issued and the land formally taken into ownership by whoever has received approval for the CPO.

Therefore, one could have An Bord Plean&aacute;la's approval for a project and one would be required to exercise the CPO and start compensating landowners within a time period commencing within the 18 months or so, but it is fairly open ended as to when construction would start.  There is a benefit in having projects pass through the planning process, even before the money is made available to build them, in that there is not such a huge time lag because it triggers a series of events.  The procurement process for a major design-build project takes about 12 months; therefore, one has to have projects through the planning process.  When people talk about projects being ready to go, it means being ready to go in about 12 months time.  It is a long process, but that is the position.<\/p><p>  As regards lighting, like everybody in the State, the NRA is examining ways to save on energy costs.  We have investigated a range of alternative initiatives to make energy savings on the road network.  We are implementing a number of pilot schemes with four local authorities to assess the benefits and their suitability for broader application across the network.  We are using communications technology to allow control and monitoring of lighting to deal with the issue of lights being on 24 hours a day.  We are also examining the use of LED lighting and a range of other measures, including wind power generation.  From these will come measures that will reduce energy usage on the motorway network.  It is a slow process because one must undertake a pilot project and examine the results.  Many measures that reduce energy usage come with a high capital cost and very long payback periods.  At a time when we are struggling to find money to carry out more fundamental work, we will probably be slow to divert significant capital to such measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700011#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1374054600,"counter":883,"content":"<p>However, there is potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071700011#N00800","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374054600,"counter":884,"content":"<p>There definitely is potential.
