","asker":"1066","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":7,"content":"<p>I am keenly aware that the expenditure reductions in this Budget will impact on some social welfare recipients. However, the lower adjustment of &euro;226 million, rather than the &euro;440 million originally requested of the Department means I have protected the weekly social welfare payments upon which people depend as well as crucial supplementary payments such as the Fuel Allowance, the Electricity\/Gas Allowance, Free Travel, the Half-Rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and the Respite Care Grant.  Child Benefit rates have also been protected in this Budget.As part of the Budgetary deliberative process, the Department has analysed, in so far as possible, the distributive and poverty impact of possible welfare changes to all welfare recipients including different family types including those with children.   The Department is now preparing an analysis of the Budget 2014 tax and welfare packages.  This Social Impact Assessment will include an analysis of the distributive and poverty impacts of these changes on different family types as well as the impact on at risk of poverty levels.  I will be examining the analysis when it is finalised and I will publish it in due course. <\/p><p>  As I have already outlined, Budget 2014 continues the process of repairing the public finances while protecting the welfare safety net and providing a pathway back to work for jobseekers.<\/p><p>  The principal reason I have been able to protect these crucial welfare supports is the Department&rsquo;s role in helping people back to work, which in turn has seen the Live Register fall.  Getting people back to work is the most effective way of reducing welfare expenditure &ndash; and we are doing it.  Every 10,000 we help off the Live Register saves around &euro;90 million in welfare expenditure per annum. But more importantly the best route out of poverty is through employment.<\/p><p>  Since coming to office, I have focused on transforming the Department from the passive benefits provider of old to an active, engaged and focused employment service which is helping people to avail of education and training opportunities and ultimately to get back to work. <\/p><p>  This work continues apace and the increase in the number of people in the workforce proves that this approach, combined with the work of my colleagues in Government, is bearing fruit.<\/p><p>- The numbers in work rose by 33,800 in the year to the second quarter of 2013.<\/p><p>- The Live Register is down by 20,000 over the past year, and will shortly fall below 400,000 for the first time since May 2009. <\/p><p>  Next year, the Department will spend &euro;1.08 billion on work, training and education places and related supports for jobseekers &ndash; an increase of almost &euro;85 million on our projected spend this year.<\/p><p>  During Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU Council, I oversaw negotiations on the Youth Guarantee, which will be introduced across Europe from next year. <\/p><p>  The Guarantee will be a youth employment stimulus, offering good-quality work, training and educational opportunities for young people. <\/p><p>  This budget will help more people back to work, reduce the overall welfare spend as part of the sustained effort to repair the public finances, and ensure the safety net remains firmly in place for those who need it most. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700050#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code Review","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700050#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[43333\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700050#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views that there are anomalies in the family income support system; if she has any plans to rectify these; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>The family income supplement (FIS) is an in-work income support for employees with families on low earnings, who otherwise might be at risk of financial poverty.

Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.<\/p><p>  The &#8220;hours worked&#8221; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996.  Further reducing the &#8220;hours worked&#8221; requirement would have expenditure implications.  It is also important that FIS does not inadvertently subsidise unsustainably low earnings or encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment.   Creating jobs and reducing unemployment are key challenges facing the Government.  The tax and social protection systems have a part to play in addressing these issues and in ensuring work is remunerative.  To this end, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience in order to address a number of specific issues.  The Group is currently examining the issue of working age supports.  In this regard the Group is considering how employment incentives might be improved.  Among the issues being examined by the Group is the role in-work supports, such as FIS, should play in facilitating people to move from welfare into work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700050#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Eligibility","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700050#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[43680\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700050#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will justify the rationale in changes to community employment schemes which has resulted in for example, golf clubs having to let go staff where there was a strong history of training and subsequent employment.

The expenditure on the OFP scheme was &euro;1.06 billion in 2012 and is estimated to be &euro;935 million in 2013.  Currently 36% of OFP recipients are employed.  Despite significant levels of state spending on one-parent families, the results have been poor in terms of tackling the poverty and social exclusion among them.  The on-going reforms to the OFP scheme are predicated on activation and on getting people back into the workforce once their children have reached an appropriate age.     The reforms aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to participate in education and training, enter the workforce and, ultimately, attain financial independence.<\/p><p>  When  lone parents reaches the end of their entitlement to OFP as a result of the reforms, there are a number of income support options available to them.  These include Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) and Family Income Supplement (FIS).  If the individual moves to the JA scheme they then have access to the full set of Intreo services to assist them to develop their skills and enter employment.  If they are entitled to the FIS, this payment incentivises them to retain or increase their employment.<\/p><p>  In order to ease the transition to the new payment structure for lone parents with young children, a special Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance transition arrangement was put in place in July 2013.  This exempts previous OFP recipients with children under 14 years of age from certain conditionality within the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance scheme, including the requirement to be genuinely seeking and available for full-time work.  Recipients of Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance under this transition arrangement are required to engage with the full Intreo services to help them prepare for employment, while balancing their caring responsibilities.

Energy poverty is a factor of income, energy prices and the thermal efficiency of the home.  The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to improve the thermal efficiency of the home.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme (BEWH), administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), funds energy efficiency improvements in the homes of the elderly and vulnerable, making the homes more comfortable, healthier and more cost effective to run.  The Department is working with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other Departments and agencies on the implementation of the Energy Affordability Strategy.<\/p><p>  We had many difficult choices to make in the recent Budget.

These allowances are paid as a contribution to the energy costs of the household.  They are not intended to meet these costs in full.<\/p><p>  This year we will spend over &euro;182 million on the free electricity\/gas allowance for over 410,000 customers.  In addition, some 410,000 customers will also receive the fuel allowance of &euro;20 per week for the winter months (26 weeks) from October to April, at a cost of &euro;223 million. Over 200,000 customers receive both the electricity\/gas allowance and the fuel allowance from the Department, contributing &euro;940 per household towards their energy costs.<\/p><p>  The fuel allowance is paid to long-term jobseekers and one-parent family payment recipients as well as people in receipt of disability allowance, invalidity pension and some people in receipt of the State pension.

Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  In the case of new entrants or persons changing from one type of farming to another the assessment looks at all expected annual income and is based on normal output and costs appropriate to items such as normal stock levels, capacity, and market trends.<\/p><p>  It may be noted that payments received under the Agri-Environment Options Scheme or Special Area of Conservation schemes are assessed separately from other farm income.

The General Register Office, which administers the Civil Registration Service, has identified areas where legislative amendments are required to streamline the service to the general public.

In general, where persons do not qualify for social insurance benefits they may claim means tested social assistance payments. For example, any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker's benefit may claim means tested jobseeker's allowance.

The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.  The State pension age will then increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age. This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.   State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Overtime, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.<\/p><p>  However, the Deputy may wish to note that  a significant number of people coming on to State pension (transition) in 2012 did not come from work as many were already on other social welfare schemes.  In December 2012 there were approximately 14,400 State pension (transition) claims in payment and of those, 12.5 per cent came from work with over 50 per cent coming from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseekers benefit and assistance, invalidity and carers, indicating that significant numbers of people are leaving the workforce for a variety of reasons well in advance of State pension age.<\/p><p>  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65,  all short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  Each application for any social welfare scheme is assessed on its own merit in terms of qualifying criteria and contribution history. Where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions including a means test.<\/p><p>  Further consideration is being given to the position of those exiting the workforce before pension age.<\/p><p>  It should be noted there is no statutory compulsory retirement age for employees in Ireland.  Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer\/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  However, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000\/78\/EC, which prohibit work-related discrimination on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down by employers within the context of national law, whether by contract, custom and practice or other means, which must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim, with the means of achieving that aim being both appropriate and necessary.  Consideration of these issues as they relate to enterprise and equality policy come within the respective remit of the Minster for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  An interdepartmental Working and Retirement Group was initiated to consider the cross departmental policy issues arising and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of pensions systems.  The interdepartmental group, established in August 2012, is chaired by the Department of Social Protection, and includes representatives from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Pensions Board.

Poverty impact assessment is the process by which Government departments, local authorities and state agencies assess policies and programmes at design, implementation and review stages in relation to the likely impact that they will have or have had on poverty and on inequalities which are likely to lead to poverty, with a view to poverty reduction. In line with this requirement, the Cabinet Handbook states that memoranda for Government involving significant policy proposals should &quot;indicate clearly the impact of the proposal on groups in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty&quot;. Official guidelines for poverty impact assessment are available on the Department's website (). The Social Inclusion Policy Division provides assistance to Government Departments and other bodies on the application of the guidelines. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of individual Government Departments and other bodies to adhere to the guidelines.

This merger facilitated the redesign and reconfiguration of services so as to improve the quality of service the Department provides to jobseekers and employers. In particular, it enables the Department to ensure that jobseekers registering for income supports have earlier access to employment services <\/p><p>  The development of closer links with employers as a means of securing work opportunities to which jobseekers can be referred is another key aspect of the transformation agenda.

This includes case officers regularly calling to employers promoting employer services such as Jobs Ireland, JobsPlus, JobBridge and job matching supports and attending employers networking events in the Kerry area.  Local management also have Local Employment Services and associated Partnerships in Kerry promoting these services and supports.  A further avenue of services promotion is through locally organised Job Fairs, the most recent of which was held in Killarney in May 2013. <\/p><p>The Department's new Intreo service is a one stop shop for all income and employment support services for our jobseeking customers.  The Intreo service in Killarney commenced in January of this year and the service has also has been partially introduced in Tralee and Listowel and it is intended to have it further rolled out in these towns and in Cahirciveen and Kenmare by the end of the year. Local Intreo services continuously promote local vacancies to unemployed clients and carry out matching to alert clients to suitable vacancies. Department staff also progress unemployed clients to education and training programmes to better enable them compete for job vacancies as they arise.   The Department's work schemes such as Community Employment, TUS and Gateway are also providing key interventions and supports to enable long term unemployed prepare to progress into full time training and job placement.<\/p><p>  In order to ensure a quality service for jobseekers and employers, the Department is in the process of developing its current Jobs Ireland web service.  It is intended that that the new system will provide enhanced online employment services for jobseekers and employers allowing employers to advertise their vacancies and search for jobseekers while all jobseekers will be able to search for vacancies, training and to create an online profile that will allow the jobseeker to demonstrate their relevant skillsets and experience to prospective employers. The option of making registration with this online service compulsory for all jobseekers who are in receipt of a welfare payment and are deemed 'job ready' by the Departments case officers is under consideration and is being catered for in the development of the new system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700052#WRC00600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Eligibility","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700052#WRC00650"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[43132\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700052#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to introduce measures to enable persons in receipt of carer's allowance to participate in community employment schemes or training courses provided by her Department in view of the limitations on carer's in pursuing further education, training or employment.","asker":"1020","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>There are certain conditions placed on persons in receipt of carer's allowance.

It was also decided that payments of the Youth Employment Initiative will be front-loaded and all monies provided for this purpose will be allocated to measures undertaken in 2014 and 2015.The exact allocation of this funding between countries is yet to be determined. The Department of Social Protection is leading an inter-departmental group to develop an implementation plan for Ireland and we expect to submit this plan to the EU commission before the end of this year.   For Ireland this plan will likely require that we:<\/p><p> - Earmark a quota of additional places\/opportunities for young people on existing schemes.<\/p><p> - Vary the eligibility conditions for access to certain schemes by young people - for example reduce the eligibility criteria so that young people can access places\/opportunities after 4 - 6 months of unemployment rather than the general requirement of 12 months unemployment.<\/p><p> - Expand the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.<\/p><p>  At present we spend circa &euro;170m per annum on employment, training and further education programmes for young people. The type of actions set out above will inevitably involve some increase in the level of expenditure on programme take-up by young people.  As an initial step towards preparing for implementation of the guarantee, provision was made in this week's 2014 Budget for:<\/p><p> - reducing the threshold (in terms of duration of unemployment) for JobsPlus eligibility from 12 months - to 6 months or less - in the case of persons aged less than 25 years,<\/p><p> - an additional intake of 1,500 young people on to the very successful JobBridge scheme,<\/p><p> - ensuring that 1,000 places on the  T&uacute;s scheme are targeted at young people,<\/p><p> - developing a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job,<\/p><p> - ring-fencing a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the successful Momentum programme that operated in 2013, with income support for participants being provided by my department,<\/p><p> - the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation making funds available to young entrepreneurs via Micro finance Ireland and other business start-up schemes.<\/p><p>  In total, the provision across these headings in the 2014 Budget comes to about &euro;46 million.  Given the scale of existing and future provision it is clear that the bulk of funding for labour market programmes for young people will continue to come from domestic exchequer sources.

Accordingly, it incorporated a number of  conditions into the scheme to minimise any such impacts including; placing a cap on the total number of interns that can be hired by any one organisation;  placing limits on the duration of internships; including a cooling off period so that organisations cannot hire interns one after the other in sequence; requiring organisations to appoint a mentor to each intern, to complete a standard agreement for each intern and to provide an undertaking that the internship is not being used to displace employees.  In addition host organisations are not permitted to advertise internships in areas where they have recently made redundancies or in areas where they currently have paid posts advertised.  Host organisations must also complete and submit a monthly compliance report to the Department. The Department provides an on-line facility for interns or others to report breaches of these conditions.<\/p><p>  The Department takes a serious view of any allegations that these scheme conditions\/requirements are being breached and as part of its control process conducts random on-site inspection visits.

Reducing and ultimately eliminating poverty remains a fundamental aspiration of Irish society and is a commitment of the Government. One component of consistent poverty is basic deprivation, which is the enforced lack of two or more items from a list of 11 basic goods and services due to a lack of income. The list includes items such as two pairs of strong shoes; a warm waterproof overcoat, keeping the home adequately warm and a meal with meat, chicken or fish (vegetarian equivalent) every second day. The indicator was developed by the Economic and Social Research Institute as a way of capturing the lack of resources in the population. It is a component of the consistent poverty indicator used for the national social target for poverty reduction.<\/p><p>  The CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) is the official data source for national poverty indicators and household and individual income. It found that in 2007 the rate of basic deprivation was 11.8 per cent. The rate doubled to reach 24.5 per cent in 2011. The increase in basic deprivation highlights the continuing impact of the economic crisis on household living standards, due to higher unemployment and a fall in incomes.<\/p><p>  Social transfers play a key role in reducing poverty and basic deprivation. The effectiveness of social transfers in reducing poverty can be measured by comparing the at-risk-of poverty rate before and after social transfers. In 2007, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 33 per cent to 16.5 per cent, representing a poverty reduction effect of 50 per cent (rising to 60 per cent if pensions are included). This increased by 10 percentage points to a 60 per cent poverty reduction effect in 2011. Including pensions, the poverty reduction effect went from 60 per cent in 2007 to 68 per cent in 2011, an increase of 8 percentage points. The strong performance of social transfers over the period underlines the crucial importance of social welfare in protecting the most vulnerable people during the economic crisis. Using data from Eurostat from 2011, Ireland&rsquo;s performance in reducing poverty is far in excess of the EU-27 norm of 35.7 per cent, and even more so the 29 per cent reduction achieved in countries which are worst affected by the crisis. <\/p><p>  The Department undertakes a social impact assessment of the main welfare and direct tax measures in the Budget.

There are approximately 82,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million in 2013.  The Department completed a review of the maximum rent limits for rent supplement earlier this year and the revised rent limits came into effect on 17 June 2013.  The emphasis of the review was to ensure that value for money is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  The review broadly reflects the new market trends with rises in rent limits in County Dublin and Galway with the majority of rural counties falling.  Special provisions are made in exceptional circumstances including, for example, people with disabilities in specially adapted accommodation or homeless persons.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support.  In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities.  Officials in the Department of Social protection are working with those in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, who are leading the project, in developing proposals to give effect to this transfer.  Under HAP, customers with assessments of a long term housing need who would otherwise receive rent supplement will be taken directly into HAP. There is no evidence to suggest that rent supplement policy is increasing the incidence of homelessness.  Policy in relation to housing is a matter for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p><b>The number of ENP&rsquo;s in respect of rent deposits for the years 2010 to September 2013<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>No of Claimants<\/th><th>Expenditure<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>8,700<\/td><td>&euro;4.5m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>7,500<\/td><td>&euro;3.8m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>5,600<\/td><td>&euro;2.6m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013*<\/td><td>3,400<\/td><td>&euro;1.6m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>* as of 30 September 2013<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700053#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":106,"content":"<p>Question No. 40 answered with Question No. 16.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700053#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[43140\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700053#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to ensure that persons are financially better off in employment rather than on welfare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1183","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>The replacement rate for given income levels is a tool used to measure the degree to whichout-of-work benefits when unemployed replace take home income from work.  While there is no pre-determined level of replacement rate, which would influence every individual&rsquo;s decision to work, higher replacement rates may indicate lower incentives to take up employment.  In this regard a replacement rate in excess of 70% may be considered to be excessive.  The Department will shortly make available an online \"Better Off in Work\" ready reckoner which will give an indicative estimate of the difference between a customer's potential in-work and current out-of-work payments based on information input by the customer.  I expect this to be of significant practical help to jobseekers.  Replacement rate analysis, as supported by research by the ESRI, demonstrates that the great majority of people on the Live Register have a strong financial incentive to work and significant numbers leave the Register each year.<\/p><p>  In this regard it may be noted that almost three-quarters of the people on the Live Register are only claiming a personal rate for themselves. They are either single or may have a spouse or partner who is working. In addition, 53% of the people on the Live Register receive less than the maximum personal weekly rate.<\/p><p>  High replacement rates are generally associated with a relatively high number of dependent children and\/or receipt of rent or mortgage supplement. However, it is important to note that only some 9% of persons on the Live Register are in receipt of rent supplement, with a further 1.5% in receipt of mortgage interest supplement. The vast majority of jobseekers do not receive these additional supports. Significant moves have already been taken to address the impact of housing entitlements upon replacement rates. Arising out of commitments in the Programme for Government to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme, proposals to integrate the systems for providing rent supplement and social housing support have been advanced. It is intended to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from the Department of Social Protection (currently provided through rent supplement) to housing authorities using a new housing assistance payment.<\/p><p>  The effect of this transfer and the introduction of a new form of housing assistance payment will be to address one of the significant disincentives to accessing full-time employment that exists under the rent supplement scheme.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and thus reduce unemployment and long-term unemployment.  Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.<\/p><p>  The Government is also implementing a number of programmes to assist young unemployed persons and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance\/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies and include:<\/p><p> - The Youthreach programme providing 6,000 integrated education, training and work experience for early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age;<\/p><p> - The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme scheme, which provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age, particularly focusing upon early school leavers;<\/p><p> - The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated on this scheme in the last academic year;<\/p><p> - Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012. This excludes apprenticeships and evening courses;<\/p><p> - This year MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative, is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education.  MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  Over 1,250 of these places are assigned specifically for under 25s;<\/p><p> - The JobBridge National Internship Scheme is focused on providing work experience to young people with the total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 at 2,700;<\/p><p> - Long-term unemployed youth will also benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person from the Live Register;<\/p><p>  The most recent statistics available from the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey show the level of youth unemployment has fallen from an average of 75,000 in 2010 to 63,000 in the most recent twelve months for which data are available. The level of employment of young people appears to have stabilised, and indeed the employment rate (proportion of the population with jobs) for those aged 20-24 years rose from 46.5% in mid-2012 to 49% in the second quarter of this year. With regard to the expected future impact of existing policies, the original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people.<\/p><p>  Looking forward, in addition to current initiatives, policies to increase youth employment will be supplemented by additional measures under the Youth Guarantee which will be rolled out in 2014.  While the Recommendation for an EU-wide Youth Guarantee Scheme was adopted during the Irish Presidency earlier this year, the implementation of the scheme across the EU has yet to begin.  It is recognised, both in the Youth Guarantee Recommendation itself and more generally, that the pace of implementation must take account of the scale of the youth unemployment and inactivity challenge and consider the fiscal capacity of each Member State.  At the same time, Member States should take all possible measures to ensure that the Recommendation is swiftly implemented.  The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the implementation of a Guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  <\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has set up an interdepartmental group with officials and programme managers from the Department of Education and Skills, Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, to review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee. The Department of Social Protection has also engaged the assistance of the OECD in developing the Youth Guarantee Policy.<\/p><p>   It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee for consideration by the Government in December before being transmitted to the European Commission by the end of 2013. Development of the implementation plan will include identification of the costs of implementation, and how it is envisaged that these will be met (how much can be provided from domestic sources, and what is the likely requirement from EU funds, e.g. European Structural Fund and Youth Employment Initiative).  The amount that will be required for Ireland will only become clear when the implementation plans are drawn up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700053#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":113,"content":"<p>Question No. 43 answered with Question No. 35.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Registration Legislation","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700053#WRD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[43139\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700053#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to amend the Civil Registration Act 2004; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>On the 19 July, 2013, the Cabinet approved the drafting of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2013.

","asker":"1022","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 51 together.<\/p><p>  As the pension system in Ireland has developed, pensions policy has continued to evolve.  In recent years there has been a particular focus on the sustainability of the  State pension system because of the demographic issues that Ireland faces; the associated increases in pension and other age related costs; and the deterioration in the public finances since the recession.  <\/p><p>  Significant research has taken place with regard to pensions generally and the impact of changes in State pension.  This has included a Green Paper on Pensions, various technical studies and, most recently, the OECD Review of Pensions in Ireland.  <\/p><p>  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund provided evidence that the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate that the ratio of working age to pensioners will decrease from 5.3 at present to 2.3 by 2050 while the number of older people will increase from 12% of the population being over 65 in 2012 to an estimated 23% in 2050.  In the medium to long term, pension related expenditure will account for an increasing proportion of Fund expenditure - rising from 57% in 2011 to 85% in 2066.   <\/p><p>  In terms of impact assessment, the Actuarial Review has assessed the future impact of State pension changes.  This shows that, notwithstanding the State pension reform measures, social insurance benefits offer excellent value for money for those on the lower part of the income distribution, those with shorter contribution histories, and the self-employed.  The social solidarity principle which underlies the Fund is reflected in the fact that, for those at the higher end of the income distribution, the Fund is redistributive and this group generally get back less than they pay in.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>  Payment of pension is now more closely linked to contributions made over a working life due to the comprehensiveness of the social insurance system, the existence of voluntary contributions, the Homemaker's Scheme and the facility for awarding credited contributions to employees in times of unemployment or illness.  All of these elements mean that, unless a person goes abroad or operates in the informal economy, s\/he will have the potential to achieve a 100% insurance record.   <\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that there have been significant improvements with regard to the level of pensioner poverty in Ireland in recent years.  This is mainly attributed to substantial increases in the rates of State pensions over the period and other non-cash benefits.  In 2004, the at risk of poverty rate  for people aged 65 or over was 27.1% - higher than for other age groups and higher than the rate for the total population which was 19.4%.   By 2011 the at risk of poverty rate for those aged 65 or over had dropped to 9.7% while that for the population as a whole is at 16%.  In 2011, the consistent poverty rate for those over age 65 was 1.9% compared to 6.9% for the population as a whole.  This compares to 3.9% in 2004 which stood at 6.6% for the population.  Every effort has been made to maintain the rate of State pension at 34% of average earnings.  <\/p><p>  Even with the State pension reforms underway the role of social transfers will continue to be protected and social welfare supports will continue to be available to those most in need.  It should also be borne in mind that for those with a shorter contribution history which will result in a lower rate of payment of State pension, the non-contributory pension will continue to be available to those who meet the qualifying criteria which could result in a higher rate of payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700054#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":132,"content":"<p>Question No. 50 answered with Question No. 31.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":133,"content":"<p>Question No. 51 answered with Question No. 49.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Voluntary Work Option Issues","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700054#WRE01150"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[43407\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700054#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will consider introducing clearer guidelines for the accessibility of the voluntary work option to ensure that jobseekers can make a valuable contribution to society while still being eligible for a jobseeker's payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Due to the retirement of several Medical Assessors in recent years a number of vacancies have arisen.  In response, the Department in conjunction with the Public Appointment Service (PAS) ran a competition in 2012 to recruit replacement\/additional Medical Assessors.  Four Medical Assessors appointed from that competition are currently employed with a further Medical Assessor due to commence work this month.  The Department has continued to liaise with the PAS with a view to filling these critical vacancies.  A further competition was advertised on 13 September 2013 inviting suitably qualified candidates to apply for the position of Medical Assessor in the Department and interviews are due to take place shortly.  This competition is one of a number of options that the Department is currently exploring in order to increase its capacity to carry out medical assessments and reviews of its illness\/disability\/caring schemes thus enabling the Department to deliver a quality service to our customers.  The Department&rsquo;s disability and illness related schemes require a high level of medical evidence which must be assessed by the Medical Assessors and this, together with other qualifying criteria such as means testing for Disability Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and PRSI contributions for Invalidity Pension, can affect the processing times of claims.  There has also been an increase in volume of customer claims to particular schemes.  Despite this, there have been significant improvements from 2012 in the waiting times for assessment by the Medical Assessors across all the illness related schemes.

The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges Ireland faces, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and the deterioration in the public finances.  This means that, in the future, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the working population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to older people will decrease from 5.3 to 1 at present to 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing and whilst this is very welcome development, it also presents very real and obvious public policy challenges.  A number of policy reviews on pensions have been published in recent years.  The Green Paper on Pensions was published in 2007, followed by a country-wide consultation on the future of pensions.  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed a framework for the future development of pensions.  In 2011 and 2012, a number of pension reforms were introduced, State pension age has been increased and changes to eligibility have been introduced which link employment more closely to the rate of pension paid.<\/p><p>  In April 2013, the OECD in their Review of the Irish Pension System undertook an independent and objective review of pension policy and endorsed the approach of policy to date.  However, it also concludes that financial sustainability issues and our changing demographics and aging population mean that further reform is required.<\/p><p>  The report recommends for consideration a range of changes in the key parameters of the Irish State, occupational and private pension schemes and outlines options for more profound structural reforms of the retirement income system.  The OECD Report recommended expanding private pension coverage by the introduction in the future of a compulsory or soft compulsory private pension.  In the context of the introduction of such an option, it also proposed structural reform of the State pension, including the option of a universal based payment, based on the principle of residency.  However, residency based criteria can pose particular difficulties since Ireland does not maintain details of long term residency status.  Detailed analysis of these options is on-going in my Department and consideration of the recommendations of this review will inform further developments in the area of pension policy. <\/p><p>  The State pension has been successful in lifting older people out of poverty.  Compared to the rest of the population, older people in Ireland have the lowest poverty rates (at 1.9%) and are least likely to be at risk of poverty (pointing to the adequacy of the State pension).<\/p><p>  Secure and adequate finances are one of the fundamental components of a happy and active retirement.  The overall objective of the pension system in Ireland is to provide an adequate and sustainable basic standard of living through direct supports in the form of the State pension and to encourage people (through tax reliefs) to make supplementary pension provision so that they may have an adequate income replacement rates when they retire from work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700055#WRF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payments Administration","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700055#WRF01250"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[43307\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700055#WRF01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which in the coming year, she expects to be in a position to transfer responsibility for meeting the housing needs of those on local authority housing lists and having to rely on rent support from her Department to the Department of the Environment thereby achieving considerable savings; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

If necessary, the landlord may seek termination of the tenancy which, if affected, would result in the termination of rent supplement.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to review the operation of rent supplement to ensure that tenants who are receiving long term support from the State under the scheme are subject to the same type of anti-social behaviour regime as local authority tenants.

Following the restoration of devolved powers in May 2007, the then First Minister and deputy First Minister considered the position of the Civic Forum in the re-established devolved arrangements and commissioned a review of the effectiveness and appropriateness of its structure, operation and membership. In April 2013 the NI Assembly voted in favour of an SDLP motion to re-establish the Civic Forum.   In my ongoing contacts with the Secretary of State and with the Northern Ireland Executive, including in the context of the North South Ministerial Council, I have pressed for the re-establishment of the Civic Forum as a valuable and, as yet, unimplemented provision of the Good Friday Agreement.     I welcome the recent consultations which Richard Haass, Independent Chair of the Panel of Parties, and Meghan O&rsquo;Sullivan, Independent Vice-Chair of the Panel of Parties, have undertaken with community groups and with representatives of wider civil society in order to ensure that their views and perspectives are considered in the context of the talks process. <\/p><p>  I have previously put on the record of the D&aacute;il that I support the establishment of a   Civic Forum which would provide for a broad range of voices on community relations and stimulate informed public debate in relation to key societal challenges.

A substantial proportion of representational work is associated with St Patrick&rsquo;s Day events, which are crucial in maintaining contacts and influence with business and political leaders.

RPN spending, like all Departmental spending, is subject to rigorous internal controls as well as external audit.  RPN resources are shared between Heads of Mission and other diplomatic staff - a total of approximately 253 officers across the mission network in 2012 - with varying amounts allocated to individual officers according to the business priorities of the mission.

This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally <\/p><p>obliged to publish its enrolment policy.<\/p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of my Department. <\/p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I recently published a draft General Scheme for an Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, 2013 as well as draft regulations for discussion ahead of enacting legislation. I have referred the draft General Scheme and draft regulations to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, to allow a full public discussion of the proposed legislative framework, including inputs from parents and the education partners. <\/p><p>  The Joint Committee has issued an invitation to interested individuals and groups for submissions on the Draft General Scheme of an Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013. The Joint Committee's closing date for receipt of same is Wednesday 31st October (at 3 pm).

There are approximately 82,000 rent supplement recipients of whom over 51,000 are in receipt for over 18 months.  The Government has provided over &euro;403 million for the scheme in 2013.  Expenditure on rent supplement for the last 3 years is provided in the following tabular statement.<\/p><p>New revised rent limits came into force on 17 June 2013.  The new rent limits were determined following an extensive review of the private rental market which showed rising rents for urban centres, particularly Dublin and Galway, and reduction in rents for the majority of counties.  The new limits continue to ensure that value for money is achieved while, at the same time, people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  The Department currently funds approximately 30% of the total supply of private rented sector properties so it is essential that the rent limits are kept under review and do not distort the natural supply and demand conditions that prevail.  Officials in the Department continue to examine the impact of the new rent limits on those who claim rent supplement and ensure that their accommodation needs are met.<\/p><p>The Department's strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support.  In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities.  Officials in the Department of Social protection are working with those in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, who are leading the project, in developing proposals to give effect to this transfer.  Under HAP, customers with assessments of a long term housing need who would otherwise receive rent supplement will be taken directly into HAP.<\/p><p>This summer, DECLG undertook a Business Processing Design exercise to determine the business processes required to support the implementation of HAP roll out.  This exercise will assist DECLG in the drafting of the necessary legislation and feed into the development of implementation plans and the necessary IT infrastructure to support the roll-out of the new scheme in selected test authorities.  The Department is advised that following the enactment of the relevant legislation, a HAP testing phase will be carried out in the selected local authorities in 2014 with full roll out of the scheme to follow once the test phase is complete.<\/p><p><b>Rent Supplement Expenditure: 2010 to 2012<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th><br \/>Year<\/th><th><br \/>Cost &euro;000<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>2010 <\/td><td><br \/>516,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>2011<\/td><td><br \/>502,700<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>2012<\/td><td><br \/>422,500<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700059#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700059#WRK01750"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[43894\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700059#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the average waiting period for decision in respect of disability allowance on appeal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[43897\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700059#WRK01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the average time taken to deal with appeals in respect of invalidity pension; the extent to which the waiting period has fluctuated in each of the past three years to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":290,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 107 together.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the current average time taken to process disability allowance appeals decided by summary decision is 31.5 weeks and 40 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.

Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.<\/p><p>In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is under way in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.

This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to September 2013 reducing to 35.2 weeks for an oral hearing and 26.7 weeks for a summary decision.  A similar trend is reflected in processing times for invalidity pension appeals.  In 2010 the average processing time for an invalidity pension oral hearing was 59.7 weeks while a decision requiring a summary decision took an average of 40 weeks.  This had improved to 48.7 and 38.8 weeks respectively in 2012 and has further improved (up to September 2013) to 41.7 and 35.1 weeks respectively.<\/p><p>These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.<\/p><p>By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<\/p><p><b>Processing times for Invalidity Pension Appeals 2010-2013 (to 30\/9\/2013)<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Average processing times (weeks) Summary Decisions<\/th><th>Average processing times (weeks) Oral Hearings<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>40.0<\/td><td>59.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>36.4<\/td><td>58.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>38.8<\/td><td>48.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013   (to 30\/9\/2013)<\/td><td>35.1<\/td><td>41.7<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700059#WRK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Non-Contributory) Applications","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700059#WRK02050"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[43895\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700059#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the total number of applications for non-contributory old age pension received in each of the past two years to date; the number approved, refused and-or pending; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

A self-employed person may apply for jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or their income reduces to a low level due a lack of demand for services.  Jobseekers allowance is a means tested payment and income from self-employment activity is assessed by reference to the estimated net profit from the business concerned over the coming 12 months.  It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in income and activity levels is reflected in any assessment of means from self-employment.<\/p><p>  Where it is not possible to estimate income for the coming 12 months, the income for the most recent 12 month period is generally taken as a guide, allowing for any known changes in circumstances which are likely to have a significant effect on income.  Accordingly, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.  For example, if a self-employed person lost a contract and was unlikely to find a substitute contract in the coming year, this would be factored into the estimate of future income.  At present there are over 11,000 people in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment who are also classified as self-employed, although the current level of engagement in business would vary greatly among this group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700060#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Levels","counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700060#WRL01350"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[43904\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700060#WRL01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons currently on the live register who have remained unemployed for up to two years and for longer periods; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":314,"content":"<p>As of the end of September 2013 there were 408,670 people on the live register.

The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 when State pension (transition) ceases and State pension age is standardised for all at 66 years.  The State pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age. This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.   State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Over time, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.<\/p><p>  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65 who are unable to remain in the workforce, all short term schemes are payable to 66 years.  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before State pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).

The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and fixed businesses in the designated NBS Electoral Divisions. The areas of Mullaghmast, Ballitore, Narraghmore, Calverstown and Kilmeade, referred to in the Deputy's questions, are serviced under the NBS.<\/p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.<\/p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Kildare. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.<\/p><p>  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700063#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Energy Projects","counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700063#WRO01950"},{"type":"question","counter":396,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[43930\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700063#WRO02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of wind turbines it will take to fulill his Memorandum of Understanding in view of the fact that a newspaper (details supplied) reported that the UK will save seven billion sterling by not having to build offshore wind farms and that Ireland is planning to export approximately &euro;2.5 billion worth of electricity annually; if he has carried out a cost benefit analysis and if that analysis has taken into account the well being of the persons here who are to be forced to live with the pylons and turbines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

An agreed programme of work to this end is underway with the ambition to settle on an Inter-Governmental Agreement in early 2014. A key objective, from an Irish Government perspective, is to realise the potential for investment, jobs and growth. The amount of energy to be procured by the UK and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including an appropriate return to the Exchequer, are among the matters to be addressed ahead of signing any Inter-Governmental Agreement.<\/p><p>  One of the key requirements for proposals of a significant scale for wind energy export will be the achievement of the necessary planning consents in Ireland. Planning permission for major renewable energy projects of significant scale are determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la (ABP). In order to facilitate decisions by ABP on projects specifically for export, a clear national planning policy framework is essential and I have asked my Department to prepare such a framework. The policy framework will provide the opportunity to integrate relevant EU Directive requirements (including Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment), trans-boundary dimensions and stakeholder participation within the context of a national framework.<\/p><p>  The outcome will be a high level development framework taking its lead from the Inter-Governmental Agreement, EU Directive requirements and relevant national, regional and local planning policy considerations in conjunction with wider policies, objectives and requirements.

It is intended to commence public consultation in the coming weeks by formally inviting all interested parties and members of the public to make written submissions on the export project which will be taken into consideration in preparing the framework. Details on this will be provided through a new dedicated section on my Department&rsquo;s website, exclusive to the project, and which will be updated as the project progresses.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, is undertaking a review of the Wind Energy Guidelines which will address the key issues of noise (including separation distance) and shadow flicker. Draft guidelines will be published for public consultation by end-November 2013 with a view to finalising guidelines by mid&ndash;2014.

Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time. <\/p><p>  The Carrigaholt Sewerage Scheme was not amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the current Programme.  While Clare County Council submitted a proposal to have the Carrigaholt Sewerage Scheme included in the current programme, as part of the review process in 2011, there had been no change in circumstances since 2009 such as to alter the priority attached to the scheme.  Consequently it was not possible to include the Carrigaholt Sewerage Scheme in the current Programme.<\/p><p>  However, Clare County Council may consider submitting a proposal in respect of group sewerage scheme grants when submissions are requested for 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700064#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":419,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700064#WRP01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700064#WRP01450"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[43913\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700064#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will clarify the issue of the types and costs of the various Irish nationality certificates awarded; if the costs vary depending on whether the client is an EU citizen, other than EU national, an asylum grantee and so on; if cost to client in each case can be outlined; if cost in all cases is fully borne by the applicant and specifically say why cost to an EU citizen married to an Irish citizen is regarded as expensive considering that the administrative cost of such an application and the background examination into it would be less than other cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There is a range of options open to separating couples depending on the degree to which they can reach mutually acceptable arrangements including, where relevant, in relation to custody of, and access to, their children. Where couples can reach mutually acceptable terms, they may separate by deed without the need to make any court applications, and the terms of the separation in relation to maintenance may be made a rule of court in the event of any future breach of the terms. They may also seek a judicial separation and, if they have been able to agree terms, they may ask the court to make orders based on their agreement. When they have been separated for four out of the previous five years, they may apply for a divorce and again, they may ask the court to make its orders based on any agreements they have come to, provided the agreements meet the Constitutional requirement of \"proper provision\".<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is also a free Family Mediation Service to help separating couples agree the terms of any separation or divorce. Where couples can agree those terms through mediation, this can reduce any legal costs relating to court proceedings by minimising the issues to be so resolved. Information about the Family Mediation Service is available at www.legalaidboard.ie, or through Citizens Information Centres. Where couples have not reached any agreement and the proceedings are concerned extensively with determining the division of assets, appropriate levels of maintenance, and arrangements concerning children, the legal costs will be higher. Ultimately, the reaching of agreement in relation to separation and divorce proceedings relies on the parties concerned and solutions cannot be imposed solely from a legal costs perspective.  <\/p><p>  It has also been my long-held view that there should be a dedicated and integrated Family Court structure to meet the particular needs of people involved in family proceedings. A commitment has been given in the Programme for Government to introduce a Constitutional Amendment to allow for the establishment of such a court to streamline family law court processes and to make them more efficient and less costly.<\/p><p>  At a broader level, the issue of legal costs is being addressed by the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 which has commenced Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and is a key component of the Government's strategy aimed at reducing legal costs in this country and providing those involved in family or other proceedings with less costly alternatives. The Bill makes extensive provision, particularly in Part 9, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. Both barristers and solicitors will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. The Bill also sets out a number of measures aimed at opening up the provision of legal services to new business models that can provide more tailored and competitive services for clients such as those involved in separation or divorce proceedings. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700066#WRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","counter":471,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700066#WRR00950"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[44042\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700066#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will support local residents (details supplied) in Dublin 5 who are concerned about their safety and security when a paedophile is released soon from prison and who have concerns that there could be violence.

Implementation of AVFC has been slower than originally expected.  It has been delayed by a number of factors including the changed economic context, constraints in public spending and the moratorium on recruitment.  <\/p><p>  Nonetheless, a great deal of progress has been made with the accelerated closure of old psychiatric hospitals and their replacement with bespoke new facilities, better suited to modern mental health care.  Progress also includes shorter episodes of in-patient care and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery. <\/p><p>  A modern mental health service is best delivered in the community and in 2012 a special allocation of &euro;35m was provided primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children's mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems and to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities, in line with AVFC<i>.<\/i>  414 posts were approved to implement the &euro;35m package of special measures.  <i><\/i><\/p><p>  Budgetary pressures within the HSE delayed the full utilisation of this funding, but this sum is now available to mental health services along with an additional &euro;35m allocated in Budget 2013 for the continued development of mental health services across a range of headings, including the further development of forensic services and community mental health teams for adults, children, older persons with a mental illness and those with an intellectual disability and mental illness.  477 posts have been approved to implement these measures.  <\/p><p>  As at 30 September 2013, the recruitment process is complete for 378 or 91% of the 414 posts approved in 2012.  There are a number of posts for which there are difficulties in identifying suitable candidates due to factors including availability of qualified candidates and geographic location, and the remainder are at various stages in the recruitment process.<\/p><p>  Of the 477 posts approved in 2013, as at 30th September 2013, 255 or 54% of these posts were in the final stages of the recruitment process and a further 149 were at earlier stages, indicating that 85% of posts are in the recruitment process.   The HSE's National Recruitment Service is currently working to ensure that the remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible, from existing panels or through competition in the absence of panels, at the earliest opportunity.  Options to enable more local recruitment are also being considered where this will assist in filling specific posts.

In the case of nurses and midwives, the standard working-week has increased from 37.5 to 39 hours.

Historically,\u00a0Irish Road Traffic legislation made it an offence to use a commercial vehicle in a public place without a Certificate of Roadworthiness (CRW).  Under the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 a person guilty of such an offence is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months, or to both.   \u00a0<\/p><p>  Heretofore, rates of annual testing compliance have been unacceptable.  The RSA is implementing\u00a0important changes to improve the roadworthiness standard of commercial vehicles which will in turn improve safety on our road network.  Vehicles\u00a0that are off the road can\u00a0deteriorate,\u00a0therefore\u00a0it is important\u00a0that they\u00a0be tested.  For example,\u00a0tyres and brake hoses may perish, while\u00a0brake lines, brake reservoirs\/air tanks, brake chambers and callipers may seize and or corrode.<\/p><p>  As part of the Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Reform Programme,\u00a0the issuing of\u00a0CRWs\u00a0is now aligned to the obligation to have\u00a0commercial vehicles tested annually.  Longer\u00a0delays in completing\u00a0tests result in\u00a0shorter\u00a0periods of validity\u00a0for\u00a0issued CRWs.  Operators who fail to comply with the requirements for testing should not be\u00a0allowed to gain an advantage over\u00a0those who\u00a0are proactively compliant.  Where a vehicle is out of test for over a year, the validity of a CRW is six months from the test date\u00a0with a further test\u00a0being required at the expiry date of the relevant CRW.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700072#WRX01800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"}]
