The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report which was published in November 2015, provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025. <\/p>  <p>  The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.

The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.\u00a0 Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity.

There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons\/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.<\/p>  <p>  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.<\/p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multi-denominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.  There will be a role for the existing patron\/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.\u00a0 It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.<\/p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation.  Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body. \u00a0In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to respect the voluntary nature of these transfers, given that the current patron is in most cases owner of the land on which the school stands.\u00a0 My Department will develop protocols on patronage transfer with existing patrons to ensure that school and local communities and prospective patrons are fully consulted before a decision is made.\u00a0 I am confident that this process will respect the views of all parties - parents, local schools and communities and patrons, I anticipate full co-operation from all parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100071#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[10412\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100071#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will report on the process for awarding patronage of new secondary schools in the Dublin 15 area; if the diversity in the population was considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1254","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":98,"content":"<p>Since 2011 new schools are established in areas to meet demographic growth.

I welcome such research and I am happy to see the collaborative pooling of resources by the University of Limerick and DIT which is instanced in this case. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan for Education 2017, my Department will commence a review of guidance services, tools and career information for students and adults.  The report will provide an important input to this review.<\/p>  <p>  Measures announced in Budget 2016 and 2017 will, between them, effectively restore two-thirds of the number of ex-quota guidance posts that were withdrawn from schools in Budget 2012.  In that Budget, schools were required to make provision for guidance from within their general allocation of teachers.  I am keen to ensure that in restoring these posts, schools will be required in their guidance plans to include specified time allocations for guidance counsellors to be available for one-to-one guidance counselling for students.  I also want to ensure that there will be adequate time allocated for the role of the Guidance Counsellor in supporting the Student Support Team.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100072#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Quality and Qualifications Ireland","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100072#WRC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[10118\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100072#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the implementation of the Quality and Qualifications Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, in particular his Department's engagement with Quality and Qualifications Ireland regarding the implementation schedule for the international education mark; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) was formally established on 6 November 2012 under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act, 2012.\u00a0 The 2012 Act also provided for the dissolution of the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC), the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  QQI was given responsibility for the functions of those bodies across further and higher education and training as well as for the external quality assurance function formerly carried out by the Irish Universities Quality Board (IUQB).

The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to\u00a0provision for 7542 posts in the current school year.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend &euro;1.6billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  This investment\u00a0will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils in their school who require such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools\u00a0will be\u00a0provided with total allocation which includes\u00a0a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school. <\/p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.\u00a0 This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, as school will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.\u00a0 This includes provision for\u00a0pupils newly\u00a0enrolling to the school or pupils who may transfer from another school. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.\u00a0 Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.

","asker":"1257","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>As the Deputy knows, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State by the end of 2017;  2,622 through the EU  relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy's questions covers two separate cohorts arriving under the Irish Refugee Protection Porgramme (IRPP):<\/p>  <p>  -  Firstly, those arriving as UNHCR programme refugees from Lebanon who are catered for by the Office for the Promotion for Migrant Integration (OPMI)  and<\/p>  <p>  -  Secondly, those arriving from Greece and Italy as relocated asylum seekers. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the first cohort arriving under the IRPP, programme refugees, I refer to my comprehensive reply to the Deputy's recent Parliamentary Question No. 96 of 21 February 2017 which sets out in considerable detail the nature of the integration programmes available to this group.  In relation to the second cohort arriving under the IRPP, relocated asylum seekers, which I take to be the core focus of this Parliamentary Question, I wish to inform the Deputy that the integration programmes available to this cohort will be broadly the same as those for programme refugees but there will be some differences arising from the different nature and initial entitlements of the two cohorts.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware from my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 96 of 21 February 2017, work in relation to the arrival of UNHCR programme refugees begins about 9 months in advance of resettlement.  With the relocation cohort this period of advance planning is not available because of the circumstances of the relocation group and the process set out in the relocation instruments.  Instead the IRPP has about 3 months to plan for the arrival of relocated asylum seekers.  When this cohort arrive they do not, as asylum seekers, possess the same rights and entitlements as refugees.  Nonetheless, the IRPP endeavours to the greatest extent possible to treat them in a broadly equivalent manner so as to commence the integration process in the quickest possible timescale.  The IRPP does this as the likelihood of persons in this cohort achieving a grant of international protection is very high because (a) the selection process embedded in the relocation instruments is predicated on the fact that eligible nationalities must, across the EU, have a 75% or higher chance of obtaining status and (b) the overwhelming majority of persons being relocated to Ireland are fleeing the war in Syria . <\/p>  <p>  In advance of their arrival in Ireland, relocated asylum seekers will have been interviewed while in Greece or Italy by an IRPP team to both assess their needs and vulnerabilities prior to arrival in Ireland and to initially orient them to Irish life and society.  Following their arrival in Ireland, and during their initial period of reception, relocated asylum seekers will be accommodated in an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC).  As the name suggests, an EROC is largely about reception and orientation for those who are to be subsequently resettled.  In the EROC they will receive broadly the same integration services as available to programme refugees with due account being taken of the fact that certain things may not be able to happen until individuals receive a decision on their application for a grant of international protection.  This decision is usually forthcoming within twelve weeks.  IRPP staff meet individuals and families at regular intervals to help assess their ongoing needs and requirements.  The client group also receive an orientation and language training programme while in the EROC.  A Friends of the Centre group will be established in Ballaghaderreen, the newest EROC to be opened and, working through with the Irish Red Cross, the IRPP intends to explore with volunteers what additional  community supports can be of benefit from an integration perspective to the cohort.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of resettlement in the community, the overall model to be used will be identical to the model used for programme refugees as will be the suite of integration supports.  Details of this model are set out in the response to the Deputy's previous Parliamentary Question referred to above.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to integration, the Deputy may also be aware that the Migrant Integration Strategy, which was published on 7 February 2017, offers a blueprint for the Government's action to promote migrant integration for the period to 2020.  It sees integration as a two-way process which involves action by migrants and non-migrants alike.  It promotes action by Government, business, employers, migrants, NGOs and local communities.  The Strategy requires all Departments to insert integration as a theme in strategy statements, business plans and staff training.  It is using networks as a means of encouraging greater participation by migrants in all aspects of Irish life. <\/p>  <p>  It includes targeted initiatives to promote migrant entrepreneurship, to encourage migrants into the Civil Service and onto State boards and to improve English language provision in education and training.  It is accompanied by a Communities Integration Fund, launched by Minister David Stanton T.D., on 7 February, which will provide funding for community initiatives to promote integration.<\/p>  <p>  The IRPP integration model for relocated asylum seekers will work with existing best practice in this areas as pioneered by the OPMI but is also willing to work organically with community bodies, NGOs and civil society to see what else can be added to the integration model in order to help refugees successfully integrate into Irish society and rebuild their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100073#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting Applications","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100073#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[10616\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100073#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason for the delay in a person's Garda vetting application (details supplied).

The incentive applies for the period from 19 July 2016 to 31 December 2019.  The legislative provisions for the Help to Buy incentive are set out in Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as inserted by Section 9 of the Finance Act 2016.<\/p>  <p>  There are three elements to the payment provisions.  Firstly, in respect of a first home purchased or self-built in the period from 19 July to 31 December 2016, the HTB refund is paid directly to the purchaser or self-builder, that is to the claimants bank account.  Secondly, for a first home purchased from a qualifying contractor in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019, the Help to Buy refund is paid to the qualifying contractors bank account.  Thirdly, for a self-built home where the first tranche of the mortgage is drawn in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019, the refund is paid to the claimants qualifying loan bank account, which is taken to be an account with the mortgage institution that extended the mortgage.<\/p>  <p>  In the individual case raised by the Deputy, the first-time buyer purchased a house after 1 January 2017, paid the standard 10% deposit to the builder, and subsequently became aware that the Help to Buy refund is to be paid to the builder or qualifying contractor.  The first-time buyer in such an instance still gets the benefit of the scheme as their Help to Buy refund is a credit against the purchase price of the house, albeit that they are not receiving the refund directly to themselves.  The legislation, in Section 477C(16)(b), of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997\u00a0is very clear in that regard, noting that: Where the appropriate payment is made in respect of a claimant to a qualifying contractor the contractor shall treat the appropriate payment as a credit against the purchase price of the qualifying residence.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that information about how refunds were to be paid, including the fact that qualifying contractors would be paid the refund for purchases after 1 January 2017, has been included in the Revenue guidance documentation and Frequently Asked Questions on Help to Buy since shortly after I announced the scheme on Budget Day last October.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Revenue has briefed the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) on a number of occasions on the operational detail of the scheme.  CIF members have been advised that the Help to Buy incentive\u00a0is to operate on the basis of helping first-time buyers meet their deposit requirements and, specifically, that contractors should give first-time purchasers the benefit of the appropriate refund when they are finalising the sale contract and the arrangements for the payment of the deposit.

It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgment to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils.  Schools are supported in this regard by NEPS.  Schools are not required to apply directly to my Department for learning support for SLDs such as dyslexia.  Schools should monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.  The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.<\/p>  <p>  A new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs will be implemented from September 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools\u00a0will be\u00a0provided with a total allocation which includes\u00a0a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile.  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school.  A\u00a0new Circular will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will also receive guidance as to how they should deploy their resources to provide additional teaching support for pupils taking into account their individual learning needs.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is available to schools also for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and\/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with SLDs, where relevant professionals recommend the equipment as being essential for the provision of education.  Schools apply to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) through their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) for such support.  SENOs make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support in the form of Assistive Technology, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0010\/2013.  In order to qualify for equipment under the assistive technology scheme, a child must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the child to access the curriculum.  It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs.<\/p>  <p>  Schools who wish to apply for assistive technology support for pupils with special educational needs should contact their local SENO.\u00a0 All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO, parents may also contact the SENO directly to discuss the special educational needs of their child.  A list of SENO contact details is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Further supports which are provided to support pupils with Dyslexia include an information resource pack on Dyslexia which has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools as well as provision for continuing professional development for teachers with additional training needs in the area of Dyslexia through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) and reasonable accommodations in State Examinations.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides annual funding to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland at national level which helps the organisation operate an information service for members and the public as well as assisting in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100075#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100075#WRF01850"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[10714\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100075#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to outline the steps he has taken to ensure there will be an adequate supply of chefs available to the hospitality industry here in view of the shortage of trained chefs in the country at the moment, particularly in rural areas; the discussions he has had with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>Work is progressing on the development of a\u00a0new Commis Chef Apprenticeship\u00a0led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.

A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders. \u00a0Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year.

A Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet has been established which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention.  Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report.  Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was\u00a0initiated\u00a0by SOLAS in collaboration with the ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  Networks have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers\u00a0to identify training needs, design training programmes, recruit learners and deliver training on and off the job.

Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0also announced that an additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to\u00a0provision for 7542 posts in the current school year.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend &euro;1.6 billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  This additional investment will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils in their school who require such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools\u00a0will be\u00a0provided with total allocation which includes\u00a0a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need \u00a0in each school. <\/p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, as schools will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.  This includes provision for junior infants who are newly\u00a0enrolling to the school or pupils who may transfer from another school. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the NCSE advised schools that there was no longer a requirement for schools to make applications for special education teaching supports for individual\u00a0pupils with\u00a0special education teaching\u00a0needs, as resources\u00a0would be provided for schools by the\u00a0profiled allocation.<\/p>  <p>  It will be a matter for schools to allocate additional resource teaching time to individual pupils from within their total allocation, taking into account each students learning needs. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally\u00a0be adjusted between allocations. <\/p>  <p>  The model will provide, from this year, additional resources to schools where it is expected that there will be additional needs.  In protecting resources in schools where the profiles indicate that the levels of need are\u00a0lower than are currently provided for some additional capacity is also provided for in those schools.  Accordingly, all schools should have the capacity to meet the needs of additional children enrolling in the school in the following school year without the need for additional or new resources. <\/p>  <p>  The model\u00a0will, however,\u00a0allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The Inclusion Support Service,\u00a0established under the National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the school&rsquo;s profile has changed very\u00a0significantly since the allocation was made to the school,\u00a0may\u00a0an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. <\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0new Circular will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will also be provided with guidance on how to manage their resources to ensure that all pupils who have additional learning needs can be provided with support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100076#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Extra Curricular Activities","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100076#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[10560\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100076#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he  has issued any circular letters or other guidelines to schools regarding the private organisation of evening study for which students make payments in post-primary schools; if so, if those letters or guidelines will be made available; if he has not issued any circular letters or guidelines, his plans to issue them to schools regarding the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The position is that my Department has not issued any guidelines to schools in relation to the organisation of evening study and I have no plans to do so.

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions and the internal disbursement of funding is then a matter for the individual institution.  Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day to day affairs, including the allocation of all of its income (both public and private).  They are also responsible for the provision and management of courses at their institution.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA are aware of the financial difficulties being experienced by a number of the Institutes of Technology (IoTs), including GMIT.  The HEA has been closely monitoring the financial position of all of the IoTs and in particular it is working closely with those Institutes operating in deficit to ensure appropriate mechanisms are put in place to eliminate the deficit as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Financial Review of the Institutes, published last year by the HEA,\u00a0was carried out in order to provide an overview of the financial health of the sector, to consider capacity issues and to examine the challenges for the institutions given their respective plans for the future.  The report makes a number of recommendations on how some of the issues which contribute to\u00a0funding problems in the IoT sector\u00a0can be addressed and my Department is working with the HEA in relation to those recommendations.  These policy recommendations will also feed into the work being undertaken on developing a sustainable funding model for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the HEA has a policy framework in place for engaging with vulnerable IoTs\u00a0which requires Institutes to submit a three-year plan to return them to a balanced budget situation.  If the Institute is unable to demonstrate how a return to a balanced budget can be achieved within this timeframe, or if actual performance deviates significantly from the plan, then the HEA will seek the appointment of an independent financial expert to work with the Governing Body and Executive Management Team to agree a revised plan and programme of remedial action.  The HEA and the GMIT executive are engaged in ongoing contact in relation to the financial difficulties being experienced by GMIT.<\/p>  <p>  Funding overall for the higher education sector is a key concern for me, particularly in light of the additional pressure that will fall on the system over the next decade or so - an issue which is clearly set out in the Report of the Expert Group on the Future Funding for Higher Education, which is currently with the Joint Oireachtas Committee for consideration.  However, in seeking\u00a0to address the issue in the short term,\u00a0I have for the first time in nine years secured\u00a0additional funding for the sector with &euro;36.5m additional being made available this year and &euro;160m additional overall over the next three years. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, in Budget 2017 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.  The review will be undertaken as part of the overall response to meeting the anticipated skills needs in the economy over the coming years, in line with the policy framework set out in the National Skills Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  It\u00a0will include\u00a0an analysis of the business case for enhanced investment in the higher and further education and training sectors.  In this context it\u00a0will\u00a0identify key elements of the new funding model\u00a0and of\u00a0the expected impacts, including those\u00a0on employers.  The review will include consultation with stakeholders.  It is expected that the policy review will be published by the end of April 2017, and will complement the ongoing work\u00a0by the Oireachtas Committee\u00a0in relation to the Cassells report.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100077#WRH02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Appeals","counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100078#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[10637\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100078#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the student grant appeals board will accept a late student grant appeal from a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>I understand that the student referred to by the Deputy, appealed the decision of the awarding authority to the SUSI appeals officer and a decision letter issued from the appeals officer on the 21st of July 2016.\u00a0 The student was advised\u00a0that if she was not satisfied with the\u00a0decision of the appeals officer,\u00a0she could\u00a0appeal\u00a0the decision to the Student Grants Appeals Board (SGAB) within the statutory time limits.<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 21(2) of the Student Support Act 2011, an applicant has 30 days from the date of the Appeals Officer's decision in the awarding authority, to submit\u00a0an appeal to the Student Grants Appeals Board.\u00a0\u00a0Under Section 21(3) of the Act, the Board may extend this period by a further 30 days if it is satisfied that the applicant has given reasonable cause to do so.

I have stated that, while it is to be welcomed and respected that\u00a0many parents wish their children to receive education in their faith,\u00a0I believe that it is unfair that preference is given by publicly funded religious schools to children of their own religion who might live some distance away, ahead of children of a different religion or of no religion who live close to the school.  I have also stated that I believe that it is unfair that parents, who might otherwise not do so, feel pressure to baptise their children in order to gain admission to the local school.  In that respect I agree with the aims of the Labour Party&rsquo;s Bill. <\/p><p>I intend to reform the school admissions system in relation to the role that religion can play in the admissions\u00a0process.  I have set out four possible approaches for dealing with the issue, in primary schools in the first instance, including:<\/p><p>A catchment area approach, prohibiting religious schools from giving preference to children of their own religion\u00a0who live outside the catchment area ahead of non-religious children who live inside the catchment;<\/p><p>A &lsquo;nearest school rule&rsquo;, allowing religious schools to give preference to a religious child only where it is that child&rsquo;s nearest school of that particular religion;<\/p><p>A quota system, which would allow a religious\u00a0school give preference to children of its own religion in respect of only\u00a0a certain proportion of places, meaning that the remaining places would be\u00a0allocated based on other admissions criteria &ndash; proximity to the school,\u00a0lottery etc.;<\/p><p>An outright prohibition on religious schools\u00a0using religion as a factor in admissions, meaning that all places would be\u00a0allocated based on other factors.  Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.<\/p><p>I am also mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including most importantly possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.<\/p><p>Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas.<\/p><p>On 24th January I\u00a0commenced a process of consultation on this issue which will run until 20th March.\u00a0 The details of the consultation process and how to make a submission are available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.education.ie and specifically at the following link: <\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>I am interested in hearing the views of the groups who stand to be impacted by changes as well as any members of the public with views on the issue.<\/p><p>This phase of receiving written submissions is part of\u00a0the broader 12 week consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of responses and development of next steps.<\/p><p>These steps will require additional time, and I am conscious of legislative deadlines impacting on this work, in particular the Equal Status (Admissions to Schools) Bill, referred to by the Deputy, which is due before the House again shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100078#WRJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Croke Park Agreement Implementation","counter":333,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100078#WRJ03100"},{"type":"question","counter":334,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[10681\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100078#WRJ03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to issue a directive on implementing pay deductions for members of teachers' unions which rejected working additional hours under the Croke Park agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":335,"content":"<p>ASTI's withdrawal from the Croke Park hours means that the union has repudiated the Lansdowne Road Agreement.

Education is the best means of delivering a fairer society, breaking down cycles of disadvantage and ensuring that all our people, in particular those with special educational needs, are able to participate in that progress and fulfil their potential.  Excellent and innovative education and training are the pivot around which personal fulfilment, a fair society and a successful nation should revolve.  It is central to sustaining economic success and in converting economic success into building a strong community.  Having the best education and training service in Europe will allow us to provide better opportunities for more people from disadvantaged groups, as well as ensuring that we create more sustainable well-paying jobs. <\/p><p>This February, I launched the Action Plan for Education 2017, building on the first ever Action Plan for Education 2016 - 2019, which was published in September last year.  The central vision of the Action Plan for Education is that the Irish education and training system becomes the best in Europe over the next decade.  The Plan&rsquo;s high-level goals are based on the five policy areas which I believe will help us to achieve this ambition.  The goals are:<\/p><p>1.1 Improve the learning experience and the success of learners<\/p><p>2.2 Improve the progress of learners at risk of educational disadvantage or learners with special educational needs<\/p><p>3.3 Help those delivering education services to continuously improve<\/p><p>4.4 Build stronger bridges between education and wider community<\/p><p>5.5 Improve national planning and support services.<\/p><p>Focussing on these five areas allows us to adopt a whole-of-system approach to reform.  Such an approach will allow us to deliver to the highest international standards; equip learners of all ages to participate and succeed in a changing world; allow Ireland be a leader across a broad range of endeavours; and harness education and training to break down barriers for groups at risk of exclusion.  Such an approach will allow us to achieve our overall ambition.<\/p><p>Reflecting on our high level goals, we have identified key ambitions for the coming years which will represent important milestones of progress.

It can involve research, analysis, action-research or piloting in schools and extensive consultation with stakeholders including students, parents, teacher unions and others.

I am exploring whether the projected timescale for Leaving Certificate Computer Science can be adjusted so that implementation in schools can commence sooner.<\/p>  <p>  At Junior Cycle level a short course on Coding developed by the NCCA is available to schools on an optional basis.

Politics and Society aims to develop the student's ability to be a reflective and active citizen, in a way that is informed by the insights and skills of social and political science.  The introduction of the specification is part of\u00a0my Department's commemoration of 1916 and its commitment to education for sustainable development.  The subject\u00a0will be available to all schools from 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Physical Education is being developed by the NCCA as a full subject that can be assessed for the Leaving Certificate in a manner similar to other subjects.

The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. <\/p><p>I accept that ASTI members had outstanding pay demands and that the deal did not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.\u00a0 However, it did represent significant progress, and the door remains open to the trade union movement seeking to advance this issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.<\/p><p>In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally.  For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods.  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.<\/p><p>Following discussions, the Teachers Conciliation Council published a set of proposals in November for consideration by ASTI members aimed at finding a resolution to their dispute. <\/p><p>The proposals provided ASTI members with an opportunity to benefit from the programme of pay restoration I mentioned above, including the agreement reached with TUI and INTO, which will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. <\/p><p>In addition, there were other immediate undoubted benefits for individual ASTI members in accepting the proposals including:<\/p><p>- Avoiding an increment freeze<\/p><p>- Inclusion of the S&amp;amp;S allowance of &euro;1,592 into the pay scale<\/p><p>- Continued alleviation of the FEMPI Act pay reductions <\/p><p>- The Ward Report measures and a revised sequence for filling posts which enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more easily and quickly than before<\/p><p>- An increase in the quantum of the Croke Park hours that can be worked on other than a whole-school basis<\/p><p>- A review of the usage of the Croke Park hours <\/p><p>- Protection against compulsory redundancy<\/p><p>- The &euro;1,000 increase now being paid to public servants on 1 April 2017, brought forward from 1 September 2017 under the LRA, as a result of Government moves to address the anomaly that arose in the context of the recent Labour Court Recommendations in respect of the Garda Associations.<\/p><p>ASTI members have voted\u00a0to reject the proposals put forward aimed at resolving their dispute and in consequence, to reject the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  It is regrettable that many ASTI members will now suffer permanent financial losses and loss of other benefits as a result of this choice.<\/p><p>The proposals represented the final outcome of the process and there will be no further offer made to ASTI.  The Government is committed to continuing to work with unions inside the agreement in progressing consideration of pay and conditions issues.  The work of the Public Service Pay Commission is now underway in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100080#WRL00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100080#WRL00650"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[10697\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100080#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to improve access to special educational supports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":378,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that funding for special education provision in 2017\u00a0is estimated to\u00a0amount to some &euro;1.68 billion, which is equivalent to over 19% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training and an increase of 12% in spending in the past two years.\u00a0 This funding provides for a range of supports and services including additional learning and resource teaching support, access to\u00a0Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, special transport arrangements, building adaptations, enhanced capitation in special schools and special classes, specialised equipment, additional teacher training\u00a0and the services of the National Educational Psychological Service.<\/p>  <p>  As part the recent\u00a0Budget announcements, I announced that an additional 115 Special Needs Assistants (SNA) posts at an annual cost of &euro;3.75m will be provided for allocation in 2017, bringing the total number of SNAs\u00a0available for allocation to schools to 13,015 to the end of 2017.  This represents an increase of 23% over the numbers\u00a0available in 2011, which was 10,575.

The designation of any performance in the certificate examinations as a' fail' ceased in 1968. <\/p>  <p>  The nature of curricular examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and the procedures currently in place for awarding grades are such that a certain amount of fluctuation in the grade distribution from year to year is to be expected.  Grade distributions are also affected significantly by the proportion of candidates who opt to take the examination at each level.  In particular, if the proportion of candidates opting for Higher level increases, the candidates making this move will tend to be those who were towards the higher achieving end of the Ordinary level distribution and will tend to fall at the lower achieving end of the Higher level distribution.  This will obviously affect the grade distribution at both levels.  Influenced by the combined effect of syllabus change in mathematics, known as Project Maths, and the introduction by the Higher Education Institutions of 'bonus points' for Higher level mathematics, the number of students in recent years presenting for Higher level in Leaving Certificate Mathematics examinations has increased significantly, from 15.8% in 2011 to 28% in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  During the standard-setting process that happens as part of the marking process each year, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) takes account of these and any other relevant factors in the course of satisfying itself that the distribution of grades awarded is appropriate and that it accurately reflects the performance of the candidates in comparison to the achievement standards envisaged when the syllabus was designed.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of a significant migration of mathematics candidates from Ordinary to Higher level, it may be noted that a similar absolute number of candidates awarded E, F or no grade at Ordinary level will inevitably be manifested as a higher percentage, since the total number of candidates at this level has reduced.<\/p>  <p>  The number of candidates who failed to achieve at least a D3 grade at any level of the mathematics examination in 2016, while marginally higher than in the last three or four years, is very similar to the number in the years before that (2009 to 2011, for example).  In the context of the factors mentioned above, there is nothing especially unusual about the grade distribution in mathematics for 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the current syllabus change in mathematics, there has been a deliberate attempt to increase the emphasis on higher-order thinking skills, including interpretation, problem solving, and dealing with the unfamiliar.  These are skills that students find difficult to master and teachers find difficult to instil in students.  The syllabus expectations are ambitious at all levels. <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) will be undertaking a review of the Project Maths initiative, now that the full implementation of all phases of the curricular change is complete.  By this time students will have been through the new maths cycle a few times and the NCCA will have good information on which to base the assessment of its impact, especially on the learning of under-achievers.  I have asked the State Examinations Commission to ensure that any lessons that can be learned from candidate performance in recent examinations, and the 2016 examination in particular, be fed into that review process.  The Project Maths Implementation Support Group, an industry-education partnership set up by my Department, including third level bodies, Engineers Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, will also be able to provide their considered opinions to this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100080#WRL01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Institutes of Technology","counter":392,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100080#WRL01750"},{"type":"question","counter":393,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[10703\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100080#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on the drop out rate in third level institute of technology courses; the measures his Department proposes to remedy the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":394,"content":"<p>In line with the overall mission of higher education in Ireland there has been a steady increase in student enrolments over recent years.\u00a0 The most recent report by the HEA on retention and progression, entitled 'A Study of Progression in Higher Education 2012\/13 to 2013\/14', is available on the HEA website, www.hea.ie.\u00a0 This is the fourth in a series of progression analysis released by the HEA and examines those 1st year undergraduate new entrants enrolled in the academic year 2012\/13 and traces them to the following academic year 2013\/14.\u00a0 The report gives an in-depth analysis of the non-progression rates by NFQ level, sector, discipline, gender, age, nationality and socio-economic group.\u00a0 There are many factors identified as influencing the likelihood of progression such as Gender, Age at commencement, Prior Educational attainment, nationality and socio-economic grouping. <\/p>  <p>  The report shows that 84% of full-time undergraduate new entrants in 2012\/13 progressed to their second year of study in 2013\/14.\u00a0 The rates of non-progression in 2012\/13 varied within and between sectors ranging from 26% and 28% at levels 6 and 7 to 17%, 11% and 6% at level 8 in universities, institutes of technology and colleges respectively. <\/p>  <p>  The report demonstrates that the overall new entrant non-progression rate was 15% in 2007\/08 and has remained constant at 16% from 2010\/11 to 2012\/13.

Despite this the number of female apprentices remains low.<\/p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.\u00a0 In recent months, we have seen the first of these new apprenticeships with the new\u00a0Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship launching in September 2016 and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship\u00a0commencing in November 2016.\u00a0 13 Further new apprenticeships will get underway in 2017, many of which\u00a0are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident that this will lead to a strong increase in female participation when these new apprenticeships are launched. <\/p>  <p>  As set out in the recently published Action Plan to Extend Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, my Department will, in conjunction with SOLAS, review the pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of diverse groups, including female participation, in light of the broadening of the apprenticeship system into new areas.  The review will be completed in 2018 and any recommendations made will be implemented immediately.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the plan to\u00a0expand\u00a0apprenticeship, SOLAS will introduce a new branding and marketing campaign which will, in particular, focus on attracting more women to take up apprenticeships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100081#WRM00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Funding","counter":402,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100081#WRM00350"},{"type":"question","counter":403,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[10706\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100081#WRM00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he has read the USI position paper on the funding of higher education regarding the effects a loan scheme would have on students; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":404,"content":"<p>I am aware of the USI pre-budget submission and its recommendations for increased funding to the sector.

However, it is important to recognize, as the Cassells Report has done, that doing nothing is not an option and that other measures to improve equality of access would also be necessary. <\/p>  <p>  Funding overall for the higher education sector is a key concern for me, particularly in light of the additional pressure that will fall on the system over the next decade or so.

Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0also announced that an additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to\u00a0provision for 7542 posts in the current school year.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend &euro;1.6 billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  It will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils in their school who require such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools\u00a0will be\u00a0provided with total allocation which includes\u00a0a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need \u00a0in each school. <\/p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.\u00a0 This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, as schools will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs based on their school size and profile.\u00a0 This includes provision for junior infants who are newly\u00a0enrolling to the school or pupils who may transfer from another school\u00a0including children to whom the Deputy has referred. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model. By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.\u00a0 Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally\u00a0be adjusted between allocations. <\/p>  <p>  The model\u00a0will, however,\u00a0allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The Inclusion Support Service,\u00a0established under the National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the school&rsquo;s profile has changed very\u00a0significantly since the allocation was made to the school,\u00a0may\u00a0an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. <\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0new Circular will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will advise schools of details of how the appeal process will operate in conjunction with the allocations to schools.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Schools will also be provided with guidance on how to manage their resources to ensure that all pupils who have additional learning needs can be provided with support. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100081#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100081#WRM01350"},{"type":"question","counter":418,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[10739\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100081#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which the school building programme at primary and second level in County Kildare continues to proceed as planned having particular regard to the urgent requirement for school places; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[10740\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100081#WRM01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which he has received communication from the various primary school authorities throughout north Kildare in the context of the provision of new buildings or extra facilities to meet requirements; the extent to which he expects to be in a position to respond in the current year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[10746\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100081#WRM01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which primary school places and class requirements in County Kildare continue to be met; if class sizes fall within the national average; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":421,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 170 and 176 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department consistently monitors demographics to identify where additional school places will be required.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s six-year capital programme priorities building projects for these areas, including County Kildare.

The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014.  <\/p><p>The NCSE has published details of the SNA and Resource Teaching Posts allocated to schools, including schools in Co. Kildare, for the current school year, 2016\/2017, on its website: .<\/p><p>As part the Budget announcements, I announced that an additional 115 SNA posts at an annual cost of &euro;3.75m will be provided for allocation from January to June 2017, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation to schools to 13,015 to the end of 2017, which represents an increase of 23% over the numbers allocated in 2011.  This is a higher level of SNA support than ever before, which ensures that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.  <\/p><p>There are currently over 12,500 learning support and Resource Teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools of which 7430 are Resource Teaching posts; this represents an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers which have been allocated since the 2011\/12 school year, at which point 5265 posts were allocated.  In addition, over 5000 learning support posts have been allocated to schools under the General Allocation Model for primary schools and Learning Support allocations for post primary schools.  I announced that an additional &euro;18 million will be provided in 2017 to provide for around 900 additional resource teacher posts.  <\/p><p>I also announced that, following development and piloting over the past number of years, a new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs will be implemented from September 2017, the aim of which is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  <\/p><p>Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.  <\/p><p>Under the new allocation model schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile.  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school.  A new Circular will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools.<\/p><p>The NCSE, in consultation with the relevant education partners, also has responsibility for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas, as required.  The NCSE continues to engage with schools in relation to opening special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision.  Progress in developing the network of Special Classes has been significant; approximately 150 new Special Classes were sanctioned for the 2016\/17 school year which means there are currently 1,153 special classes in place, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.  There are currently 889 ASD Special Classes which offer a supportive learning environment to students with ASD who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day.  <\/p><p>125 special schools also provide specialist education for those pupils who need it.  <\/p><p>With regard to Kildare in particular, there are 942 students with ASD attending schools in the County, 520 of those attend mainstream schools and are accessing in-school supports including Resource teaching and SNA support, 322 students are attending 59 ASD special classes consisting of 6 early intervention classes, 41 primary ASD classes and 12 post primary ASD classes, while a further 100 students with ASD are placed in 4 special schools.<\/p><p>The NCSE has indicated that it is currently satisfied that there will be sufficient ASD special class placements available to meet demand in the region for the forthcoming school year<\/p><p>The combination of supports provided means that school places are available for all children with special educational needs, including children in County Kildare. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100081#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":433,"content":"<p>Question No. 176 answered with Question No. 169.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":434,"content":"<p>Question No. 177 answered with Question No. 172.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100082#WRN00200"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[10748\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100082#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to continue support for smaller urban or rural schools with a denominational ethos; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>My Department is very aware of the importance of small schools to rural communities and particularly the most dispersed and remote communities. <\/p>  <p>  To sustain primary schools in these communities my Department has a more favourable staffing schedule for small schools that are more than 8km distant from the next nearest school of the same type of patronage and language of instruction.

However, as different methodologies and definitions are used across countries, it is not possible to draw consistent comparisons between Ireland and other countries.<\/p><p>The reasons for lower employment rates are diverse and demand a wide-ranging response.  The CES is designed to increase the numbers of people with disabilities in employment by addressing the barriers to employment and improve pathways to work.  The Department of Social Protection (DSP) actively participated in the development of the strategy and takes a full part in its implementation.  For instance, the DSP provides a wide range of work related supports for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>One of the principal supports is the EmployAbility service, which provides job coach support to people with disabilities in accessing jobs in the open labour market.  Other supports include the provision of employment subsidies through the wage subsidy scheme (WSS), the reasonable accommodation fund, which provides workplace adaptation grants and specialist training courses that are specially designed for people with disabilities, and the partial capacity benefit, which is available to recipients of illness benefit for a minimum of 6 months or invalidity pension to assist them to return to the workplace.  The combined cost of DSP employment supports for people with disabilities is estimated to be in the region of &euro;55 million in 2017.  It should be noted that the employment supports are of a voluntary nature and are tailored to individual circumstances and a person&rsquo;s capacity to engage with education, training or job-search programmes.  <\/p><p>In terms of expenditure on the reasonable accommodation fund, the cost of this programme in 2016 was just under &euro;78,000.  <\/p><p>With regard to extending the wage subsidy scheme to PCB participants, the cost is estimated to be &euro;2.9 million on a full year basis.  Given that under the scheme rules, a WSS payment can only be made where an individual is entering a new job or is in that job for less than 12 months, the costing here relates only to WSS being paid in respect of new PCB participants.  <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the issues for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100085#WRQ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":532,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 210 to 213, inclusive, answered with Question No. 203<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":533,"content":"<p>Question No. 214 answered with Question No. 209.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Applications","counter":534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100085#WRQ01800"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[10562\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100085#WRQ01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will reinstate a rent allowance payment to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":536,"content":"<p>The Department has not, to date, received an application for Rent Supplement from the client concerned.

The rationale for these rates is to prevent young unemployed people from entering longer term welfare dependency by providing a strong financial incentive to take up a job, or a training or education programme.  It should be noted that jobseekers who are under 26 years of age who have children are not subject to the reduced rates of jobseeker's allowance.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) publishes poverty rates for all young people aged 15 to 24 inclusive.  They do not separately report poverty rates for young people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.<\/p>  <p>  The consistent poverty rate for all young people aged 15 to 24 was 15.6% in 2015.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty rate&rsquo; for that cohort which was 28.3% in 2012, fell to 27.7% in 2015 and the &lsquo;deprivation rate&rsquo; for that cohort fell from 32.5% to 31.0% in the same period.<\/p>  <p>  Poverty is strongly linked to unemployment.  The number of young people under the age of 26 on the Live Register has fallen from 48,900 to 29,300 over the two years from December 2014 to December 2016, a reduction of 40.1%.  Similarly, the monthly unemployment rate for 15 to 24 year olds fell from 20.3% to 15.2% over the same period, a reduction of 25%.<\/p>  <p>  It is positive that unemployment among young people is falling at a faster rate than among the general population.  I am determined that we help more young people in the most effective way possible, by supporting them into the workforce, education or training.<\/p>  <p>  For that reason, on Budget Day 2017 I announced additional incentives for young people to participate in education.  From September 2017 when a young jobseeker participates on the Back to Education scheme, he or she will be entitled to receive the full maximum rate of jobseeker's payment, which will then be &euro;193 per week, as against the &euro;160 which they are currently on.  This is the largest single increase in the social welfare package and demonstrates our commitment to young jobseekers who seek to enhance their skills.<\/p>  <p>  As part of my Budget 2017 package, I also announced changes to the minimum contribution for young persons in receipt of rent supplement and reduced rates of weekly social welfare from January 2017, of which there are approximately 500 cases.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum rent contribution which a young single person aged 18-24 years receiving a payment of &euro;100 per week is expected to pay has been reduced from &euro;30 to &euro;10 per week.  The minimum contribution for those young people in receipt of a weekly payment of &euro;144 or &euro;160 per week has been reduced from &euro;30 to &euro;20 per week.  Similarly, reductions have been applied to the rate of contribution for couples.  The minimum contribution for these persons will remain at these new lower levels when the increase in the weekly payment rates is applied in March 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, the Department may make a single Exceptional Needs Payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income- including support towards rent deposits.  In 2016, the Department made approximately 2,800 payments of rent deposits\/rent in advance at a cost of almost &euro;1.8 million, of which almost 570 payments at a cost of over &euro;371,000 were made to persons aged under 26 years.  This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs.<\/p>  <p>  The review of jobseeker's allowance rates for young persons under 26 years of age which is currently underway will examine the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training, employment programmes and opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring my Department identifies effective measures to incentivise and support young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  The best way to do this is through engagement processes and by incentivising them to avail of educational and training opportunities, thereby enhancing their employment prospects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100086#WRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":556,"content":"<p>Question No. 222 answered with Question No. 209.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Statistics","counter":557,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100086#WRR01500"},{"type":"question","counter":558,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[10722\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100086#WRR01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the deprivation rate for persons with a disability here; how this compares with the EU average; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1262","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":559,"content":"<p>In the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), disability is based on the concept of global activity limitation.  This is defined as a &ldquo;limitation in activities people usually do because of health problems for at least the past six months&rdquo;.  The latest EU-SILC data available shows that severe material deprivation for people (aged 16 years and over) who are limited in their normal activities due to a health problem was 15% in Ireland in 2014, as compared to the EU average of 12.1%.  Ireland ranks 18th of the 28 member states.<\/p>  <p>  EUROSTAT has not, as yet, published comparable data across the Member States for 2015.  The recently published SILC report from CSO for 2015 showed a slight increase over the year in &ldquo;basic deprivation&rdquo; (a broader definition than the EU's &ldquo;severe deprivation&rdquo; measure) from 51.3% to 53.2% for people in households headed by a disabled person.  However, these figures (like other statistics for very small groups in the survey) have been volatile in recent years.  This is due to smaller sample sizes.  It is not possible to say with certainty whether the changes over the year are statistically significant and indicative of a sustained trend.<\/p>  <p>  Given the continuing economic recovery throughout 2015 and measures introduced in the Budgets since 2015, it is reasonable to expect future figures to show improvements.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  The Department will review the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing the employment opportunities for people with a disability.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities adopts a cross-government approach that brings together various measures, to be taken by different Departments and State agencies, in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on the employment of people with disabilities.  The six strategic priorities are to: build skills, capacity and independence; provide bridges and supports into work; make work pay; promote job retention and re-entry into work; provide co-ordinated and seamless support; and engage employers.  These priorities are incorporated into the Pathways to Work Strategy and this ensures that there is an integrated focus on supports that enable people with disabilities to participate in employment where they have the capacity to do so.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of specific income, activation and employment supports for people with a disability.  For instance, the partial capacity benefit scheme enables recipients of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take-up employment, on a voluntary basis, while continuing to receive income support.  The Department manages a supported employment service (EmployAbility) which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities.  Intreo services are also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  There is also a focus on supports available to employers who employ people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Workplace Equipment Adaption Grant Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100086#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Payments","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100086#WRR01800"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[10731\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100086#WRR01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) who applied for carer's allowance in June 2016 will receive their back payment to the date on which they applied; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":562,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[10732\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100086#WRR02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his views on whether it is satisfactory that a person (details supplied) has to wait seven months to have their carer's application reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":563,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 and 225 together.<\/p><p>My Department received an application for carer's allowance (CA) from the person concerned on 27 January 2016.<\/p><p>CA is a means-tested social assistance payment, made to persons who are providing full-time care and attention to a person who has a disability such that they require that level of care.<\/p><p>A person can be considered to be providing full-time care and attention where they are engaged in employment, self-employment or on training courses outside the home for a maximum of 15 hours per week, provided that they can show to the satisfaction of a deciding officer that adequate care has been provided for the care recipient in their absence.<\/p><p>This application was refused on 26 May 2016 as the person concerned was engaged on a Vocational Training Opportunity Scheme (VTOS) which involved full-time education amounting to 30 hours per week.<\/p><p>The person concerned requested a review of this decision on 30 May 2016 and submitted additional evidence to show that she had ceased education after her exams on 3 May 2016.

It will be particularly important to engage with the clinical community in the development of a framework.<\/p><p>- Department of Health officials are examining legislative changes that will be required to underpin the access programme.<\/p><p>I now intend to progress the establishment of this access programme as a priority but to be clear, patients accessing cannabis through the cannabis access programme will need to be recommended for cannabis treatment by a relevant clinician involved in the patient's care. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100088#WRT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100088#WRT01350"},{"type":"question","counter":624,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[10532\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100088#WRT01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to an application to the primary care reimbursement service for the FreeStyle Libre system to be made available under the medical card and long-term illness\u00a0scheme; when a decision will be reached on this application; and if he will ensure this device will be made available.","asker":"1239","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":625,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100088#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":626,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100088#WRT01550"},{"type":"question","counter":627,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[10533\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100088#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps he is taking to ensure quality of care in the case of severe waiting times for access to the HSE's child and adolescent mental health services in Counties Sligo and Leitrim; his plans to increase and maintain staffing of child and adolescent mental health services in Counties Sligo and Leitrim to maintain a standard of care and to take into account retirement and recruitment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":628,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100088#WRT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[10534\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100088#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the increased number of suicidal adolescents awaiting access to the HSE's child and adolescent mental health services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>CAMHS supports timely access to services, following professional clinical assessment and prioritisation, to address mental health needs of children.

The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Gardasil is the HPV vaccine used in the HSE schools immunisation programme.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.

Under the terms of this agreement, funding is being provided for safe storage, education and\u00a0signage and communications to promote and support the recycling of electrical and electronic waste through the retail take back system. <\/p><p>While I understand that this agreement has recently been renewed, my Department is not a party to it and has no role in disseminating such an agreement to the retail sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100092#WRX01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Prices","counter":754,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100092#WRX01850"},{"type":"question","counter":755,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[10597\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100092#WRX01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the progress being made to standardise electricity standing charges and unit costs and eliminating extra costs of electricity for rural consumers.","asker":"1318","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":756,"qnumday":296,"qnumall":"[10596\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100092#WRX02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the steps envisaged in equalising electricity prices throughout the country and providing equal priced electricity to rural and urban consumers, in view of the reduction in cost of fuel for generating electricity over the past number of years outlined on RTE recently.","asker":"1318","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":757,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 and 296 together.<\/p>  <p>  I have no statutory function in the setting or review of electricity or gas prices.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises\u00a0in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband of\u00a0a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging\u00a0investment by the telecoms sector, which is\u00a0continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Knockavilla, Oughterleague,\u00a0Ballinamona, Ballygarrane, Ballywalter, Bishopswood,\u00a0\u00a0Clonaspoe, Clonkelly, Cumask, Killenure, kilmore Lower, Kilmore upper\u00a0and Lisloran\u00a0are in the\u00a0AMBER area.

Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.\u00a0 A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.

As the report suggests, the issue of security of supply is extremely important, and preserving the existing structures with the UK is the best way to ensure this security.  In this regard, the continued secure trade in energy between the UK, and Ireland as part of the 27 Member States of the EU, is a priority for me.<\/p><p>To underpin the security of supply, Ireland has existing intergovernmental agreements with the UK in relation to trade in natural gas across the two interconnectors connecting Ireland with Scotland.  In addition to these bilateral agreements, there are agreements and protocols in place between the transmission system operators in Ireland and Great Britain. <\/p><p>In addition, natural gas is now being provided to the Irish market from the Corrib gas field off the coast of Mayo.  Prior to the advent of Corrib, over 95% of our gas was imported, via the two gas interconnectors, from Great Britain.\u00a0 In the short term, Corrib can meet over half of Ireland's gas demand.\u00a0 However, our gas import dependency is likely to increase again when Corrib depletes.  It is important to emphasise that, after Brexit, Ireland will still be connected by the same gas interconnectors with the UK, and will still be importing gas from the UK.<\/p><p>The Oxford Institute report goes on to say that, if the existing arrangements<font color=\"#1F497D\"> <\/font>with the UK, which is the cheapest way to provide security of supply to Irish consumers, are not preserved, an LNG regasification terminal might be needed.  I agree that the potential benefits of importing LNG directly onto the island of Ireland, and also the role of natural gas storage, should be examined in the context of Brexit.  However, LNG is just one of the options that will be considered to ensure our security of supply. <\/p><p>My Department has recently commenced the process of developing a report to identify options in order to ensure Ireland's resilience to a long-term gas and electricity disruption.  This was partly prompted by the fact that, prior to Corrib, over 95% of our gas was coming from a single source - the UK.  Although not impacting on the physical structures in place for the supply of gas, the emergence of Brexit is an additional factor that needs to be considered.  Part of this report will identify potential options to improve resilience, including the potential for LNG, storage, interconnection and fuel diversification.  All options, including LNG, will be given full consideration to ensure the best options, at least cost to the consumer, are identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100093#WRY00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Codes","counter":771,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100093#WRY01000"},{"type":"question","counter":772,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[10717\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100093#WRY01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that in devising Eircode, the postcodes assigned to certain addresses around the country do not reflect the county the property is in but rather the county assigned to it by An Post in a postal distribution system based on the railway lines dating to the 19th century; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that many property owners are reluctant to use their postcode for this reason; his plans to address this anomaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":773,"content":"<p>Capita Business Support Services Ireland, trading as Eircode, was awarded a 10 year contract in December 2013 to develop, implement, maintain and promote the use of the National Postcode System &quot;Eircode&quot;.<\/p><p>All postal addresses, geographical addresses and geo-locations are provided to Eircode from authoritative sources, namely An Post and Ordnance Survey Ireland through their subsidiary company An Post GeoDirectory.<\/p><p>Eircode does not change existing addresses and the Eircode can be added to the address normally used for the property.
