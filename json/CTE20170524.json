On behalf of the committee, I warmly welcome all the MEPs who have managed to be here today.  This is a very important engagement for us as a committee.  We follow all the work of the MEPs in Brussels and Strasbourg and we hear how hard they all work on the very many issues they deal with.  In some ways, we mirror that hear, so it is important for us to join together periodically.  Of course, they are always welcome to join our discussions and meetings but by virtue of their work and the need to be in Brussels and Strasbourg, we realise this is often very challenging.  This will be a slightly different engagement in that the MEPs are not witnesses in the traditional sense; rather, it is an open engagement.  They are all very much at the coalface of European developments, so we appreciate their willingness to share any views, advice or recommendations they have.<\/p><p>I will go off the script and say to the MEPs that I and the committee are very grateful to them for taking time to be here.  I was very glad earlier to be with Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, the Ceann Comhairle and our Vice Chairman and to congratulate Ms McGuinness very much on her recent appointment and wish her the best of luck.  When we came back from our trip to meet all the MEPs recently, the Senators were quick to put it on the record of the Seanad, and we Deputies to put it on the record of the D&aacute;il, that we are very proud of our MEPs.  Whether they be Independent, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in or whatever, we are supportive of the work they do.  At this critical time of Brexit, I believe that now more than ever there is a very important focus on the work our MEPs do and the representation they give us on the European stage, so it is great to have them here and I very much appreciate their presence.<\/p><p>Before we proceed with the engagement, I must read out a reminder on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p> On how we might structure this engagement, six items were suggested by members of the committee and Members of the European Parliament: the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments; the White Paper on the future of Europe; the EU budget and the Multi-Annual Financial Framework after 2020; the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union; amendments to Regulation No. 883\/2004 on the co-ordination of the social security systems; and the European pillar of social rights.  I propose that we cover these in order and have an open and frank discussion on them.  The first item is the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments.<\/p><p> Considering the role of Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, I invite her to start the discussion.  I aim to keep the meeting to approximately one hour and 20 minutes, if possible and within reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#A00400","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495630800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to open the discussion, principally because of my role in the European Parliament, namely, that of Vice President, responsible for relationships with national parliaments.  I also thank the committee for its recent engagement.  Since the Brexit vote, we have had deeper engagement, not only with colleagues in the Oireachtas but also Members of many national parliaments.  Perhaps it is something on which we need to build.  We always say we could communicate better and meet more often.  Today should be more about how we do it rather than the aspiration because committee members and I want to work better with national parliaments.<\/p> <p>  All of thee issues are linked.  The first will have an impact on all of the others on the agenda.  The future of Europe depends on our having stronger and deeper relationships with national parliaments.  We would like to be here more often and perhaps committee members would like to be in Brussels more often too, but it is just not possible.  Therefore, we have to find other ways.  We have formal structures.  I will be with some of my colleagues here in Malta for the national parliaments meeting at the beginning of next week.  Committee members come to Brussels.  It is the informal engagement we need to deepen.  Perhaps we need to consider engagement with specific committees, be they on agriculture, agriculture policy or other matters.  Fisheries, for example, will be a significant concern in the Brexit negotiations.<\/p> <p>  Ironically, Brexit has brought national parliaments closer to the European Parliament because they need to understand our role and we need to understand theirs.  Let us build on this and hope we can have a stronger relationship that will work for people.

Part of the failing that led to Brexit was a lack of true engagement with citizens.  Subsequent to the vote, we found out that many of them were googling, \"What is the EU?\"  One of the ways to communicate further with citizens is through national parliaments.  If we have closer liaison and discussion, we will obviously have closer relationships with citizens.  One cannot bypass national parliaments or regional governments at European level and say one is going to engage with citizens directly.<\/p> <p>  My next point is on legislation.  The more input we have at national parliament level, the better our legislation will be.  Many of the proposals we receive have a direct impact on individual countries.  While we often engage with vested interests and stakeholders, we probably do not have enough direct input from national parliaments.  We receive it from the Permanent Representation which does a great job in Europe, but perhaps we should have more discussion at committee level with the elected representatives on how we should proceed.  All that would help us to create a Europe that was more connected to its citizens through more engagement with national parliaments.  Committee members have made a great start by coming to meet us.  We have come to meet them.  That has to be positive and we look forward to further engagement.<\/p> <p>  It might not be the sexiest thing ever to be involved in European affairs because it does not always attract the attention of the media.  Nevertheless, it is very important because most of our legislation - 60% - starts at European level.  Therefore, we have to communicate properly with the directly elected Members of national parliaments.  That is a good start.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#B00500","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495630800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will be brief as we do not have much time.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with what Ms McGuinness said: in a way, today should be about how we communicate and what specific channels we can put in place.  As Mr. Kelly said, dealing with legislation at European level is not all that high profile, but ultimately it is our work.  For example, one of the items on the agenda is the co-ordination of social security, pertaining to Regulation No. 883\/2004, which I am shadowing in the main committee for my group.  I would welcome very much an opportunity to meet interested Members of the Oireachtas from the relevant committee to discuss issue.  The co-ordination of social security is a very important issue.  If we want to discuss it later, I will be happy to do so.  For now I am staying with the question of how we communicate.<\/p> <p>  I was very pleased recently to see a reasoned opinion from both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad on the restructuring directive.  They stated it did not comply with the principle of subsidiarity.  During the years I have seen many reasoned opinions from other parliaments.  I am sure the Oireachtas has issued them in respect of other committees, but the one I saw was one of the first pertaining to mine.  It is a sign that this committee is fully and totally engaged at this point of the process, which is before it even comes to the Parliament.  It is happening slowly.  At one time I was a member of this committee sitting on the other side.  I note that there is a huge difference between then and now.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kelly talked about citizens.  As Members of the European Parliament, one of the things we can and often do is ensure access for citizens to the Commission on various issues.  All of us do this regularly on matters that affect citizens and also Members of the Oireachtas.  On my way in to the meeting I met Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice and we discussed a certain issue.  Mr. Luke \"Ming\" Flanagan is also involved.  It is about the abstraction of water from Lough Talt in County Sligo.  Irish Water is linking with the Commission, as are we, to determine whether we can find a solution to a local problem.  It happens at different levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Harkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation, particularly the four representatives from my region.  The longest serving is Ms Marian Harkin who was in the old Connacht-Ulster constituency, followed by Ms Mairead McGuinness.  Mr. Luke \"Ming\" Flanagan and Mr. Matt Carthy are new Members.  The region is very well represented today and I am very impressed.  I also welcome Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly who represents the South constituency.  Also welcome is Ms Martina Anderson who is from Derry and represents the North.  This is the first time we have engaged with her.<\/p> <p>  During the years we have dealt with all sorts of issue such as the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties, but we never thought we would be dealing with Brexit.  When I was a Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing, we were dealing with the Single European Act.  It was a long time ago, but my point is that the British were so engaged and involved that there was no debate and no divisions as such.  They have contributed so much to the European Union in the past 30 or 40 years that their exit is quite a blow.  We will not go into that matter as the facts are facts and we are where we are.<\/p> <p>  The European Parliament will play a more important role than ever before as far as Brexit is concerned.  Its Members, especially Vice President Mairead McGuinness, are in a particularly good position to link with the other parliaments.  Consider the matter of trying to explain our situation, involving trade worth &euro;1.2 billion per week and a 499 km Border with the North.  From my experience of attending COSAC meetings which the Chairman has also attended, I believe nobody is particularly concerned about us.  When I was in Estonia recently, I was told that there were 70,000 Estonians working in the United Kingdom and that they would not enjoy the free movement arrangement the Irish would have when the negotiations were completed, as if to say, \"Don't cry for me Argentina; you are doing okay.\"<\/p><p> There is a long way to go.  As I understand, the European Parliament's decision has to be unanimous, or at least by a majority vote in the European Parliament.  We have only so many MEPs.  They do all they can, but it is a small number in a big house.  Looking down the road, Spain has a veto over Gibraltar.  Can someone please explain to me how they could get a veto over Gibraltar when we do not have a veto as far as Northern Ireland is concerned?  That surprises me, and perhaps someone could try to extract that somewhere along the line.  <\/p><p> Finally, it might be a political point from the witnesses point of view, but we will be losing our MEPs from Northern Ireland.  Will the British MEPs be redistributed?  In that case, we would end up with only a single extra MEP, as I understand it.  We have a very strong case of claiming the Northern jurisdiction, and that three MEPs should be elected from our constituency to represent the people of Northern Ireland in the European Parliament in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#B00700","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I welcome everyone here today.  It is great to see all the MEPs representing all the parts of the island.  On the relationship between the national Parliament and the European Parliament and where all this is ending, in the past year or so Brexit has focused people's attention on the growth of a very right wing ideology in many parts of Europe.  In many places that ideology is very racist and xenophobic and is throwing up all the things with which we have serious issues.  Its growth is based on dissatisfaction among many people in many member states, particularly on the periphery, regarding their economic circumstances, where they see Europe going, and how they consider the European structures as something that are distant from them and not something with which it is easy to engage.  I welcome what Ms Harkin said and that there are efforts being made in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The impression among many people is that Europe is an elite club and not something that ordinary people have either access to or a good relationship with.  If we are really serious about doing something around Brexit and all the issues which flow from it, we need to look at that seriously.  It is not only the responsibility of the people elected to the European Parliament, but also to the people elected to all the other parliaments, to try to ensure the direction in which all this is going is arrested and brought back so that people will once again feel that the European institutions are for them.  Would the witnesses agree that we need to have a greater level of accountability, transparency and supervision of all the European policies that flow to places like this committee from Europe?  We regularly have to scrutinise various directives and information that come from Europe and the nub of the issue is the attempt, particularly by France and Germany and the bigger countries who they seem to come together, do deals on the future of Europe and then dictate to other countries what will happen.  I would like the MEPs' views on this aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#C00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I welcome the MEPs.  It is rare for some of them to get back to Dublin or Ireland on a Wednesday, but green weeks are made for things such as this and it is great to have everyone here.<\/p> <p>  On the level of engagement between the Oireachtas and the European Parliament, this is the second time we have met this year following our trip to Brussels.  There have been various other opportunities either within our own political families or otherwise, but we do not meet enough.  We need a lot more engagement not only with this committee, but all the sectoral committees shadowing the work the MEPs are doing in their committees.  Do the MEPs have any thoughts or solutions as to how we might better achieve that?  Previously, this committee would have met on a Thursday to try to facilitate those returning, but that is not feasible either.  We also tried the dial-in mechanism once or twice.  Could we see how we might work more closely as Deputy Martin Kenny said, on directives or legislation not on a party basis, but on a committee or representational basis?  Similarly, this would apply if they are working on reports or opinions which are coming into the European Parliament and which we will then have to scrutinise.  How can we work together and occasionally put on the green jersey, to use that horrible phrase?<\/p> <p>  It will become really apparent with the ECJ ruling, issued two weeks ago, regarding upcoming trade deals.  We have had fairly feisty exchanges in this committee over CETA and TTIP.  We have disagreed and that is fine, but we all agreed that there was not the necessary level of scrutiny of those trade deals.  From those of us of my political background, as a keen supporter, we are constantly fighting a battle but those who oppose those deals are saying that we do not discuss them enough.  How can we ensure that those deals are discussed in order to identify potential problems or issues or to sell them?  This is a responsibility that national parliaments will have to adopt and it sums up the crossroads that the EU is at now.  For so long, support was taken for granted, yet in this country we have seen in our referendums that we do not have a great history in that regard.  We see in its ultimate conclusion, Brexit, that people have lost faith in the European institutions, although some of them never had faith in the first place, or it was taken for granted.  Aside from the obvious core positives, when people think of Europe, they think only of endless directives or myths about straight bananas and ridiculous things like that.  The level of disengagement is extremely worrying.  <\/p> <p>  I spoke about the Oireachtas, the European Parliament and hopefully the Assembly working closer together, where possible. in the future, but also within national parliaments.  The Council of Europe, on which Senator Leyden still sits, has delegates from national parliaments and in the history of the European Parliament, there were delegates from the Oireachtas until the dual mandate was abolished in 2007.  We very rarely get to meet our counterparts in other EU parliaments.  We have had a lot of engagement with people from the House of Commons and the House of Lords in recent months for obvious reasons but, bar the occasional visit from the big counties, by which I mean Germany and France which are sending delegations here - they are very welcome and it is perhaps eye-opening - how can the European Parliament fill that gap through national parliamentarians from the soon-to-be 27 member states engaging either within their political families or none, depending on where they belong?  We need to know what EU affairs committees are doing in Spain, Estonia or Croatia to see how we can act.  There is co-ordination at European Parliament level and a history there, but we will have to have greater engagement.  National parliamentarians are required to engage under the Lisbon treaty and the recent ECTA dealings, but how do we facilitate that?  Do the MEPs have any suggestions on how we might bring about that greater co-operation?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#C00300","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>It is great to see the MEPs here today.  Normally when I am at committees such as this or discussing these matters in the Seanad, I am one of the few who voted to remain but it is good to see a fellow-Remainer here in Martina Anderson MEP today.  I recently travelled to Brussels with a delegation from Border Communities Against Brexit and we met most of the MEPs.  Unfortunately Luke \"Ming\" Flanagan MEP was tied up on that day so it is good that we can engage with him this afternoon.  I was in the Seanad for a debate earlier so I am slightly late and I apologise.<\/p> <p>  In the course of all our engagements on the issue of Brexit, the Good Friday Agreement must have primacy.  I have serious concerns on the nature of what the European Union's constitutional affairs committee referred to as an alteration of the Good Friday Agreement as a result of Brexit.  I have raised this in the Seanad and at the Seanad's Brexit committee with a range of people who have come in to present to us.  I have deep reservations about such a unilateral move, and the legality and political intent of that undermining and alteration of the Good Friday Agreement, which is the result of a vote taken by people by this State to endorse its structures and its all-Ireland and east-west strands.<\/p><p>Do the witnesses have a view on that statement by the committee?  What is the outworking of that and what can MEPs continue to do to ensure that unilateral and unwanted alteration of the Agreement's structures does not take place?<\/p><p> What is becoming increasingly apparent regardless of the nuanced views on Brexit and its complexities is the growing consensus that there are two ways to mitigate against a hard Brexit.  A blind man on a galloping horse could see that we are in for a hard Brexit.  That is the political and ideological trajectory of the Tory party in England.  As mandated by the D&aacute;il, one of the ways to mitigate against it is a special designated status.  What engagements have the MEPs had on that proposal?  How has it been received?  What would it look, taste and smell like for people living across the island?<\/p><p> The second way to mitigate against a hard and unwanted Brexit is the natural outworking of the Good Friday Agreement, that is, a poll on Irish reunification.  In some of my dialogue and engagement in Brussels recently, that featured in discussions with colleagues from across the EU and the political spectrum.  It is a perfectly legitimate democratic aspiration and we should not be sitting back waiting for it to happen.  Rather, we should modestly or, indeed, proactively work to try to bring it about.<\/p><p> What struck me about the North's 56% vote to remain was that it came from all shades of political, traditional and cultural backgrounds.  The recent attainment of a guarantee that Ireland in its entirety will be returned to the EU if and when we reunify the country will add considerable food for thought for people.

I am delighted to be present.  This is the first time that I have had an opportunity to present to the committee.  As members know, Brexit negotiations formally commence on 19 June, 11 days after the election.  It is important that we get a clear and, where possible, united view among everyone here not just among MEPs or committee members, but across all political parties in Leinster House.<\/p> <p>  Brexit is incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement.  Of that there is no doubt, and we must all be clear on that point.  Consider the strands of the Agreement.  For instance, the Assembly does not have the power to establish its own laws.  That is incompatible with EU law.  Of the six North-South implementation bodies over areas of co-operation, take the Food Safety Promotion Board as an example.  How do we deal with the prospect of having two different regulatory standards on this island?  That is where the damage will begin.<\/p> <p>  The British Government is driving towards a hard Brexit, which means a hard Border and hardship for the people of this island, particularly in the North.  We have had benign soundbites about there being no hard Border, but we must ensure that, as the European Parliament's resolution stated, there is no hardening of the Border.<\/p> <p>  Senator Leyden mentioned our relatively small number of MEPs, yet we were able to secure 516 MEPs' support for the preservation of the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts.  That means something - that there would be no hardening of the Border and the unique and special circumstances.  We have been on a diplomatic offensive since before the vote.<\/p> <p>  I will give the committee an insight into the negotiations.  I am working closely with the steering committee in the European Parliament and other MEPs have relationships with some of its members.  We have been able to insert into the negotiations the issues of transparency, strengthening the reference in the Council guidelines to rights and standards and the requirement that nothing undermine the objective and commitment of the Good Friday Agreement.  Regarding a point that Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised, this competes and conflicts with a report from the European Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs, AFCO, which asserted that Brexit required an alteration to the Good Friday Agreement.

We know the damage and danger of doing that and where it would take us.<\/p> <p>  The committee members are probably aware of the key priorities, given that they have been outlined: citizenship and people; finance; and Ireland.  Much focus and attention are being given to the situation in Ireland.  Europe is very aware of the peace process, including the political process and the Good Friday Agreement.  It has contributed to peace funding via PEACE I, II, III and IV.  We all have particular views on Europe and the need for Europe and we critics engage with the EU.  It needs reform and there are differences in opinion as to how that reform should proceed.  Today, however, I will focus primarily on the implications of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  The negotiations will follow a four-week cycle or rhythm.  The first week will be the preparation stage, which will involve the European Parliament.  The second week will be an exchange of documents between the EU and the British Government.  The third week will entail four or five days of intensive negotiation and the fourth week will see a debriefing, which will involve the European Parliament again.  The European Parliament will book-end every four-week period.<\/p> <p>  There is a clustering of committees.  The first round of negotiations, which will deal primarily with citizens' rights, will involve the employment committee, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, LIBE, of which I am a member, and the Committee on Legal Affairs, JURI.  Like Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, I have an Irish passport.  I do not have a British passport.  In fact, I have two Irish passports because I have been afforded the opportunity to have a diplomatic passport by the Irish Government.  I speak on behalf of more than 500,000 in the North who have Irish passports.  Therefore, we are EU citizens and the issue of reciprocal rights must be addressed in the context of preserving and protecting the rights of those in the North.<\/p> <p>  There must be public debate.  We got the issue of transparency included in the negotiations, so we must advance the public debate when the negotiations formally commence until 19 June.  If there are to be four strands of focus in the negotiations and one of those is the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts, we call on the Irish Government to ensure that there is no hardening of the Border.  We hear nonsense about a \"frictionless\" Border, whatever that means, and other terminology.  We cannot have a hardening of the Border.<\/p> <p>  The EU refers to the need to protect the integrity of the Single Market.  Obviously, it does not want cheap and unregulated produce coming from Britain.  Britain is not self-sufficient in terms of food, so the concern is that Britain will engage in trade deals to import cheap food that will not meet the same regulatory standards.  Therefore, the whole island of Ireland will need to be protected.<\/p> <p>  We must consider where the Border can and should be located.  The South will need mitigation measures, including financial support.<\/p><p>If a border is erected, it should be in the Irish Sea, not on the island of Ireland.  As Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and others have touched on, if the Good Friday Agreement is to count for anything, the principle of consent needs to be considered.  We were guaranteed in the Agreement that the constitutional position of the island and of the North would not change unless we gave our consent.  That was a big pill for republicans - who believe that the country and the people are sovereign - to swallow but we swallowed it in the context of the support for the Agreement.  We did not consent to Brexit.  This will be the biggest constitutional change to happen in Ireland since partition.  We need to engage and talk about how to take forward the choice that has been given to us and outlined in the Agreement through a unity poll because it is clear with each passing day that an increasing number of people are talking about what form and shape the new Ireland would take.  We need to engage those who have concerns about that.  We would like the Government to adopt the position of the D&aacute;il to seek special designated special status for the North within the EU.  The majority voted for that and the majority of political parties in the Assembly are anti-Brexit.  We need to ensure that becomes the Government's position.  I could talk for Ireland on this issue and I appreciate the opportunity to engage with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Martina Anderson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Luke \"Ming\" Flanagan, MEP and we will try to move the agenda on to the White Paper on the Future of Europe and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#E00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495630800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us.  The pleasure is all mine.  The more often we do this, the better.  Senator Richmond asked a good question about what we can do to improve this co-ordination, and he answered it by saying green week is the perfect week to do it.  We need to find the time and we should meet between four and eight times a year.  Currently, I am covering files on land use, land-use change and forestry, which will impact on the number of forests grown in Leitrim in order that people can intensify in Tipperary.  We need to have a debate.  I am shadowing a file on fertilisers that could lead to a change to the nitrates directive, which could solve our problems with spreading slurry based on the calendar rather than when it is or is not raining.  All that is going on.  I am also drafting a document on whistleblowing in the environmental sector for the environment committee.  That needs to be brought to this committee in order that we can have an exchange of views and in order that MEPs can show what they are doing.  It would ensure MEPs are trying hard and are doing what the people of Ireland want us to do, rather than simply taking decisions in the dark.  There is a danger of that unless we engage more with the committee.  We have the time to do it because of these green weeks and we have to find the time to do it.<br\/><br\/>As many speakers have said, we have engaged more with the EU and spoken more about it since the Brexit referendum.  Connected to the relationship with the European Parliament and national parliaments is the fact that our national broadcaster, to which we are forced to pay a licence fee, which would be fine if it carried out its mandate, does not show what happens in the European Parliament except for a time at which people arrive home from the pub when they are drunk or just before they go to bed.  The European Union and what happens in its institutions is vitally important to us.  It is a sick joke that RTE will not broadcast coverage of them at a time everyone can watch it.  If 12 midnight is prime time for current affairs, why are &quot;Prime Time&quot; and other current affairs programme not on then?  They are not because nobody would watch them.  If a politician's goal is to make people fond of the European Union and its institutions, hiding what we do has proven to be a major success.  There was 88% support for the EU in the most recent poll.  Why would RTE want to show what MEPs are doing and talk about the EU?  If we talked about the EU, people might be a little more sceptical and questioning of it.  I suggest that in the immediate aftermath of the Famine, people in Ireland knew more about what was happening in the House of Commons than they do about what is happening in the European Parliament now.  I have visited schools over the past number of years where I have spoken to educated people.  They do not have a clue about what we do or what the parliament is about.  They do a brilliant job teaching children but very few of them know anything about this topic.Two years ago, I was asked by a businessman whether I was still the Mayor of Roscommon.  Perhaps that is my fault.  However, we need to get people to engage.  We need to stop hiding the EU and the European Parliament and put them on national television.  We also need to come in and out of this committee room.  I need to hear the opinions of members on proposals such LULUCF.  Most people do not know what is that.<br\/><br\/>Last year, we celebrated 100 years since the seed was planted that grew into this State and what that meant.  The European Parliament is currently planting a seed.  We are deciding and what seed we will plant and what fertiliser to put on it as we discuss the White Paper on the Future of Europe.  Have members heard about it?  If not, they should google it and there will be a few hits from around the world.The <i>Longford Leader <\/i>and the <i>Roscommon People<\/i>are in the top ten.  This is about our future and where Europe will be in 2025.  No one is talking about that and it is as though that does not matter but the committee needs to discuss its consequences.  We are not going to carry on as we are because that is not working.  The second outcome is nothing but the Single Market.  Many countries might like that but others will not.  The third is those who want to do more should do more, the fourth is do less more efficiently and the fifth is to do much more together.  This debate has been going on since 1 March.  There is meant to be a series of debates on the future of Europe.  Where is it?  Nobody is able to tell me.  It is important that we talk about this because doing much more together, according to the document, means full engagement with NATO.  I would prefer to go with the third option.  We need a debate in the Oireachtas and on our airwaves about what are the other political parties' preferred options because we do not know.  I have done a tour of all the local radio stations - there is no chance the national stations would want to talk about it -  and each of them said they would ask their local politicians their opinion on the White Paper.  I have heard nothing since.  I would love to know those opinions and that is why it is important to engage.  It was important to engage last year to celebrate the Centenary but it is even more important to engage now to make sure we do not sleepwalk into a united states of Europe if that is not something we wish to do.  Some people were called conspiracy theorists when they came out with this in the past but it is down in black and white in the White Paper and we need to talk about it.<br\/><br\/>From the point of view of our budgets, it will mean we will be in the same position I was as a member of Roscommon County Council.  Ireland will get a block grant, centrally decided and we will have to take it or leave it.  Perhaps the majority of people will think that is a wonderful idea but we do not know because we have not consulted them.  I have asked a series of people where this dialogue will take place.  I asked Commissioner Hogan at the launch of the White Paper and he suggested that the MEPs, including me, do it. I asked the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and he reckoned that it would be a divisive process.  That was not really very hopeful.<\/p><p>Last week I asked Jean-Claude Juncker where the process was but he could not tell me.  Two days' later, in the plenary in the European Parliament, I asked Donald Tusk.  We are a country with 88% support for the EU and one would imagine we would be only delighted to do this.  What did Donald Tusk say?  He did not answer the question.  All of this is going on now and we definitely need to know about it.  The best way to know about it is for us to come in here more often and engage with the committee.<\/p><p> Maybe someone can tell me where this process will take place because it will go back to the European Parliament by September.  It will have discussed it with us at that stage.  In its own words, it will have \"harvested\" our opinions, which it sounds like something from that sci-fi, \"V\" but, by September, it will not be doing that anymore.  Tick, tock, we have three months left.  It is time we engaged.<\/p><p> I am a sceptic, I ask questions and I am proud to say that.  I want to work with our European neighbours but I would like people to engage in what that means.  What does it mean when 88% say they are in favour of the EU?  Does it mean they want their children to end up in a European army?  Does it mean they do not want budgets?  What does it mean?  We need to know that because it is kind of important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Luke 'Ming' Flanagan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I now call the MEP, Mr. Matt Carthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#F00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495630800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Cheann Comhairle agus an choiste as ucht an deis a thabhairt dom labhairt anseo inni&uacute;.  I thank the committee for the invitation.  I agree, without repeating what has been said, that this is an important engagement that should be repeated as often as possible.<\/p> <p>  We are in a big, arguably defining moment in the European Union.  At some point in the not-too-distant future, there will be treaty change and that treaty will, more than likely, have to be put to the Irish people.  I hope when it comes to that point, we will have a national conversation that deals with the content and direction of that treaty and that we can make an informed decision, but we need to start that conversation before the referendum is called and the treaty is effectively locked down because we know what will happen at that occasion.  We will be told we need to vote \"Yes\" for jobs and either we support this treaty or we leave the EU, and we will have conversations around that.<\/p> <p>  There has been a difficulty and we need to acknowledge that the EU is in a challenging period.  The most welcome political development of the past year or so was the fact that only 35% of the French people voted for a fascist.  However, the citizens of Europe are ringing alarm bells and we need to listen to and engage with them.<\/p> <p>  If one looks at where the problems in which the EU finds itself arise, I would go back to the European Union constitution agreed by European leaders and put to electorates.  The electorates in France and The Netherlands rejected it.  That was the moment the EU could have woken up and realised it needed to change direction.  Instead, it came up with a formula by which it could effectively agree the same constitution but rework it in such a way that it would not have to be put to electorates.  The formula it found was the Lisbon treaty, which was a convoluted series of amendments to existing treaties.  It achieved its goal and managed to avoid having to go to electorates, except, as the committee will be aware, in our case.  The Irish people voted, not once but twice, and people had their own positions in relation to it.  Sinn F&eacute;in is the only party in this country that can say hand on heart that it accepted the democratic decision in every referendum that has been put because we accepted the democratic decision of the Nice treaty on the first occasion and even though we lost on the second occasion, we accepted that, and likewise, with the Lisbon treaty.<\/p> <p>  There was a promise given by David Cameron, when he first became leader of the Tory Party, that he would put the Lisbon treaty to a referendum in Britain but because of pressure from the European institutions, he back-tracked on that.  We would be in a much better situation today had he upheld that promise and the people of Britain had that referendum because we would not have the Lisbon treaty, but more than likely, we would not have Brexit either.<\/p> <p>  Something the committee needs to be aware of when we talk about this important engagement is the fact we are a really small delegation in the European Parliament.  There are 14 MEPs from the island of Ireland.  There are, to put it in context, 24 UKIP MEPs.  It is incredibly difficult for us to remain on top, in so far as we would like, of every development coming through the European Parliament and we need to recognise that.  There are 14 Irish MEPs out of 751.  When one puts it in context, the Germans have 97.  Almost one in seven MEPs is German.  Arguably, because of its population, it could be entitled to even more but one can see the difficulty of smaller countries asserting themselves in the European Parliament.<\/p> <p>  Luke 'Ming' Flanagan is correct on this point.  Not a single Irish journalist concentrates on European Parliament activities.  I am sure there are times when Members of the Oireachtas, as elected representatives, become frustrated that the good work they are doing on committees, in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il is not getting picked up.  Imagine a scenario where there was not a single journalist based here and where the only time one showed up was when a foreign speaker visited or something along those lines.  The media in Ireland have a role to play to ensure we engage with people.  The Government, and I accept MEPs as well, have a responsibility.  <\/p> <p>  I visit schools, and during Green Week, we usually spend a lot of time visiting schools.  When I ask students if there are aspects of the EU they do not like, they will always name four or five decisions the EU has made they do not like.  In many cases, they are surprised when I tell them that, as much as they have every right not to like those decisions, it is not entirely Europe's fault because for every one of those decisions, an Irish Minister has sat at the Council table and signed off on it and usually his or her predecessor then points his or her finger at Europe.  We need to ensure there is a connection between what is happening at European Parliament level and at Council level and how Irish representatives are responding.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased Senator Richmond mentioned the CETA trade deal.  It is a big deal.  I am very critical of the deal, what it entails and how it can be managed.  Many Irish people will be surprised to hear that deal is currently being provisionally applied - in other words, it is being implemented prior to national parliaments having a vote on it, and our Minister accepted and signed up to that deal, despite the fact the only conversation or vote that was taken in the Oireachtas was a decision by the Seanad to call on her not to do that.  There has not been a debate or a vote in the D&aacute;il, despite the fact the Minister and the Taoiseach have been all over the world selling this deal that they have no democratic mandate from the Oireachtas to do.  It is a problem on which we and the committee need to work together to resolve.<\/p> <p>  Brexit is the biggest challenge we face as a country.  Notwithstanding all I have said in terms of a critical analysis of the EU and why it needs to change, the prospect of having one part of our country in the EU and another part outside it will be politically, economically and socially destabilising and could have serious consequences.  The Irish Government is not doing enough to address it.  Going back to the issue of media engagement with European institutions, there was a torrent of positive media on the Irish Government's position with regard to the Council position on Brexit.  It is not strong enough.  It is not as strong as the European Parliament's position which, in itself, we would like to be stronger.  Many will say the Irish Government had a diplomatic coup because it got what it asked for in the negotiations.  It did not ask for enough.  It has not been putting forward a strong enough position that will defend the rights of the people in the North who voted remain and defend the rights of the entire island and economic or our political institutions that are under threat as a result of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  We need to up our game.  That means we need the MEPs from across this island as well as committees, such as this one, engaging with each other and engaging with the Government, and putting pressure on the Government to ensure it accepts the majority decision of the D&aacute;il by demanding special designated status, and to go forward at a European level and demand above and beyond what is currently on offer.<\/p><p>The latter is not going to address the needs and wants of people not only in the Border region but also across the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Carthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.

Could the witnesses tell us what will happen after that date, be it 2019?  When do the witnesses believe the negotiations about the so-called seamless Border we want will get serious?  Nobody wants a hard Border.  Are we not being led to believe that until the UK decides how much it will contribute to the budget for the next number of years, no serious negotiations will start?  Perhaps that will not start until some time later this year after the German elections.  I would like to hear our guests' comments on that.

They have done great work so far but, obviously, have a lot more work to do given the fact that the final deal or deals must be agreed by the European Parliament.  Taking up the point made by Mr. Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, MEP, the Commission published the white paper on 1 March.  As Mr. Flanagan rightly said, five options are being considered.  I understand that there are to be six reflection papers on all sorts of issues, including developing the social dimension of Europe, deepening the economic and monetary union on the basis of the five presidents' reflection paper on harnessing globalisation of June 2015, the future of Europe's defence and the future of EU finances.  Is there any sign of those reflection papers being published given the timeline the witnesses outlined to us?<\/p> <p>  In respect of the option of a multi-speed Europe or those who want to do more - option 3 - it seems that Germany, France, Italy and Spain are pursuing that particular agenda, which must sound alarm bells for us.  Such a multi-speed Europe could involve increased co-operation on defence matters, co-operation on security and justice matters and closer co-operation on taxation and social matters.  We need to have a debate in this country about the future of Europe.  Obviously, this has come to a head with the Brexit vote and the widespread realisation that many people are alienated from the EU.  As a result, this debate is very timely.  It seems that it might be in Ireland's interests to have a multi-speed Europe because there would be some things we would not like relating to the other member states pressing ahead but perhaps this will lead to us being left behind.  The Union started off as a partnership of equal member states.  Will we move away from that?  There is also the option of further integration of the EU.  I do not think there would be much support among the Irish public for further integration of the EU.  I think Mr. Carthy said there would be treaty change.  I would not like to sell a referendum to the Irish people on further integration.<\/p> <p>  I agree that this is a debate in which we need to engage.  This committee needs to discuss that in the coming weeks.  It is on our agenda.

We value the opportunity to have a one-to-one discussion with our European colleagues.  I do not accept the negativity associated with the Brexit negotiations.  The Government has long since established the priority relating to the Good Friday Agreement and all that goes with it, such as the necessity of ensuring that no Border will arise during the course of these discussions that was not there before and the need to ensure the continuation of the single market and the customs union on the island of Ireland.  I do not accept that we have a weakened position or that any stone has been left unturned.  I believe the opposite is the case.  Independent commentators have repeatedly stated that the Irish MEPs and the Government, Ministers, ambassadors and the diplomatic corps have been exceptional in the way they have driven Ireland's case in the context of Brexit.  That is the first thing we need to establish.  People can have their own independent opinions but that is a fact.<\/p> <p>  I have been a supporter of the European concept since 1973.  I have campaigned in favour of every referendum held on Europe and have spoken on public platforms during each campaign so I am committed to the concept of Europe for a reason that is quite simple to everybody.  This country has developed beyond belief within the EU.  Ireland has become a major player.  We have shown what we can do.  We can achieve heights we never thought possible.  Ireland can now be regarded as a major player on the European scene to such an extent that in the aftermath of the economic crisis we experienced, we have led the field in the context of recovery.  Of course, there were huge sacrifices by the Irish people but we proved what we were capable of doing when given the chance.<\/p> <p>  That is the point relating to the future of Europe as well.  Of course, there are changes but we need to be careful not to go down the road of ensuring that every country in the EU will impose its own will on the Union because the bigger the country, the more its will is imposed.  We need to bring what we have committed and what is advantageous and complementary to the concept of Europe to the table of discussions in Europe as it is now emerging and will emerge in the future.  We have the opportunity to discuss all directives in committees and they have all been discussed in committees from time to time.  Each lead Department has a sub-committee that discusses all directives coming from Europe.  Sometimes we are successful and sometimes we are not but the point to remember is that it is all very fine for people to blame Europe when it suits them and that is what happens.  This is why there is an antipathy towards Europe.  It suits some people at national level in all member states to blame the Europeans and say they are the cause of problems.  We should remember that it was not the EU that put up the barriers and barbed wire to greet the refugees a year and a half ago.  It was a well-known fact that it was individual member states that put the barriers and the razor wire to greet the refugees coming across the borders.  We should separate the blanket blame of Europe for an identification of where difficulties arise, what caused them and how we can resolve them.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is not leaving the EU.  It is a fully-paid-up and committed member of the Union and that is what we must establish.  It is within the capacity of the British Government to negotiate a situation that allows us to do the things the Taoiseach, various Ministers and Opposition Members have already set out, that is, retain what we have had relating to the all-island trading situation, including the customs union.  It is possible for the British Government to agree to that.<\/p><p>That is a matter for it.  They are the people who are leaving the Union.  It is also possible and a natural progression within the European Union that we will be in a position to trade with the UK afterwards, along with all the other member states.  We are part of that group no matter which way we turn.  It is quite a strong position to be in.  Far from being negative and pessimistic about the future, we have a great deal to play for.  It is all to play for.  In fact, we can come very well out of the debate which is now taking place and which will ultimately take place with our European colleagues.  I have no doubt that we will be successful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#G00400","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>To provide members with a time check, we have 25 minutes left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#H00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495630800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I want to respond to some of the issues raised.  I go back to the very first thing that Ms Mairead McGuinness asked today, namely \"How?\".  We can talk all day, but at the end of the day how do we sit down and have an interaction that is meaningful and which will have an impact on my role or that of any of the other MEPs on legislation?  I think Ms McGuinness was also there when we had a dial-up one day from the Parliament.  I am not talking about the opinion stuff, but when someone is in charge of or shadowing a legislative dossier that impacts here, there should be a connection set up with a sectoral committee.  It might be the person who initiates that or someone else.  I might want to initiate it for example.  I am shadowing the accessibility Act, which is legislative, and 883, which is a hugely important document.  Who do I contact?  I am a bit like Henry Kissinger who asked \"Who do I call if I want to call Europe?\".  Who do I contact to get feedback from a relevant committee on that issue?  That is the first question.<\/p> <p>  I will not talk about Brexit because a great deal has been said.  I agree with everything that has been said.  I do not want to be party political, but if one were to rely on the newspapers, one would think the only people who worked on this were from the Government.  I accept that they did a great deal of good work.  Equally, however, a lot of people in the Parliament put huge effort into this to ensure that Parliament's resolution was as positive as it is.  That is never recognised.  People think we are a talking shop in the Parliament and that we do not do a great deal more.  I will not get into that debate.  We have heard enough about it.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Ming that we need to discuss the White Paper because it is out there.  Deputy Haughey asked about some of the reflection papers.  The one on globalisation was discussed the week before last in the Parliament and I spoke on it.  Indeed, I raised the issue of the trade deals and the recent judgment from the ECJ which did not make a judgment on the rights and wrongs in relation to these investment courts.  That has yet to come.  Thankfully, the Belgian Parliament sent that to the ECJ.  The court said that all member states had to agree individually to the inclusion of the investor court in any trade deal.  That is an issue the committee will be discussing here.<\/p> <p>  To finish with the White Paper, it requires discussion.  It must be a reasonable discussion in which we look at all of the options.  People will have various options but within the next year or two we could be on that road.  We may not be, but we could be.  The Oireachtas needs to discuss it as well.  They have also come forward with a lot of policies under the social pillar.  To mention one or two, they came forward with a work-life balance directive which, for the first time ever, proposed a carer's leave directive and parental paternity leave.  That is the package under the social pillar, of which there are five different aspects.  That is ongoing and being debated at length in the Parliament.  I am not sure, however, whether people are aware of it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny referred to the EU as an elite club.  I have been an MEP for 13 years and as I sit here I wonder if this is my fault.  Am I not doing enough to tell people what happens at European level?  Am I not meeting enough people and going to enough schools?  Am I failing to engage?  Without blowing my own trumpet, and I presume it is the same for everyone here, I could not do more than I do.  Is there is a democratic deficit and do people see it as an elite club or is it just a phrase people use?  All MEPs engage extensively nationally and throughout their constituencies.  There are only 11 of us, however.  If we are going to say that, we have to be able to say what more needs to be done to bridge the gap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Harkin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495630800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I will be general rather than answer in detail as too many questions have been raised.

It is important to say that we represent part of the institutions so there is sometimes that view.<\/p> <p>  People are talking about the future of Europe in Ireland.  One of the scenarios that is not in the paper is disintegration.  People should not underestimate disintegration which can happen by accident or design.  Brexit has been a wake-up call and it is making people understand where Europe works as well as charging us with the responsibility to fix those things which are not working.  It is an opportunity.  People I meet are talking about Europe.  My colleagues mentioned visits to schools.  I was at a school in Kiltimagh yesterday which had references on the walls to the First and Second World Wars.  We are forgetting the history of Europe.  Sometimes people say it is boring and that we should forget the past.  The day we forget the past is the day we will rue.  If we do not remember our roots, which are in peace, we will not have a future.  Indeed, the peace process in Northern Ireland was assisted greatly by the European Union.  I am always happy to go to a school.  The children talk about conflict and war and then we talk about what Europe has done to build peace.<\/p> <p>  The White Paper is not about picking an option and running with it, it is about opening a debate.  That debate happens everywhere.  I do not know if it should be structured.  Certainly, I am having meetings about it all the time.  Others are doing that also.  It will not be a case of picking three or four.  It will be pieces of each.  The first question we have to answer is whether we believe the concept of Europe is worth defending, protecting and fixing.  If we do that, we can work towards solutions, taking into account that other countries might have different views.  We can work together to find a solution that moves us, hopefully, in a more positive direction.<\/p> <p>  I was in Letterkenny and Martina Anderson was also there.  We had a very important meeting on Monday where we spoke to stakeholders about Brexit.  The fishing sector is one about which I am very concerned because there could be war at sea, apart from the trouble we will have on land.  The real tragedy and sadness I have around Brexit is that the people of Northern Ireland do not have an assembly.  An assembly would be a good way for the political voices to be heard.  We face a UK election in which the issue of Brexit and its impact on the island of Ireland is not sufficiently or at all being addressed.  I am happy that I can articulate the concerns of stakeholders from Northern Ireland and not just listen to them on a Monday but reflect them with Michel Barnier and my colleagues in the EPP.  Elmar Brok sits on the Sherpa committee of the Brexit negotiators.  He came to the Border region and he really saw.  Seeing is believing.  He also travelled into Northern Ireland and met community groups.  He reflected very strongly his concern about the great fears in Northern Ireland for Brexit.<\/p> <p>  While we are here today to worry about the difficulties, people should not underestimate the progress we have made and our capacity and responsibility as politicians to find solutions.  Regarding Brexit, we have to put our fingers in our ears until after the UK has its election in the hope that some of what I hear or read on Twitter will be tempered when the negotiations begin.<\/p><p>It will require both sides to go into the room with less emotion than perhaps currently exists.<\/p><p> I suggest that I can address some of the individual concerns separately through email or through another conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Yes, thank you.

I will touch on some points briefly because I realise we are conscious of time.  There is a major discussion around engagement and meeting.  Surely it is not beyond possibility to get a timetable to match Oireachtas Members, including Senators and Deputies, with MEPs to enable them to meet up on a more frequent basis.  I was elected in 2016.  I am not aware of any regular or frequent meetings to exchange views.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the reason Brexit has happened is because many people have felt in general terms a disconnect between national and European politicians.  Many may take the view that much of the policy and legislation is being given to them in a dictatorial way rather than their having an input into how it affects them.  That is important because when we meet people on the street on a weekly or daily basis, they say their issue is that they are not being listened to and that some of the policies and legislation that come through are not reflective of their views or of how they affect people.  There is an understanding that there is a major disconnect between Europe in different countries, including Ireland, as well as between the various stakeholders, including businesses and private individuals.  We need to consider how that can be resolved and dealt with before it becomes a greater issue than it is at the moment.<\/p> <p>  One outcome from Brexit is that it has brought this problem into focus.  I have a suggestion for when the various policies that MEPs are involved in or shadowing are being drawn up and which affect Ireland.  I suggest that process could be linked into the appropriate Department at national level.  From there it could be sent to the various committees to get feedback.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that legislation is coming from Europe as it has done before.  It has affected people across all sectors of the community in many ways.  Europe has been positive, but negatives have been attached to it as well.  Some of that has happened and people feel it at different levels.  Politicians have had no input in that regard.  That is an issue and it cannot be beyond the bounds of possibility.  We should not be scratching our heads too much or wondering how we can communicate and engage better.  That is something that we should consider and it should be possible to fix it easily enough.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to hear the views of the MEPs present and the views of their fellow MEPs.  What is their view on the Irish position and special circumstances or status applying to us, given all the issues we know about?  There is no point in me outlining them again.  What is the view on protecting our interests as a small isolated island with a small population that depends heavily on exports?  With that in mind, what discussions are happening regarding exports to the UK?  It is a market on which we are heavily dependent.  The same applies to exports via the UK.  I know from being involved in the small and medium-sized business sector that this is a major problem.  What discussions or supports are engaged, when this is happening at European level, to consolidate the Irish position and to ensure that it does not negatively impact on us, if at all?  That is important especially in the food and agriculture sectors and everything that goes with them.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about Europe and the future of Europe.  Many countries might start to think that it is trendy to leave Europe based on what happened in the United Kingdom.  There is anecdotal evidence suggesting that if a referendum was put to people in other EU countries, they would consider leaving the EU.  Bearing that in mind, what is being done at European level to ensure that Europe is seen as a positive thing and seen as coming back to engage with national governments and the people they are representing to ensure that it is all-inclusive and reflective?  That piece of the jigsaw has been disconnected in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#J00300","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I want to refer back quickly to some of the comments made by Deputy Durkan.  If we are committed to an engagement here, we should not be putting the word of so-called independent experts in front of what he brandishes as individual opinions of MEPs here.  As Ms McGuinness has said, rightly, all MEPs come with a vast mandate in their own right.  When MEPs are raising legitimate concerns we should not simply dismiss them and put independent experts, nameless as they are, ahead of them.  In that spirit, I wish to reference the comments of my colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny.  I do not share the view that when he was referring to an elite club he had MEPs in mind.  I believe it was those elements of the structures that do not necessary have the mandate that Ms McGuinness and her colleagues have.  That is the concern for us.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the absence of the Northern Ireland Assembly.   I would love to see it.  We could have the assembly up-and-running tomorrow if the political will existed to fulfil outstanding agreements.  I do not believe it is too much to ask that those agreements are implemented.  However, we are not going to get into a political discussion on that.  The point I wanted to make was that when we had the assembly, the British Government put little stake in the views of it.  As the British Government has absolutely no support for the expressed democratic mandate of the people in the North, why would it listen to the assembly?  It certainly did not listen when the assembly was up and functioning.<\/p> <p>  We have talked about the arrangements of the Good Friday Agreement and other issues of a cross-Border nature.  The elephant in the rooms is any manifestation of a hard border.  For me, the question is the exploitation of the re-emergence of a hard border by people who are opposed to the peace process.  We know that the Irish Government is scoping out sites for customs checks.  It has conceded as much on the floor of both Houses.  This comes back to the point Ms Martina Anderson made earlier about the platitudes and plam&aacute;s around no return to a hard border, borders of the past and frictionless borders.  What engagement have MEPs have thus far to ensure that from a European perspective there is no return to a border?  If there is a return to a border, then surely that is a definitive clear physical alteration and undermining of the integrity and sanctity of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#J00400","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495630800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank the committee members for all the contributions and thoughts.  MEPs, the Irish Government and Irish civil society have done a great job thus far in ensuring that the concerns of Ireland are taken into account.  This is reflected in the position of the European Parliament and the position of the Council.  Michel Barnier is a member of the EPP.  This process started when I, as leader of the Fine Gael delegation, wrote to Mr. Barnier and asked him to meet all Irish MEPs.  He did so and we have been engaging as a group ever since.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  The Irish position is now one of the three major points.  The other two are easy enough and are controversial because they involve the rights of European Union citizens and United Kingdom citizens.  Our concern relates to the Border.  There is recognition of it.  As Ms McGuinness has said, we have done a good deal of work and we brought them to the Border.  Michel Barnier went to see the Border.  This is where we need to keep up the flow of discussion.<\/p> <p>  Ms Anderson and others have mentioned transparency.  As the negotiations go through, we have to see how things are progressing to ensure that the commitments in place now are honoured.  That will be a task for us.  That is where we need to relate to the committee and that aspect will be important.<\/p> <p>  Senator Coghlan referred to the big issue, which is the question of the exit bill for the British.  That is going to produce a major dispute.  There was a dispute on the question in the European Parliament last week.  Essentially, the view of the European Union is that a commitment is in place and the programmes and projects and so on are under way.  These have to be funded and they will certainly be funded until the end of the multi-annual financial framework.  Last week, Michel Barnier put it to the British people that when a person goes to a restaurant, before he leaves, he settles the bill.  That is where it is.<\/p><p>There is going to be a lot of discussion on that.  Unless the British change their attitude, it will be difficult.  At the moment, they are playing to their electorate but if they change, it will be possible to do these things.<\/p><p> I am the only Irish member of the International Trade Committee of the Parliament, INTA.  I am totally in favour of trade deals and we have benefited more than any other country from the Canadian deal on account of having a lot of interaction with Canada.  The European Court of Justice made a decision last week on the Singapore agreement, which will apply to future agreements and to CETA.  The ruling states that most of the deal comes under European competence but that the dispute resolutions system, the ISDS, has to be negotiated and agreed by all Parliaments.  This will help rather than hinder the situation.<\/p><p> Deputy Durkan spoke about blaming Europe.  Unfortunately, one of the worst culprits is our EPP colleague, Mr. Orb&aacute;n, the Prime Minister of Hungary, and I said so much at a meeting of the EPP group last week.  I criticised his populist approach and for blaming Brussels for this and that and I am hopeful that the message will get through.  As the Deputy pointed out, such people are part of the decision-making process and in Mr. Orb&aacute;n's case this is as a Prime Minister and in the European Parliament.<\/p><p> Marian Harkin asked who we could speak to about our files.  I am involved in the climate file and am dealing with renewable energy, the energy performance of buildings and energy efficiency.  I could talk to Deputy Eamon Ryan and his colleagues but I need to speak to more members.  Engagement at national parliament level is important.  All the lobbyists come to us.  They have vested interests and that is okay but we need politicians in national parliaments, and not just the Greens, to give us a broader view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495630800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Senators Leyden and Coghlan referred to representation.  The negotiations are scheduled to end in March 2019.  Under the current allocation, this will mean no more MEPs in the North.  However, the first phase of the negotiations is about acquired rights as Irish citizens and, under Article 9 of the treaty, we should receive equal attention, while Article 10 states that we should be directly represented.  We would argue that the Irish Government should get additional seats, and not just the one to which Senator Leyden referred, and that these should be on a range of bodies.  As Deputy Durkan said, there is sometimes a blame game but all of us have heard horrendous news today, about something which is happening day by day at the moment.  Some 30 people - men, women, little boys and girls - have drowned in the Mediterranean because member states want to keep them out rather than keep them safe.  The support the Parliament has given to Frontex in this area and the role the latter has played are alarming and shocking.  The Mediterranean has, to quote Pope Francis, turned into a &quot;floating cemetery&quot;.  It is Europe's sinking shame.  Shame on all of us who witness it but do nothing about it.<br\/><br\/>Senator Coghlan spoke about the negotiations.  The British Government wants the negotiations to take place in secret but transparency is important.  Deputy Martin Kenny referred to elites and Deputy O'Rourke mentioned the disconnect between the EU and its people.  The Commission has too much power.  It has the power of initiative but it is not an elected body, it is not like the Council and it does not represent the people.  There is a list of reforms that need to be made.  The Europe citizens' initiative was referenced by Matt Carthy and there was a finding last week of the European Court of Justice in this area.  State-aid rules need also to be looked at.<br\/><br\/>Let there be no doubt about one thing: we want an assembly in the North.  We need an assembly predicated on good governance based on respect, equality and integrity.  The late Martin McGuinness confounded the naysayers ten years ago by establishing the Executive with the late Ian Paisley.  It was Martin McGuinness who called time on the <i>status quo<\/i>and said that there would be no return to it.  Deputies and Senators will agree that an assembly needs to be built on good governance based on respect, integrity and rights.<br\/><br\/>Deputy O'Rourke also asked about how a special status was being discussed and engaged on.  A united Ireland would be a solution to Europe's Brexit problem, as well as being a solution for this island.  That is evident for many of those who have engaged with us.  My colleagues, Lynn Boylan and Liadh N&iacute; Riada, and I have engaged with hundreds of MEPs about the circumstances of the North, on ensuring that the Good Friday Agreement is protected and preserved in all of its parts and in the context of making sure that there will be no hardening of the Border.  It is understood that mitigation is required for the island as regards trade with Britain and Irish unity seems to many people to be the obvious solution.  It is a no-brainer.  We all have to play a part in taking this forward.  I call on the Irish Government to reach out to and engage with the Protestant and unionist-loyalist community who have concerns about their identity being protected in an all-island structure.  We need a Green Paper on Irish unity, or something like that, from the Government to guarantee that their rights and entitlements would be respected and upheld and that what happened to the nationalist-republican community in the North will never be foisted on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Martina Anderson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495630800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan proved my point on media engagement by referring to the analysis of the Taoiseach's and the Government's performance in the Council negotiations.  This analysis was largely written by people who had not been in Brussels for the past 12 months, let alone engaged with the negotiations.  The lead piece  in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>was written by its London correspondent.  We need an engaged media and people who will hold us all to account as MEPs and Government representatives.<br\/><br\/>I agree with everything Deputy Martin Kenny said.  Elites can be elected.  An elite is a disengaged political class and comprises people who deliberately or negligently ignore what citizens are asking them to do.  At European level, notwithstanding everything Se&aacute;n Kelly and others have said, there is a big problem in this regard.<\/p><p>The EU engagement with trade agendas in the recent past has been the best example of that, where it has gone out of its way to ignore, misinform and, in some cases, block any debate in regard to what trade deals will mean for vulnerable sectors such as the agricultural sector or domestic indigenous SMEs and what the real output will be.  As we have from the start, we are asking for an open conversation on the net impacts of trade deals.  For example, the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, has led to an additional 50,000 tonnes of Canadian beef entering the EU market.  No one can tell what impact that will have on the Irish beef market because nobody has bothered to find out.  Nobody has carried out an analysis of what it will mean, yet Ireland has signed up to it.  Regardless of the Deputy's position on the matter, there should be a public debate about it.  There is a very good chance that the provision of an EU investor court system for resolving disputes between investors and states will be put to a referendum.  As I said earlier, I do not want such a referendum to take place in a vacuum where the only option is to accept it or Ireland will leave the EU.  We need to have a conversation about whether Ireland wants to be part of this type of scenario.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Rourke asked two questions which are crucial in regard to how we move forward.  The first addressed the position of MEPs and other European leaders regarding our concerns about Brexit.  Although I am usually very critical, I admit that there is an openness at European level to addressing the issues that we have raised.  The EU has more understanding than the British Government of the implications of Brexit for the island of Ireland and the Border, in particular.  Our colleagues in the British Parliament do not comprehend our discussion in terms of the dangers of a hard Border.  Perhaps the understanding of the EU on this issue is because it has more awareness of what land borders mean and the challenges and hindrances they can create.  On the evidence of people to whom we have spoken, there is no resistance at European level to a formula that allows the North to remain part of the Single Market and the customs union, to draw down EU funding and continue to have rights in terms of European Parliament elections.  The only places from which resistance to such solutions will come are this country or our neighbours across the water.  We must ensure that, if there is resistance, it does not come from Irish political leaders.  People need to work together.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Rourke also asked about the prospect of other countries leaving the EU.  In the short term, there is no prospect of any other country leaving the European Union.  That is probably primarily influenced by the apparent mess that the British Government is making of its exit.  In the short term, no electorate would leave the EU, even if they were given an option to do so.  That is mainly due to a threat and fear of what leaving the EU would entail as opposed to a sense of ownership and belonging to the EU.  That is not a good foundation on which to move a political project forward.  As I said earlier, unless the EU moves towards a situation where citizens across Europe want to belong to and feel they have ownership of the EU project, it is a foundation built on quicksand and does not have a future that we would like.  All witnesses and members here today accept the EU is an important concept and has an important role to play in the future of this country and other EU member states.  If we do not engage with European leaders to ensure they begin to engage with citizens and national parliaments in a way they should have been doing and should do, I fear what the future prospects may be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Carthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495630800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>On the issue of the media, I refer colleagues to an excellent analysis of the Canadian beef agreement by a journalist at the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>, Phelim O'Neill, who I know only though his work.

The issue of the Border has arisen in regard to Brexit.  The Border is approximately 500 km long.  The constituency I represent stretches along it for almost 100 km, from Belturbet to Pettigo.  I am, therefore, acutely aware of the impact that closing roads, putting up checkpoints and so on would have.  It is agreed that is not wanted.  The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, has said that nobody wants to return to the Borders of the past.  It is understood that the EU wants to protect the Single Market and the integrity of that market.  All members of the committee want that also.  However, there is a discrepancy because one can have one or the other but it is very difficult to have both.  One cannot have a free and open border and at the same time protect the integrity of the market.  That issue needs to be understood.  Britain's position so far has been that it wants to leave the customs union and so on.  If it does so, that will cause serious problems for people on the island of Ireland.  There is recognition of that across Europe.  That situation would be resolved by the island of Ireland having special status.<\/p> <p>  I was glad to hear Ms McGuinness mention the fishing issue.  The issue of Irish territorial waters is important.  Our fishing industry, which is one of the most vocal industries about getting a raw deal from Europe, is extremely concerned that if British territorial waters are taken out of the EU, where will the boats currently fishing there go if not into Irish waters?  We need to negotiate what Ireland's position will be after Brexit.<\/p> <p>  No one at this meeting is opposed to trade deals.  They are always good.  However, for whom are they good?  People are concerned by the secondary and tertiary effects which trade deals have on other industries and which may not be evident on the surface.  We must be careful that vulnerable industries in peripheral countries such as Ireland will not be negatively affected by trade deals.  No one is saying there should not be trade deals.  There should be.

Trade deals and our involvement in the EU are the real opportunity for an island such as Ireland.  Economic growth on this island in terms of jobs, people and small, vulnerable businesses could not be sustained without comprehensive trade deals which allow us to be have a disproportionately large export sector compared to that we would have without trade deals and certainly compared to that we would have were we outside the EU.  Facts are important.  One can speak of how the EU is built and whether its citizens want to remain as citizens.  The establishment of the European Union was probably the best peace agreement ever signed.  People should remember that before it is put at risk.  Most EU citizens wish to remain in the EU.   When they really think about it, the people of Europe, not just political elites, want to remain members of the EU.  All polls conducted in Ireland on this issue indicate that the majority of people on the island of Ireland are very positive towards the EU.  It is worth bearing in mind that while problems may exist, and I appreciate that certain political parties have historical problems with the EU and its institutions, the real threat which Ireland faces is that people discussing Brexit fail to recognise that Ireland is stronger with its European partners.<\/p><p>It is not us setting up ideological divides.

I think it is the worst decision that Britain has ever made, as a country.  I would be much happier if it had chosen to remain, and I campaigned for Britain to remain.  We have all lost by the UK leaving.  We and our EU partners must negotiate a deal, which I believe is possible.  After the UK general election is over I believe a mindset will develop, over the next two years, within British politics that will be better disposed to recognising the fact that even if Britain cannot remain within the EU it can do a deal with the EU that benefits both sides.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#L00600","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Deputy Brophy was not present for the earlier part of the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#M00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I acknowledged that at the start of the meeting.

I would like to address a couple of points that have arisen.<\/p><p>Members across the room have given the impression that somehow the Irish Government or Irish politicians are not committed to doing what is necessary in the present climate.  Please be assured that they are.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly laid the groundwork.  The constant chipping away, criticism and undermining of the ability of Irish institutions to carry the day is not a good thing.  All of the political parties in this House, as far as I am aware, sing off the same hymn sheet.<\/p><p>Let me explain trade deals.  In 1989, the GDP <i>per capita<\/i>in this country was half that of the countries in the European Free Trade Association, EFTA, which was half that of the United States.  The only country in the European Union that came close to our GDP was Luxembourg.  Since then, Ireland has reached the position of being on par with all of the leaders in the European Union, which did not happen overnight or without the commitment of the European Union and the Irish people.  It is a fact of life now and is a major achievement.<\/p><p>I have been amazed by some of the things alluded to by Sinn F&eacute;in's MEP, Mr. Matt Carthy.  I heard a reference in the House, not so long ago, to the effect that the policy was akin to Tory policy.  I heard that we would move away from the European Union concept altogether and return to free trade agreement.  That is Tory policy and is what they want.  That is why the Tories are leaving the European Union.  The Tory party is committed to that policy.  Who wins in that situation?  The bigger country always wins.  That is why we have trade deals.  They protect smaller countries.  Trade deals also provide collegiality in terms of the need to address the issues that arise and they deal with them, accordingly.  If one country falls out then all of the countries fall out, which makes a huge difference.  <\/p><p>I want to mention the possibility of protectionism.  As the Chairman and everyone else seated around this table knows as well as I do, protectionism is not the answer because of who wins.  The bigger country wins.  The bigger economic bloc always wins.<\/p><p>I compliment Ms Martina Anderson on one thing.  There is an urgent need to have an Assembly in Northern Ireland.  It would be hugely beneficial to what we in this part of the island are trying to do.  It would be hugely beneficial to the outcome of the negotiations that are taking place.<\/p><p>I have one reservation.  We tend to blame the European Commission for lots of things.  We can sack the European Commission but we cannot sack the European Parliament if it does something wrong.  I mean no disrespect to anybody seated around the table, the European Parliament occasionally goes off on a tangent from time to time and produces reports that are not in our interest, although I shall not go into it in too much detail.  I believe that we should work with what we have.  We have an agenda to chart the agreement that this part of the island needs to ensure the future of the island of Ireland, as we have already repeatedly stated.  We are not watering that down.  We are not taking advice from anyone on how to do so because we know what to do.<\/p><p>Finally, I am always irked when people say &quot;we will get the best deal that we can&quot;.  That is a sign of defeatism before one starts.  Who enters negotiations with a mindset to get the best deal that one can?  Immediately one's opponent will say: &quot;We will limit the best deal that you will get from here on in.&quot;  I firmly believe that the world is our oyster.  I believe that we can get a better deal than we had before, without a shadow of a doubt.  We hope that a reconstituted Assembly in Northern Ireland is established as quickly as possible with a view to ensuring that we have the assistance that we need in this part of the island to achieve our goals.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#M00500","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Eamon Ryan to make a brief comment because we have run over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#M00600","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1495630800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I watched proceedings on a screen upstairs.  I wish to mention one concern, on behalf of the Green Party.  I disagree with Deputy Durkan's belief because there are differing views.  Ireland is really concerned about Brexit.  The visit by Michel Barnier here two weeks ago deepened my concern.  I firmly believe a clear message has been given that the free movement of people on our island would be accommodated but there will be no flexibility on the European side in the trade of goods and services.  That leaves us all in an incredibly difficult situation.<\/p> <p>  I do not agree with the Tories on anything.  David Davis, the Tory Brexit negotiator, has said that the European Union is assisting us with the sequence.  I do not believe that is right for us as a country.  We have been told that the Irish Border issues will be examined first.  One cannot resolve that unless one knows the wider trade issue in terms of goods and services.  Perhaps the people issues will be dealt with first but the key critical issues, such as Irish agriculture, will not be dealt with.     <\/p> <p>  I urge our European Parliamentarians, on our behalf, to tell their European colleagues that Ireland does not have to insist on a two-tier process.  Why should we not start negotiations on some areas where we can get agreement, such as energy policy, climate and environmental standards, that are not part of the complex trade arrangements?  We should start with some points of agreement.  I believe that we are increasingly heading towards a crash-out Brexit process where we get no transitional deal.  Ireland will be the worst affected in that regard.  The Irish Government must go the European Council meeting on 22 June, presumably we will have a new Taoiseach by then, and start saying to our European colleagues that they must break away from this and that we will only negotiate on two strands.  First, we have a very short timeline.  Second, it risks a crash-out process.  Third, it does not address the fundamental Irish issues on how we deal in trades and services.  From what I heard Michel Barnier say, he will not allow any movement on this matter.  The customs border will be the customs board if the UK is not in the customs union.  That is a real concern of mine.  We need to change strategy and policy in the sequencing of the talks.  The UK will have to give up on everything because it does not have a negotiating position.  It is not as I am saying we should yield to the UK.  Why must we stick to the issue of sequencing?  David Davis has said that it will be the row of the summer.  If so, then Ireland should say: \"Come on, step back from the cliff edge.  The cliff edge does not suit us.\" <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017052400002#M00700","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495630800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>The European Parliament, Council and the Commission supports sequencing.  The Deputy has missed the following piece.  It has been mentioned that if sufficient progress is made on the three issues we will look at the transition plus the trade agreement.  It is not as if one must be finished before negotiations begin on the other.  A more nuanced approach must be adopted.<\/p> <p>  The European Parliament would like to debate the new trading partnership by October of this year.  We cannot let the UK off the hook.  It opted out of the European Union, which will have a clear impact on us.  We cannot say to the UK that we will sort everything out in its direction.  I have had frank discussions with David Davis on this issue and know that he understands the EU's perspective.  I do not share the entire optimism of Deputy Durkan right now nor Deputy Ryan's pessimism.  I believe that if all of us, as elected representatives, and the UK look to the rights and needs of citizens first we will work through all of the structural issues to formulate a deal that works for people, business and communities.

What I said was that we should have a frank and open debate on what exactly these deals meant and make a judgment call on what they meant for Ireland and let people make up their minds.  My position was reinforced when people jumped up and seized on the very notion that we should even have a debate on these questions as if, somehow, all of a sudden we were opposed to free trade or in favour of protectionism.  I said nothing of the sort and neither has any representative of Sinn F&eacute;in.  The concept that because one supports the European Union one cannot be critical of what it does is exactly the one that led us into the difficulties with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whereby because we support its work we cannot question or criticise any particular element of that work.  We know the mess we are in in that regard.  Frankly, this is on a much lower scale than some of the fundamental deficiencies with the democratic accountability of the European Union.  If those of us who support it do not stand up and demand that these inefficiencies, as well as its ineffectiveness and, frankly, unaccountability, be addressed, we are doomed to see huge fundamental failures.<\/p> <p>  Let me state when Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs are most comfortable at European Parliament level.  We are most comfortable when we are able to adopt a single position with the Irish Government, the permanent representatives and our fellow Irish MEPs and we go into the European Parliament to battle with a united voice for Ireland.

Some would like to say it disappeared into thin air, but it did not.  As a result of our being designated as a special case, in the past two years we borrowed &euro;6 billion.  On what did we spend it?  We spent it on nothing.  We eviscerated it and got rid of it.  We, therefore, need to be wary about being granted special case status.  If a dog on my estate bites a child, it will be lucky to get a second chance.  We have been more than bitten, we have been devoured.  Therefore, we need to be wary.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Frank O'Rourke asked about the position of other MEPs.  I presume he meant their position on the future of Europe.  A particular MEP, Guy Verhofstadt, the lead negotiator on behalf of the European Parliament, is quite clear.  Option No. 5 would not go far enough for him.  He wants to sit down beside people to tell them what they should eating for dinner.  That is the sort of European Union he wants and that is where it is inclined to go.  At our group meeting Jean-Claude Juncker was clear enough on where he wanted it to go, as is Emmanuel Macron.  They all want to move towards further integration.  People might think this is wonderful, but we have to have a debate on the issue.<\/p> <p>  I tried to establish when the discussion on the future of Europe would take place by asking Commissioner Phil Hogan, Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, but each and every one of them could not tell me much about it.  We were promised that, to encourage debate, the European Commission, together with the European Parliament and interested member states, would host a series of debates on the future of Europe in European cities and regions to engage with national parliaments, local and regional authorities and civil society at large.  Having attempted to establish when and where these debates will take place, I am on the verge of giving up because no one who should know about them seems to knows anything about them.  Whether people are in favour of option one, two, three, four or five, we have to have this discussion.  I have to have it because my children will be living in the European Union and I want it to be the best possible.  If we are not going to discuss the issue, if we are going to be afraid of and run away from it, I can only conclude it will not be good for us.  It terrifies me that even a country such as ours which supposedly is 88% in favour of EU membership is afraid to discuss it.  If we are that much in favour of it, we should not only not be afraid to discuss it, we should also hear what the dates of the meetings are, as opposed to hearing from the Vice President of the European Parliament that nothing really will happen and that people will hold their own private meetings.  The debate needs to be held in public, not in the dark.<\/p> <p>  Do not mix up correlation and causation.  One would swear that if we had not joined the European Union in 1973, the iPhone would never have been invented and that we would still be driving around in 20 diesel tractors.  No, we would not.  Things would have changed.  It should be remembered that we had peace before what happened in Nice.  Next time someone says there have been no wars on the continent of Europe, tell him or her to have a little respect for the people who lived in the former Yugoslavia.

Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments seek to do the same thing, perhaps in a slightly different way.  His amendments are more simple, with just a line stating one of the functions of the board is to make recommendations on sentence management.  Mine is a bit more detailed and convoluted.  I am open to seeing which approach is best.  I presume there is an argument that if too much detail is included it might tie the board's hands which is obviously not the intention.  At the same time, I was trying to balance against this that if we do not include the detail there is a danger the board's functions and powers in this regard will not be clear enough, which could leave it hamstrung.  This is the balance we are trying to reach.

If it is taken away it will be left bereft of a number of responsibilities.  Everybody agreed on Second Stage it should continue to have this role.  The question is how.<\/p><p>Where my group of amendments differs from Deputy O'Callaghan's is I propose that we give the board powers to make orders regarding sentence management rather than just recommendations.  This is an important difference.  It is important in light of the fact it will be the body reviewing all of the facts about the individual's progress, and I believe this is appropriate.  It is recommended by the existing board.  I have left it open to the governor of an open prison to revoke or suspend such orders, which is how it happens at present.  Obviously it would be very difficult for the board to do this as it is not present in the prison.  The idea of an oversight role for the board whereby a governor who revokes or suspends an order has to justify it or explain the reasons in writing is reasonable.

I am slightly hesitant about giving governors powers to revoke parole orders.  We need to have a clear statutory basis that it is the parole board which has this power.  It can set out orders and revoke orders.  Amendment No. 3 is unnecessary and we should go with amendment No. 6, which is the same as Deputy Daly's amendment No. 5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#B01700","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 address the need to ensure the parole board can make recommendations relating to sentence management.  Amendments Nos. 72 and 83 are linked to amendment No. 5 and amendments Nos. 3, 45, 50 and 58 are consequential amendments to amendment No. 72.  I support the principle of the amendments, which reflect current practice whereby the parole board can and does make various recommendations.<\/p><p>These include advising a prisoner on the type of programmes with which he or she should engage, recommending transfer to a lower security prison or recommending a programme of temporary release, leading to longer periods.<\/p><p> With respect to the element of the amendments regarding transfers to open prisons, this is, as I have said, a recommendation that the current parole board can make.  Such a recommendation could be implied in the general understanding of \"sentence management\".  However, I am not going to object to specifying the transfer to open prisons.<\/p><p> My preference is for amendment No. 6.  My concern with Deputy Daly's amendment No. 72 is the proposal permitting the parole board to issue orders relating to sentence management, including orders for transfer to open prison.  By providing for the parole board to make orders rather than recommendations, the amendments would effectively involve the board in the management and operation of prisons, which is outside of the remit of the board.<\/p><p> I acknowledge that Deputy Daly has also put forward amendment No. 83, which would allow a Governor to revoke it.  Nevertheless, getting into the management of prisons is a somewhat inappropriate role, and I hope the Deputy understands that.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 6 goes a long way to what the Deputy Daly is seeking.  It allows recommendations with respect to sentence management, including recommendations relating to transfers to open prisons.  I would suggest agreeing amendment No. 6 over amendments Nos. 3, 5, 72, 45, 50, 58, 71, 72 and 83.<\/p><p> With respect to amendment No. 71 in the name of Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan, this amendment allows for the parole order to be sent to a prison governor, which is right.  I would also like a further provision requiring the parole board to also notify the Minister that the parole orders have been made.  It is necessary that the Minister for Justice and Equality would be aware of any decisions to release prisoners.  A simple notification of the nature of the parole order which is issued to the relevant prison governor would I believe suffice, and I will suggest an amendment to that at a later Stage.<\/p><p> I would also like to address subsection (5) of the amendment, which provides for the board to specify conditions.  Subsection (2) of the section being amended already sets out the conditions of a parole order.  However, subsection (5) appears to allow the board to specify conditions, which I presume will be some or all of the conditions under subsection (2), or will it be conditions in addition to subsection (2) which will apply to all persons released on parole?<\/p><p> In any event, I believe there is merit in considering introducing an automatic condition of release, which would apply to all parole orders, such as that the offender must comply with all lawful instructions of his or her probation officer.  While section 22 of the Bill sets out the conditions which may be imposed in respect of individual offenders, I believe we should consider whether it should be a standard and automatic condition of every parole order to abide by the instructions of a probation officer.<\/p><p> Persons on parole are under the supervision of probation officers.  It is the case that this supervision may vary from offender to offender or as time passes.  Probation officers are responsible for facilitating and assisting an offender in reintegrating into society and, as such, are likely to be best placed to identify the immediate needs of and risks faced by an offender, including as these needs or risks change.  When cases come to me I often see the progress people are making and the varying recommendations of probation officers.  In my view, an automatic condition to abide by the lawful instructions of a probation officer will avoid any unforeseen gaps should needs or risks emerge, and it will aid the rehabilitation of the offender.<\/p><p> I would be interested in the views of the members with respect to this proposal.  It is a matter we can return to at a later Stage of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#B01800","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

It is probably the case that amendment No. 6 rather than amendment No. 5 should be accepted.  I will not worry about that.  However, amendments Nos. 72 and 73 are linked and their purpose is to precisely to overcome the issue of the board being involved in the day to day management of the prison.  What I am trying to do on the one hand is give the board more power over sentence management, with a caveat that the prison governor maintains a power to offset that by being able to revoke or suspend the order the parole board would make.  I believe that overcomes the Minister's point about the parole board going beyond its remit and straying into prison management.  That is there to balance that situation and giving the board more power over sentence management in this way, through the issuing of orders, was, as far as I can recall, based on a submission from the current parole board.  I believe it is reasonable because on the one hand it is giving it more power but, on the other, it is qualifying that so that the management of the prison would be able to carry on.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy O'Callaghan's point about whether that is giving a prison governor too much power to overturn that, the fact that the Governor would have to give a written explanation on that gives it an oversight role.  I do not know if that better explains it.  I like those two amendments and I am prepared to push them rather than the other ones.  If I did not move amendment No. 5 and amendment No. 6 was moved, the possibility of the board issuing orders remains in other Parts of the Act, which I believe is what Deputy O'Callaghan said.

Under existing arrangements, parole is effectively the exercise by the Minister of the power of temporary release under the Criminal Justice Act 1960, reflecting the fact that the existing parole board operates in an advisory capacity only.  Given that the parole board will now be established on a statutory basis, with a clear decision-making function with regard to the release of certain prisoners, it may be necessary to explicitly set out what parole is as distinct from ministerial powers of temporary release, which will continue to operate under the Criminal Justice Act 1960.<\/p> <p>  Under the provisions of this Bill, parole is conditional release.  Unlike temporary release which may be renewed but also may not, parole can only be revoked where there is a risk to the public or there has been a breach of a condition attached to the parole.  That risk or breach is subsequently determined through a hearing under section 25 of the Bill.  It would be helpful, and it will distinguish parole from temporary release, if we set out - possibly in section 5 of the Bill - that parole is a form of conditional release.  It is already clear from section 5(3) that the provisions of the Bill are not intended to interfere with the right of temporary release, so I may therefore bring forward amendments to clarify the type of release that is being provided for under the Bill.

On amendment No. 8, my point was that the emphasis should be on the assessment of the current risk of the person before the board.  There should be an emphasis on current knowledge of the public safety environment, on assessing risk to the community or risk of reoffending at the present time, using up-to-date information from currently serving members of the force.  It is important to focus on the prisoner now and at how much he or she has been rehabilitated, and not have a retrospective look at the period of his or her offence or his or her sentencing.  A retired garda might have known the prisoner better in the past than a serving garda, but we hope that the prisoner is not the same individual he or she was when he or she got into trouble and that maybe he or she has moved on.  While we accept that the principle of prison does not work, the thinking is that it is supposed to rehabilitate prisoners.  If the system was better than it is, there might be more rehabilitation than there is.  To give a person a fair chance, it is fair to look at his or her present more than his or her past.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Callaghan made a point about retired garda&iacute;.

Amendment No. 13 reads:<\/p><blockquote>two persons appointed through a competitive selection process coordinated by the Public Appointments Service with knowledge and experience of working or volunteering in a support role with criminal offenders and discharged prisoners.<\/blockquote> <p>My amendment has a similar intent to that of Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment No. 12, which allows for the possibility of two community representatives.  My amendment seeks to appoint people who have worked in the community or in pastoral roles with offenders to the board.  They would be a welcome addition.  My amendment is more definite than amendment No. 12.  My amendment wants it made obligatory to appoint two community persons rather than leave it as an option.  The aim of my amendment is supported by the present parole board.  <\/p><p>I made the point on Second Stage that the board is heavily weighted towards legal and high powered people who, with the best will in the world, probably have more professional contact rather than a direct experience of dealing with some of people who are up for parole.  In that sense, community experience and that type of background would add a good and necessary balance to the board.  My amendment is important to me because it seeks to make the provision obligatory rather than optional.<\/p><p>I tabled amendments Nos. 14 and 15.  Section 8(1) provides for the parole board to be made up of &quot;not more than 15&quot; members.  My amendment seeks to improve gender representation and bring it closer to 50:50.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#E00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>We are both on the same page on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#E00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Are we?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#E00400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#E00500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I tabled the amendment along with the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#E00600","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>That amendment is sorted.

My amendments seek an open competition for appointment to the board and the rationale is the same as previously.  I do not have a difficulty with the professions being represented.  It is good for the board to be comprised of legal people, Garda and psychologists.  I have a problem with their nominating bodies nominating people rather than using merit.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust has also raised its concern that the people who are favoured by the organisation might be nominated and that they will agree between themselves to take turns to be appointed for a year.  People are not being nominated on merit.  It is too important to leave the final say to the representative bodies even though I do not have a problem with the criteria.  It is really important to have psychologists.  I would prefer people to be nominated on merit and for a competition to be held.  I do not think a competition would put people off.

I could not get on the board even against that background.<\/p> <p>  Finally, amendment No. 21 seeks to add to the list of criteria that must be satisfied before somebody can be considered for appointment to the parole board.  It is important that members of the board have training or experience in interview techniques given that the contact with the person is based on report but a lot of it is based on a person's performance during an interview.  People need to be qualified in how to assess the situation.  They must be able to recognise when a person does a bad interview or does not represent himself or herself properly.  It is a disempowering process for the applicant.  Therefore, it is important that board members are skilled in how to draw people out in an interview process, particularly in the criminal justice system.  Board members need common sense.  A knee-jerk impression can cloud a person's judgment so board members need training.  It is a complex issue.  We need people who can see past their feelings.  I agree with the parole board in its call for inservice training in interview techniques to be provided.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#E01400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a small matter with the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#E01500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#E01600","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>This situation arose last week as well.

I have had the benefit of reading their decisions, and having to make a decision myself on the recommendation they are making to me.<\/p> <p>  I will make a general point first about how critical the membership is.  I think everybody here accepts that it is critical to have the right people on the board because one must make life and death decisions almost.  One must assess the most serious offenders or people who have committed the most serious of crimes who are before the parole board in terms of an application for their future management.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Wallace that risk assessment is absolutely central.  I have given an awful lot of thought to this matter.  I constantly ask myself the following when I read these cases.  What is the risk?   What is the risk assessment?  How has it been done by the parole board?  How well has it been done by the various reports that the board has access to?  If I have any questions about it I refer them back and get further information.  I say that just to highlight how absolutely critical decision-making is and the implications it has for society as a whole in terms of safety and of course for the individual in terms of his or her future life and his or her opportunity for rehabilitation.  That always has to be balanced with an absolutely accurate assessment, in so far as we can.  These things are not a precise science but they are terribly important.  The membership of the board must be seen in that light.  The criteria that we use are critically important.<\/p><p>I have put much thought into this.  We must ensure we get the right mix and the right balances, and that we do not do anything just for the sake of a representation that might appear to be the right thing to do.  We must have a process in place that ensures we get the best people on the parole board.  That is the goal of everybody in the committee.<\/p><p> In that context, I will not oppose amendment No. 7.  It expands the category of persons qualified to be the chairperson of the parole board.  It broadens it to include a solicitor or barrister of ten years standing.  Deputy O'Callaghan also includes the phrase \"a practising academic\".  There might be further qualification of that because it is a broad phrase and we might need to narrow it down in the context of the job to be done on the parole board.  However, I am happy to revert to the Deputy on that.  The Bill will establish the parole board on a statutory basis with decision making powers to release prisoners prior to completion of sentence.  I have a preference for a legally qualified chairperson, but I can give it further consideration.  I also wish to examine the phrase \"practising academic\" to define it a little further.<\/p><p> With regard to the amendment proposed by Deputy Wallace, it is existing practice to have a retired member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the parole board.  On the point the Deputy makes about risk assessment, whether the member is retired is not an influencing factor.  The Deputy appears to be talking about cases where there might be what might be seen as a conflict of interest or where there might have been an involvement of the garda in the case.  I do not know how often that happens, but I would not have thought it was very often.  The key point is the critical ability of the garda, retired or otherwise, to make the risk assessment.  Restricting it to current members narrows the depth of expertise available to the board, so I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 9 proposes to include in the membership of the parole board \"a lay community representative, appointed following a transparent and objective recruitment process and selected by an independent body\".  Amendment No. 12 proposed by Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan contains a similar proposal involving the appointment of such a representative by the Minister.  Obviously, \"community representative\" is a very broad concept and there are varying ideas of who such a representative might be.  The basic point, as I have already said, is that persons with the greatest expertise in crime, justice, offender management and, in particular, rehabilitation and re-integration of offenders should be represented.  I am not convinced that the amendment is necessary or sufficiently clearly drafted, but I will not oppose it.  However, members should again consider the point that the board we are appointing comprises people who must be as tight as possible in terms of the expertise we would like them to bring to the board.  It is such a serious decision to make and we want people who understand the context and have the broad qualifications.  I have no wish to restrict it unduly, because people bring much life experience to this type of situation as well.  However, management of offenders and understanding of criminal behaviour, recidivism and rehabilitation are very important.  A particular difficulty with amendment No. 9 relates to the process of recruitment.  There is no guidance on who or what would comprise the independent body with responsibility for selection of the person in question.  Including the words \"transparent\" and \"objective\" appears to be superfluous because this is a requirement of all recruitment processes.  I will proceed with amendment No. 12.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 10, 13, 16, 17, 19 and 21 proposed by Deputy Clare Daly also relate to the membership of the board and in particular the appointment of persons to the board.  The Bill currently provides for the membership of the board to include persons appearing to the Minister to have knowledge and experience of the supervision of discharged prisoners or who have made a study of the causes of delinquency.  Currently, when the Minister has to make an appointment to the board, there are clear criteria for who should be appointed.  They must be expert.  Amendments Nos. 10 and 19 remove the Minister from any role in the appointment of persons to the parole board and assign the role to the Public Appointments Service.  The membership of the board as currently proposed in section 8 properly identifies the appropriate persons to be members of the board as well as the means of appointment.  It is appropriate, given the Minister for Justice and Equality's oversight of the criminal justice system, that the Minster should have input into the membership of the board.  The Minister has responsibility for oversight and has awareness of the broad issues in crime.  To exclude the Minister having any input into the board is unnecessary.<\/p><p> It is a positive thing for the Minister to have an input into the membership because one often finds when one looks at the membership of a board that some skills might be absent, so when the Minister is due to make the appointment that could be taken into consideration.  One may find, for whatever reason, that particular expertise has been selected by everybody else who has an input into the membership and there might well be a gap which could be filled by the appointment by the Minister of the two members.  This relates not just to the parole board, but to appointments in general.  Certainly one of the criteria I consider when making board appointments is what skills are necessary in the particular situation and what is missing.  That is a unique role and unique knowledge the Minister can have, as opposed to other people.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 13 proposes the appointment of a further two persons through the Public Appointments Service with experience of working with offenders.  It is evident that the board as set out under section 8 already contains such persons, be it the representative of the Probation Service or the representative of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, a body with a great deal of experience in this area and which focuses on these issues and is very appropriate.  Equally subparagraph (i) of the section refers to the appointment of persons with knowledge and experience of the supervision or aftercare of discharged persons and there is potentially considerable overlap with that provision and the amendment proposed by the Deputy.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 propose that persons appointed to the parole board should be selected through competitions run by the Public Appointments Service.  This would be extremely unwieldy if it was applied to everybody.  The appointment of existing employees of certain services such as the IPS or the Probation Service should be a matter for those organisations and those appointed will continue to be employees of those services.  I do not believe that any difficulty has been raised by the existing parole board which these amendments would address.  There would have to be further consultation with a number of the organisations and with the Public Appointments Service on the impact of these amendments before they could sensibly be agreed.  Members will understand my point.  Take the example of a probation officer who is nominated to be a member.  It is quite appropriate that this comes from within the Probation Service, as opposed to all probation officers going to the Public Appointments Service and having to go through that process and then returning as members.  It is unwieldy.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 21 is to section 8(4), which sets out certain requirements of persons appointed to the parole board.  The amendment adds to those requirements by requiring the person to have training or experience in interviewing techniques and proven analytical skills.  Again, that is very broad.  These skills are clearly necessary.  Whether it is necessary to build in them in as a specific requirement in this way, that everybody has skill in interviewing and in analytical techniques, gives rise to the question of assessing that and building it in as a criterion.  People will bring a different range of skills to the board and I am not sure it is necessary to go into that level of detail.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 relate to the gender balance of the parole board and I agree with them.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 18 corrects an oversight in providing for the appointment of a probation officer to the board by including such appointment in paragraph (3)(e) of section 8.  However, I propose to bring forward an amendment to provide for the appointment of a probation officer by the director of the Probation Service. <\/p><p> The key goal is to get the right mix of people with the right level of training, experience and understanding of the area to do this important job.  That has guided my approach and response to the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#E02000","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>While I was listening to the contributions I looked at section 8 again.

It is inappropriate, as I have suggested, to try to get around that by getting the Irish Prison Service to nominate the person.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 12 accommodates Deputy Wallace's concern about a lay community representative, as it includes such a representative.  I agree, however, it is a board that requires expertise.  I know Deputy Daly's concern in respect of trying to get everyone nominated in a transparent and open way.  My assessment of trying to get people to serve on public boards, and I do not have the experience of other people here, is that it is hard to get decent people to serve.  If we have a process whereby people have to apply for a competition and, as the Minister said, every probation officer has to apply for a competition and has to be separately interviewed, after which an individual will be selected, it would make it very complicated, in my opinion.  Maybe in a different society it would be appropriate, but it would make it extremely complicated to get membership of the board in this way.  The method we have in section 8 at present is that four people will be nominated by the Public Appointments Service and other individuals will be nominated by representative bodies, such as the Irish Penal Reform Trust, a probation officer, the Prison Service, a garda, a psychologist and the psychiatrists will nominate a person.  There will be a good mix there, and the Minister will also have a role in it.

The involvement of the Public Appointments Services is part of a broader political debate flowing out of public disquiet over the way in which appointments to boards were previously handled.  It is something we have discussed.  In this context, I am prepared to see this is a board that will not be a highly sought-after gig with loads of initials after people's names and wads of cash attached to it.  Presumably the people who would opt to go to the parole board would do so out of a motivation of public service or an association in a former life or some interest in the area.  In this sense, I accepted the point that perhaps mandating the Public Appointments Service to deal with a board of this character, which does not meet weekly, is perhaps a little top-heavy.  However, it is there to overcome the difficulty with previous political appointments.  I am prepared to stand back from this group of amendments.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the idea of the nominating bodies being subject to some scrutiny, perhaps this does not apply to this type of board because the people coming forward will be those who will want to come forward, and they will not be stampeded in the queue for the positions.  That is probably true.  Others, such as judicial boards, would be prestige gigs and we would need to include more caveats.  When we say nominating bodies this does not necessarily give a level of transparency.  Perhaps the overall balance is met by the various categories.<\/p> <p>  I am quite adamant about the inclusion of a community representative, whether it is done in Deputy Wallace's way or my way.  Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments also speak about community.  Deputy Brophy's points are a bit facetious, because the person will define himself or herself and the appointment process will nominate who comes forward.  Yes, a Member of the Oireachtas is a community representative as far as I am concerned, but in actual fact what is far more likely in this category, and what is supported by the present parole board, is the idea of somebody who has experience of working with ex-offenders.  In this sense, they would be very well placed.  They may not have initials after their name but they have street knowledge of risk and how a person's sentence was managed, and they could be a really valuable addition to the professional people on the board.  The only point is to have a balance with the high-powered professional-type input because, with the best in the world, people who are professional may not have a broader understanding.  They have their own expertise, but it could be blended with somebody who has more of the background.  Many of the people up for parole perpetrated their crimes in their own communities on neighbours and friends.  If they are going back into those communities it is precisely those people who would be the victims of further crime if they got it wrong.  A community representative would be a valuable addition, whether through Deputy Wallace's amendment or mine.  I take what Deputy O'Callaghan is saying, that his amendment allows for community also, but it is only an option and not an obligation.  I believe somebody such as this would be invaluable to the board.  I would like such a person to be there.  I accept the Minister's point on amendment No. 21 regarding interviews.<\/p><p>My amendment is probably too detailed.  Hopefully, the board deals with that issue.

What it has teased out in subsequent contributions from Deputy Clare Daly is what was being talked about, not merely a generic community representative but a specific type of community representative.  Others might have a view that the community is victims of crime which have a particular view on what has happened to their life or their families lives, or someone like that, would be as entitled to a community representative of a similar nature on the parole board.  We are trying to strike a balance in terms of the membership of the board.  There is a good balance outlined, by the Bill and by some of the proposed amendments, but we need to be careful that we do not seem to be, by a careful process of how we select the board, almost creating a prejudged outcome for what the parole board will do.  I renew my reservation about the broadness of the term \"community representative\" without qualifying it in some way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#H00300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Would the T&aacute;naiste like to respond to any of this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#H00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>No, that is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#H00500","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Callaghan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#H00600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>No.  I have nothing more to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#H00700","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>We are finished.

Deputy Mick Wallace seeks to require the chairperson of the board to adhere to the principles of impartiality when making such appointments.  The Bill will establish the parole board on a statutory footing.  The board and its members will be subject to all of the duties and obligations of any statutory decision-making body and the requirements of fair procedures, as Deputy Jim O'Callaghan said.  There is a body of law which oversees and covers procedures.  In that regard, the amendment is unnecessary and would actually cloud the situation a little.

Supporting the timely communication of parole board decisions to candidates for parole and other relevant parties is vital.  According to the Irish Penal Reform Trust, there can be delays of up to nine months before a candidate for parole has a decision communicated to him or her, which is more than frustrating for the prisoners who want to act on the parole board's recommendations.  For example, sometimes it might recommend particular training or treatment.  If the communication of a decision is delayed by months, it is a little mad and not very fair.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of accountability and the keeping of records and so on, the committee does not need me to tell it that we do not have enough of it in Ireland.  We are considering bringing forward a Bill to make it compulsory to keep minutes, for example.  A simple example would be the decision made by NAMA to shred the minutes of the meeting of 13 December which was crucial in the final stages of the setting up of Project Eagle.  Greater accountability is required across the board in how we do things, but the point about a prisoner receiving information in good time, surely, is quite practical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#J02100","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I agree with amendment No. 26 tabled by Deputy Clare Daly.

Putting a specific date on it - for example, a requirement that it be done within four weeks - would make it very difficult for the board.  However, on balance, I have no problem with amendments Nos. 28 and 29.  I do not think amendments Nos. 26 and 27 are over the top, as suggested by Deputy Clare Daly, but I am concerned that they would limit the discretion of the parole board and the chairperson.  The objective in having panels of three, four or five individuals is that a number of panels could be in operation at any one time.  It should be remembered that there are only 15 people on the board; therefore, there could be between three and five panels operating at any one time.  We are better off leaving discretion as to how panels are operated with the chairperson.  If panels are to consist of five members every time, less consideration may be given and they could find themselves overworked.  Every single one of the five members would only be able to deal with three applications at a time.  Therefore, on balance, I would leave the provision as it is and let the chairperson have discretion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#J02300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I will come to the T&aacute;naiste in a moment.

As currently set out in the Bill, that could be three or five members of the board.  It would mean, as Deputy Brophy was saying, that there were always five persons on the panel.  The amendment does remove the flexibility which will lead to the better working of the parole board.  Five out of a board of 15 is quite a lot.  It is a busy board and there are a lot of cases to be seen.  The flexibility that is there at the moment for the chair is good.  One does not want to increase the membership of the board.  By keeping the flexibility and have the chairperson decide, I have no doubt that on some occasions the chairperson may decide that there is five in particular cases.  I would prefer to stick with flexibility.  It also means that more reviews can be carried out.  Ultimately, the people on this board have applied and are volunteers.  Giving the chair the flexibility is the best use and what will get the best outcome, depending on their skills.  It is better to keep the position where there is three or five and to allow the board to manage its work and get on with it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Wallace wants to insert the words \"signed and dated\".  I take his point but I would say the words are unnecessary and could call into question similar provisions in legislation.  Obviously, all decisions should be signed and dated and statutory provision is not necessary.  I would be concerned that accepting the amendment may have unintended implications for similar statutory provisions but I am happy to look at it.  It is a common sense approach, and why not make it statutory, but it may be that there would be subsequential issues for other statutory provisions.  I would like to have a look at it again with the Parliamentary Counsel and perhaps come back on Report Stage.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Wallace's other amendment refers to \"the decision must be provided directly to the prisoner within reasonable time frame\".  I agree with that, of course it should.  I suggest that section 15(2) and 16(2) of the Bill already make the necessary provision for decisions to be forwarded to the parole candidate directly and that we do not need further provision.  However, we do not have a big problem with this issue of reasonable time frame.

There is a list of criteria, such as risk of reoffending, conduct to date, etc., and this adds extra criteria to take account of the effect the decision would have on the prisoner's family and the likelihood of facilitating his or her reintegration.  A theme of our discussions on penal reform was that the role of the family and social supports are the key determinant in whether somebody will reoffend or not.  One could say that this is basically covered by looking at the risk of reoffending but we need to elevate that issue.  That is why I have included it.  International evidence shows that family integration is the key to whether somebody is going to end up back in prison or not.

The reason I tabled the amendment is that if one is charged with murder, there is no incentive to pleading guilty, because whether one pleads guilty or not guilty, one will be sentenced to life imprisonment.  I thought there might be some benefit in providing an incentive for a person accused of murder that if he or she pleads guilty, it could be taken into account at the parole process.<\/p> <p>  Having spoken to officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, I recognise there are issues in respect of it.  For instance, why should whether a person pleaded guilty or not guilty at the time of the prosecution be taken into account when assessing whether he or she should be rehabilitated and allowed out into the community?  The real issue I am trying to deal is to provide an incentive to plead guilty to a murder charge when there is none at present.  Perhaps the parole process is not the way to do that.  On that basis, further consideration needs to be given to it.  I will withdraw amendment No. 62.<\/p> <p>  In amendment No. 32, Deputy Daly proposes additional factors that need to be taken into account, including the effect the granting of parole may have on the prisoner's family.  My concern is this will lead to a corresponding requirement by the family of a murder victim to have its submission taken into account and what impact the release will have on it.  Under the Bill a victim can make representations to the parole board.  I am concerned Deputy Daly's amendment will extend it further to take into account factors that are not relevant to the central issue, which is the rehabilitation or not of the parole candidate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#L01300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 32 tabled by Deputy Daly would require a report regarding a parole candidate to include the effect the granting of parole may have on the prisoner&rsquo;s family and the likelihood that being granted parole would facilitate reintegration into his or her family.  It is clear from section 19 of the Bill that a parole board may grant parole if, in its opinion, the person being considered for parole will not present a risk to society and releasing the person will facilitate the reintegration of that person into society.<\/p> <p>  From the cases I have seen, there is a significant level of information available to the parole board when considering cases.  The parole board has all the information that is relevant, including how the prisoner has behaved, how he or she has dealt with disciplinary issues and if there has been contact with family.  A wide amount of information is available to the parole board.  In her amendment, Deputy Daly proposed to insert \"the effect that the granting of parole may have on the prisoner's family\".  There are broader issues in regard to family.  I understand the point the Deputy is making but the effect on the prisoner&rsquo;s family of the actual decision is not really relevant to these considerations.<\/p><p>With regard to facilitating reintegration of the offender into his or her family, the parole board always considers the overarching matter of reintegration into society, which encompasses the aspect of integration into family.  Having the effect on family in statute is problematic.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 63 to section 19 of the Bill makes a similar provision regarding facilitating reintegration with family.  Under subsection(1)(<i>b<\/i>) of section 19, the parole board may grant parole to a person if, in its opinion, the release of the person in question would facilitate the reintegration of the person into society.  That is the general point.  The intention behind the Deputy's amendment is adequately covered in the provision as is.  I note the comments of Deputy O'Callaghan with regard to amendment No. 62.<br\/><br\/>Both amendments seek to achieve the same aim and I will outline a concern as to possible consequences if this amendment is agreed.  The effect of the amendment suggests that defendants who plead guilty to an offence would receive a positive benefit with respect to their being considered for parole.  I agree that a defendant&rsquo;s remorse or admission of guilt should be acknowledged.  However, I do not believe that a defendant who fails to plead guilty should be negatively impacted in respect of release.  Where a defendant pleads guilty this can be, and generally is, taken into account as a mitigating factor for the purpose of sentencing and that is correct.  I do not agree that it is a relevant factor - Deputy O'Callaghan made this point - with respect to the release of the prisoner and I consider the criteria currently set out in the Bill to be sufficiently broad for the purpose of determining release.  I repeat that I would not like to see offenders who have pleaded not guilty, as is their right, and were convicted following a trial having that choice and right possibly negatively impacting on a decision relating to their release.<br\/><br\/>Section 19 of the Bill provides that the parole board may grant release if the person being considered for parole will not present an undue risk to society and the release of the prisoner will facilitate the reintegration of the person into society.  I do not see how the nature of the offender&rsquo;s plea would inform either of those considerations.  We are going back to the basic purpose of the parole board, which is assessing risk.  That is really the key consideration at that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#L01400","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I totally accept the points made by the Minister and Deputy O'Callaghan.

This is against the backdrop of where the Bill currently provides for the parole panel to refuse somebody and not be considered again for two years.  I am trying to replace this with a provision for one year as I do not accept the two-year rule.  I am not sure if it is a resourcing issue but it is too long.  The European Court of Human Rights has accepted periods of less than a year between reviews and rejected periods of more than a year as incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights Article 5.4.  In Murray <i>v.<\/i>Parole Board, the English Court of Appeal stated the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights regarding parole review periods for life sentence prisoners was that for an interval of more than a year, the onus is on the state to establish a period is not in breach of Article 5.4.<\/p><p>This is really important and there is no logical reason a year could not be considered.  Sentence length can be a kind of peculiar concoction in some ways, as it is not necessarily linked to rehabilitation.  It is a mixture of punishment depending on the seriousness of the offence, tradition and how long prisoners are likely to move towards rehabilitation.  All of those factors are put in.  The parole system is really the only comprehensive way of keeping track in this regard to see if rehabilitation is working.  Two years is just too long.<\/p><p>Earlier this year I was contacted by the partner of a prisoner serving a life sentence and this man has basically ticked all the boxes necessary to become eligible for parole.  He has not been granted it to date because of delays in accessing therapeutic services that have been mandated to him but not provided.  That is not his fault but it is holding up the entire process when he is carrying out his side of the bargain.  It is preventing him from being paroled.<\/p><p>Instances like this cannot be addressed in the Bill, but by shortening the time period between parole applications pressure could be brought to bear in circumstances where, for example, the Irish Prison Service is not delivering services that would help the person to get parole, when he or she is doing all that is required and ticking all of the boxes.  If the parole board was meeting the individual within a year rather than two years, for example, then the person could say that he or she did not get access to counselling and the board could then apply some pressure.  I am trying here to overcome such problems and believe this amendment will make the Bill more human rights compliant, which is why I will be pressing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#M02000","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Deputy Clare Daly is right about the two year issue, which comes up again later on, but if my amendment No. 44 is accepted then-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#N00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Then amendments Nos. 45 and 46 cannot be moved-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#N00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Yes.

I know that the Government is reluctant to accept specific time limits but this goes back to the issue we discussed earlier regarding what is a &quot;reasonable&quot; timeframe and how long is a piece of string.  I understand that there is a danger that a failure on the part of the authorities to meet a timeline may give rise to a judicial review or a potential cost to the State and I can see why the Government might want to avoid it.

That seems very reasonable.  Amendment No. 42 would require a decision of a parole review to be given to the parole candidate&rsquo;s legal representative.  There is no provision in the Bill for legal representation for the purposes of the review.  The reference in the Bill to legal representation is in relation to the hearings.  I would certainly have no difficulty with legal representatives being included in section 16 of the Bill for the purpose of receiving a copy of the decision following a hearing, as proposed by Deputy Wallace in amendment No. 47.  The review stage under the Bill is an initial consideration of parole on the basis of such information and reports as the parole panel considers relevant.  These are reviewed by the panel which can then decide if parole should be granted.  If not, the parole candidate can request a full hearing under section 16 of the Bill.  I would also like to inform to the select committee that it is my intention to bring forward amendments to provide for legal aid where necessary with respect to representation at hearings.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 43 which was tabled by Deputy Wallace would require a hearing following a refusal of parole to be conducted within four weeks.  I believe that is too short a period of time in which to prepare for such a hearing.  Aside from operational difficulties this may cause the parole board with respect to gathering evidence or seeking witnesses, it might also cause difficulties for a parole candidate and his or her legal representative with respect to considering the decision following the initial review and preparing for the hearing.  I would suggest further consideration be given to this provision.<\/p> <p>  I have no difficulty with amendment No. 44.  Amendment No. 67 tabled by Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan relates to section 21 and will address the subject of amendment 44.  If amendment No. 44 is agreed, then amendment 67 provides that parole candidates will be eligible to make subsequent applications for parole after two years from the date of the most recent decision declining parole.  The parole board may also direct a shorter period than two years.  Amendments Nos. 46 and 51 from Deputy Daly are to section 16 and would require a parole candidate who is refused parole to be further considered for parole one year following that refusal.  The Bill currently provides for subsequent considerations two years following review.  However, as I have said, amendment No. 67 will allow the parole board to direct a shorter period than two years and I have a preference for proceeding with that approach.  I believe we should make statutory provision for it being done in less than two years.  I would prefer to take that route.  I would go back to the earlier point about the quality of the decision making in the first instance.  If we are satisfied with the membership of the panels and the people doing the work, including the chair and with the fact that they are giving serious consideration to each and every case and are carrying out proper risk assessments, then referring decisions back within a year might not be appropriate.  I would prefer to leave it to the discretion of the panel.  There may be outstanding issues or some reason for the panel deciding that it would like to conduct a hearing again within a shorter period and it can do that.  I believe that is a better way to proceed.  <\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 89 provides for the legal representative of the parole candidate to be notified of a hearing.  It may be the case that a legal representative has not been engaged by or appointed to the candidate.  Perhaps the amendment could be reconsidered to provide for notification to a legal representative where the candidate is represented for the purpose of a parole hearing.  That is just a technical and practical point.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#N01300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Does anyone wish to make a further contribution on this grouping of amendments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#N01400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>On the point that Deputy Wallace made about providing that the legal representative be notified, that is not necessary for a review because a review is an informal process where they just look at papers.

I understand absolutely that the safety of the community and the victim are of critical importance in making decisions on a person's release, but the emphasis in the paragraph is too much on the actual offence when it should be on rehabilitation, which is the whole purpose.  Of course, we have to have an assessment of the risk to victims and the community if a prisoner is released, but the section already provides that the position of the victim and any victim impact statement or submission made on behalf of the victim must be one of the board's guiding principles.  It would be despicable if someone said a prisoner who had committed an horrific crime was a great fellow in prison and should be released early, while the victim was left to think he or she had no come back.  At the same time, the whole point of prison and parole is supposed to be rehabilitation and allowing someone back into society without the risk of reoffending.  The IPRT put it well.  It stated decision-making should concentrate exclusively on the risk of a prisoner committing a serious offence if released and not engage in re-sentencing by considering the seriousness of the offence and the aggravating circumstances.  I am seeking to delete the line to avoid re-sentencing, while being very cognisant of the impact on victims and the community.  The victim impact statement is taken into account.

It is important to set it out.<\/p> <p>  Deputies Daly and Wallace are correct when they say prison is about rehabilitation but it is also about punishment.  There are many cases where people are just convicted of murder.  There are different degrees of murder.  We do not differentiate between murders under our legal system.  The factors associated with the case of somebody who is convicted of killing a group of children, as supposed to somebody who is convicted of murder committed on the spur of the moment one night with drink taken, can be taken into account.  It could be argued that the issue is to assess whether the former candidate still poses a threat but it is unrealistic to believe the parole board should not take into account the offence for which a person has been convicted.  Sometimes that may be unfair but it is relevant to the function it has to fulfil to ascertain the gravity of the offence committed.  Some offences stand out but not because of media notoriety.  The murder of five children is different from another type of criminal offence.  I am aware that this is a tricky issue.  Not to include what is proposed, however, would mean the board would not take into account the gravity of the original offence.  The reality is that, when any parole board comes to consider a case, it will ask what the individual is convicted of.

It is critical in decision-making that one knows the nature and gravity of the offence.  When I consider the cases that have come to me, I cannot think of one in which, when making a decision on release into society, I would not want to know the details on the nature and gravity of the offence or the risk to society.  I am referring to the exclusion of the nature and gravity of the offence from the list of relevant material that the board should endeavour to take into account under section 18.<\/p> <p>   Amendment 59 would make similar provision with respect to section 20.  The information in question is information that the parole board currently considers and information that parole boards traditionally considered.  To exclude the nature and gravity of the offence would be to exclude fundamental information that is essential.  The nature and gravity of the offence - the particular circumstances in which the murder or rape took place - must be known if one is making a decision on releasing somebody into society.  One also needs to consider a range of other issues.  When one examines the guiding principles in the Bill, one notes this is one of a whole series.  It is stated the board shall endeavour to take into consideration all relevant available information, including the stated reasons and recommendations of the sentencing judge.  This gives a lot of information about the context of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the person whose parole is being considered.  If the offence was committed when the prisoner was 19 and he is now 40, one needs to know what his behaviour has been like in prison, in addition to his attitude, engagement with the alcohol and drugs programmes and his engagement within prison.  One must also consider information from the trial or sentencing process.  Therefore, there is a long list of guiding principles.  The one in question is one of them but it is a very important one that should be left in the legislation.  In view of this I do not believe the amendment is a good one.<\/p> <p>  On amendment No. 54, I have already outlined my concerns with respect to the board taking into consideration an offender's plea at trial.  Moreover, I believe there should be sufficient information in the stated reasons and recommendations of the sentencing judge which are to be considered by the parole board without making specific provision to consider the offender's plea at trial.  As I said, section 19 provides that the parole board may grant release if the person being considered for parole will not present an undue risk to society and the release of the prisoner will facilitate reintegration.  I do not see how the nature of the offender's plea would inform either of these considerations.  We have discussed this.<\/p> <p>  I support amendment No. 55 as an alternative to amendments Nos. 56 and 57.  This amendment will require the board to assess the extent to which the person whose parole is being considered has been rehabilitated and is capable of being reintegrated into society.  That addresses the matters contained in the subsequent amendments from Deputies Daly and Wallace.  These are matters that are central to the way in which the board does its work at present.  I refer to all the issues associated with the potential for rehabilitation.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, the average life sentence served is approximately 18 years.  It is very clear that, in this country, we assess all those issues.  In America, for example, there are much longer sentences and one does not have an opportunity to rehabilitate.  We all know the consequences of that.  We have a good system but all the various factors need to be taken into account.  One obviously has to focus on rehabilitation but, from what I have seen, I am very confident that it is fully taken into account.<\/p> <p>  On a more general point, sections 18 and 19 would benefit from further review as there is some overlap in the guiding principles under section 18 and the factors to which the board may have regard in deciding on whether to make a parole order under section 19.  For instance, section 19(1)(a) provides that the parole board may grant parole if, in its opinion, the person being considered for parole will not present an undue risk to society and the release of the person will facilitate the reintegration of that person into society.  To take up Deputy Daly's point, reintegration is one of the factors to which the board may have regard, as set out under subsection (2) of section 18.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the drafting of section 18, consideration will also need to be given to the numbering.  There may be some stand-alone subsections.  This, however, can be accounted for in any amendments to sections 18 and 19 to bring them further into line with each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#P00300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":380,"content":"<p>If someone does something absolutely terrible, it should be dealt with up-front, at the start.

The trust is opposed to the introduction of any mandatory minimum custodial periods.  The Law Reform Commission and the Strategic Review of Penal Policy have both recommended that no new mandatory sentencing regimes be introduced.  The Law Reform Commission report on mandatory sentencing of 2013 recommends that where an offender is convicted of murder and is, therefore, sentenced to life in prison, legislation should provide that the judge may recommend a minimum term to be served by the offender.  This would deal with the issue.<\/p> <p>  Tariffs may provide clarity and reassurance to victims and to life-sentence prisoners in terms of the length of periods of imprisonment.  If tariffs are introduced where the original sentencing judge stipulates a minimum custodial period based on the gravity and circumstances of the offence, considering the nature and gravity of the offence, as in sections 18 and 19, after this period has been served may amount to re-sentencing.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Tom O'Malley of NUI has said there must be some mechanism for identifying the absolute minimum period a sentenced prisoner is required to serve before being eligible for release.  Otherwise, a parole board risks subjecting the prisoner to double jeopardy, that is, trying the prisoner twice for the same crime.  No one is saying otherwise but some people are definitely deemed unfit to be let loose in society because of the nature of their crimes, and they should be dealt with accordingly.<\/p><p>If a judge stipulates the minimum amount of time that a person must serve then the parole board must have an open mind and the notion that the person is in a different place must be entertained. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#P00400","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I can see where Deputies Daly and Wallace are coming from with their amendments.

The judge factors in the nature and gravity of an offence when sentencing.  Nobody is saying that the parole board will not know what the person has been imprisoned for.  Of course the board will know the type of crime.  It must recognise the impact the original crime has had on the victim but it must also recognise the impact on the victim of its decision to release the person up for parole.  That provision is still in place.  It is important that the submissions made by the victim are taken into account.  We are trying to avoid a situation where a person has ticked all of the boxes.  Presumably, if the nature and gravity of the crime is particularly appalling then the person will have been imprisoned for quite a while.  The person will have completed their treatment and therapy, admitted they are wrong, acknowledged their crime, tried to make amends and all of the rest and yet the decision could be held back by having to specifically take into account the nature and gravity of the crime.<\/p> <p>  The parole board will take account of the nature and gravity as it is in the background.  To spell it out does not bring balance and I believe it is better to remove the clause.  A parole board is supposed to assess whether a person is ready to be reintegrated in society.  To reach that stage the person will have had to cross many barriers.  In addition, many of the issues will have been dealt with at the sentencing stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#Q00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I will go over this matter again.  Essentially, a parole board analyses the whole situation.  It conducts a risk assessment, on behalf of society, on the possibility for rehabilitation.  It seems to me that one cannot assess the current risk unless one understands the nature of the offence that was committed in the first place and the risks factors that led to same.  The nature and gravity of the offence must, absolutely in my view, be factored into the current risk assessment.<\/p> <p>  It was mentioned that one should not go back in time because the person has served his or her sentence.  Of course one must consider the circumstances, the nature and type of the offence.  That is the reason the person is in prison in the first place - the nature and the offence.  We are talking about very serious offences.  Understanding the particular circumstances that led to the offences in the first place in my view, and from my experience, is critical in terms of deciding what the next step would be.  It is critical for the parole board when it makes an assessment.  It considers the journey that the person has undertaken and it is a journey away from the offence that he or she committed in the first place.  The nature and type of offence must be centrally involved in the decision-making.  It is one of the factors.<\/p> <p>  Many of these crimes, where crimes have been committed by people who go before the parole board - any murder, any description of any murder, any rape and any of these serious reasons why people are in prison - are going to be horrendous situations.  That is the reason the person is in prison in the first place.  It is why the person started out being in prison.  Understanding the nature and type of the offence, the circumstances, and Deputy O'Callaghan gave examples of the type circumstances one could have in terms of being associated with alcohol and drugs, then understanding the journey the person has been on in prison in regard to drugs and alcohol would be a critical part of the decision-making.<\/p> <p>  My view is that this provision should absolutely be left in the legislation.  The provision is central to the current risk assessment that one makes about the future of the person.  It is one of many factors.  The other factors have been well spelled out in the Bill.  They include rehabilitation.  They include the other areas that I have already read out such as the details about the trial and what happened at the trial.  The provision is central.  To take it out would miss an essential part of a risk assessment.  In terms of having a safe society, it would be a great disservice to remove the nature and gravity of the offence that was committed in the first place.  <\/p> <p>  As far as mandatory sentencing is concerned, Deputy Wallace, it is a totally different issue.  I happen to agree and I think most of the bodies that have examined the matter, such as the Law Reform Commission and penal reform groups, have moved away from that stance.  One often gets calls in society for mandatory sentencing.  I support the view of the Law Reform Commission and penal reform groups in terms of this matter.  It is not a matter for the parole board.  That is a different issue and it dealt with in other legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#Q00400","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Our wires have crossed.

One could have recommendations, which would not be permitted once this law came in.  In America one can be sentenced without parole.  Ireland has a statutory mechanism.

I tabled the amendment in the context that the Irish Penal Reform Trust said that a violation of conditions in the absence of a criminal offence being committed should not automatically mean the person is returned to prison.  I know Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill provides for a parole licence to be suspended if somebody is deemed to be an undue risk or if he or she has breached his or her release conditions, and that is fair enough.  A suspension of a licence is fine but to have it entirely revoked with a person being sent back to prison to serve his or her full sentence is an incredibly serious decision and it should be one that is only taken for the most serious of reasons.  It should not be automatic for the breaching a condition.  The transgression has to be serious enough for it to amount to a criminal offence for it to be considered.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 82 deals the two-years versus one-year debate regarding a person whose parole licence has been revoked.  It provides for a person whose parole licence has been revoked not having to wait two years to have a review in that he or she could have one after a period of one year.  It is worth saying that the provision my amendment seeks to amend is deemed to be not appropriate by the current parole board.  That is why we decided to examine that and it is interesting to take on board the parole board's views on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#S04300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":478,"content":"<p>My comments are on the same theme.  My two amendments are similar to Deputy Daly's amendment but are worded differently.  The conditions attached should be reasonable and proportionate.  A breach in a parole order should not automatically mean a return to prison.  All relevant circumstances should be taken into consideration, including prior behaviour on licence.  A recall to prison can disrupt positive factors, which have been known to protect against reoffending, such as stable accommodation, employment, family relationships, contact with community health care and so on.  Therefore, a decision to recall a person to prison should be proportionate to the seriousness of conditions breached.<\/p> <p>  The intention must be to try to keep the individual out of prison if at all possible and that he or she would be only thrown back into it if there was no choice.

Deputies Daly and Wallace are correct in stating that serious sanctions can be imposed by the parole board.  They only arise in circumstances where conditions have been breached and the other grounds are set out in the section.  The section states that a person who is the subject of a parole order can have it revoked if he or she poses an undue risk to the safety of the community and he or she has breached his or her release conditions and the board is satisfied that the gravity of the matters outlined justify the revocation of a parole order.<\/p><p>Then there are lesser grounds for a suspension.  Either way, under section 25(4), they have an entitlement to a hearing and it is not as though one can have some arbitrary decision by the parole board stating it will revoke that person's parole order.  The person will get a hearing.  It is not feasible for it simply to be the case that they could only revoke it if the person has committed a criminal offence.  One is out on licence, to a certain extent, when one is out on parole and it is a privilege that one is being given.  It is not only if one commits a criminal offence.  One must comply with the conditions.  For instance, one of the conditions could be to stay away from a particular person.

Currently, the section provides that an order may be revoked if the person poses an undue risk to the safety of the community or any person - that stalking example is a good one - or persons or has breached a condition of his or her parole.  I would have very grave concerns about agreeing this amendment.  Parole is in effect conditional release.  A person knows precisely what the conditions are.<\/p> <p>  If a person was to pose an undue risk or breach a condition of his or her release, then the option of revoking the parole order must be available.  That is what it is about.  One is released on certain conditions.  It is not merely about whether one commits a further crime.  It is about all the varying conditions.  I return to the quality of the parole hearing.  If one has the proper risk assessment, one will have the proper conditions laid out in the order.<\/p> <p>  It is also the case that a person who has an order revoked is entitled, under the Bill, to a hearing following the revocation or suspension of an order.  The grounds for revocation, as set out in the Bill, are common grounds in parole practice and we should retain them.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 78 and 79 to section 20 would require any breach of conditions to be a serious breach.  The seriousness or otherwise of a breach of a condition is a matter which can be considered at the subsequent hearing.  A breach of a condition as a trigger for revocation or suspension of an order is a straightforward matter to determine.  Determining what amounts to a serious breach and who would make such a determination would introduce a subjectivity which could cause delay in what may be a high risk situation - one must keep that in mind.  Persons granted parole will be fully aware of the conditions of their release and their need to abide by those conditions.  All of that is part of the parole hearing.  It is laid out clearly.  The person will know precisely the conditions by which they must abide.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 81 is unnecessary, in my view.  There is no reason to consider that the hearing into the revocation of a parole order could amount to a renewed parole process.  It is clear from subsection (4) of section 25 that the person who is subject to the revocation of the parole order may make submissions &ndash; for the purpose of a hearing &ndash; in respect of the proposed grounds upon which it is proposed to revoke or suspend the order.<\/p> <p>  Amendment 82 was discussed in a fair bit of detail by us already.  It proposes the reduction, from two years to one year, in the subsequent period before which a person can seek to be further considered for parole.  I have already made clear my view on that.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on section 25 at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#T00200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I disagree.

I certainly do anyway.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan states it is a pleasure to be out on parole.  There is an element of that, but if one is in prison for a long time, he or she would not be used to being out.  On the idea that one might breach some of the rules because one is out, like a calf in the shed after the winter being let out into a green field of grass who behaves in a funny fashion for a while until he or she gets used to it, the prisoner, when he is released after being inside for a long time, is in a strange place.

Suspension of a licence is fair enough - I can see that - but what we are trying to say is it should be a serious criminal matter that has a person sent back to prison with his or her sentence reinstated.

I would not like it to be operated in a black and white fashion.  I am sure the parole board would not operate it as such.

It requires discretion on the part of the parole board and that is the way it will operate.  It is a serious sanction.  It would only happen, I would have thought, in exceptional circumstances.

If someone is arrested under subsection (1), the Bill currently provides that the board can exercise the powers without holding a review or hearing.  My amendment tries to change that such that if the situation is not urgent and the board is considering having someone arrested and returned to prison, it needs to first conduct a review or hearing.  In section 26, there is a provision for the board to hold a review or hearing 21 days after the parolee has been locked up again.

I welcome this opportunity to present my research evidence to the committee on the National Spatial Strategy 2002-2020 and its successor, the national planning framework, on the subject of what it takes to sustain a viable rural community.<\/p> <p>  I am not quite sure as to the extent to which I can specifically assist this committee.  My areas of experience are primarily urban in nature but nevertheless I accept the kind invitation in good faith and because of the complementarity between urban and rural.  My academic research colleague, Dr. Conor Skehan, is unable to be with me today as he is chairing a housing seminar in Cork.  In sending his apologies, he has very kindly provided me with material which I am at liberty to use and it will assist and broaden this presentation.  His input comprises sections 4 to 7, inclusive, of this submission and I therefore beg the committee's forbearance for the fact that will take somewhat longer to deliver than had originally been intended. <\/p> <p>  I am also grateful to my collaborating research colleagues in the Dublin Institute of Technology and in other research centres and indeed, also to the assistance afforded by the Central Statistics Office in the use and application of its census data.  I will also refer to five appendices attached to this 15-page opening statement document, which run from pages 16 through to 78.  Some of the historical appendix material, unavoidably, repeats the submission content.<\/p> <p>  What is urban agglomeration?  Urban agglomeration was first identified in 1920 by Alfred Marshall as geographic human concentration, supporting specialisation and labour market pooling, and, most importantly, geographic proximity, facilitating the spread of information.  Thus urban agglomeration increases productivity and reduces public per capita spending requirements because of scale economics.  It also increases the occurrence and viability of services, human capital formation and today&rsquo;s knowledge-based economic activity.<\/p> <p>  The output from urban agglomeration is the formation and growth of cities, epitomised by the density of people and density of firms.  Cities are increasingly dominant in the world&rsquo;s economies and are now responsible for most of their national wealth creation. <\/p> <p>  Furthermore, large towns, particularly if they physically merge with another large one, can also agglomerate into cities.  A current Irish example of this process at work is the formation of the State&rsquo;s sixth city.  This is Drogheda&rsquo;s agglomeration with Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington, including Donacarney village, and their densifying areas that link these former individual settlements to creating a greater Drogheda population now approaching 90,000 with a settlement grid agglomeration that now matches the population of and exceeds the density of Waterford city.

Thus the home market effect is boosted both by population growth and <i>per capita<\/i>incomes.  In addition, increasing property values provide a feel-good factor that encourages spending and further rounds of both residential and commercial investment.  The resultant four years of Ireland&rsquo;s sustained economic growth and its employment recovery is not evenly spread, nor is intended to be.  The United Nations, the OECD and the World Bank are advocates of what is called &quot;lumpiness&quot; or centripetal agglomeration.  This results in city formation and, critically, it is the expanding cities, in turn, that support their regional and rural spheres of influence, as emphatically confirmed in the evidence-base demographics of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, census results.<br\/><br\/>Accordingly, the idealistic but impracticable principles of balanced regional development, which was the intended as the core driver of the national spatial strategy for 2002 to 2020, have resulted in unintended demographic consequences, aggravated by the faulty selection of some gateway and hub centres.  In any even, 23 was far too many for a State that has the population equivalent of greater Manchester.  I use this opportunity also to convey my sympathies to the people of that great city.  The irony of the failed national spatial strategy was demonstrated with the same number of matching, alternative centres achieving greater population growth in the 2002 to 2016 period than those centres selected.<br\/><br\/>The second section concerns the national planning framework and the current demographic background.  The replacement for the national spatial strategy, Ireland 2040, the national planning framework, proposes to be different.  It is intended to have full statutory backing as recommended in the Mahon tribunal and it must achieve prior all-party political agreement.  It is intended to be fully aligned with the State&rsquo;s economic strategy and it is hoped it will be properly resourced to rectify the near-cessation of infrastructural investment over the past decade.  It will be managed by way of the three newly established regional assemblies for the east and midlands, the southern regional area and the Border and western regional area.<br\/><br\/>Given the depth and length of Ireland&rsquo;s economic collapse with its loss of economic sovereignty and the international bailout, the demographic outcome of the 2016 census was surprisingly benign, especially so against the alarmist political background utterances of 80,000 plus emigrants per annum.  The reality, however, in the definitive census results published last month confirms that these outward flows were 87% counterbalanced by inward migration flows.  This resulted in the modest net emigration figure of 4,300 per annum for the five years to April 2016.  During this period Ireland's population continued to increase by almost 35,000 per annum.  These two-way demographic flow volumes are reflective of the offshore location and economic characteristics of this small but dynamic trading nation, one that is endowed with a temperate climate but is still disadvantaged with a &quot;tundra&quot; population density outside of the greater Dublin area and Louth.  Likewise, our exports plus imports, expressed in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s gross domestic product, emphatically confirm the reliance on the high globalisation index rating that this country enjoys and the nature of Ireland&rsquo;s open trading economy.<br\/><br\/>The State's population increased by 173,600, with the natural growth of births less deaths figure at 196,100 offset by net outward migration of 22,500, resulting in a creditable State population growth of 3.78% in the five years to April 2016.  The net emigration loss represented just 13% of the net gain in population, as I mentioned, occurring at a time of Ireland&rsquo;s deepest economic and financial crisis and the subsequent, necessary corrective measures.  It is now 30 years since Ireland&rsquo;s population last contracted, when net outward migration was greater than natural growth.  Given the profound nature and depth of our recent economic and financial difficulties and the subsequent and sustained recovery, it is unrealistic to expect that Ireland will return to a population loss scenario any time soon.  The opposite is likely to be the case with the resumption to net inward migration for the past two years and the reality of continuing world population growth, with its supply-push effect that will require careful managing.  Indeed, Ireland will have every cause to celebrate this coming July because in or about that third quarter of 2017, this State will mark its two million growth in population, up by some 71% since the low point of April 1961.  Furthermore, for the first time, Ireland&rsquo;s cities are growing at a faster rate than their surrounding home counties.  We have much to be grateful for as to the extent to which our cities are able to buffer what otherwise would have been much more serious emigration outflows, especially from rural Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Nevertheless, the forthcoming national planning framework must contain combined aligned spatial and economic strategies to address the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s provincial cities have an average population of just 109,000, which is only 9.3% of Dublin&rsquo;s city and suburbs.  That comparison excludes Dublin&rsquo;s burgeoning towns, together with its modest rural population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#B02000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495631400,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I did not catch that.

If Ireland's provincial cities are to become the drivers of their regions and their wider rural areas, as is now encouragingly evident for Cork and Galway, considered spatial strategies will be required to promote their accelerated growth so that their average size difference with that of Dublin can be reduced.  This is imperative because the default alternative is for a Dublin city state to emerge later in this century.  Ireland therefore, needs to have that set of missing teeth restored, in contrast with the city-size hierarchies of comparable countries such as Finland, Denmark, Scotland and New Zealand.<\/p> <p>  The researched, strategic, demographic objective is at least to double the size of the provincial cities as quickly as possible but well within the 2040 timescale of this plan.  That was the end objective of the Dublin Institute of Technology&rsquo;s Twice the Size study of 2009 which had proposed a somewhat shorter timescale but without having had the foreknowledge of our subsequent, dreadful economic collapse.<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to the town settlements and their demographic performance.  There is a direct correlation between a city&rsquo;s size and its sphere of influence, in terms of the growth outcomes of surrounding towns and their countryside, as shown in the statistics I have included in the submission supplied to the committee.  It confirms some of the most significant town population losses since April 2011.  Some of these dreadful population losses are topped by Birr with a 24.9% loss in the five years to April 2016.  Other areas with losses in the 20% range include Clifden and Bantry.  Within the same five year period Cootehill had a population loss of 12.7%, Ballina lost 8.3% of its population, Bundoran and Ballyshannon lost nearly 8% each, Templemore lost 6.4% and so on.<\/p> <p>  Not all towns or villages thrive, in the same way as there are laggard areas within cities.  Nearness to a city, however, is a critical factor in influencing town growth rates.  Generally, the nearby fastest&ndash;growing towns are those within the sphere of influence of a nearby city, as exemplified by the performance of Cork or Galway towns.  Distance decay is an important land use transportation reality as the spatial counterpart to urban agglomeration.  Within County Offaly, for example, its second town Birr was replaced by Edenderry in the census of 2002.  Edenderry is twice as near to Dublin as Birr and is now 68.4% larger.  In the five years to April 2016 Edenderry grew by 5.5% whereas Birr lost 24.9% of its population.<\/p> <p>  Further research work is required to provide individual explanations for some of the above horrendous population losses occurring within such a short time period.  Many other towns not listed in this statistical table have either stopped growing over a number of censuses or have exhibit weak growth characteristics.  Thurles, for example, is home to the founding of the GAA and location of the largest capacity stadium outside of Croke Park.  In the 1981 census Thurles was placed within the top 20 of Ireland&rsquo;s town size but in 2016 it was the placed at 56.  I have a \"what if\" question in this regard.  If the Buchanan plan been politically accepted and implemented in 1969, and if its 1986 target of 175,000 for Limerick, including Shannon, had been attained, what would have been the spillover benefit for Limerick&rsquo;s regional sphere-of-influence towns, including Thurles?  This would be on the basis that the self-generating benefits of urban agglomeration would have continued to 2016 with that city&rsquo;s population now standing at 235,000, instead of 94,000, in direct proportion to the State population increase that has taken place during 1986 to 2016.  The irony is that the State's population for 1986 was 1.16% above Buchanan&rsquo;s projected 3.5 million.<\/p> <p>  It is clear that the former central-place functions of many Irish towns as market places and as service providers for the agricultural surrounds has radically altered, reflecting both fundamental changes in agriculture, the nature and change of what constitutes work and modes of living.  Today, the Fordist style manufacturing single-branch plant era has almost finished and Nenagh is in the process of winding down its largest remaining plant.  This is, however, a worldwide phenomenon epitomised by the most famous firm town, the city of Detroit.  Yes; cities also fail.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Conor Skehan has kindly allowed me to present some of his own research work which helps clarify some of these changes and their effects on agriculture and on rural life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1495631400,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I might draw a halt to the presentation element.

It was fascinating.  It is startling that 70% of the total State tax revenue comes from the greater Dublin area.  Something like 74% of growth that happened between the two censuses happened in the Leinster area, which is incredible.  The fact the population of a number of different counties, even some counties combined, could fit into Croke Park shows that we have had a lopsided, spatially rudderless type of growth over recent years which, as Dr. Hughes says, creates the potential for a city state.  Unfortunately, the rest of the country may end up as a national park to that city state.  I agree with the argument Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made that there are two conflicting objectives.  First, there is such demand in the urban space of Dublin that it will be difficult to feed if from capital investment.  The other objective is we need to disrupt that demand to a certain extent by creating other locations in other parts of the country that develop the necessary critical mass to create an even balance.  Dr. Hughes said it is necessary for those regional cities to double in size.  How do we do that?  Do we create a formula that outlines two types of spend in our capital investment, one for Dublin demand and the other for demand disruption?  How do we orientate Government investment to disrupt it?

Cork is now very nearly at the point at which it can really take off because it surprisingly increased its city population from 119,000 to 125,000 people and its overall agglomeration increased by about 10,000 people to 208,000 or 209,000 people.

Mr. John Moran, whom the witness mentioned earlier, would nearly be of the extreme view, to a certain extent, that all of the energy should go into one of those regional cities.  Even if we were to take Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway and try to grow them as a group of four, we are still probably not going to get to that critical mass that Aarhus in Denmark achieved by managing to build its city up in balance to Copenhagen.

Obviously, we should be investing to give the best returns in the longer term.  To my mind, it is not a question of Dublin versus the rest of the country or Dublin plus the other cities versus the towns and rural areas.  It is about complementarity.

Table 2 in my handout and PowerPoint presentation shows the 2011 and 2016 populations of the three regional authority areas.

If we look at the entire island, half of the population is located in the Dublin-Belfast corridor and the surrounding areas.  That is just the reality.  The shift is taking place further east.  The current centre of gravity of the national population on a single point is now focused on the town of Maynooth and is moving further eastward.  That historically has been the case since the foundation of the State, particularly because of the centralised nature of our Government and the fact that so much activity is going on within Dublin.  There are gains to be had in the Dublin-Belfast corridor, and obviously also the other corridors of Derry-Letterkenny and so on and forth.  The Dublin-Belfast one is hugely important.  It is about the accessibility of it.  Dublin Airport, with its 29 million people a year, is not just available to Dublin but is only 20 minutes down the road from Drogheda, for example.  Likewise, Dublin Port, doing 30 million tonnes a year, is similarly located.

The phrase of \"distance decay\" that he used earlier on was an interesting one.  I live in County Galway and see that physically before me everyday in terms of the economic footprint of Galway city and how the economic power of the city peters out as one goes out to the outer fringes of both east Galway and west Galway.  There are what the witness described as the necklace towns of Oranmore, Athenry, Tuam, Gort and Loughrea, and they are all within easily commutable distances of the city.<\/p><p>In fact, the census results a few weeks ago proved that 50% of the working population originates from outside the city.  However, in the far reaches of east Galway, in places such as Lawrencetown, Eyrecourt and Kiltormer, there is little or no economic impact from the city.  Is it the experience that when the size of a city such as Galway is doubled, the consequent economic footprint widens in terms of a greater economic benefit accruing to towns that were formerly beyond the existing economic footprint?  Does the distance decay element decrease as the city increases in size?<\/p><p> John Moran has spoken and written extensively on my second question.  If we are to prioritise investment in the future on trying to create an economic counterpoint to Dublin city and its unstoppable growth, which is quite apparent now, a huge opportunity exists in developing Galway and Limerick cities as a single urban conurbation.  There are many reasons that it would work.  First, there are Galway port and Foynes, both of which offer huge opportunities for development in the future.  There is also Shannon Airport, whose existing infrastructure is not capitalised upon to any great extent.  In Limerick city and Galway city there are incredibly successful third level institutions.  If we are deadly serious about developing these powerful counterpoints to Dublin and the Dublin-Belfast conurbation, as Dr. Hughes described it, we must focus on Galway-Limerick as a genuine opportunity to develop a single city in the future.  What are Dr. Hughes's thought on that?  What type of investment would be required to make that happen?<\/p><p> I understand Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's argument to a certain extent, but when one looks at what is happening globally, it is clear that cities are becoming the engines of economic growth and development, almost to the point that cities are competing with other cities across the globe rather than countries competing with other countries.  It is becoming a city-centric economic growth model for the future.  Is Galway-Limerick realistic and is it a solution?  John Moran at one time suggested continuing that conurbation down to Cork and ultimately to Waterford.  Will one dilute the possible effect by trying to spread it across a greater part of the country?  Is Galway-Limerick enough to make it happen?<\/p><p> Second, all our cities in the past 100 or 150 years have developed economically primarily because they had the infrastructure in place for that to happen.  What opportunity, if any, exists to move beyond the cities to the smaller towns and villages and to generate economic growth with digital infrastructure?  Is there something happening in the digital area whereby, if we get our broadband infrastructure right nationally and we get the magical minimum of 30 Mbps into every house by the end of 2021 or 2022 and 100 Mbps in other locations, there is an opportunity to move beyond that city-centric economic development model to use digital technology, particularly in the creative space?  Is there anything we are not tapping into or ignoring in our rush towards growing our cities?  In the past the infrastructure required for economic development was solely located in our cities.  With the use of technology, that economic growth model could be migrated to smaller towns and villages.  Is that being examined and is it an opportunity for the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#F01400","speaker":"1241","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495631400,"counter":705,"content":"<p>The Deputy made some interesting points.

This goes to the heart of the Deputy's question.  The Deputy referred to distance decay.  That is undoubtedly a huge factor.  In other words, it might take some time to get the Galway and Limerick population up to a point where it creates this urban agglomeration synergy between the two, but it is a hugely important issue in the Irish context.  Galway and Limerick are, respectively, the fourth and third largest cities and cannot be ignored.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second point related to examples of local infrastructure.  Through my in-laws in Mitchelstown and Kilbehenny it has been fascinating to see the work that has gone into the Ballyhoura initiative and the way it has been able to part-fund the extension and improvement of the community centre in Kilbehenny.  What is happening there with the surrounding Knockmealdown, Galtee and Ballyhoura mountain ranges is that people can come and have showers, use the IT and so forth if they wish.  Clearly, linked in with that is the need for better access to the mountains as our tourism increases.  There are other very exciting examples such as local beer, local quality beef and quality deer.  There is the hugely increased Dairygold plant and the resulting milk intake.  All those developments are replacing the industry that disappeared and which greatly affected Mitchelstown 15 or 20 years ago.  It is great to see how it is on the way back and to see the vitality.  It is a fantastic place to visit and the golf club is super.

It has always fascinated me how Tampere's population has been able to grow at more than twice the per cent per annum compound of Cork's.  An awful lot more urban economic and new economic geography research is needed in this regard.

I have looked back over the past few censuses, comparing directly Naas with nearby Newbridge.  Naas is the county town, yet why has Newbridge been growing at twice the rate of Naas in recent years?  It is probably because of the necklace of towns surrounding Naas to some extent diluting the population centring in Naas.  The same phenomenon is very evident in the case of Sligo and its surrounding towns.  However, the way in which places such as Straffan, Kill and so on have developed suggest to me that to some extent some towns are being diluted.  The Irish people - at least, some of them - to a large extent still prefer to live in the countryside if they can then work in Dublin, Naas or wherever.

I was going to use Athy as an example to try to tease out the places Dr. Hughes is thinking about.  I thank him for his presentation, which I found hugely interesting, but I cannot let the Naas-Newbridge comparison go.  Newbridge has definitely passed out Naas as a retail town, and I think some of the reasons for this are down to planning decisions.  A very large Tesco complex on the edge of Naas town was given planning permission, which has effectively caused the town centre to die.  This coincided with a town centre development not going ahead because of the recession.  It was the perfect storm.  There are perfectly viable businesses in the heart of Naas town now closing, with business moving out to the shopping centre because of more footfall.  I think this is largely a planning decision.  <\/p> <p>  I would not say Naas is dying on its feet.  Retailers are very negative, but there are many positives in Naas, and Kerry Group was a huge one.  Naas basically fought off competition from Amsterdam and London to win that business, and Kildare County Council did very well in playing its part in helping to secure it.  When one talks to senior management in Kerry Group, one hears that one of their main reasons for locating in Naas and not Dublin, London or Amsterdam was the quality of life for their staff and the staff's ability to afford housing in the area and send their children to school in the area.  Senior management's view is that if their staff are happy and the company is able to attract and retain good staff, it is very positive for them, which I thought was an interesting insight.  <\/p> <p>  The whole middle of Kildare has benefited from 900 jobs coming into the Naas area, but this has also brought its challenges, specifically the increased housing demand that comes with an increase in employment opportunities.  I take Dr. Hughes's point that Sallins and similar towns on the edge of Naas have grown exponentially and that Newbridge does not have the same pull out of it.  Interestingly, Kildare County Council's long-term master plan is for the population of Naas to increase from 22,000 at present to 50,000 and for the population of Newbridge, at present 23,000, to increase to 25,000.  If this plan remains the same, we will see that change continue into the future.<\/p> <p>  I wish to use the example of Athy, further south in south Kildare and still an hour from Dublin.  There is a perception of Kildare as being affluent all over.  When people from outside Kildare meet a person they discover is from Kildare, they ask him or her whether he or she owns a racehorse.  They believe everyone in Kildare owns a racehorse, works for Intel or Pfizer or is a big farmer.  This perception poses huge challenges for us as a county.  Like everywhere else, we have our pockets of deprivation.  Those pockets of deprivation tend not to get looked after as well as other areas that are perhaps better recognised as being deprived.  Leixlip and Athy, in the very south of our county, are worlds apart, yet when it comes to making decisions as to how much Leader funding Kildare gets, the county is bundled up all together, which is a challenge.  This was very much evident when the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation a few years ago extended the regional aid map ever so slightly and Athy was one of the three towns included in the extension.  This was a recognition that there was difficulty attracting business there.  However, the town has recently undergone regeneration.<\/p> <p>  What I am interested to find out is what our aspiration as people who have responsibility for trying to manage Athy should be in the context of what Dr. Hughes says.  I do not disagree that key cities can be drivers of economic growth.  Athy is an hour south of Dublin, was a thriving market town for years and was home to enterprises such as Minch Malt and Batchelors peas for years.  The main industry in the town of Athy was predicated on the fact that it is surrounded by some of the best agricultural land in the country.  This has fallen away now.  We do not have that same level of employment in the area.  Should the aspiration of Athy be simply that people will work in Dublin or nearby or for Kerry Group and it is hoped they will live in Athy and commute back and forth?  Are we wrong to want our own industry and enterprise in the town?<\/p> <p>  As part of a regeneration project, we have undertaken a survey of the town.  Some of the demographics in Athy are very challenging for a variety of reasons.  We have worryingly high youth unemployment, and the extent of employment in the area is probably a little more negative than it would be in other towns.  In doing the survey, we found out something that surprised us: there are 900 people in a town of 9,500 basically sleeping in Athy but going up and down to Dublin or elsewhere to work.  We are trying to ascertain exactly what kinds of skills they have.  This could then allow us to sell the story to multinationals or other industry that we have this talent pool here that does not want to be travelling up and down the road or the railway and would prefer to work in the Athy area.  What should our aspiration be in this regard?  What does Dr. Hughes envisage for regional towns with population sizes of 10,000 or perhaps 5,000 that are not a million miles away from a big city?  Obviously, it comes down to quality of life; it is not just about population.  While it is interesting to see that Athy's population is decreasing, this does not really tell us much because if the whole population is travelling, its quality of life is not the same.  What I have personally seen happen in the town is that, of those 900, those who are likely to get involved in the local community are those who have children.  This is the same for Kildare town or any of the commuter towns.  Once one has children in a school, one gets to know other parents, one's kids go to play in the local GAA or soccer club, one gets to meet other people and one gets involved in the local community centre.  The double-income, no-kids couples who are working hard to pay off their mortgages probably do not have that same attraction.  If they are originally from Dublin, they tend to go back to Dublin to socialise at the weekends and do not ingratiate themselves with the community at all.  This is not what we want to build in our towns, specifically our regional towns.  I am considering the matter more in the societal context than just the economic context.  We want to make sure our towns are live, living communities because that is where the support will be.<\/p><p>As our population ages, we will need that level of support and that everyone would know their neighbours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#H00900","speaker":"1237","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495631400,"counter":719,"content":"<p>Two or three weeks ago, when the CSO produced its data on towns, I first looked at the general trends before drilling down into specific towns, including Athy.

Why has Athy lost 200 people over the past five years?  Why has it bucked the trend that has otherwise occurred in the east?  I began to ask around and discussed with several people why this was the case.  Athy is a very interesting urban laboratory to study.  Specifically, it has had a long industrial base that was partly associated with agriculture, milling and so on.  The tall buildings visible from miles around as one goes into Athy from any direction are evidence of that.  I understand that Athy has had a number of social problems, which the Deputy has alluded to.  Therefore, it is incumbent on any town to try to do its best to stamp out those problems as early as possible so that it - I am not saying this is the case with Athy - will not get a specific reputation.  I think the Deputy knows what I mean.  I can speak to him afterwards in greater detail about what happened and what I think is happening in Athy.

That is considered by people when making decisions on where to locate.<\/p> <p>  The other hugely important thing in all of this, particularly in terms of what Deputy Heydon was saying about youth unemployment and so on, is that we are experiencing a massive societal change in what is called the nature and change of work.  That societal change means that there is an imperative to try to regard one's life as a whole of life.

I have listed them in one of my appendices.  We have to get back to skills training, particularly apprentices and so on.  It is fantastic now to see the latest information in terms of the number of additional people employed.  We are back to within approximately 120,000 of our 2006 high point, with 2.04 million people at work.  The number of additional people working in each quarter is so encouraging.  The hope would be that all young people would be encouraged, depending on their abilities and interests, to try to gain that education or work experience, particularly in the building industry and nursing.  They talk about the number of additional nurses that we will need in Ireland.  Resources are hugely important in that context to be able to fund health further.

I certainly know from my experience that if I want to get away from it all and avoid meetings for a day to catch up with the paperwork and do the e-mails and the phone calls, the best place for me to be is sitting in my home in Corr na M&oacute;na, because then people only come to me on Saturday morning at the right time and I can get on with the job.  Has anyone done a model that asks what if the future is not the simple model the witnesses are putting forward here today?  What if the future is that we live on an island that is the size of the footprint of many American cities when their recreational areas are taken into account, for example, New York, New Jersey and upstate Connecticut or wherever they all go for the weekend.  Should we not model that rather than this 20th century view that seems to be predominant in public thinking at the moment that everyone has to come in at eight o'clock every morning and be in work at nine o'clock, clogging every street?  We are actually going to have many people working at home, coming in at ten o'clock or 10.30 two days a week and not having to travel up to the city.  In that way we could relieve a lot of the traffic and people would live in a much more salubrious manner.<\/p><p> My second question concerns those who come from the nice comfortable middle classes and move into the city.  More rural people get a good education per 100,000 than urban people, so these are our biggest resource in generating all this great growth and foreign interest and so on.  The big growth has been the high-performing rural areas which, per 100,000 population, get more into the top end than the whole of Dublin city.  By not growing the countryside, particularly the non-urban countryside, are we not in danger of killing the goose that laid the golden egg?  What if that supply dries up some time in the future? <\/p><p> Anyone who watches hurling or football teams will see this crazy phenomenon.  Anyone who went to see the Cork hurling team last Sunday, who had a fantastic achievement, should take the population of Cork city and its environs, what Dr. Hughes call the dominated area of Cork, as the total population of the hurling playing part of the county, so we can count out west Cork, and see how many of the people who came from urban areas and from the city made the team compared with how many from rural areas.  They will ask if there is something happening here that defies logic.  Has that factor been included?<\/p><p> How does Dr. Hughes deal with the fact contained in this model that as we grow cities, we grow the RAPID areas of this country, defined by Trutz Haase as areas high in deprivation?  I do not care what statistics show.  Try asking rural people if they would swap where they are living.  Does the committee know where Ballycroy is?  One night in Ballycroy I had approximately 300 people in a hall, which would be one for every two that live in the place, and I offered to put any one of them up in any RAPID area of my choice for a week at my expense.  I did not get one taker.  If it was really so attractive, why were they not queuing up at the end of the hall?  That is because they would have dreaded to go where I was going to send them.  My question is how do we create cities without creating these RAPID areas that account for so much of the rim of Dublin city around the M50?  These are economically non-generative, they are destroying huge resources and they are places where people have more drugs than jobs, unfortunately, and I am not blaming the fabulous people who live there.  How does Dr. Hughes deal with that?<\/p><p> The programme for Government states, \"We also recognise that as the economy recovers it is essential that the new Government, together with the Oireachtas, puts in place measures to revitalise all of Ireland so that the benefits are felt inside every doorstep and in every community.\"  Is that not at odds with the direction that Dr. Hughes and Mr. Moran are pushing things?  They are saying that is poppycock, that we cannot get to every doorstep, and that we have to concentrate the development in the growing areas for the benefit of an economy, whatever that is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#J00800","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495631400,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I love going down the fields with a half-cup of coffee in my hand to collect cattle to bring them back and to help do relief milking.

One of the last projects was the project Dr. Hughes mentioned, between Limerick and Galway.  Unfortunately, that happened at the same time as the motorway being built.

I have no doubt but that were one built to Navan, it would massively reduce the amount of people using the roads that are feeding into the M50.  To help the M50, a rail line would take about 15,000 cars off the M50.

As for part of the reason this is happening, Teagasc produced a report stating a young family now needs two incomes to pay for itself.  If one wants two incomes, one needs to be outside of a large urban area to be able to get those two incomes.  We need to do a number of things to disrupt that.  We need to make sure that investment is prioritised away from demand to a certain extent.  It is not disruption if it completely follows that demand.  We also need to make sure that the key elements - communication, transport and education infrastructure - are part of those disruptive investments.<\/p> <p>  The other element is that the Government needs to move first.  We cannot ask foreign direct investment to go to Waterford if the Government will not go to Waterford.  We need the Government to lead on that disruption in its own right.

I know it means looking at Sandymount Strand again and so on but that is just one example.  There are many other examples as well.  The Chairman talks specifically about overheating.  It is clearly important that, as all of our cities develop, the infrastructure needed for them to operate more smoothly is developed in turn.  Look at the improvement to Limerick when the tunnel was put in west of the city.  There are other such examples as well.  It is fantastic now to be able to get as quickly as possible to the Blarney viaduct in the southern part of Cork city.  One goes down under Dunkettle roundabout through the tunnel, and before one knows it, if going to Baltimore or wherever else, one is at the Blarney viaduct.<\/p> <p>  To help all of this, we have to think in terms of accessibility and putting as much as we can into an ordered priority of infrastructure to try to help this.  The Chairman is absolutely right about County Meath and the number of people who work elsewhere.  Clearly, critical mass is hugely important.  As the critical mass of Drogheda, for example, increases, more service-type employment is going to come into the town because it is so close to Dublin Airport, Dublin Port and so on, as well as the port in Drogheda itself.  Even small elements of infrastructure have to be considered.  For example, Mr. Peter Monahan and others have had difficulty in trying to get a cycleway from Mornington over to the Battle of the Boyne site, and it is only a small project.  There is clearly a need for this new spirit of openness and planning for the best Ireland.  We need to be all positive instead of resisting things.

There has been a lot of positive progress in terms of infrastructure, particularly transport infrastructure.  More concerning is the fact that the locations which were identified as strategic growth points, in other words as \"gateways\" and \"hubs\", in that strategy were outperformed in the intervening years by many other locations and that has caused us difficulties.  Nonetheless, the NSS was a very important starting point in the process in which we are now engaged.  It established a more strategic and co-ordinated approach to planning and infrastructure co-ordination.  The lessons learned from the NSS are a valuable resource for us in developing its successor strategy, which is why our Department commissioned an expert advisory report to independently appraise its implementation a couple of years ago.  That report is available on the Ireland 2040 website and the national planning framework website.<\/p> <p>  Public consultation on Ireland 2040 kicked off on 2 February.  It was launched by An Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, at Maynooth University.  As part of the process, we had an Ireland 2040 issues and choices paper that outlined key areas for consideration in planning for Ireland&rsquo;s future including a section devoted to the potential of rural areas.  We also engaged in a large number of consultation events throughout the country with the Minister and, independently, with local councillors.  Further to the consultation process, we received more than 3,000 submissions before the deadline at the end of March.  Many of those were specific to Ireland 2040.  Also informing the preparation of the framework is a statistical, demographic and econometric model report prepared by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which projects population and employment data for a number of different scenarios into the future.  That aligns with the latest 2016 census data.  In terms of legislative compliance, we also need to prepare a strategic environmental assessment, a strategic flood risk assessment and screening for habitats directive assessment as part of this process.  We have to do all of those things.<\/p><p> In Ireland, we have the good fortune of being able to plan for the progression of our country in terms of economic and demographic growth and social development and the environment.  Over the next 20 years, our country is likely to grow in population terms by at least 1 million.  There will be approximately two thirds of a million people at work and we will need at least 500,000 more homes to be provided.  We are very different from many of our European neighbours in this regard because of our still-young population and the agility of our economy in adjusting to various economic shocks and opportunities.  Ireland punches way above its weight, as do some of our cities and their wider regions, notably Dublin which, as our capital city, puts the country on the global map, particularly from a foreign direct investment perspective.<\/p><p> There are some key questions for the national planning framework, NPF.  Where should people live and work?  How can we best ensure a high quality of life and environment and the delivery of the kind of physical and social infrastructure that is needed to sustain progress for all our people?  The population of Ireland in April 2016 was just over 4.76 million people.  As regards the proportion of the national population residing in rural Ireland, the CSO regards rural areas as those outside settlements with inhabitants of 1,500 or more people and, in those terms, we have a population that is 63% urban and 37% rural.  Some 1.75 million people are thus defined as rural.  If the threshold is raised to include those towns with a population of 10,000 people, almost half of Ireland&rsquo;s population would be considered to live in rural areas.  That metric is more useful for the integrated planning we need to do and it enables us to look at urban and rural issues together to reflect the complementary nature of their roles and functions.<\/p><p> In overall terms, rural parts of Ireland outside census towns experienced quite high levels of national population growth between 1996 and 2016.  This level of growth was almost unique in Europe, where the trend has generally been that rural populations have declined, especially where located outside the catchments of large cities.  Map 1.1 in our presentation illustrates the contrast between the growing parts of our country, in red and brighter colours, and declining parts of our country, in grey and darker colours.  While a growing population and a fast-developing country in some parts are a plus from a strategic planning perspective, the way in which our larger cities and towns have been growing fastest at their edges, while in many cases city and town centres are in population decline, is presenting many infrastructural, investment, social and environmental challenges.  At the same time, the data highlight a contrast between a growing population in many, but not all countryside areas, while ever-higher vacancy rates of housing and other premises are being experienced in smaller towns and villages.  Many of our major cities and towns are growing fastest at their outward limits, placing overspilling residential development pressures on smaller rural towns and villages that, at times, are struggling to cope with the influx of such development.  Once one moves further out into remoter and more rural communities, it is the smaller towns and villages that appear to experience higher levels of vacancy and underutilisation of their built environment, leading to the familiar spiral of loss of services and depopulation.  The challenge we face is that the continuation of these trends into the future might well undo much of the progress of recent decades.  We need a new way forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495631400,"counter":753,"content":"<p>Population growth and the places where development has taken place in Ireland over the past decade or so paint a contrasting picture and pose key challenges that must be faced in preparing the national planning framework.

On the other hand, remoter rural areas and small to medium-sized towns and villages are presenting with a striking trend of depopulation and the spectre of empty dwellings and shops in what were once vibrant and viable towns and villages.<\/p> <p>  It would appear to the Department that some of the key factors driving the most rapid patterns of growth outward from city and town cores include: increasing costs and complexity in developing new housing in central urban areas which has to compete for land with higher-return commercial development and is drawn, instead, to cheaper land and development costs associated with edge or greenfield development; enhanced accessibility of large areas around the main cities and towns as a result of recent motorway and public transport investment, bringing with it a pressure on development; household choices that trade affordability and dwelling size for proximity to employment, a factor which often relates to the life stages of the households in question, with young people wanting to be in the centre and people with families looking for more space until, at a later stage of life, they want to return close to the services again; and the ready availability of zoned lands in edge locations coupled with broadly flexible rural settlement policies.<\/p> <p>  I will not go through all the statistics in the paper but I will highlight a few points.  We have a national vacant house reuse strategy which is in the final stages of development.  This is a major issue in terms of the broader challenges we face.  Looking at the levels of vacancy in rural housing stock in the census of 2016, it is very notable that the areas with the highest proportions of one-off housing provision are the areas with the highest proportion of vacancy and where population has stabilised or declined and is ageing.<\/p> <p>  The CSO data suggest that long-term vacancy is more of an issue in rural than in urban areas.  A sample of vacant properties in rural areas showed that almost 21.7% of empty properties were listed as long-term vacant, which is almost twice the rate of the sample taken in the Dublin area.  The evidence could be  seen, therefore, to suggest that while the supply and proportion of single houses in the countryside in many western parts of the country is high, these are the very areas continuing to trend towards long-term rural depopulation and decline, most notably in terms of their smaller towns and villages.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional and Rural Affairs, Deputy Humphreys, highlighted the need to revitalise smaller towns and villages for the benefit of the committee when discussing the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development and the pillars of the policy for sustaining rural communities.<\/p> <p>  Many NPF public consultation submissions expressed concerns about the construction of identikit suburban-style housing estates in many of our smaller towns and villages in the commuter belts, and a dearth of attractive housing location alternatives to households that wish to self-build.  The evidence could furthermore suggest that there needs to be a renewed focus on policies and mechanisms to appropriately manage the development of smaller towns and villages within the commuter belt that are under pressure from overspill development, as well as to turn around the fortunes of smaller towns and villages in remoter and economically flagging areas with a focus on jobs and local economic, social and residential development.<\/p> <p>  There are various tasks being undertaken in the preparation of the national planning framework.  The varying development issues and challenges facing the strategic development of Ireland&rsquo;s countryside highlight a contrast between the areas under pressure versus those that are being depopulated and have weak small towns and villages at their core.  We would welcome the committee's views on a couple of issues, particularly the future role of our smaller settlements and how those that are struggling to retain basic services and economic viability might be turned around in light of wider societal changes, particularly the ageing of our population, online transactions for retailing and basic services, and a preference for urban lifestyles, particularly on the part of younger people who are drawn to the bright lights.<\/p><p>We would welcome hearing the committee's views on how serviced sites for self builders might be provided at reasonable cost in rural communities.  The cost of a site or starting a home is a big factor for younger households in rural communities.  We would also welcome hearing the committee's views on how we provide that alternative for them in small towns and villages, the potential role of local authorities in the provision of that type of alternative and measures to prevent the displacement of urban and suburban housing estates that are really better suited to larger cities and towns to smaller rural settlements.  Many members, including the Chairman, know that this has been a very strong trend over the past decade.  We would welcome hearing the committee's views on the best mechanisms to ensure a healthy balance between ensuring dispersed rural communities can meet their housing needs and, at the same time, ensuring we build up smaller towns and villages to act as focal points in their areas.  <\/p><p> The Department is advancing the draft national planning framework, NPF, to be with Government by the end or middle of next month.  On approval of the draft, it is expected that it will be placed on public display over the summer months.  It is anticipated that the NPF will be approved by the Oireachtas in the autumn.  We are happy to address whatever questions or issues members wish to discuss with us.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495631400,"counter":755,"content":"<p>There is a strong sense that spatial planning in this State is defunct, that the 2002 spatial plan was jettisoned very shortly after it was created and that there is nearly a free-for-all with regard to development.  That development is creating great difficulties for places like Dublin because of overheating and difficulties involving services in Dublin.  It also creates great difficulties for areas like my constituency, which is in the commuter belt, where the road is chock-a-block.  It takes three hours commuting per day to get in and out of towns like Navan.  There is massive flight from many towns in rural Ireland.  We received a list from our previous guest listing towns like Birr, Athy and Clonmel, which have seen massive drops in different censuses of population.  We know that a big change is happening, that it is not being driven in any particular direction <i>per se<\/i>and that this is an opportunity to, hopefully, fix that.<\/p><p>One of the most interesting submissions we heard from during this part of our investigation was Teagasc.  Witnesses from Teagasc said that an interesting development was taking place.  Young people who are starting families needed two incomes to survive.  They need two incomes to buy a house today.  They went to areas where they could access urban-type jobs.  That meant that they left their more rural towns, which made a big difference in terms of changing the age profile of counties like Louth, Wicklow, Meath and Kildare and the counties on the western seaboard.  The population average was increasing radically in the west and declining here because of young couples with young children in those places.  It seems to me that to a certain extent, one of the greatest tools to re-balance that driving force within that demographic change is the location of jobs.  If people can access two jobs in towns like Clonmel and Birr, which are losing people, they are more likely to want to stay there in the future, which will redress some of those age profiles.  Jobs tend to migrate towards infrastructure.  Regardless of whether it is transportation, communication or educational infrastructure, that is where most enterprises want to locate.  <\/p><p>The NTA also appeared before us.  I asked witnesses from the NTA what determines its development of infrastructure.  They told me it was demand.  If demand determines the location of infrastructure, the process just flows in exactly the same direction it is currently flowing so there is no change because the demand is where the development is happening at the moment and the lack of demand is where places have been emptied out.  The key elements that the NPF needs to have concern how to disrupt that trend.  It needs to come up with a formula that apportions investment contrary to demand in the State.  Obviously, this is a very difficult thing to do because as legislators, we typically respond to demand.  We must meet that demand in Dublin and other large urban areas first and foremost to a certain extent but we must prioritise areas where demand is not as great but where we want to shift future demand.  What formulas can be used for policy makers to make that happen?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#S00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495631400,"counter":756,"content":"<p>In his response, the Chairman set out very clearly and effectively the range of the challenges we must address in framing the national planning framework.  A very useful critique of what worked and did not work with the spatial strategy is, as Mr. Hogan outlined, available on our website.  At the time the national spatial strategy was launched in 2002, many subsequent steps were taken to support it.  As they started to gain momentum - I am thinking of the national development plan 2007-2013, which was very much in the image of the national spatial strategy - far more significant economic challenges came along and to some extent, there was a lot of pressure on resources to exactly carry out the disruptive type or prudent, plan-led forward investment in infrastructure around which the Chairman's thesis pivots.  We have the good fortune of having recovered economically to the point where resources are again available to consider those sorts of new directions we can take in terms of regional planning and infrastructure investment policy.  Hopefully, in the coming months, we will see the opening of new road connections between Limerick and Galway and indeed the connecting to wider parts of the south Mayo-east Galway area.  This is a crucial step in building an economic critical mass in the west which is not so much a competitor to Dublin but a complement to it.

I think that some of the investments we have made, for example, that motorway link, are made as much for the economic development piece - the long term - rather than asking whether that is the busiest stretch of road in the country right now.  As the Chairman knows, there are infrastructure projects that would probably have a higher priority in terms of pressure of demand but it is a question of where that fits in an overall strategy.  Finding ways to better connect our regional cities, particularly those on the western seaboard, was very much a key part of the spatial strategy back in 2002 so that they could present the economic and jobs catchments that could be seen as a credible complement to the Dublin area.  IBEC and others have pointed out that where there is a labour force catchment of a million people that is broadly within an hour of getting to each other, productivity and innovation capacity increase markedly.  Distance and time are the enemies of that kind of economic critical mass, which is why the M17 project is a very important step in realising the potential of two regional cities on the western seaboard - Limerick and Galway.  Although these cities are very dynamic in their own way, they now have a new impetus behind them.

One is on growth being employment led, or jobs led or infrastructure led.  On infrastructure led development alone, the ESRI, with which we are working, did a study recently on firm location in the country and what drives it, whether it can be influenced by infrastructure.  It found that human capital is more influential than infrastructure.  Increasingly because of the nature of work and jobs they want very highly qualified people, people with the leaving certificate at least, if not a third level qualification.  That militates against some of the declining communities where people may not have had the opportunity to avail of education so lifelong learning and retraining is critical to people participating in that sort of economy, as well as adding to the prospects of regions.<\/p> <p>  Another issue we have gleaned from our consultation, and we have learned as we went along, is that people choose where they want to live first, rather than where they want to work.

For instance, one thing I looked at today was a submission from the Shannon Development Company.  It argued that in the context of integrated regional development Shannon as an airport made a difference to the mid-west region.  This was particularly the case historically, it is less so now.  It was making a case for that sort of development.  By focusing infrastructure it is possible.

We have to be mindful of the fact that this is a national planning framework.  It will be partnered by regional subsidiary documents from the three regional assemblies - the eastern and midlands regional assembly area, the northern and western regional assembly area and the southern assembly area which broadly equate to a lot of Leinster, most of Munster and south Leinster, and Connacht and parts of Ulster.  They will be required under legislation to prepare replacements for the regional planning guidelines.

I represent the Cavan-Monaghan constituency and we have a huge problem in west Cavan, which I see highlighted on the map.  We have housing vacancy rates at greater than 23%.  It is a whole part of the county.  As Mr. Hogan said here, unless there is a spread of job opportunities, one cannot keep the young people there.  It was interesting to hear him say that people choose where to live before they choose where to work, with which I would agree, but if there is nowhere to work it forces them in one direction.  Particular attention and focus has to be given to the Border counties in light of Brexit as we are already on the back foot by virtue of being Border counties.  Our local enterprise offices and our local authorities can already see where there has been stagnation.  We are naturally a very industrious people in Cavan-Monaghan, we have had to do it on our own; there are very high rates of self-employed people because there have had to be.  There are no big factories or big IDA Ireland companies coming into the constituency and the area does not have the infrastructure, which was discussed earlier.  Cavan-Monaghan has none of that and is way behind on human capital, infrastructure and job opportunities.  I would hope that the east-west link which has been talked about for the last ten or 15 years, probably since the national spatial strategy first came out, would be a big part of that.  That one piece of infrastructure has the potential to address a lot of these issues in one sweep if the attention and funding was provided.  We have already seen how the N3 has opened up Meath.  Of course, it is on the periphery, it is the usual story.  It stopped when it got to the border of Cavan but it has made a huge difference to people in Meath in terms of where they work and the access to Dublin.<\/p> <p>  One thing we need to be careful about is the situation we have returned to where housing has gone beyond the reach of most people, there have to be two people employed in every household to be able to get a mortgage.  There was a time, particularly in east Cavan which is quite densely populated, where there were people who had sold their homes in Dublin in search of a better lifestyle and continued to work in Dublin but they felt that they did not fit in.  Maybe that was partly our fault, maybe it was partly their fault too, that it was too great a leap, but people were caught.  They might have been too far from their own family which remained in Dublin, they could not return to where they had come from and some just upped and left.  There were vacant houses where there had been high density population, with people scrambling to get back to Dublin.  That scenario happened too.  <\/p> <p>  There is a reference to self-build in the witnesses' submission.  I am always talking about this.  We are still at the point where it is too expensive for people in rural Ireland to build houses in their local areas.  People have to spend &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 on connections to sewerage and water and on development charges and it pushes people into the urban areas.  Until that is addressed, places like west Cavan will not be developed because it is too costly, they do not have the opportunity, and the infrastructure is not there.  We are back to basics such as roads and broadband and the east-west link must be part of the national strategy plan.  <\/p> <p>  I do not have questions, more observations on what the witnesses presented here today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#T00600","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495631400,"counter":767,"content":"<p>Maybe Mr. Hogan might deal with some of the specific vulnerabilities which we would see for parts of the Border area, bearing in mind some of the issues which the Deputy raised, including Brexit.  I am very familiar with west Cavan.  The Border zone is an area I know well.<\/p><p>The Deputy is correct in saying it has always had an extremely vibrant enterprise culture working with local resources.  In looking at the analysis it is striking that, considering all of the challenges we face such as rolling out broadband, holding on to public services in rural communities and all the issues the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, addressed in the Government's Action Plan on Rural Development, we would redouble our efforts in what we are doing in practical terms to make smaller settlements in rural areas a viable proposition for exactly the type of households the Deputy mentioned.  For example, many local authorities will have their statutory local area plans and their planning functions but one question we have to ask is whether local authorities are appropriately equipped, from a resources and maybe a legal powers perspective - my colleague, Mr. Terry Sheridan, may come in on this on the vacant properties and derelict sites area - to implement those plans in practical terms to subsidise or make available land which young couples or local people can see as a viable alternative to provide a dream home for themselves to their own design and specification.  Such a home would be across the road from the school, nearby the post office and all the local services in order that these places have a fighting chance to become nuclei in their own local communities and therefore create the conditions within which, as the Chairman mentioned, it then would be a sensible proposition in which to invest from the point of improving those services.  One creates a virtuous cycle of people coming in and engendering a demand for services that can be addressed.  Too often, if we are really honest about it, when we move beyond the suburban zones along the aforementioned motorway corridors to really get out into rural Ireland, we often see the twin cycles of villages, such as Dowra and so on, that are not reaching their potential but where there is a significant amount of building in a wider rural community.  One asks oneself the question: if we could find a way to give the smaller settlements a fighting change to create a credible alternative, would it be different in terms of rolling out broadband, holding on to schools and services and justifying things because we now have a population to service?  On the Brexit or Border issue, is there anything Mr. Hogan wants to add?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#T00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495631400,"counter":769,"content":"<p>Part of our analysis indicated clearly that, certainly, north of a line from Galway to Dundalk, obvious large towns or cities are few and far between and we need a different type of strategy, particularly for the north west and Border part of the country.  There is much uncertainty to do with Brexit.  That has been a constant theme of recent months.  It has been clearly made aware to us as well that the part of the country to which I refer has generated much employment as a result of people using their own initiative and starting businesses in their own sheds, premises or whatever and leading to bigger things.  It is a question of whether there is some way we can facilitate that type of activity.<\/p> <p>  It is clear that south Cavan, in particular, is coming in to the overdeveloped part of the country in terms of the settlements and the influence of Dublin.  An idea we have looked at, which is mention in the paper, is that we would limit the capacity for settlements to grow endlessly, particularly in places where we have seen growth of hundreds of per cent.  In parts of County Meath, for example, planning policies should prevent towns from growing three or fourfold over the course of a few years.

The witnesses state in their document that the granting of planning permission in rural areas is one of their roles or they are responsible for whether or not we can have it.  At the outset, I have to say we in Kerry have a great local authority, a great planning section with good dedicated staff and a great group of county councillors.  However, when we put together our county development plan, we are directed by the planning guidelines as to what we can and cannot have.  Sadly, when those guidelines are implemented, they come down heavily on some people and deprive them of getting planning permission.  That is why I raised it yesterday and today and I will continue to raise it.<\/p> <p>  In my local authority, there are three types of area.  In areas of intense urban pressure, no one will get planning permission unless he or she is a family member of a resident.  It is to stop people from coming out from town and building in such areas.  This clause, in itself, is restricting the local person who was brought up in the place in his or her parent's house, who wishes to buy a site in the same townland but who is being deprived because of this clause on intense urban pressure.  Such a person is being denied the opportunity to buy a site from his or her neighbour 300 yd. away.  This is being replicated right around the town of Killarney and other towns where there is any mention of intense urban pressure.  Not every family has more land in its holding and the obvious solution for those brought up in an area is to try to buy a site as near as possible.  They are being denied that.<\/p> <p>  Then there are other so-called \"stronger\" areas.  For example, there were 16 families living in one such area but because those 16 families left before the census of 2002 or 2006, they are not being regarded as suitable for letting people come in there.  It is absolutely wrong.<\/p> <p>  The only place one will get permission is in an area that is known as a \"weaker\" area.  In other words, for the stronger area, one must be from the area and have a need to live there.  There is no attachment.  They must have some attachment and they are not able to have an attachment because the people left it before that census.  Those issues need to be addressed.  These people are not asking for funding.  They are asking for planning permission to put a roof over their heads.  That needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I make no apology to anyone anywhere for someone wanting to build a one-off house to accommodate himself or herself.  That is what we should be all about.  Whether it came from Europe, from national policy or howsoever it came to be, there seems to be a grudge against allowing people to build a house for themselves in rural areas.  It is totally unsatisfactory.  That needs to be addressed in the Department's spatial strategy or whatever.<\/p> <p>  Dublin is not able to cater for what is going on at present.  Jobs are coming in here day after day.  When one turns on the radio in the morning, one hears another 100 or 150 jobs being created.  We cannot get jobs in Kerry because of the non-existent Macroom bypass and the non-existence of broadband in most of the county.<\/p><p>There is talk about a hub but a hub is not much good if we do not have a wheel and this is what has happened.  People have left because there was no employment.  I disagree with Mr. Hogan's statement that people choose where to live before they decide where they will work.  If people do not have work they will follow the work and they will have to leave.  This is what has been happening.  Sneem and Caherdaniel had three teams between the two of them and now the most that can be mustered is one team between the two.<\/p><p> Zoning was mentioned.  There is an idea that the less zoned land there is, the better.  If only one developer in each town or village will be allowed to zone a piece of land with no competition on the other side of town, clearly the price of houses will be driven up and the poor young fellow and the young girl trying to start off will pay.  I have held the view for a long time that zoning does not matter.  The market will dictate how many houses are built and zoning does not matter.  An awful lot of time is given by local authorities to developing plans and zoning.  The planners should decide whether there is genuine need, particularly if we were speaking about towns.<\/p><p> We have an awful lot of vacant houses in rural Ireland but the question we must ask is how suitable are they for occupation.  Some of the houses are grand but most of them are not inhabitable.  When people have to leave them they are out of date and falling down but the shell is standing.  Perhaps the walls and roof are there.  That cannot be counted as a house because all that is really there are four walls and we all know they are the cheapest part of any house to build.  The walls and a roof can be put up in a couple of weeks and it does not cost that much.  We need to be more accurate when we state the number of vacant houses.<\/p><p> We wonder why villages are disintegrating.  Villages and towns will disintegrate if the community around them disappears and this is what has happened.  Many people had to leave the glens and valleys around the small villages because of the lack of employment.  In the bigger towns, even in fairly vibrant towns, multinational shopping arcades or companies have been established.  What happens then?  The centre of the town disintegrates because there is a whole town in a new place.  All of the shops are in one place.  I was only in the council a short time when I raised this issue in 2004.  They are having a devastating effect.  The harm has been done in many cases.<\/p><p> What do we do with the villages we have?  Perhaps some of the houses would be suitable for elderly people.  They should be reconstructed to suit elderly people who need the comfort of having people beside them.  They are not suitable for children in most instances because there is always a road going through a village and it is not safe for children.<\/p><p> Dublin is not able to cater for what is going on there, socially and in other ways.  Someone is shot or killed there every day and there are drugs.  It cannot be monitored.  It has gone out of control.  We need assistance in rural areas.  There are three rural Deputies here and Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell is representing Dublin.  We have to fight our corner.<\/p><p> I have highlighted what is wrong with planning.  The planning guidelines need to be addressed as do the problems they are creating for the planners.  We were not able to cater for Kerry Group.  It hurts me every time I pass that mighty operation when I go up to and down from Dublin.  We should have had it in Farranfore.  It was a designated hub but, sadly, because of infrastructure and accessibility issues we lost it.  Up to 900 people are working there and I am told the smallest wage is &euro;65,000.<\/p><p> There needs to be an emphasis on rural Ireland.  In Kerry, 500 applications were made to local improvement schemes.  The Department suggested they were private roads.  They are not private roads.  They are public roads that were never taken in charge by the local authority for one reason or another.  There are ten, 11, 12 or 14 houses on some of these roads and there is no gate across them.  The Department got its way.  It did not get it in 2010 when my father was here, but in 2011 the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, suspended the scheme.  This is hurting an awful lot of people.  If some of the people in some estates in Dublin were told they could not have a road to their houses there would be uproar.  The people on these roads have their own water.  They have sunk their own wells.  They have paid for their own septic tanks.  They do not cost anyone a penny.  They are entitled to a road to their door, the same as the people in Dublin 4.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#U00400","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495631400,"counter":773,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Healy-Rae for giving me the constituency of Dublin.

I was travelling down the country yesterday, it does not matter where, but the ugliness of the estates struck me, even in the paint, shape and size, and where we ask people to live.

It is absolutely appalling, with no thought at all put into where people are being asked to live.  We talk about wanting to give vibrancy back to towns and villages.

People have been employed in England to go around and find out where that person is from or where the family is from, to see whether they can do something about it, and this is their actual job.  The rural redevelopment scheme was a great scheme and we might have to look at it again.  I also think we have to bring more creativity and more imagination.

They have given us an insight into the planning process.  Having been a councillor in south-west Cork prior to being elected to the D&aacute;il, as well as being a community activist, has given me experience in dealing with planning issues.  Many young people in the scenic areas of west Cork were unable to get planning permission for a house on their parents' land because of the beauty of where they live.  That should not prevent anybody from getting planning permission.<\/p> <p>  In the course of writing an article for a newspaper, I was looking at the census of population breakdown in the district electoral divisions, DEDs, for my own community.  It paints a picture of the challenge we face.  The reason for that challenge is that successive Governments have decided that rural Ireland is not a place to do business.  Our roads are in a scandalous condition and young people cannot get planning permission.  Quite a number of people have come to a place as beautiful as west Cork and want to set up a business but are faced with a seven-year residential rule, which has been challenged.  Our European advisers have been told that such a residency condition is no longer legally correct.  Of the six DEDs in my community, there has been a population drop of 2.2% in Crookhaven, a decrease in population of 13.1% in Dunbeacon, no change in Dunmanus, a decrease of 10.5% in Goleen and a decrease of 7.7% in Lowertown, where I live.  There was an increase of 1.6% in Toormore, giving a population decrease of 5.4% in our community.  That is the second consecutive census in which we have had a population decrease.  We are finding it very difficult.  We have lost two of the three banks in the peninsula, and the nearest bank is 20 miles away.  We have lost our Garda stations and our post offices are on the verge of closure if the Government has its way.  There is a complete lack of thinking on how we could turn this situation around.  Some of my neighbours travel to Cork, a 120 km journey on shocking roads but more people are travelling from Cork to work in Dublin, a journey of 251 km on a beautiful road.  I enjoy the benefit of that road.  There has been no focus on improving our roads.  People could commute from west Cork to Cork city, as employment has picked up in the city, but unfortunately not in rural areas.  <\/p> <p>  A businessman who has lived in Ballydehob for the past four years came to my constituency office.  He will be refused planning permission because he is not a local.  That is a ridiculous rule.  That rule has been challenged in Europe and it looks as if it will have to go and I would like the witnesses to comment on that.  A young man in Kinsale wants to design a house that is the exact same as all his neighbours, but he has been refused as the regulations and guidelines have changed.  His plans will have to be changed so that his house will be different from all the other houses that surround it.

There is a need for a rule to deal with them because many wealthy people have derelict sites that they are sitting on.

Colleagues will come in to add to my response.  There are many very sensible ideas, proposals and comment there and I tend to agree with a lot of it.<\/p> <p>  By way of opening remarks, the purpose of the planning system is to ensure the right development happens in the right place at the right time.  There is a structure and some sort of shape to how things happen over time.  All the members of the committee I am sure would agree with me that in rural areas, in particular nobody is proposing a free-for-all.  If we are starting with this basic principle or building block, we then have to have some sort of policies within which to avoid a free-for-all and structure our approach.  What planning policy in Ireland has typically tended to do, particularly with regard to housing development in rural areas, is to distinguish between areas that are under intense pressure for development, as Deputy Healy-Rae mentioned, particularly the areas that are closest to our cities and our largest towns.  To some extent if we do not have some sort of policy framework effectively these areas would be absorbed into the urban area very quickly.  As the Chairman is aware, there are parts of south County Meath, for example, where we have had to retrofit sewerage schemes because effectively they became overdeveloped during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  <\/p> <p>  In other administrations, particularly across the water, they have policies based on green belts.  They distinguish between areas that are rural and areas that are urban.  The only forms of development that take place in green belt areas are agri-industry, that is, people who are engaged in full-time large-scale farming or other occupational or functional links back to the rural areas.  Bearing in mind Ireland's unique social history and the form of development in rural areas, we have settled our policies around distinguishing between housing that arises out of the linkages to a rural community and many members have mentioned this and those people coming from an area altogether different and want to build what are effectively urban-generated housing.  My colleague, Mr. Terry Sheridan, will comment on where we are on some of the issues that have arisen with regard to this policy, the seven-year rule and similar conditions.  We will come back to this.<\/p> <p>  On Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's points on the visual integrity and the quality of much of our development in recent years, we were building 90,000 homes a year for several years during the boom year.  While homes were built that people needed and in the places that needed more housing, the quality of some of the development left a great deal to be desired, particularly the spectre of unfinished housing developments.  We have resolved 85% of these unfinished developments through slog during the past five or six years.  Senator O'Donnell asked for examples of bad planning.  If the Senator picks up any copy of the annual reports we produce on resolving unfinished housing developments throughout the country, particularly in the upper Shannon area, which benefitted from the tax relief scheme there, she will see plenty of examples of small very pretty riverside or canal side villages, which in some cases were very adversely affected by the apartment block or housing estate that was plonked in from nowhere and bears little or no relationship to the character of the area.<\/p><p>We are grappling with a housing crisis so we must be mindful of those lessons and not forget them.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#W00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495631400,"counter":783,"content":"<p>That was my point.

We always encourage citizens and communities to become engaged in both the policy-making and development management aspects of the planning process, and to exercise their rights to express their views about development and the quality of development.

When I was a young man studying planning Dublin city centre,  particularly some of its dockland area, were areas of serious deprivation.  There was a serious social housing concentration, serious dereliction, serious environmental and contamination issues.  Today, the area is a vibrant centre that has over 10,000 high paid jobs, housing and a whole range of social and cultural facilities that drive the heart of the city from an economic point of view.  That situation did not happen by accident but by deliberate thinking and strategising from a planning and urban design point of view.  Indeed, we must take forward what we have learned.  I urge members to remember that there are plenty of planning successes around the country.  <\/p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. Sheridan, will comment on the seven-year rule and other points that were mentioned.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#X01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495631400,"counter":793,"content":"<p>Deputy Collins asked about the seven-year rule and Deputy Danny Healy-Rae asked about the local needs criteria applied by local authorities to determine planning applications in particular areas.<\/p> <p>  I willl preface my remarks by saying that the national spatial strategy and rural housing guidelines advocate that the planning system should facilitate rural generated housing, where feasible, in order to maintain rural populations and support rural communities and economies.  That is the basic planning principle and policy.  As Mr. Cussen has mentioned, there is a need to manage the overspill pressure in the areas located around the main cities, and in the rural areas located around the main cities in particular.  I have outlined the areas where restrictions are generally applied.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Collins has mentioned, we have an issue with the residency requirements that local authorities have included in the development plans.  Applicants for planning permission are required to reside in an area for a specific period.  We have conducted a trawl of the local authorities and discovered that the periods can vary from two to ten years.  The provision breaches the EU treaty's requirement for the free movement of citizens because it discriminates against non-locals and prevents them from residing in areas.<\/p> <p>  We are in the process of revising the rural housing guidelines and the local needs criteria.

In other words, the design of the Department was for everyone to live in concentrated city centres.  It would all be like an ice cream block and cut off fresh and solid.  However, the problem was that the naughty people had a different idea.  A lot of them came from Meath and they wanted to live there.  They wanted to live in that terrible thing, the one-off house.  Imagine that.  Just think about it, but they did.  They could not be stopped from doing what they wanted to do because we do not live in a dictatorship.  The grand plan fell and the ice cream melted all over the place.  It has nearly melted as far as the Shannon now.  I see the same phenomenon in Galway.  Some 55% to 60% of those who work in the high-end factories in Galway actually live in rural areas.  If I go to Westside and a few other places, I find very few people who work at the high end jobs.  The people are naughty because they do not do what the planners want.  However, the planners have no legal instrument to make it happen unless they ban one-off houses and assert that they will determine where people live and that is it, going the whole hog with their plan.  There is nothing worse than a plan where the instruments to implement it do not exist.  One gets a totally different effect in that case.<\/p> <p>  Having grown up in this city in a household that always had a car, even though we used to bus it or use our bicycles quite a bit, I do not believe on foot of all the patterns the NTA shows that people will not continue to use private personal vehicles.  I do not mean cars because \"car\" connotes an internal combustion engine.  A private personal vehicle can be driven totally sustainably with sustainable fuels which have no carbon effect.  They are on the way.  We could have them now if we just put our minds to it, but we are too lazy.  The idea that everyone in this lovely wet climate will go on foot or by bicycle, including the lame, the weak and the blind, is wide of the mark.  I could just get rid of my internal combustion engine if we just made the electric car a real thing.  However, I find that while cars are not much of a nuisance down the country, they are damnable things around cities where they get clogged up.  As such, we have a lot of funny premises in this debate.<\/p> <p>  I was very interested in what was said about towns and one-off houses.  The witness was absolutely right in the analysis that there is very little relationship nowadays between the vibrancy of a town and the total population.  I know a good-enough sized town which has perhaps tripled in size in the last ten years, but the shopkeepers there tell us the business in the centre has absolutely decayed.  They say that 80% of the shopping done in drapery stores is done by the rural rather than the urban population.  Why is that?  It is because in that town, the parents buy the children's clothes in Dunnes rather than in the local drapery shop.  The shops that are doing well in this particular town are the two major supermarkets to which one can drive.  The high street stores are disappearing.  There are three convenience shops in that town doing extraordinarily well and each of them is in a service station.  It is very handy.  One just drives in.  If one does not need fuel one can still drive in, get one's things and drive off.  I suggest the Department gets some PhD student to remodel the town from memory as a project to ask what was there circa 1970 or whatever its heyday was.  It would show if this premises was a shop, this one was a pub and this was a grocery.  Do people remember video shops?  Nobody goes to a video shop now because of Netflix.  How many people go to small pubs anymore?  Unless they are eateries, the answer is not too many.  They sit beside the television on a big lounge chair, which they can do at home.  How many people go to travel agents?  I was stunned to hear that somebody had gone to one recently.  Everyone who gets on to my office about passports have done the whole thing online.  We know when we get the evidence of travel.  The travel agent is gone.<\/p> <p>  There are a lot of complex factors in relation to towns.  One can argue now about the idea of having to have a particular locus to do a thing.  We have to get it into our heads that we live in a transformed world.  I asked a planner why he wanted me to live in the village and he said it was so I could walk to the post office.  I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out my best friend.  I said, \"Here is my post office.  Here is my bank, my travel agent and ten or 15 other things\".  People in rural Ireland must be the most technologically literate crowd because we do not move to do most of those things.  We just do them on the net.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#Y00500","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1495631400,"counter":805,"content":"<p>Do we close all the towns now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017052400002#Y00600","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1495631400,"counter":806,"content":"<p>We are not closing the towns.

Since Eir started rolling out broadband - and there are many people 100 yards beyond the point to which the service is provided - what we are finding is that there is a quiet revolution taking place and people are only working odd days in cities.  More and more of them are working more days at home.  They commute into cities now and again to conduct whatever business they want, to attend meetings and whatever.  The rest of the time they are operating from home.  Even the big multinational technology companies are doing this.<\/p> <p>  I am very worried that the witness is driving a plan that is going to cost this country a fortune, that is not dealing with what is really happening on the ground, that is driven by a crazy ideology which is out of date and that does not deal with social deprivation in the cities, which is pervasive in large areas of the latter in which the most deprived and least educated communities in Ireland are to be found.  In fact, the witness is basing the principle of driving things into the cities on some university thesis which states that the only creative thought happens in cities.  I do not buy into that.  I find I can think as creatively as anybody around here.  When I go up the mountain on a Sunday, I think even more creatively in the clear air and away from the background noise.  I do not think I am unique in that.  Artists and all sorts of people would ask for a quiet atmosphere in which to work.  That is just putting myself into isolation.  We have got every kind of high-tech way of talking to people.  I am of the view that we need to hasten slowly on this and have a much more detailed debate about where we are going.<\/p> <p>  Galway city is chock-a-block.  Dublin city is chock-a-block with traffic jams and there no houses available.  The plan is that we are going drive more growth into those cities before we catch up with the absolutely astronomical problems already there.  Galway has the worst traffic in the entire country.

Our presentation will address the background of the collapse and the level of investment in education the trainee pilots made, the collapse of PTC in the summer of 2012 and how much was lost by the trainee pilots, developments since the collapse, concerns we have about regulatory oversight of PTC and the human consequences, which Ms Kealy will cover.<\/p> <p>  PTC operated a pilot training business in Waterford as well as a Florida facility associated with the Florida Institute of Technology, both approved by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA. The IAA oversaw the safety standards and training of the company as well as ensuring that there were sufficient resources to carry out training to the required standard.  Generally students did the early part of their training in Florida, where clear skies were usually available, before completing training in Waterford.  Training was provided to retail or self-funded students and airline-sponsored students.  Training was supposed to take approximately 14 months and cost between &euro;80,000 and &euro;90,000.  No State support or subsidy was available.  Fees were collected over the first seven months of the course even if the training schedule was falling behind.  The company was quite aggressive in ensuring collection.  Fees were not bonded.  Although that issue was considered after the collapse, the Minister at the time decided not to require bonding as a result of concerns that training firms would leave Ireland.  Prospective students and their sponsors would have taken comfort from the IAA approval and also an investment in the company by Enterprise Ireland.<\/p> <p>  PTC ceased training students in late June 2012 and the IAA suspended its approval as a flight training organisation on 3 July 2012.  The company initially went into examinership in July.  The examinership was not successful and liquidation was initiated in late September 2012.  While liquidation has not yet finally concluded, there will be nothing for the students.  A total of &euro;7.7 million net fees, in respect of which no training was delivered, had been prepaid at the date of the collapse.  A figure of &euro;8.4 million gross was due as the company claimed that &euro;700,000 was owed to it by some individuals.  At the same date, the company had an estimated deficit of &euro;7.2 million.  Essentially, the students paid for the failure.   The 60 or so students we represent were among those most impacted upon and were owed &euro;2.6 million.  In total, 300 students were affected, including some whose training was airline-sponsored.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;7.7 million net owed as at June 2012 compared to &euro;3.6 million owed in December 2010.  In the intervening 18 months, the company lost &euro;5 million.  That situation was not helped by advertising costs of &euro;1.2 million incurred in 2011 alone, as the company aggressively tried to expand.  That effort failed with the company having essentially used prepaid student fees for training it could never afford to deliver.  It would appear that the company had no cash and was instead relying on prepaid fees to pay its way.<\/p><p>Hardly any cash has been realised since the liquidation which commenced in September 2012, not even enough to pay the liquidator.   The parent company of PTC, Shemburn, owed PTC &euro;1.6 million and was subsequently liquidated.  However, little value was realised from the company and nothing is expected to go to PTC.  The liquidator of PTC sought to restrict directors of the company through High Court proceedings in February 2016 before Judge Haughton.  The proceedings resulted in the managing director and main shareholder being restricted from acting as a company director for five years.  Judge Haughton was very sympathetic in his approach but was not in a position to do anything for the students because the company had no money.<\/p><p> A range of complaints were made by students and their sponsors to the Garda bureau of fraud investigation but no action has been taken to date.  In October 2012, Following a meeting with the Irish Aviation Authority in October 2012, this committee indicated it would undertake a forensic investigation of the collapse.  However, that decision was subsequently reversed when the committee met in private session.<\/p><p> PTC and its sister operation in Florida were approved by the IAA, which undertook a review in September 2011 as part of its renewal and review process, during which additional financial information was sought.  PTC's approval was renewed in spite of its precarious financial position.  The additional information was requested pursuant to a section of the regulations which deals with concerns about the lack or apparent lack of financial resources.<\/p><p> Freedom of information disclosures show that the IAA reviewed the company accounts of Shemburn, the parent company of PTC, although these were not the group accounts because they did not consolidate its subsidiaries.  It was solely the company accounts.  Shemburn had a &euro;1 million reported net worth at December 2010. The IAA noted that Shemburn did not have qualified accounts.  However, Shemburn was not the entity it was approving for flight training.  A review of PTC&rsquo;s accounts would have shown a &euro;2 million deficit at December 2010, &euro;3.6 million owed to students and a serious qualification of the accounts which stated that the conditions in being at the time indicated the existence of a material uncertainty which may have cast significant doubt over the company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.  PTC could only survive by collecting fees upfront to fund training which had already been paid for by other students.  The IAA director of safety regulation stated at a committee meeting in October 2012 that many flight training companies are like Ponzi schemes.  A review of the PTC accounts would have shown this to be the case.  PTC was borrowing from Peter to pay Paul.  In view of the fact that PTC had little or no cash, how could the IAA have concluded that it had the resources to carry out pilot training to the required standards?  The IAA showed excessive forbearance in allowing it to continue to operate.  One of the objectives of the IAA was to promote aviation education and training in Ireland and it formed College Ireland in 2010 to further that aim.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland injected stabilisation funds of almost &euro;400,000 into PTC in 2010 by way of preference shares.  Unfortunately, that investment was lost.  The desire to promote companies such as PTC almost certainly resulted in forbearance when hard decisions were required.  The problem with that is that it was the students&rsquo; moneys that were at risk and ultimately completely lost.<\/p><p> The Minister noted in 2012 that students would have lost money no matter when intervention, including the withdrawal of approval, occurred, implying that earlier intervention was contemplated.  Such earlier intervention would have resulted in reduced overall losses as sums owed for training due increased dramatically from &euro;3.6 million to &euro;7.7 million in the final 18 months of the company's operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017052400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kealy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1495629000,"counter":830,"content":"<p>I will address some of the effects that the collapse of the company had on students.  For many students, this was their only chance for a career or education in flying.  When PTC collapsed with no reimbursements for students, their dreams collapsed.  Some trainees were ashamed to talk about it.  We set up and continue to run a Facebook group for these students in order to keep us all together and communicate any progress or developments in our quest for justice over the past five years.  We knew it would keep at least some hope alive.  Approximately 120 students have continually followed the group since the collapse of PTC in July 2012.

Another almost had their home repossessed and had a major row with their bank.  One student had a stress-induced seizure and will never be allowed to fly again, which is very sad.  Some students took the exams at a later stage but the exams had changed in format or content and students did not receive a discount on the exam fees.  There was no way of getting any money back.

Subsequent to the PTC collapse, analogous situations involving the safety responsibilities of public bodies, such as the case of Priory Hall, resulted in very large usages of public moneys.  There was considerable co-ordinated action across Departments and the private sector in regard to problems involving English language schools.  While the cost of flights home for trainee pilots stranded in the US was covered by the IAA, no other financial assistance was forthcoming other than the preservation of flight records.  As Ms Kealy noted, students who ended up re-doing exams when time limits ran out received no discount on the fees charged by the IAA.<\/p> <p>  Five years after the company's collapse, this is still a sore issue for all affected.  We appeal to the committee members to give our case and the futures of all these young people a full and deserved hearing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017052400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kealy"},{"type":"speech","time":1495629000,"counter":832,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance and very detailed submission.

In many ways, the IAA was very heavily invested in promotion.
