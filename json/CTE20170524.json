The most important point is not that it is my Bill or anyone else's but that we get it right.  I am not proprietorial about the Bill and acknowledge the work the Department has done on it.  We all agree that the legislation is long overdue.

Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments seek to do the same thing, perhaps in a slightly different way.  His amendments are more simple, with just a line stating one of the functions of the board is to make recommendations on sentence management.  Mine is a bit more detailed and convoluted.  I am open to seeing which approach is best.  I presume there is an argument that if too much detail is included it might tie the board's hands which is obviously not the intention.  At the same time, I was trying to balance against this that if we do not include the detail there is a danger the board's functions and powers in this regard will not be clear enough, which could leave it hamstrung.  This is the balance we are trying to reach.  I do not know which is best so I will throw it out there.<\/p><p>The amendment I have tabled, whereby the Bill would empower the board to make sentence management recommendations, has been tabled on foot of the recommendations by the existing parole board, which I believe is significant and adds weight to it.  It has pointed out it has this function already and it constitutes the bulk of its work.  It recommends it for only five or six prisoners a year.  If it is taken away it will be left bereft of a number of responsibilities.  Everybody agreed on Second Stage it should continue to have this role.  The question is how.<\/p><p>Where my group of amendments differs from Deputy O'Callaghan's is I propose that we give the board powers to make orders regarding sentence management rather than just recommendations.  This is an important difference.  It is important in light of the fact it will be the body reviewing all of the facts about the individual's progress, and I believe this is appropriate.  It is recommended by the existing board.  I have left it open to the governor of an open prison to revoke or suspend such orders, which is how it happens at present.  Obviously it would be very difficult for the board to do this as it is not present in the prison.  The idea of an oversight role for the board whereby a governor who revokes or suspends an order has to justify it or explain the reasons in writing is reasonable.  There was unanimity on this issue on Second Stage.  What we are trying to do is sort out the detail of how it would be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#B01600","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>There is a lot of agreement.  I will go through the amendments one by one.  The amendment we are dealing with now is amendment No. 3, in which Deputy Daly is trying to amend the definition of parole order.  At present, the Bill states it shall be construed in accordance with section 22.  Deputy Daly wants to change this to section 22(1) and (2) and she also proposes a new section.  It is easier if we leave it in accordance with section 22, the way it is.  It complicates it by having to specify subsections.<\/p> <p>  There is agreement on the more general issue.  If we look at amendment No. 6, which I have proposed, it is in effect similar to what is contained in Deputy Daly's amendment No. 5.  What we are seeking to do is provide that one of the functions of the parole board shall be to make recommendations regarding the sentence management of prisoners and transfers to an open prison.  This is a function the board will have.  With regard to parole orders, these are dealt with in section 22.  Obviously, the parole board will have the power in respect of parole orders.  I am slightly hesitant about giving governors powers to revoke parole orders.  We need to have a clear statutory basis that it is the parole board which has this power.  It can set out orders and revoke orders.  Amendment No. 3 is unnecessary and we should go with amendment No. 6, which is the same as Deputy Daly's amendment No. 5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#B01700","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 address the need to ensure the parole board can make recommendations relating to sentence management.  Amendments Nos. 72 and 83 are linked to amendment No. 5 and amendments Nos. 3, 45, 50 and 58 are consequential amendments to amendment No. 72.  I support the principle of the amendments, which reflect current practice whereby the parole board can and does make various recommendations.<\/p><p>These include advising a prisoner on the type of programmes with which he or she should engage, recommending transfer to a lower security prison or recommending a programme of temporary release, leading to longer periods.<\/p><p> With respect to the element of the amendments regarding transfers to open prisons, this is, as I have said, a recommendation that the current parole board can make.  Such a recommendation could be implied in the general understanding of \"sentence management\".  However, I am not going to object to specifying the transfer to open prisons.<\/p><p> My preference is for amendment No. 6.  My concern with Deputy Daly's amendment No. 72 is the proposal permitting the parole board to issue orders relating to sentence management, including orders for transfer to open prison.  By providing for the parole board to make orders rather than recommendations, the amendments would effectively involve the board in the management and operation of prisons, which is outside of the remit of the board.<\/p><p> I acknowledge that Deputy Daly has also put forward amendment No. 83, which would allow a Governor to revoke it.  Nevertheless, getting into the management of prisons is a somewhat inappropriate role, and I hope the Deputy understands that.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 6 goes a long way to what the Deputy Daly is seeking.  It allows recommendations with respect to sentence management, including recommendations relating to transfers to open prisons.  I would suggest agreeing amendment No. 6 over amendments Nos. 3, 5, 72, 45, 50, 58, 71, 72 and 83.<\/p><p> With respect to amendment No. 71 in the name of Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan, this amendment allows for the parole order to be sent to a prison governor, which is right.  I would also like a further provision requiring the parole board to also notify the Minister that the parole orders have been made.  It is necessary that the Minister for Justice and Equality would be aware of any decisions to release prisoners.  A simple notification of the nature of the parole order which is issued to the relevant prison governor would I believe suffice, and I will suggest an amendment to that at a later Stage.<\/p><p> I would also like to address subsection (5) of the amendment, which provides for the board to specify conditions.  Subsection (2) of the section being amended already sets out the conditions of a parole order.  However, subsection (5) appears to allow the board to specify conditions, which I presume will be some or all of the conditions under subsection (2), or will it be conditions in addition to subsection (2) which will apply to all persons released on parole?<\/p><p> In any event, I believe there is merit in considering introducing an automatic condition of release, which would apply to all parole orders, such as that the offender must comply with all lawful instructions of his or her probation officer.  While section 22 of the Bill sets out the conditions which may be imposed in respect of individual offenders, I believe we should consider whether it should be a standard and automatic condition of every parole order to abide by the instructions of a probation officer.<\/p><p> Persons on parole are under the supervision of probation officers.  It is the case that this supervision may vary from offender to offender or as time passes.  Probation officers are responsible for facilitating and assisting an offender in reintegrating into society and, as such, are likely to be best placed to identify the immediate needs of and risks faced by an offender, including as these needs or risks change.  When cases come to me I often see the progress people are making and the varying recommendations of probation officers.  In my view, an automatic condition to abide by the lawful instructions of a probation officer will avoid any unforeseen gaps should needs or risks emerge, and it will aid the rehabilitation of the offender.<\/p><p> I would be interested in the views of the members with respect to this proposal.  It is a matter we can return to at a later Stage of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#B01800","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

It is probably the case that amendment No. 6 rather than amendment No. 5 should be accepted.  I will not worry about that.  However, amendments Nos. 72 and 73 are linked and their purpose is to precisely to overcome the issue of the board being involved in the day to day management of the prison.  What I am trying to do on the one hand is give the board more power over sentence management, with a caveat that the prison governor maintains a power to offset that by being able to revoke or suspend the order the parole board would make.  I believe that overcomes the Minister's point about the parole board going beyond its remit and straying into prison management.  That is there to balance that situation and giving the board more power over sentence management in this way, through the issuing of orders, was, as far as I can recall, based on a submission from the current parole board.  I believe it is reasonable because on the one hand it is giving it more power but, on the other, it is qualifying that so that the management of the prison would be able to carry on.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy O'Callaghan's point about whether that is giving a prison governor too much power to overturn that, the fact that the Governor would have to give a written explanation on that gives it an oversight role.  I do not know if that better explains it.  I like those two amendments and I am prepared to push them rather than the other ones.  If I did not move amendment No. 5 and amendment No. 6 was moved, the possibility of the board issuing orders remains in other Parts of the Act, which I believe is what Deputy O'Callaghan said.

Under existing arrangements, parole is effectively the exercise by the Minister of the power of temporary release under the Criminal Justice Act 1960, reflecting the fact that the existing parole board operates in an advisory capacity only.  Given that the parole board will now be established on a statutory basis, with a clear decision-making function with regard to the release of certain prisoners, it may be necessary to explicitly set out what parole is as distinct from ministerial powers of temporary release, which will continue to operate under the Criminal Justice Act 1960.<\/p> <p>  Under the provisions of this Bill, parole is conditional release.  Unlike temporary release which may be renewed but also may not, parole can only be revoked where there is a risk to the public or there has been a breach of a condition attached to the parole.  That risk or breach is subsequently determined through a hearing under section 25 of the Bill.  It would be helpful, and it will distinguish parole from temporary release, if we set out - possibly in section 5 of the Bill - that parole is a form of conditional release.  It is already clear from section 5(3) that the provisions of the Bill are not intended to interfere with the right of temporary release, so I may therefore bring forward amendments to clarify the type of release that is being provided for under the Bill.  It would be helpful if we did this and I want to alert the committee that I intend to do that under section 5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#D01100","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495612800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495612800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Section 6 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495612800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>SECTION 7<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":61,"content":"<p>There are two amendments to section 7.

I had originally indicated that it should be a current or retired member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but Deputy Wallace suggests we take out the term \"or retired\".

I would think a current garda should be out guarding the streets as opposed to sitting on the parole board.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on it.

If it is a current or retired member of the Garda, it is more expansive.<\/p> <p>  In amendment No. 9, Deputy Wallace proposes \"a lay community representative\".  It is important to have community representatives but people are going to be selected by a competitive selection process under section 8(3)(b).  On the wording, Deputy Clare Daly has amendment No. 10, which I would prefer to amendment No. 9.  It refers to \"two persons appointed through a competitive selection process coordinated by the Public Appointments Service to have\" certain qualifications.  It is important everyone is not appointed by a Public Appointments Service competition.  People will just not apply for it.  There is some basis for certain members of the board to be appointed that way.<\/p> <p>  The manner in which I have identified that people should be appointed is that, for example, the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service, the Garda Commissioner and the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland will nominate a person each.  That is a better way to do it rather than to have a competition, which may look transparent and which people might think sounds great, but which will in many respects not get people to apply.  There is a mix within it in that some have to apply through the competition process and some are appointed by others and it is a good mix.

On amendment No. 8, my point was that the emphasis should be on the assessment of the current risk of the person before the board.  There should be an emphasis on current knowledge of the public safety environment, on assessing risk to the community or risk of reoffending at the present time, using up-to-date information from currently serving members of the force.  It is important to focus on the prisoner now and at how much he or she has been rehabilitated, and not have a retrospective look at the period of his or her offence or his or her sentencing.  A retired garda might have known the prisoner better in the past than a serving garda, but we hope that the prisoner is not the same individual he or she was when he or she got into trouble and that maybe he or she has moved on.  While we accept that the principle of prison does not work, the thinking is that it is supposed to rehabilitate prisoners.  If the system was better than it is, there might be more rehabilitation than there is.  To give a person a fair chance, it is fair to look at his or her present more than his or her past.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Callaghan made a point about retired garda&iacute;.  I know retired garda&iacute; as well and they are a lot smarter than serving garda&iacute; in many cases.  It does not change the fact that current members of the Garda will be more up to date, which is natural.<\/p><p> My amendment No. 9 refers to a lay community representative.  Given that this stuff is going to be put on a statute basis then it is just a case of ring-fencing this matter.  There might be several community representatives on the board or they might be sidelined.  We could have a situation where there are no community representatives on the board.  My amendment seeks to guard against such a situation by insisting that the board has at least one community representative at all times, on a statutory basis.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#D02600","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>The bulk of the amendments in this section are mine and I will go through them individually.  My amendments are linked and share a theme but some highlight different points.<\/p><p>My amendment No. 10 refers to the appointment system and calls for the two members with experience of the supervision or aftercare of discharged prisoners to be appointed subject to section 8(2)(i).  At the moment it is the Minister who appoints under this heading.  I tabled my amendment because I believe that two persons appointed through a competitive selection process co-ordinated by the Public Appointments Service is better than the Minister appointing such persons.  We have the same debate on every piece of legislation whether it is appointment to a judicial council or everything else.  There is a danger when the Minister nominates that the appointment would appear to be less transparent.  That is the only reason I tabled my amendment. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 13 seeks to add two new members to the board.  Like Deputy Wallace's amendment No. 9, my amendment seeks to add people from the community to the board.  Amendment No. 13 reads:<\/p><blockquote>two persons appointed through a competitive selection process coordinated by the Public Appointments Service with knowledge and experience of working or volunteering in a support role with criminal offenders and discharged prisoners.<\/blockquote> <p>My amendment has a similar intent to that of Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment No. 12, which allows for the possibility of two community representatives.  My amendment seeks to appoint people who have worked in the community or in pastoral roles with offenders to the board.  They would be a welcome addition.  My amendment is more definite than amendment No. 12.  My amendment wants it made obligatory to appoint two community persons rather than leave it as an option.  The aim of my amendment is supported by the present parole board.  <\/p><p>I made the point on Second Stage that the board is heavily weighted towards legal and high powered people who, with the best will in the world, probably have more professional contact rather than a direct experience of dealing with some of people who are up for parole.  In that sense, community experience and that type of background would add a good and necessary balance to the board.  My amendment is important to me because it seeks to make the provision obligatory rather than optional.<\/p><p>I tabled amendments Nos. 14 and 15.

My amendments seek an open competition for appointment to the board and the rationale is the same as previously.  I do not have a difficulty with the professions being represented.  It is good for the board to be comprised of legal people, Garda and psychologists.  I have a problem with their nominating bodies nominating people rather than using merit.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust has also raised its concern that the people who are favoured by the organisation might be nominated and that they will agree between themselves to take turns to be appointed for a year.  People are not being nominated on merit.  It is too important to leave the final say to the representative bodies even though I do not have a problem with the criteria.  It is really important to have psychologists.  I would prefer people to be nominated on merit and for a competition to be held.  I do not think a competition would put people off.

It is important that members of the board have training or experience in interview techniques given that the contact with the person is based on report but a lot of it is based on a person's performance during an interview.  People need to be qualified in how to assess the situation.  They must be able to recognise when a person does a bad interview or does not represent himself or herself properly.  It is a disempowering process for the applicant.  Therefore, it is important that board members are skilled in how to draw people out in an interview process, particularly in the criminal justice system.  Board members need common sense.  A knee-jerk impression can cloud a person's judgment so board members need training.  It is a complex issue.  We need people who can see past their feelings.

I have had the benefit of reading their decisions, and having to make a decision myself on the recommendation they are making to me.<\/p> <p>  I will make a general point first about how critical the membership is.  I think everybody here accepts that it is critical to have the right people on the board because one must make life and death decisions almost.  One must assess the most serious offenders or people who have committed the most serious of crimes who are before the parole board in terms of an application for their future management.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Wallace that risk assessment is absolutely central.  I have given an awful lot of thought to this matter.  I constantly ask myself the following when I read these cases.  What is the risk?   What is the risk assessment?  How has it been done by the parole board?  How well has it been done by the various reports that the board has access to?  If I have any questions about it I refer them back and get further information.  I say that just to highlight how absolutely critical decision-making is and the implications it has for society as a whole in terms of safety and of course for the individual in terms of his or her future life and his or her opportunity for rehabilitation.  That always has to be balanced with an absolutely accurate assessment, in so far as we can.  These things are not a precise science but they are terribly important.  The membership of the board must be seen in that light.  The criteria that we use are critically important.<\/p><p>I have put much thought into this.  We must ensure we get the right mix and the right balances, and that we do not do anything just for the sake of a representation that might appear to be the right thing to do.  We must have a process in place that ensures we get the best people on the parole board.  That is the goal of everybody in the committee.<\/p><p> In that context, I will not oppose amendment No. 7.  It expands the category of persons qualified to be the chairperson of the parole board.  It broadens it to include a solicitor or barrister of ten years standing.  Deputy O'Callaghan also includes the phrase \"a practising academic\".  There might be further qualification of that because it is a broad phrase and we might need to narrow it down in the context of the job to be done on the parole board.  However, I am happy to revert to the Deputy on that.  The Bill will establish the parole board on a statutory basis with decision making powers to release prisoners prior to completion of sentence.  I have a preference for a legally qualified chairperson, but I can give it further consideration.  I also wish to examine the phrase \"practising academic\" to define it a little further.<\/p><p> With regard to the amendment proposed by Deputy Wallace, it is existing practice to have a retired member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the parole board.  On the point the Deputy makes about risk assessment, whether the member is retired is not an influencing factor.  The Deputy appears to be talking about cases where there might be what might be seen as a conflict of interest or where there might have been an involvement of the garda in the case.  I do not know how often that happens, but I would not have thought it was very often.  The key point is the critical ability of the garda, retired or otherwise, to make the risk assessment.  Restricting it to current members narrows the depth of expertise available to the board, so I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 9 proposes to include in the membership of the parole board \"a lay community representative, appointed following a transparent and objective recruitment process and selected by an independent body\".  Amendment No. 12 proposed by Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan contains a similar proposal involving the appointment of such a representative by the Minister.  Obviously, \"community representative\" is a very broad concept and there are varying ideas of who such a representative might be.  The basic point, as I have already said, is that persons with the greatest expertise in crime, justice, offender management and, in particular, rehabilitation and re-integration of offenders should be represented.  I am not convinced that the amendment is necessary or sufficiently clearly drafted, but I will not oppose it.  However, members should again consider the point that the board we are appointing comprises people who must be as tight as possible in terms of the expertise we would like them to bring to the board.  It is such a serious decision to make and we want people who understand the context and have the broad qualifications.  I have no wish to restrict it unduly, because people bring much life experience to this type of situation as well.  However, management of offenders and understanding of criminal behaviour, recidivism and rehabilitation are very important.  A particular difficulty with amendment No. 9 relates to the process of recruitment.  There is no guidance on who or what would comprise the independent body with responsibility for selection of the person in question.  Including the words \"transparent\" and \"objective\" appears to be superfluous because this is a requirement of all recruitment processes.  I will proceed with amendment No. 12.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 10, 13, 16, 17, 19 and 21 proposed by Deputy Clare Daly also relate to the membership of the board and in particular the appointment of persons to the board.  The Bill currently provides for the membership of the board to include persons appearing to the Minister to have knowledge and experience of the supervision of discharged prisoners or who have made a study of the causes of delinquency.  Currently, when the Minister has to make an appointment to the board, there are clear criteria for who should be appointed.  They must be expert.  Amendments Nos. 10 and 19 remove the Minister from any role in the appointment of persons to the parole board and assign the role to the Public Appointments Service.  The membership of the board as currently proposed in section 8 properly identifies the appropriate persons to be members of the board as well as the means of appointment.  It is appropriate, given the Minister for Justice and Equality's oversight of the criminal justice system, that the Minster should have input into the membership of the board.  The Minister has responsibility for oversight and has awareness of the broad issues in crime.  To exclude the Minister having any input into the board is unnecessary.<\/p><p> It is a positive thing for the Minister to have an input into the membership because one often finds when one looks at the membership of a board that some skills might be absent, so when the Minister is due to make the appointment that could be taken into consideration.  One may find, for whatever reason, that particular expertise has been selected by everybody else who has an input into the membership and there might well be a gap which could be filled by the appointment by the Minister of the two members.  This relates not just to the parole board, but to appointments in general.  Certainly one of the criteria I consider when making board appointments is what skills are necessary in the particular situation and what is missing.  That is a unique role and unique knowledge the Minister can have, as opposed to other people.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 13 proposes the appointment of a further two persons through the Public Appointments Service with experience of working with offenders.  It is evident that the board as set out under section 8 already contains such persons, be it the representative of the Probation Service or the representative of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, a body with a great deal of experience in this area and which focuses on these issues and is very appropriate.  Equally subparagraph (i) of the section refers to the appointment of persons with knowledge and experience of the supervision or aftercare of discharged persons and there is potentially considerable overlap with that provision and the amendment proposed by the Deputy.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 propose that persons appointed to the parole board should be selected through competitions run by the Public Appointments Service.  This would be extremely unwieldy if it was applied to everybody.  The appointment of existing employees of certain services such as the IPS or the Probation Service should be a matter for those organisations and those appointed will continue to be employees of those services.  I do not believe that any difficulty has been raised by the existing parole board which these amendments would address.  There would have to be further consultation with a number of the organisations and with the Public Appointments Service on the impact of these amendments before they could sensibly be agreed.  Members will understand my point.  Take the example of a probation officer who is nominated to be a member.  It is quite appropriate that this comes from within the Probation Service, as opposed to all probation officers going to the Public Appointments Service and having to go through that process and then returning as members.  It is unwieldy.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 21 is to section 8(4), which sets out certain requirements of persons appointed to the parole board.  The amendment adds to those requirements by requiring the person to have training or experience in interviewing techniques and proven analytical skills.  Again, that is very broad.  These skills are clearly necessary.  Whether it is necessary to build in them in as a specific requirement in this way, that everybody has skill in interviewing and in analytical techniques, gives rise to the question of assessing that and building it in as a criterion.  People will bring a different range of skills to the board and I am not sure it is necessary to go into that level of detail.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 relate to the gender balance of the parole board and I agree with them.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 18 corrects an oversight in providing for the appointment of a probation officer to the board by including such appointment in paragraph (3)(e) of section 8.  However, I propose to bring forward an amendment to provide for the appointment of a probation officer by the director of the Probation Service. <\/p><p> The key goal is to get the right mix of people with the right level of training, experience and understanding of the area to do this important job.  That has guided my approach and response to the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#E02000","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>While I was listening to the contributions I looked at section 8 again.  In fairness to me, I thought it was quite well drafted.  I accept the T&aacute;naiste's point about the nomination from the Probation Service.  As a result, I will withdraw amendment No. 18.  It is inappropriate, as I have suggested, to try to get around that by getting the Irish Prison Service to nominate the person.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 12 accommodates Deputy Wallace's concern about a lay community representative, as it includes such a representative.  I agree, however, it is a board that requires expertise.  I know Deputy Daly's concern in respect of trying to get everyone nominated in a transparent and open way.  My assessment of trying to get people to serve on public boards, and I do not have the experience of other people here, is that it is hard to get decent people to serve.  If we have a process whereby people have to apply for a competition and, as the Minister said, every probation officer has to apply for a competition and has to be separately interviewed, after which an individual will be selected, it would make it very complicated, in my opinion.  Maybe in a different society it would be appropriate, but it would make it extremely complicated to get membership of the board in this way.  The method we have in section 8 at present is that four people will be nominated by the Public Appointments Service and other individuals will be nominated by representative bodies, such as the Irish Penal Reform Trust, a probation officer, the Prison Service, a garda, a psychologist and the psychiatrists will nominate a person.  There will be a good mix there, and the Minister will also have a role in it.  If we hand over everything to the Public Appointments Service we could have it electing the Taoiseach at the end of the day.

The involvement of the Public Appointments Services is part of a broader political debate flowing out of public disquiet over the way in which appointments to boards were previously handled.  It is something we have discussed.  In this context, I am prepared to see this is a board that will not be a highly sought-after gig with loads of initials after people's names and wads of cash attached to it.  Presumably the people who would opt to go to the parole board would do so out of a motivation of public service or an association in a former life or some interest in the area.  In this sense, I accepted the point that perhaps mandating the Public Appointments Service to deal with a board of this character, which does not meet weekly, is perhaps a little top-heavy.  However, it is there to overcome the difficulty with previous political appointments.  I am prepared to stand back from this group of amendments.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the idea of the nominating bodies being subject to some scrutiny, perhaps this does not apply to this type of board because the people coming forward will be those who will want to come forward, and they will not be stampeded in the queue for the positions.  That is probably true.  Others, such as judicial boards, would be prestige gigs and we would need to include more caveats.  When we say nominating bodies this does not necessarily give a level of transparency.  Perhaps the overall balance is met by the various categories.<\/p> <p>  I am quite adamant about the inclusion of a community representative, whether it is done in Deputy Wallace's way or my way.  Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments also speak about community.  Deputy Brophy's points are a bit facetious, because the person will define himself or herself and the appointment process will nominate who comes forward.  Yes, a Member of the Oireachtas is a community representative as far as I am concerned, but in actual fact what is far more likely in this category, and what is supported by the present parole board, is the idea of somebody who has experience of working with ex-offenders.  In this sense, they would be very well placed.  They may not have initials after their name but they have street knowledge of risk and how a person's sentence was managed, and they could be a really valuable addition to the professional people on the board.  The only point is to have a balance with the high-powered professional-type input because, with the best in the world, people who are professional may not have a broader understanding.  They have their own expertise, but it could be blended with somebody who has more of the background.  Many of the people up for parole perpetrated their crimes in their own communities on neighbours and friends.  If they are going back into those communities it is precisely those people who would be the victims of further crime if they got it wrong.  A community representative would be a valuable addition, whether through Deputy Wallace's amendment or mine.  I take what Deputy O'Callaghan is saying, that his amendment allows for community also, but it is only an option and not an obligation.  I believe somebody such as this would be invaluable to the board.  I would like such a person to be there.

It is implicit throughout the Bill that anyone in the role of chairperson of the parole board must be impartial in his or her treatment of issues.  Deputy Mick Wallace raises a valid point that a judge who adjudicated in a case and passed sentence on an individual could not adjudicate in that individual's parole hearing, but this all comes within the principles of natural justice that operate in administrative bodies.

There is a body of law which oversees and covers procedures.  In that regard, the amendment is unnecessary and would actually cloud the situation a little.

Supporting the timely communication of parole board decisions to candidates for parole and other relevant parties is vital.  According to the Irish Penal Reform Trust, there can be delays of up to nine months before a candidate for parole has a decision communicated to him or her, which is more than frustrating for the prisoners who want to act on the parole board's recommendations.  For example, sometimes it might recommend particular training or treatment.  If the communication of a decision is delayed by months, it is a little mad and not very fair.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of accountability and the keeping of records and so on, the committee does not need me to tell it that we do not have enough of it in Ireland.  We are considering bringing forward a Bill to make it compulsory to keep minutes, for example.  A simple example would be the decision made by NAMA to shred the minutes of the meeting of 13 December which was crucial in the final stages of the setting up of Project Eagle.  Greater accountability is required across the board in how we do things, but the point about a prisoner receiving information in good time, surely, is quite practical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#J02100","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I agree with amendment No. 26 tabled by Deputy Clare Daly.

Putting a specific date on it - for example, a requirement that it be done within four weeks - would make it very difficult for the board.  However, on balance, I have no problem with amendments Nos. 28 and 29.  I do not think amendments Nos. 26 and 27 are over the top, as suggested by Deputy Clare Daly, but I am concerned that they would limit the discretion of the parole board and the chairperson.  The objective in having panels of three, four or five individuals is that a number of panels could be in operation at any one time.  It should be remembered that there are only 15 people on the board; therefore, there could be between three and five panels operating at any one time.  We are better off leaving discretion as to how panels are operated with the chairperson.  If panels are to consist of five members every time, less consideration may be given and they could find themselves overworked.  Every single one of the five members would only be able to deal with three applications at a time.

The amendment does remove the flexibility which will lead to the better working of the parole board.  Five out of a board of 15 is quite a lot.  It is a busy board and there are a lot of cases to be seen.  The flexibility that is there at the moment for the chair is good.  One does not want to increase the membership of the board.  By keeping the flexibility and have the chairperson decide, I have no doubt that on some occasions the chairperson may decide that there is five in particular cases.  I would prefer to stick with flexibility.  It also means that more reviews can be carried out.  Ultimately, the people on this board have applied and are volunteers.  Giving the chair the flexibility is the best use and what will get the best outcome, depending on their skills.  It is better to keep the position where there is three or five and to allow the board to manage its work and get on with it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Wallace wants to insert the words \"signed and dated\".  I take his point but I would say the words are unnecessary and could call into question similar provisions in legislation.  Obviously, all decisions should be signed and dated and statutory provision is not necessary.  I would be concerned that accepting the amendment may have unintended implications for similar statutory provisions but I am happy to look at it.  It is a common sense approach, and why not make it statutory, but it may be that there would be subsequential issues for other statutory provisions.  I would like to have a look at it again with the Parliamentary Counsel and perhaps come back on Report Stage.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Wallace's other amendment refers to \"the decision must be provided directly to the prisoner within reasonable time frame\".  I agree with that, of course it should.  I suggest that section 15(2) and 16(2) of the Bill already make the necessary provision for decisions to be forwarded to the parole candidate directly and that we do not need further provision.  However, we do not have a big problem with this issue of reasonable time frame.  Sectons 15(2) and 16(2) give the necessary provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#K00200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

There is a list of criteria, such as risk of reoffending, conduct to date, etc., and this adds extra criteria to take account of the effect the decision would have on the prisoner's family and the likelihood of facilitating his or her reintegration.  A theme of our discussions on penal reform was that the role of the family and social supports are the key determinant in whether somebody will reoffend or not.  One could say that this is basically covered by looking at the risk of reoffending but we need to elevate that issue.  That is why I have included it.

The reason I tabled the amendment is that if one is charged with murder, there is no incentive to pleading guilty, because whether one pleads guilty or not guilty, one will be sentenced to life imprisonment.  I thought there might be some benefit in providing an incentive for a person accused of murder that if he or she pleads guilty, it could be taken into account at the parole process.<\/p> <p>  Having spoken to officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, I recognise there are issues in respect of it.  For instance, why should whether a person pleaded guilty or not guilty at the time of the prosecution be taken into account when assessing whether he or she should be rehabilitated and allowed out into the community?  The real issue I am trying to deal is to provide an incentive to plead guilty to a murder charge when there is none at present.  Perhaps the parole process is not the way to do that.  On that basis, further consideration needs to be given to it.  I will withdraw amendment No. 62.<\/p> <p>  In amendment No. 32, Deputy Daly proposes additional factors that need to be taken into account, including the effect the granting of parole may have on the prisoner's family.  My concern is this will lead to a corresponding requirement by the family of a murder victim to have its submission taken into account and what impact the release will have on it.  Under the Bill a victim can make representations to the parole board.  I am concerned Deputy Daly's amendment will extend it further to take into account factors that are not relevant to the central issue, which is the rehabilitation or not of the parole candidate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#L01300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 32 tabled by Deputy Daly would require a report regarding a parole candidate to include the effect the granting of parole may have on the prisoner&rsquo;s family and the likelihood that being granted parole would facilitate reintegration into his or her family.  It is clear from section 19 of the Bill that a parole board may grant parole if, in its opinion, the person being considered for parole will not present a risk to society and releasing the person will facilitate the reintegration of that person into society.<\/p> <p>  From the cases I have seen, there is a significant level of information available to the parole board when considering cases.  The parole board has all the information that is relevant, including how the prisoner has behaved, how he or she has dealt with disciplinary issues and if there has been contact with family.  A wide amount of information is available to the parole board.  In her amendment, Deputy Daly proposed to insert \"the effect that the granting of parole may have on the prisoner's family\".  There are broader issues in regard to family.  I understand the point the Deputy is making but the effect on the prisoner&rsquo;s family of the actual decision is not really relevant to these considerations.<\/p><p>With regard to facilitating reintegration of the offender into his or her family, the parole board always considers the overarching matter of reintegration into society, which encompasses the aspect of integration into family.  Having the effect on family in statute is problematic.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 63 to section 19 of the Bill makes a similar provision regarding facilitating reintegration with family.  Under subsection(1)(<i>b<\/i>) of section 19, the parole board may grant parole to a person if, in its opinion, the release of the person in question would facilitate the reintegration of the person into society.  That is the general point.  The intention behind the Deputy's amendment is adequately covered in the provision as is.  I note the comments of Deputy O'Callaghan with regard to amendment No. 62.<br\/><br\/>Both amendments seek to achieve the same aim and I will outline a concern as to possible consequences if this amendment is agreed.  The effect of the amendment suggests that defendants who plead guilty to an offence would receive a positive benefit with respect to their being considered for parole.  I agree that a defendant&rsquo;s remorse or admission of guilt should be acknowledged.  However, I do not believe that a defendant who fails to plead guilty should be negatively impacted in respect of release.  Where a defendant pleads guilty this can be, and generally is, taken into account as a mitigating factor for the purpose of sentencing and that is correct.  I do not agree that it is a relevant factor - Deputy O'Callaghan made this point - with respect to the release of the prisoner and I consider the criteria currently set out in the Bill to be sufficiently broad for the purpose of determining release.  I repeat that I would not like to see offenders who have pleaded not guilty, as is their right, and were convicted following a trial having that choice and right possibly negatively impacting on a decision relating to their release.<br\/><br\/>Section 19 of the Bill provides that the parole board may grant release if the person being considered for parole will not present an undue risk to society and the release of the prisoner will facilitate the reintegration of the person into society.  I do not see how the nature of the offender&rsquo;s plea would inform either of those considerations.  We are going back to the basic purpose of the parole board, which is assessing risk.  That is really the key consideration at that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#L01400","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I totally accept the points made by the Minister and Deputy O'Callaghan.

This is against the backdrop of where the Bill currently provides for the parole panel to refuse somebody and not be considered again for two years.  I am trying to replace this with a provision for one year as I do not accept the two-year rule.  I am not sure if it is a resourcing issue but it is too long.  The European Court of Human Rights has accepted periods of less than a year between reviews and rejected periods of more than a year as incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights Article 5.4.  In Murray <i>v.<\/i>Parole Board, the English Court of Appeal stated the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights regarding parole review periods for life sentence prisoners was that for an interval of more than a year, the onus is on the state to establish a period is not in breach of Article 5.4.<\/p><p>This is really important and there is no logical reason a year could not be considered.  Sentence length can be a kind of peculiar concoction in some ways, as it is not necessarily linked to rehabilitation.  It is a mixture of punishment depending on the seriousness of the offence, tradition and how long prisoners are likely to move towards rehabilitation.  All of those factors are put in.  The parole system is really the only comprehensive way of keeping track in this regard to see if rehabilitation is working.  Two years is just too long.<\/p><p>Earlier this year I was contacted by the partner of a prisoner serving a life sentence and this man has basically ticked all the boxes necessary to become eligible for parole.  He has not been granted it to date because of delays in accessing therapeutic services that have been mandated to him but not provided.  That is not his fault but it is holding up the entire process when he is carrying out his side of the bargain.  It is preventing him from being paroled.<\/p><p>Instances like this cannot be addressed in the Bill, but by shortening the time period between parole applications pressure could be brought to bear in circumstances where, for example, the Irish Prison Service is not delivering services that would help the person to get parole, when he or she is doing all that is required and ticking all of the boxes.  If the parole board was meeting the individual within a year rather than two years, for example, then the person could say that he or she did not get access to counselling and the board could then apply some pressure.  I am trying here to overcome such problems and believe this amendment will make the Bill more human rights compliant, which is why I will be pressing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#M02000","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Deputy Clare Daly is right about the two year issue, which comes up again later on, but if my amendment No. 44 is accepted then-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#N00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Then amendments Nos. 45 and 46 cannot be moved-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#N00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Yes.

I know that the Government is reluctant to accept specific time limits but this goes back to the issue we discussed earlier regarding what is a &quot;reasonable&quot; timeframe and how long is a piece of string.  I understand that there is a danger that a failure on the part of the authorities to meet a timeline may give rise to a judicial review or a potential cost to the State and I can see why the Government might want to avoid it.  At the same time, I think the request here is not unreasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#N01200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I support amendment No. 41, which provides that a parole candidate may be interviewed by the parole panel, where the panel believes that is appropriate.  That seems very reasonable.  Amendment No. 42 would require a decision of a parole review to be given to the parole candidate&rsquo;s legal representative.  There is no provision in the Bill for legal representation for the purposes of the review.  The reference in the Bill to legal representation is in relation to the hearings.  I would certainly have no difficulty with legal representatives being included in section 16 of the Bill for the purpose of receiving a copy of the decision following a hearing, as proposed by Deputy Wallace in amendment No. 47.  The review stage under the Bill is an initial consideration of parole on the basis of such information and reports as the parole panel considers relevant.  These are reviewed by the panel which can then decide if parole should be granted.  If not, the parole candidate can request a full hearing under section 16 of the Bill.  I would also like to inform to the select committee that it is my intention to bring forward amendments to provide for legal aid where necessary with respect to representation at hearings.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 43 which was tabled by Deputy Wallace would require a hearing following a refusal of parole to be conducted within four weeks.  I believe that is too short a period of time in which to prepare for such a hearing.  Aside from operational difficulties this may cause the parole board with respect to gathering evidence or seeking witnesses, it might also cause difficulties for a parole candidate and his or her legal representative with respect to considering the decision following the initial review and preparing for the hearing.  I would suggest further consideration be given to this provision.<\/p> <p>  I have no difficulty with amendment No. 44.  Amendment No. 67 tabled by Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan relates to section 21 and will address the subject of amendment 44.  If amendment No. 44 is agreed, then amendment 67 provides that parole candidates will be eligible to make subsequent applications for parole after two years from the date of the most recent decision declining parole.  The parole board may also direct a shorter period than two years.  Amendments Nos. 46 and 51 from Deputy Daly are to section 16 and would require a parole candidate who is refused parole to be further considered for parole one year following that refusal.  The Bill currently provides for subsequent considerations two years following review.  However, as I have said, amendment No. 67 will allow the parole board to direct a shorter period than two years and I have a preference for proceeding with that approach.  I believe we should make statutory provision for it being done in less than two years.  I would prefer to take that route.  I would go back to the earlier point about the quality of the decision making in the first instance.  If we are satisfied with the membership of the panels and the people doing the work, including the chair and with the fact that they are giving serious consideration to each and every case and are carrying out proper risk assessments, then referring decisions back within a year might not be appropriate.  I would prefer to leave it to the discretion of the panel.  There may be outstanding issues or some reason for the panel deciding that it would like to conduct a hearing again within a shorter period and it can do that.  I believe that is a better way to proceed.  <\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 89 provides for the legal representative of the parole candidate to be notified of a hearing.  It may be the case that a legal representative has not been engaged by or appointed to the candidate.  Perhaps the amendment could be reconsidered to provide for notification to a legal representative where the candidate is represented for the purpose of a parole hearing.  That is just a technical and practical point.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#N01300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Does anyone wish to make a further contribution on this grouping of amendments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#N01400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>On the point that Deputy Wallace made about providing that the legal representative be notified, that is not necessary for a review because a review is an informal process where they just look at papers.

In that context, it is beneficial to have Deputy Wallace's proposal inserted in respect of the hearings but not in respect of the reviews.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the two year versus one year provision, the parole board is going to work in a collaborative way.

I understand absolutely that the safety of the community and the victim are of critical importance in making decisions on a person's release, but the emphasis in the paragraph is too much on the actual offence when it should be on rehabilitation, which is the whole purpose.  Of course, we have to have an assessment of the risk to victims and the community if a prisoner is released, but the section already provides that the position of the victim and any victim impact statement or submission made on behalf of the victim must be one of the board's guiding principles.  It would be despicable if someone said a prisoner who had committed an horrific crime was a great fellow in prison and should be released early, while the victim was left to think he or she had no come back.  At the same time, the whole point of prison and parole is supposed to be rehabilitation and allowing someone back into society without the risk of reoffending.  The IPRT put it well.  It stated decision-making should concentrate exclusively on the risk of a prisoner committing a serious offence if released and not engage in re-sentencing by considering the seriousness of the offence and the aggravating circumstances.  I am seeking to delete the line to avoid re-sentencing, while being very cognisant of the impact on victims and the community.  The victim impact statement is taken into account.

It is important to set it out.<\/p> <p>  Deputies Daly and Wallace are correct when they say prison is about rehabilitation but it is also about punishment.  There are many cases where people are just convicted of murder.  There are different degrees of murder.  We do not differentiate between murders under our legal system.  The factors associated with the case of somebody who is convicted of killing a group of children, as supposed to somebody who is convicted of murder committed on the spur of the moment one night with drink taken, can be taken into account.  It could be argued that the issue is to assess whether the former candidate still poses a threat but it is unrealistic to believe the parole board should not take into account the offence for which a person has been convicted.  Sometimes that may be unfair but it is relevant to the function it has to fulfil to ascertain the gravity of the offence committed.  Some offences stand out but not because of media notoriety.  The murder of five children is different from another type of criminal offence.  I am aware that this is a tricky issue.  Not to include what is proposed, however, would mean the board would not take into account the gravity of the original offence.  The reality is that, when any parole board comes to consider a case, it will ask what the individual is convicted of.

It is critical in decision-making that one knows the nature and gravity of the offence.  When I consider the cases that have come to me, I cannot think of one in which, when making a decision on release into society, I would not want to know the details on the nature and gravity of the offence or the risk to society.  I am referring to the exclusion of the nature and gravity of the offence from the list of relevant material that the board should endeavour to take into account under section 18.<\/p> <p>   Amendment 59 would make similar provision with respect to section 20.  The information in question is information that the parole board currently considers and information that parole boards traditionally considered.  To exclude the nature and gravity of the offence would be to exclude fundamental information that is essential.  The nature and gravity of the offence - the particular circumstances in which the murder or rape took place - must be known if one is making a decision on releasing somebody into society.  One also needs to consider a range of other issues.  When one examines the guiding principles in the Bill, one notes this is one of a whole series.  It is stated the board shall endeavour to take into consideration all relevant available information, including the stated reasons and recommendations of the sentencing judge.  This gives a lot of information about the context of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the person whose parole is being considered.  If the offence was committed when the prisoner was 19 and he is now 40, one needs to know what his behaviour has been like in prison, in addition to his attitude, engagement with the alcohol and drugs programmes and his engagement within prison.  One must also consider information from the trial or sentencing process.  Therefore, there is a long list of guiding principles.  The one in question is one of them but it is a very important one that should be left in the legislation.  In view of this I do not believe the amendment is a good one.<\/p> <p>  On amendment No. 54, I have already outlined my concerns with respect to the board taking into consideration an offender's plea at trial.  Moreover, I believe there should be sufficient information in the stated reasons and recommendations of the sentencing judge which are to be considered by the parole board without making specific provision to consider the offender's plea at trial.  As I said, section 19 provides that the parole board may grant release if the person being considered for parole will not present an undue risk to society and the release of the prisoner will facilitate reintegration.  I do not see how the nature of the offender's plea would inform either of these considerations.  We have discussed this.<\/p> <p>  I support amendment No. 55 as an alternative to amendments Nos. 56 and 57.  This amendment will require the board to assess the extent to which the person whose parole is being considered has been rehabilitated and is capable of being reintegrated into society.  That addresses the matters contained in the subsequent amendments from Deputies Daly and Wallace.  These are matters that are central to the way in which the board does its work at present.  I refer to all the issues associated with the potential for rehabilitation.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, the average life sentence served is approximately 18 years.  It is very clear that, in this country, we assess all those issues.  In America, for example, there are much longer sentences and one does not have an opportunity to rehabilitate.  We all know the consequences of that.  We have a good system but all the various factors need to be taken into account.  One obviously has to focus on rehabilitation but, from what I have seen, I am very confident that it is fully taken into account.<\/p> <p>  On a more general point, sections 18 and 19 would benefit from further review as there is some overlap in the guiding principles under section 18 and the factors to which the board may have regard in deciding on whether to make a parole order under section 19.  For instance, section 19(1)(a) provides that the parole board may grant parole if, in its opinion, the person being considered for parole will not present an undue risk to society and the release of the person will facilitate the reintegration of that person into society.  To take up Deputy Daly's point, reintegration is one of the factors to which the board may have regard, as set out under subsection (2) of section 18.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the drafting of section 18, consideration will also need to be given to the numbering.  There may be some stand-alone subsections.  This, however, can be accounted for in any amendments to sections 18 and 19 to bring them further into line with each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#P00300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":317,"content":"<p>If someone does something absolutely terrible, it should be dealt with up-front, at the start.

The trust is opposed to the introduction of any mandatory minimum custodial periods.  The Law Reform Commission and the Strategic Review of Penal Policy have both recommended that no new mandatory sentencing regimes be introduced.  The Law Reform Commission report on mandatory sentencing of 2013 recommends that where an offender is convicted of murder and is, therefore, sentenced to life in prison, legislation should provide that the judge may recommend a minimum term to be served by the offender.  This would deal with the issue.<\/p> <p>  Tariffs may provide clarity and reassurance to victims and to life-sentence prisoners in terms of the length of periods of imprisonment.  If tariffs are introduced where the original sentencing judge stipulates a minimum custodial period based on the gravity and circumstances of the offence, considering the nature and gravity of the offence, as in sections 18 and 19, after this period has been served may amount to re-sentencing.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Tom O'Malley of NUI has said there must be some mechanism for identifying the absolute minimum period a sentenced prisoner is required to serve before being eligible for release.

The judge factors in the nature and gravity of an offence when sentencing.  Nobody is saying that the parole board will not know what the person has been imprisoned for.  Of course the board will know the type of crime.  It must recognise the impact the original crime has had on the victim but it must also recognise the impact on the victim of its decision to release the person up for parole.  That provision is still in place.  It is important that the submissions made by the victim are taken into account.  We are trying to avoid a situation where a person has ticked all of the boxes.  Presumably, if the nature and gravity of the crime is particularly appalling then the person will have been imprisoned for quite a while.  The person will have completed their treatment and therapy, admitted they are wrong, acknowledged their crime, tried to make amends and all of the rest and yet the decision could be held back by having to specifically take into account the nature and gravity of the crime.<\/p> <p>  The parole board will take account of the nature and gravity as it is in the background.  To spell it out does not bring balance and I believe it is better to remove the clause.  A parole board is supposed to assess whether a person is ready to be reintegrated in society.  To reach that stage the person will have had to cross many barriers.

Essentially, a parole board analyses the whole situation.  It conducts a risk assessment, on behalf of society, on the possibility for rehabilitation.  It seems to me that one cannot assess the current risk unless one understands the nature of the offence that was committed in the first place and the risks factors that led to same.  The nature and gravity of the offence must, absolutely in my view, be factored into the current risk assessment.<\/p> <p>  It was mentioned that one should not go back in time because the person has served his or her sentence.  Of course one must consider the circumstances, the nature and type of the offence.  That is the reason the person is in prison in the first place - the nature and the offence.  We are talking about very serious offences.  Understanding the particular circumstances that led to the offences in the first place in my view, and from my experience, is critical in terms of deciding what the next step would be.  It is critical for the parole board when it makes an assessment.  It considers the journey that the person has undertaken and it is a journey away from the offence that he or she committed in the first place.  The nature and type of offence must be centrally involved in the decision-making.  It is one of the factors.<\/p> <p>  Many of these crimes, where crimes have been committed by people who go before the parole board - any murder, any description of any murder, any rape and any of these serious reasons why people are in prison - are going to be horrendous situations.  That is the reason the person is in prison in the first place.  It is why the person started out being in prison.  Understanding the nature and type of the offence, the circumstances, and Deputy O'Callaghan gave examples of the type circumstances one could have in terms of being associated with alcohol and drugs, then understanding the journey the person has been on in prison in regard to drugs and alcohol would be a critical part of the decision-making.<\/p> <p>  My view is that this provision should absolutely be left in the legislation.  The provision is central to the current risk assessment that one makes about the future of the person.  It is one of many factors.  The other factors have been well spelled out in the Bill.  They include rehabilitation.  They include the other areas that I have already read out such as the details about the trial and what happened at the trial.  The provision is central.  To take it out would miss an essential part of a risk assessment.  In terms of having a safe society, it would be a great disservice to remove the nature and gravity of the offence that was committed in the first place.  <\/p> <p>  As far as mandatory sentencing is concerned, Deputy Wallace, it is a totally different issue.  I happen to agree and I think most of the bodies that have examined the matter, such as the Law Reform Commission and penal reform groups, have moved away from that stance.  One often gets calls in society for mandatory sentencing.  I support the view of the Law Reform Commission and penal reform groups in terms of this matter.  It is not a matter for the parole board.

I tabled the amendment in the context that the Irish Penal Reform Trust said that a violation of conditions in the absence of a criminal offence being committed should not automatically mean the person is returned to prison.  I know Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill provides for a parole licence to be suspended if somebody is deemed to be an undue risk or if he or she has breached his or her release conditions, and that is fair enough.  A suspension of a licence is fine but to have it entirely revoked with a person being sent back to prison to serve his or her full sentence is an incredibly serious decision and it should be one that is only taken for the most serious of reasons.  It should not be automatic for the breaching a condition.  The transgression has to be serious enough for it to amount to a criminal offence for it to be considered.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 82 deals the two-years versus one-year debate regarding a person whose parole licence has been revoked.  It provides for a person whose parole licence has been revoked not having to wait two years to have a review in that he or she could have one after a period of one year.  It is worth saying that the provision my amendment seeks to amend is deemed to be not appropriate by the current parole board.  That is why we decided to examine that and it is interesting to take on board the parole board's views on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#S04300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>My comments are on the same theme.  My two amendments are similar to Deputy Daly's amendment but are worded differently.  The conditions attached should be reasonable and proportionate.  A breach in a parole order should not automatically mean a return to prison.  All relevant circumstances should be taken into consideration, including prior behaviour on licence.  A recall to prison can disrupt positive factors, which have been known to protect against reoffending, such as stable accommodation, employment, family relationships, contact with community health care and so on.  Therefore, a decision to recall a person to prison should be proportionate to the seriousness of conditions breached.<\/p> <p>  The intention must be to try to keep the individual out of prison if at all possible and that he or she would be only thrown back into it if there was no choice.

Deputies Daly and Wallace are correct in stating that serious sanctions can be imposed by the parole board.  They only arise in circumstances where conditions have been breached and the other grounds are set out in the section.  The section states that a person who is the subject of a parole order can have it revoked if he or she poses an undue risk to the safety of the community and he or she has breached his or her release conditions and the board is satisfied that the gravity of the matters outlined justify the revocation of a parole order.<\/p><p>Then there are lesser grounds for a suspension.  Either way, under section 25(4), they have an entitlement to a hearing and it is not as though one can have some arbitrary decision by the parole board stating it will revoke that person's parole order.  The person will get a hearing.  It is not feasible for it simply to be the case that they could only revoke it if the person has committed a criminal offence.  One is out on licence, to a certain extent, when one is out on parole and it is a privilege that one is being given.  It is not only if one commits a criminal offence.  One must comply with the conditions.  For instance, one of the conditions could be to stay away from a particular person.  If one starts approaching that person again, one shall have it revoked or suspended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#S04500","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 77 to section 25 would have the effect that a parole order may only be revoked if the person commits a criminal offence, as Deputy Clare Daly outlined.  Currently, the section provides that an order may be revoked if the person poses an undue risk to the safety of the community or any person - that stalking example is a good one - or persons or has breached a condition of his or her parole.  I would have very grave concerns about agreeing this amendment.  Parole is in effect conditional release.  A person knows precisely what the conditions are.<\/p> <p>  If a person was to pose an undue risk or breach a condition of his or her release, then the option of revoking the parole order must be available.  That is what it is about.  One is released on certain conditions.  It is not merely about whether one commits a further crime.  It is about all the varying conditions.  I return to the quality of the parole hearing.  If one has the proper risk assessment, one will have the proper conditions laid out in the order.<\/p> <p>  It is also the case that a person who has an order revoked is entitled, under the Bill, to a hearing following the revocation or suspension of an order.  The grounds for revocation, as set out in the Bill, are common grounds in parole practice and we should retain them.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 78 and 79 to section 20 would require any breach of conditions to be a serious breach.  The seriousness or otherwise of a breach of a condition is a matter which can be considered at the subsequent hearing.  A breach of a condition as a trigger for revocation or suspension of an order is a straightforward matter to determine.  Determining what amounts to a serious breach and who would make such a determination would introduce a subjectivity which could cause delay in what may be a high risk situation - one must keep that in mind.  Persons granted parole will be fully aware of the conditions of their release and their need to abide by those conditions.  All of that is part of the parole hearing.  It is laid out clearly.  The person will know precisely the conditions by which they must abide.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 81 is unnecessary, in my view.  There is no reason to consider that the hearing into the revocation of a parole order could amount to a renewed parole process.  It is clear from subsection (4) of section 25 that the person who is subject to the revocation of the parole order may make submissions &ndash; for the purpose of a hearing &ndash; in respect of the proposed grounds upon which it is proposed to revoke or suspend the order.<\/p> <p>  Amendment 82 was discussed in a fair bit of detail by us already.  It proposes the reduction, from two years to one year, in the subsequent period before which a person can seek to be further considered for parole.  I have already made clear my view on that.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on section 25 at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#T00200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I disagree.

I certainly do anyway.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan states it is a pleasure to be out on parole.  There is an element of that, but if one is in prison for a long time, he or she would not be used to being out.  On the idea that one might breach some of the rules because one is out, like a calf in the shed after the winter being let out into a green field of grass who behaves in a funny fashion for a while until he or she gets used to it, the prisoner, when he is released after being inside for a long time, is in a strange place.

Suspension of a licence is fair enough - I can see that - but what we are trying to say is it should be a serious criminal matter that has a person sent back to prison with his or her sentence reinstated.  I would imagine stalking and harassment are criminal matters and they would be covered under those conditions.  Obviously, that would be reprehensible and should be included.

One cannot merely have the parole board stating that the person committed a criminal offence by doing that.<\/p> <p>  I agree that it is not black and white.  I would not like it to be operated in a black and white fashion.  I am sure the parole board would not operate it as such.  If somebody gets out of prison and gets into a bit of trouble in the first while, that is not an issue on which the parole board will state that his or her parole is revoked or suspended.  It requires discretion on the part of the parole board and that is the way it will operate.  It is a serious sanction.  It would only happen, I would have thought, in exceptional circumstances.

To the T&aacute;naiste and her officials, go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go l&eacute;ir.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#V02400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#V02500","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I also thank Mr. John Costello and Mr. Shane McCarthy from the parole board for their attendance.

We were unable to deal with committee needs last week due to the heavy voting block in the D&aacute;il.  I believe there were 13 votes.  Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan had other business to attend to also.  I appeal to members in that there is important work to be addressed at that meeting.  Preceding that meeting, and as previously agreed, I remind members that a meeting with a delegation from the justice committee of the Hungarian Parliament been arranged.  It will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow in Room A in LH 2000.  Members are invited and encouraged to attend.  I am sure the whole business of it will be completed within an hour.  If they are in a position to attend, the Chairman would be most grateful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#V03400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Is it possible to go into private session?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017052400002#V03500","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1495612800,"counter":528,"content":"<p>Yes, remembering this is a select committee.
