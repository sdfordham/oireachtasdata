The Arts Council is the main mechanism through which it directs funding to the arts and artists.  The council provides significant support to individual artists through bursaries and individual grants.  It also funds means-tested payments to members of Aosd&aacute;na.  The Arts Council recently published its new strategy statement, Making Great Art Work.  The strategy sets out the council's plans to lead the development of the arts in the decade to 2025 and prioritises two policy areas, namely, the artist and public engagement.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the Irish Film Board, which my Department funds, is also a significant support for creative workers.  The film sector is also supported by the improved tax incentive system introduced by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  This year, as part of budget 2016, I was pleased to announce a 12% increase in allocations across a range of areas.  This includes additional funding to the Ireland 2016 centenary programme and a new investment programme for regional arts and cultural centres.  Significant benefits will accrue for artists and creative workers from many of the Ireland 2016 programmes supported by this additional funding, including at an international level.<\/p>  <p>  I was also particularly pleased that the Government introduced a 25% increase in the ceiling for the artists exemption from 2015 onwards.  This important measure recognises the invaluable contribution artists make to society.  The feedback available to me indicates that artists very much welcome the increase in the exemption limits.  The scheme ensures that Ireland continues to be a place where the work of artists is valued.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with other Departments to promote the cultural and creative industries within the framework of the Government's overall objectives under the Action Plan for Jobs.<\/p>  <p>  The place of artists in society has been a significant theme arising from the public consultation process I established for the development of Ireland's first national cultural policy, Culture 2025.

I understand the previous Government, which was in office up to 2011, was in a position under the Towards 2016 plan to give a commitment to the Association of Artists' Representatives Organisations, AARO, to bring forward legislation to address this particular difficulty in collective bargaining.

I attended the Dublin event, which followed the participative world caf&eacute; model and was held under the open policy debates programme in line with the Civil Service renewal plan.  I am pleased to inform the House that this event, which was held in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham, was a great occasion with a high level of engagement from those attending.  I thank all those who participated in the various consultation events, which were attended by over 600 people, and those who were involved in organising and running them.  More than 200 written submissions were received before the closing date of 31 October last.  The feedback from the regional meetings and the submissions are being examined in detail as part of the process of drafting the cultural policy.  An expert group and a steering group established by my Department and comprising a range of cultural stakeholders are also making an input into the process of consultation and drafting.  I intend that Culture 2025 will be a high level and living document that will set out the framework of cultural policy for the next decade.  I propose to submit it to the Government shortly with the intention of publishing it early in the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800012#K00700","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1449586200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Is this document going to be published before the general election, while the Minister is still in her current position?
