There have been at least three extremely high profile events in which there has been Central Bank intervention.  One is the finding of the &euro;70 million gap in Royal &amp;amp; Sun Alliance which is without a proper explanation at this stage.  While the Central Bank's involvement is not clear, we need to get to the bottom of it.  It opens the much wider question of how many other insurance companies are involved in the sort of practices we suspect are going on elsewhere and which have a major effect on profits.<\/p><p>  The second issue is the takeover of Newbridge Credit Union by Permanent TSB.  That was initiated, led and directed by the Central Bank.  In that case there is direct Government involvement in which we will certainly be looking for value for money because of the relationship between Permanent TSB and the State.<\/p><p>  In recent days news has broken of the credit card issue, where again the Central Bank is the regulator.  I am talking about the regulator coming in in all three cases.  An enormous number of questions need to be answered in all of them.  We need to know if the Central Bank is doing its job properly and what it is doing in all three cases and generally.  We need to ensure these types of problem are not spreading throughout the three industries involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400003#B00300","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1384423200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The committee's role is to get value for the public purse.

It would be appropriate to call in the Governor of the Central Bank at this time.<\/p><p>  I wish to raise another issue on the State's procurement practices.  As members will know, there is a new office for centralised procurement and a move under way to save substantial moneys for the public purse, which is welcome.  However, there are some issues of concern about certain sectoral competitions.  I am thinking specifically about the stationery contract for schools and academic institutions.  I have acquainted myself with some of the issues involved, which are quite serious.  I would go so far as to say there is a real possibility that far from saving money in some instances, this centralised procurement arrangement might prove costly.  There are concerns about quality, proper invoicing and predatory pricing.  I intend to write to the Cathaoirleach officially on the matter, but I am taking the opportunity to flag the matter as an issue of concern that would most appropriately be examined by the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400003#B00500","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1384423200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I will deal with the first item, Deputy Shane Ross's request.  The Central Bank is not accountable directly to us, unless the Comptroller and Auditor General carries out a report.  Therefore, we would not normally ask its representatives to appear before the committee; we are precluded from bringing them before it.  However, I agree with the Deputy that a considerable amount of taxpayers' money is now being directed towards saving institutions.  In some way the Committee of Public Accounts needs to have some overview or input into the conversation on these matters because they may come before us for consideration in years to come.  Why not do it now when the issues are live in order to express concern?  The electorate expresses concern, as do members.  While I understand the accountability role, we need to have some input.  Perhaps we should ask the clerk to follow up on Deputy Shane Ross's proposal.  We should ask him to find some way of bringing in the regulator, representatives of the bank or whoever it might be to discuss these issues.  We might also call in departmental officials who would be directly responsible in terms of their accountability for taxpayers' money; that is from where the money comes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400003#B00600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384423200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I shall pursue the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400003#B00700","nonspeaker":"Clerk to the Committee"},{"type":"speech","time":1384423200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his response.

Correspondence was received on 7 November from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, on the need to review the legal code and investigate processes with regard to white collar crime.  This correspondence arose from proceedings at a previous meeting.  I ask committee members to note this correspondence and perhaps we might examine it in the context of the bank stabilisation report which is being concluded.<\/p><p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 8 November 2013, from Mr. Martin Whelan of NAMA on the involvement of NAMA in Mill Shopping Centre, Clondalkin.  The correspondence is to be noted.<\/p><p>  No. 3A.3 is correspondence, dated 12 November 2013, from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing information requested at the meeting of 3 October.  The correspondence is to be noted.  It was only received yesterday and is now on the agenda.  I propose that it be published, but some of the answers are not answers.  It is quite appalling that it took so long for the Department to respond to us and, in my opinion, the information contained in some of the answers is simply not good enough.  We should consider it more fully at our next meeting.  I will give members the opportunity to read the correspondence and look at the questions asked and the replies given.  They should bear in mind the length of time it took to provide us with the replies and that some of the questions have not been answered.  Deputy Sean Fleming raised this issue at our last meeting.  I propose to include it for discussion at our next meeting before the witnesses come before us and include with it the minutes we receive from the Department to examine the quality of the answers given.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated 5 November 2013, from Augustus Cullen Solicitors for Marie O&rsquo;Sullivan regarding The Warrens Wicklow Hostel.  The correspondence is to be noted.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.2 is correspondence received on 7 November from an anonymous source regarding consultancy fees of &euro;186 million paid by AIB in 2011.  The correspondence is to be noted.  This is not a matter for the committee.  As AIB is 99% owned by the State, we will send it to the Department of Finance for its view on the use of consultants, how they were paid and the tender process involved.  While it is not specifically a matter for the committee, it is similar to the question raised by Deputy Shane Ross.  We should insist on a full and comprehensive answer from the Department of Finance on these issues because taxpayers' money is involved.  There is no point in examining the matter long after the event.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence, dated 16 November 2013, from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, on complaints made to the Minister in 2008 by Councillor Padge Reck.  The correspondence is to be noted and a copy forwarded to Councillor Reck.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.4 is correspondence, dated 23 October 2013, from an anonymous source on governance issues at the Institute of Technology, Tralee.  The correspondence is to be noted and a copy forwarded to the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority for appropriate follow-up and a note on the action taken in dealing with the matter.  I propose that we invite people involved in the sector because we have received a number of complaints about institutes of technology.  An issue in one institution was raised in the House yesterday by a Deputy who will be writing to us about it.  Perhaps we might examine the correspondence collectively as a unit.  We will produce a report on Waterford Institute of Technology and it may be opportune to bring in the complaints we have received about the institutes of technology and include a commentary on them in the report.<\/p><p>  No. 3C is documents related to today&rsquo;s meeting.  No. 3C.1 is correspondence received on 11 November from Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin, Secretary General, Department of Health regarding a report on medical cards and matters to be considered at this meeting.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  <\/p><p>  No. 3C.2 is correspondence received on 11 November from Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin, Secretary General, Department of Health, on briefing material on matters to be considered at this meeting.

The correspondence is to be noted and published.  <\/p><p>  No. 3C.4 is correspondence received on 13 November from Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin including his opening statement.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.<\/p><p>  No. 4 is reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting on 24 October.  No. 4.1 is the annual report from Pobal, while No. 4.2 concerns the local government fund.  These items are to be noted.  Pobal allocated money to the Tipperary hostel, which is a question which is to come before us again.  We should ask it about the money it allocated and perhaps obtain information from the other agencies on the amounts allocated by them to this project and examine the company now in charge on whether it is sustainable with reference to the accounts.<\/p><p>  The work programme is on screen.  I propose that we meet the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, on 6 February 2014 to examine its financial statements for 2012.  We are finalising a date with Professor Niamh Brennan in respect of the DDDA Glass Bottle site.  As soon as we agree a date, she will appear before us.<\/p><p>  No. 6 is other business.  The agenda for the meeting on Thursday, 21 November is that at 10 a.m. we will meet representatives of the National Gallery of Ireland to examine the 2012 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General - chapter 15, staff appointments at the National Gallery of Ireland, and Vote 34 - National Gallery of Ireland.

The scheme currently helps in providing medical support to an estimated 43% of the population.<\/p><p>  The cost of the scheme in 2012 was &euro;1.7 billion, accounting for approximately 12.5% of the Health Service Executive's total expenditure.  The scheme's costs increased from &euro;937 million in 2003 to &euro;1.7 billion in 2012, an increase of 85%.  The number of cards in issue increased by more than 70% in that period and the estimated average cost of a card increased by about one fifth.<\/p><p>  Eligibility for a medical card is, in the main, determined by a means test based on the applicant's income, taking account of certain relevant household outgoings.  The HSE also has discretion to award a card if not doing so would result in undue hardship.  Medical cards are normally valid for three or four years.  Subject to continuing eligibility, cards are renewed upon expiration.  Eligibility is determined either by way of a full case review by the HSE or through self-assessment by the card holder.<\/p><p>  Our examination was carried out to assess the adequacy of controls over the initial award of cards and the process of review of cards in issue.  The level of ineligible card holding was also examined.  Shortcomings were identified in the application of controls in 8% of a sample of 2012 medical cards approved.  In 4% of cases, medical cards had been approved in circumstances where the available evidence suggested that the applicant had not satisfied eligibility criteria.  In the other cases, no documentation or inadequate documentation of outgoings had been provided.  Additional guidance and staff training, as well as more formal supervisory reviews of medical card approvals, should ensure that prescribed controls are applied.<\/p><p>  Approximately 5% of new cards are awarded on discretionary grounds, taking account of the individual's economic and social circumstances and the level of illness and related costs.  A review of cards awarded on a discretionary basis identified opportunities for improving the information supplied by general practitioners, GPs, to allow the HSE to assess the individual's normal medical costs.<\/p><p>  Administration of medical card scheme processing was centralised in June 2011.  A significant backlog in the processing of applications and renewal notices had emerged by the end of 2011.  The HSE introduced a number of initiatives to deal with the backlog and to prevent further backlogs from occurring.  This included extending the self-assessment basis for the renewal of cards, allowing GPs to amend the medical card database in certain circumstances and extending eligibility for one year for some categories of card holders due for renewal in 2012.<\/p><p>  In 2012, the HSE issued approximately 366,000 renewal notices.  In 70% of cases, the applicant was asked only to confirm that the relevant circumstances had not changed.  In the remaining cases, a full review of eligibility, comparable with an initial application, was conducted.<\/p><p>  Overall, 10.7% of card holders had not responded to the renewal notices by May 2013 and their medical cards had lapsed as a result.  A further 1.9% of cards were not renewed because it was found the card holders had died.  Of the remainder, more than 94% had their eligibility confirmed as before or were awarded full medical cards instead of their previous GP visit cards.  Some 1.7% had their eligibility reduced from a full medical card to a GP visit card and 4% were deemed not to have eligibility for either form of card.<\/p><p>  During 2012, the HSE also reviewed 40,000 cards where card holders had not accessed medical services for periods of 12 months or more.  Eligibility was removed in just under 40% of these cases.  While these cases had not recently resulted in payments for prescriptions or other items, capitation payments to their GPs would have been incurred.<\/p><p>  Overall, the available evidence suggests there is a material level of ineligibility of card holding in the medical card system.  However, the financial implication of that ineligibility has not been established.  In 2012, the HSE engaged consultants to review excess payments within the medical card scheme.  They estimated that excess expenditure could be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;210 million per year.  However, that review was limited in scope as it was conducted on the basis of a review of reports, rather than a detailed analysis of the database.  The review concluded that a more reliable estimate would require detailed analysis of the medical card database.<\/p><p>  The HSE has not yet developed an estimate of the level of excess payments in the medical card system.  Based on our examination findings, I have recommended that the HSE initiate a cyclical programme of reviews of eligibility in respect of random samples of card holders.  This would allow a reliable baseline estimate of the scale of excess payments to be identified.  Tracking changes in the levels of excess payments would allow the HSE to evaluate the effectiveness of its overall control strategy and to identify the key drivers of excess payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400005#D01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1384424400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I now ask Dr. McLoughlin to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400005#D01300","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384424400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to assist in the examination of Chapter 22 - eligibility for medical cards.

I am also aware that members of the committee have received the briefing material which has been the subject of briefings in the Oireachtas this week.  I will, therefore, be brief in my opening statement.<\/p><p>  Eligibility for a medical card or a GP visit card is determined on the basis of an assessment of financial means.  If an applicant's means are above the financial thresholds set out in the national guidelines, the HSE examines for any indication of circumstances, medical or social, which might result in undue financial hardship.  Eligibility may be granted on a discretionary basis if these circumstances are such that a person cannot access general practitioner or other medical services without undue financial hardship.  There can be a significant crossover between social and medical circumstances and applications do not fall discretely into these specific categories.  The process whereby the application of discretion may be considered includes a review by HSE medical officers led by a principal medical officer.<\/p><p>  Almost 2 million people are covered by either a medical card or a GP visit card.  This means that 43% of the population have medical cards or GP visit cards, with the number of people with eligibility having increased by 74% since January 2005.  The HSE continues to make significant progress in the reconfiguration of this key component of national health infrastructure.  The medical card centralisation project which commenced in 2011 has been successfully delivered.  Medical card processing is now carried out, with single national governance, at a central office location, compared with 100 locations in the past.  Customer service processes, assessment of applications and reviews, correspondence and the application of discretion are now operated in a consistent and equitable manner across the country.<\/p><p>  Turnaround performance in processing medical card applications is reported online each week.  This reporting confirms that the HSE continues to surpass the turnaround rate of 90% processed at 15 days.  For example, as of 14 October, more than 96% of complete applications had been processed in 15 days.  It is important to stress that eligibility for a medical card is founded on the undue financial hardship test.  The HSE must operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Act, while also responding to the financial, medical and social circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.  In parallel with a focus on service provision and improvements in customer service and efficiency, the HSE is also focused on its public accountability role in the overall management of the medical card scheme.  New legislation passed in March created the legal basis for the sharing of records with Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  This will allow for further improvements in the management of the medical card system and offers an additional assurance that medical card eligibility continues to be provided for people appropriately in line with the national assessment guidelines for eligibility.<\/p><p>  The availability to the HSE of data indicating changes in a medical card holder's circumstances such as change in employment status, income levels and a change in eligibility for Department of Social Protection schemes will inform the HSE in focusing reviews on subsets of the register to identify clients who may no longer be eligible.  The introduction of these additional controls will strengthen the risk management framework for the scheme.  I assure members that the assessment arrangements are designed to ensure people who are eligible for either a medical card or a GP visit card receive it quickly and efficiently and equally to ensure those who are not eligible to receive or retain a medical card do not.<\/p><p>  Each month the HSE analyses the medical card register to identify those medical card-GP visit cards which are scheduled for review within three months.  We have increased this timeline to four months in respect of those clients who were granted eligibility on the basis of discretion in order to allow an additional month to ensure all pertinent medical and other data are provided for inclusion in the assessment process.  All customers scheduled for review are notified and a process of either full reviews or self-assessments is conducted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384425600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Thank you.

As Deputies on the ground, we know a major issue for constituents is the discretionary medical card.  Having read the material provided, it can be said about people with discretionary medical cards without fear of contradiction that they are seriously ill, as they would not have qualified for the discretionary medical card otherwise.  In other words, these people got discretionary medical cards on medical grounds because of a serious illness.  Based on the information provided, since the start of the year 45,000 medical cards have been withdrawn, and of those 10,400 were discretionary.  Is that analysis correct?  This is based on a publication provided by Dr. McLoughlin which gives the total number of medical cards.  The review indicated 45,000 medical cards were withdrawn, with 9,981 not reviewed, 3,992 people deceased, 35,733 people who did not reply, and 5,803 cards which expired before the review was over.  The period is January to September this year.  On 1 January this year there were 63,136 discretionary medical cards in place and as of 1 October this year, there were 52,733.  The reduction is in the order of 10,393, or 16%.  The number of discretionary cards at the end of September comprised approximately 0.3% of overall medical cards.

In the cases that have come across my desk many of them are disabled children or children with Down's syndrome.  They would have had medical cards since birth or from the first year of their lives.  I am talking about the system; this is not personal.  It is an important issue.  Let us say a person has Down's syndrome and he or she is offered a long-term illness card under the mental handicap heading, a term that must be changed as it has been used since 1970.  It is outdated and I have major problems with it.  Let us consider the conditions that invariably occur with a child who has Down's syndrome.  Up to 90% of such children have asthma, 70% to 80% suffer from hearing loss, while 80% to 90% will have heart conditions, yet when they receive the long-term illness card, they are not covered for any of these.  Does that make sense, given all the time it takes to administer these 6,324 applications for people who are seriously ill, have had medical cards for the past ten years and are a vulnerable group?  We are dealing with their parents who are under extraordinary pressure.  In some cases, they do not have the time to put together what is needed for an application, but if they are offered a long-term illness card, it will not cover virtually all of the conditions from which their child is suffering.  Along with this, when a review was carried out of a cohort of 428,682 and 9% of these, nearly 36,000, did not reply, is it value for money to chase down the discretionary medical card scheme for this small cohort of 6,324 people?  They account for a minute percentage of the GMS cards issued.  There are up to 1.9 million cards issued; perhaps, therefore, it would be better value to carry out a review of these categories.  The point is that this is a group of people who received medical cards because there was a serious illness from the start.  I am trying to see the logic of it and whether there is a need to change the system to deal with this issue.  It all dates back to 1970.  Will Mr. O'Brien address that issue?

As I said in my opening remarks, just as our function is to ensure there are no medical cards in force for which people are not eligible, it is equally our function - the communications strategy in place is has been designed this way - to ensure those who are eligible receive medical cards.  The figure of &euro;113 million does not change the eligibility criteria.  It will lead us to a continuation and extension of the fair process in place to ensure by way of a review people will continue to be eligible; that if they are eligible, they will have the medical card to which they are entitled and if they are not so entitled, they will not.

The law has not changed.  The law has been in existence since 1970.  Katie Connolly is five years old, which puts her date of birth in 2008.  She was granted the medical card with due regard and in accordance with that legislation.  The judgment was that, given the seriousness, complexity and lifetime nature of the child's medical condition, and notwithstanding the parents' income, the child warranted a full medical card.  However, she now finds herself with no medical card cover at all.  She does not even have a GP-only card.  The legislation has not changed, the family and the child have not changed and the only variable in the scenario is policy.  With the greatest of respect to Mr. McLoughlin, I do not accept the assertion to the contrary.  It would make the committee appear utterly foolish if we were to accept that line.  It is not true.<\/p><p>  Moving from the particular to the general, if we were minded to do a forensic trawl of the 6,324 cases in which people who had previously enjoyed a discretionary card were found not to be eligible, we would most likely find that the same scenario arises.  People with serious illnesses of a long-term nature were granted medical cards under the legislation by the same authorities now find themselves with no medical card cover.  I am not asking Mr. McLoughlin to defend this.  He does not make the policy calls; the Minister does.

In the pre-PCRS time, we had a lot of local schemes being administered, by and large, on a stand-alone basis, for which we came in for very heavy criticism from the political system and the Ombudsman at the time.  There was a sense of bewilderment at how somebody could get a medical card in Cork but not in Kilkenny or in Donegal, but not in Wexford.  We had to deal with that, which we did, in a way that established a standard consistent system of application with a single rule set and a process for assessing hardship in a consistent manner with standard operating procedures - essentially, all of the good practices one would expect in a statutory national scheme from a public body.  We now have that in place.<\/p><p>  The consequences of that change are throwing up the type of cases to which the Deputy referred.  As I said, thankfully, the number is quite small.  We are working with each of those to try to provide supports around them.  One of the things that became very clear to me from talking to the medical officers is that they actually take into account the fact people qualify for other services, such as the long-term illness card, and supports under the Disability Act, which can be quite significant, in some instances, for people, irrespective of whether they have a medical card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400011#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hennessy"},{"type":"speech","time":1384428000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I appreciate the process was centralised.

We took action on our communications strategy in acknowledgement of the considerable amount of controversy and genuine anxiety and concern the announcement of the review provoked.  The intention of our response was to explain, to clarify and to improve people's understanding of the operation of the medical card scheme in order to alleviate some of their anxiety and concern.  In terms of the elements of the communications plan, Mr. Burke and his colleagues in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, introduced an additional control, particularly for people who already held discretionary cards.  That is an important measure which allows us to capture the most up-to-date information on the circumstances of all cases before final decisions are taken.  That control is now in place.<\/p><p>  The second element  of the communications strategy involved public advertisements, an enhanced helpline and website enhancements, including a new video.  I would encourage all Deputies to look at the video on our website if they get a chance.  It is not lengthy, at approximately eight minutes, but is quite informative.  We are working on a frequently-asked questions leaflet for medical cards which will be ready in about two weeks and will go to all local offices, GP surgeries and hospitals as well as being circulated to public representatives.  We have embarked on a range of meetings and briefing sessions with voluntary and advocacy groups.  We have also embarked on a number of briefings in the political system through the local health fora.  <\/p><p>  The third element of the communications plan involved a re-working of our written communications.  We came in for some criticism for the tone and language used in some of our written communications with the public.  A review of the notification letters, in particular, is underway.  The language is being personalised and we are enhancing the information that is provided for applicants, particularly with regard to the range of entitlements to services that people have which do not require a medical card.  That might help to reassure people that losing their medical card is not necessarily a catastrophic event, given that a range of other services and entitlements is still available to them.  <\/p><p>  The final element concerns the issue of discretion.  We are trying to explain that discretion is still available but that it is now being applied in a consistent, fair and equitable manner.  Medical officers are involved in the process and carry out individual, case-by-case assessments.  They pick up the phone and speak to the applicant's GP or consultant, as necessary.  Obviously, the ultimate objective is to ensure the people who need a card get one but the scheme operates within the confines of the statute and the resources available to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400013#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hennessy"},{"type":"speech","time":1384428900,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hennessy for that helpful response.

I note the Comptroller and Auditor General in points 22.6 to 22.8, inclusive, of the report on eligibility for medical cards refers to an inconsistency between regions and that eligibility for medical cards was not consistent.  Can we call a spade a spade and clarify what this means?  Is it the luck of the draw?  If one lived in County Limerick and had a certain condition, one might have been granted a medical card on the grounds of discretion, whereas in County Donegal, discretion may have been applied separately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400013#M00600","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384429200,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Variation existed at the regional and even at the micro-regional level.

There are additional payments for annual, sick, maternity, paternity and study leave to GPs but they must provide the name and ID of a Locum to avail of it.  Certain subsidies are given for GP practice secretaries and nurses but they must provide, P35s and PPS numbers of the persons employed.  All of that expenditure is controlled.  Some time ago we identified trends in the GP out of hours service or special services with which we were not happy.  We challenged the GP community and in cases where we were not satisfied with a trend, we did not make a payment.  It was not a question of making a payment and looking to claim it back.  We unilaterally did not make a payment.  We negotiated with the GPs on the ambiguities that constitute a claim in an out of hours setting, and after a mediated process we have agreed with GPs and advised them on the explicit definition.  In the cases in which we had challenged the GPs and had not made the payments, we asked them to make a case on the validity of the claim as part of the mediated process.  In some cases we offered settlements.  If we were satisfied that the claims for out of hours services were valid and could verify them, we made a payment.

To safeguard the individual, we agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation and GPs, that if we had written to a client twice and if our address was wrong, when the client approached the GP, the GP could then move their eligibility for three moths to give them the opportunity to talk to the HSE.

That brings me to my next difficulty.  I will give an example of what is happening in many organisations around the country.  I think I gave notice of my wish to discuss this case.  A service provider in my constituency, Sunbeam House Services, which is bound by the Haddington Road agreement was told to make a submission on what its savings would be under the agreement.  It made a submission stating its savings would be approximately &euro;77,000.  I fully accept that it would be irresponsible of me, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, and irresponsible of the chief financial officer not to challenge all figures.  The HSE actually reduced the budget of the service provider in question by &euro;189,461, rather than &euro;77,000.  The difference between the two figures - a mammoth &euro;112,000 - had a massive impact on services, including the suspension of transport services.  Owing to the Rosetta system, reductions were not possible in some areas because these categories were not eligible.  To its credit, the HSE came back and returned some of the money, but why was it taken in the first place?  I expect organisations that know they are covered under the Haddington Road agreement to make the savings and they expect to make them.

I would say that refers to the purpose for which they are intended in the future.

It is not an easy task but it is absolutely essential for the health service.  It will start with the simple fact of systemising the accounts and bringing them all to one truth, as we like to say.

In response to your comment about administration staff, it is important as well to take into consideration the back office issues, 60% of my finance team produce information and that should be down at 20% or 30%.  That is necessary because with the systems we have we report in different formats, by region, care group etc.  The process has started.

I have one question about discretionary medical cards.  I note that approximately 5.5% of medical cards are awarded on a discretionary basis.  Mr. O'Brien gave some explanation as to how the HSE decides on discretionary cards.  This issue was raised at my party's parliamentary party meeting and there was considerable anger expressed by certain Deputies over the fact that those decisions on discretionary medical cards were not made locally because at a local level people can be much more aware of the actual situation of the individuals and families concerned.  A further note of anger which I want to convey to the witnesses is that when dealing with the office in Finglas which makes the decisions, it is not possible to deal with the same person when discussing an ongoing case.  It would be much more satisfactory if the process is being administered centrally that at least one was able to deal with the same person on any subsequent discussion.  This is part of the same issue.  Could such decisions be made at local level?  If they have to be made at central level, could one at least be able to deal with the same person rather than have to deal with different people all the time?  One of the problems of centralising everything is that the patient is faceless.  That is one of the biggest problems with public service and the Civil Service, that if one is not dealing with people on a face-to-face basis, it is very easy to forget that they are human beings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400019#S00900","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384432200,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I will answer that question and Mr. Patrick Burke will also contribute.

For that reason and as part of our current initiative we intend to strengthen the information and support available at local health centres and to provide an opportunity for people to be able to walk in and to discuss any problem with the application or with the application of discretion.

Unfortunately, there was such resistance to centralisation from every quarter that we decided to centralise first and standardise and apply probity as we proceeded.  We all know the result of that, namely, that we were obliged to deal with the backlog that arose in the latter part of 2011 and early in 2012.  As we move forward with the centralised operation, we have already built in links with the Revenue Commissioners and we are establishing them with the Department of Social Protection and general practitioners.  The new system is much more amenable to control.  As we communicate with our clients, we are seeking to ensure that they know what is expected of them.

It is manifestly clear that there is a commonly held belief that discretionary medical cards have been granted, should be granted or are granted in the context of the mere existence of a medical condition.  This is a widely held perception which is only really being challenged now in terms of the public understanding of it.  Indeed, this perception has been reflected to some extent during these proceedings.  It also seems clear that there is a widely held misconception to the effect that because these cards - like credit cards - include an expiry date, once one qualified when one applied, one has an entitlement up to that expiry date.  By means of the centralisation, standardisation and communications processes, we are clarifying what constitutes true eligibility.  We were asked earlier about the cost-benefit balance and the amount of resources we invest.  In circumstances in which we genuinely do not believe - unless a barn-door case appears - that there is any prospect of being able to prove that someone set out, with criminal intent, to falsely obtain a medical card, we do not take action.  The resources we would be obliged to allocate in order to follow up every instance in which a person is identified as having held a medical card when it was clear that they should not have had one would be completely disproportionate to the benefit.  Our resources are much better deployed in ensuring that medical cards are held appropriately.  Where they are not so held, it is probably because someone has exceeded the threshold probably without even realising it.  At that point, we end their eligibility.<\/p><p>  As we move forward with the process and reach a point at which we expect that people should have a better understanding and at which we have communicated with them clearly, we will be seeking to do two things in circumstances in which we can prove retrospectively that someone has falsely obtained a medical card.  The first of these is to ensure that the matter is referred to the appropriate authorities with regard to the offence committed, in respect of which there is a small fine.  The second is that in the context of the greater amount of money involved - namely, the cost to the public purse through capitation fees, free entitlement to medications, etc. - in providing that medical card, we might well be in a position to consider taking civil action to recover that cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400021#U03900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384434000,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Since the Act of 1974 - was that the year of the Act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400022#V00200","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384434000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>It was 1970.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400022#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1384434000,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Since the 1970 Act the organisation has not done anything to anybody or has not referred the Act to anybody who was failed to volunteer in this respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400022#V00400","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384434000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Patrick Burke like to take that question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400022#V00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384434000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>In fairness, if the Deputy wants to go back to 1970, he will find across those decades that there were times when individual health boards challenged individuals and referred things to the appropriate authorities.

I welcome also that it is getting control of the vast bulk of the applications but if I filled the Gallery this morning with people who had their medical cards taken from them or who found out their medical cards were taken from them, they would not believe what they were hearing from Mr. Hennessy.  There are cases which I do not want to go through one by one but rather I will give Mr. Hennessy two extreme examples, and they represent quite a number of people who have turned up at my clinic, and I am sure is the case elsewhere.  The son of a 91 year old woman went to the chemist to get the medication and was told he could not have it because the medical card has been cut off.  I have raised this with the HSE already.<\/p><p>  The second case involved a woman undergoing cancer treatment for a second time who applied for a medical card but was turned down.  The reason I raise that particular case is because Mr. Hennessy has done something else in regard to the medical cards.  When someone applies for a medical card and is refused, he or she is entitled to a review or an appeal or may go for a review and automatically go to appeal subsequently.  I have seen letters issued from the HSE telling people who asked for a review or an appeal that because they have offered no new evidence they will not be granted the review or appeal.  That is quite different from what I have experienced with the system previously because in any decision the wrong decision may have been made.<\/p><p>  I have attended meetings with general practitioners who have complained bitterly that they are being forced to write letter after letter to the HSE in support of an applicant who is entitled to the medical card but who for some reason is not getting their message across.  Consultants who are now being asked for letters by patients to support their application are becoming annoyed that they are being drawn into a whole bureaucracy that they simply not cannot afford to manage in their day's work.<\/p><p>  Has the HSE consulted with the GPs on this issue, the changes to the medical cards for children under five or GP cards because their complaints are that they are stressed by much of what is being imposed on them?  I would like Mr. Hennessy's views on the review and appeal system.  For those patients who are waiting for an application, a review or an appeal there should be a process in place whereby the card is kept open until such time as they are refused and are outside the system following a review or an appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013111400024#X00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384435200,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I will reply briefly on that and I might ask Mr. Burke to take us through the detail on the process as well.

As the director general has said, there is one medical card.  As we assess an individual we may have to exercise discretion.  In some circumstances we will have to involve our medical officers to look at medical or other circumstances that are being brought to bear.  As our medical officers across the country looked at material presented to us on foot of an application we found absolute differences with people making applications.  In terms of what we did, in some cases applicants would get a letter from their GP.  We sought to standardise that.  We engaged over a period of a year talking to general practice and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, about how we would have a standard form on which GP to GP could communication and set out tritely the type of information our medical officers would have to allow them assess eligibility.  I have already said it was difficult to get that agreement from general practice because in some cases where an individual is looking for a medical card they may well be losing the private patient.  We have pushed the point that we simply want general practitioners to help an individual work through their application.<\/p><p>  We have sat down with GPs.  We have put forward, as agreed by our medical panel, a standard form that could be communicated, not near administration but GP to GP, setting out the medical circumstances we want as an aid to the applicant in pursuing their application and having whatever discretion needed to be brought to bear.  Those are the circumstances in that regard.<\/p><p>  Regarding the schedule, we agree a schedule with an applicant.  An applicant makes an application to us.  We provide back a detail of what we believe to be their outgoings and their income, and we try to agree that schedule.  I mentioned already that we have issued close to 1 million of those.  In conversations with other TDs yesterday they made the point about making it more granular.  We are making it more granular but it might be no harm if I read into the record the first or second paragraph of the letter that will go out to people today.  This is where an individual has not been successful.

He said at the December GAERC meeting the work for the next European Council will be set out and he listed the agenda items.  Energy is the last item on the list.  An issue came up in conversation with friends recently that is troubling.  While we all support green energy, emission policies and the reduction in emissions it is disturbing that Europe will now be in a disadvantaged position compared to America which is continuing with a policy position that is not based on the same decisions.  For example, shale fracking is taking place there.  They are using traditional energy sources with great success and acquiring it cheaply.  Will that not greatly disadvantage Europe in the future?  If China and other major landmasses across the world are ignoring the dangers of emissions and the greenhouse gas effect, and Europe is the only area adhering to such a policy, while it is a morally sustainable position will it not put us at a huge disadvantage in terms of economic development?  I am interested in a comment from the Minister of State on the matter and how we square that circle.  The matter will require much consideration in the future.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State referred to Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s persistent raising of indigenous manufacturing.  I presume he will wish to comment himself.  I support his view that while it is very important to develop our IT sector, as there is much activity in that regard, that there is room for traditional manufacturing.  We might have taken our eye off the ball in that regard.  I was interested in the importance the Minister of State attached to the issue in his introductory remarks.  Could he comment further?  How does he envisage such development in this country and across Europe?  What could we do to get ourselves more actively involved in manufacturing?  We have a cohort of young people who are not able to get into the IT sector because they do not have the competencies, interest or aptitude.  Many young people were displaced from construction and traditional manufacturing could appeal to them.  I would be interested in hearing a comment from the Minister of State on the matter.<\/p><p>  My constituency colleague, Senator Reilly, has done much personal work which I happily acknowledge, on the youth guarantee scheme.  How is that proceeding?  Is the Minister of State confident that we can get it implemented and that we will get enough money from Europe to introduce and sustain it?  There is the greatest requirement and moral imperative on all of us to do something about youth unemployment.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State referred to SME financing in the agenda items.  Any of us who do constituency work know it is an enormous issue.  Will he comment on how optimistic he is that we will get something practical in place or get a return so that by this time next year an SME could more readily access cash than is the case today?  That is an important issue.

I am proud  we are sitting here as a collective dealing with European affairs against the backdrop of the announcement by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste that Ireland will see the troika leave on 15 December and that we will no longer be seeking extra financial supports.  As this is the Irish European affairs committee, it is important to convey not only to the Irish public but to the European public, and particularly to those other countries facing financial constraints and difficulties, that Ireland is extremely proud of that, notwithstanding the obligations placed on the sovereign by the European Union vis-&agrave;-vis the Central Bank to carry the buck for the bankers.  Although it was unfair, this country has done a remarkable job in two and a half years and I want the message to go out to our European partners that Ireland has succeeded in regaining its sovereignty, that it is proud it has regained its sovereignty, and that it is happy to work alongside other countries in distressed financial straits with a view to reunifying the European project around fiscal stability. I am extremely proud, after two and a half years of difficulties for this country, that in December we can raise the tricolour for the second time under the new Republic.<\/p><p>  As I am a member of the foreign affairs committee, many of the issues I will touch on have an international context.  The Chairman mentioned the discussions with Turkey.  I strongly support the Turkish and the Ukrainian relationship with Europe and I ask the Minister to outline how matters progressed at the conference on 5 November.  The 22nd chapter was being opened with Turkey and I would advocate strongly that we should continue to show Turkey this country's commitment to its efforts in involving itself in a greater way with Europe.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister of State to give me an update on Ukraine, and what we read in the newspapers is positive in that regard.  The problem for Ukraine is that Tymoshenko - a name that rolls off everybody's lips - was reputed to have done an unsustainable deal on energy with the Russians that bankrupted Ukraine.  The issues of energy and Ukraine go hand in glove.  Given the pressures Russia is applying on the peripheral states, be it Moldova, Ukraine or Armenia - it twisted the arms of the Armenians so much that I understand Armenia has pulled out of its developments with Europe - can we take it the Ukrainian Government is attempting to progress matters but it is under phenomenal pressure from Russia, which has threatened them - these are the winter months in Ukraine - that if it developed the relationship and does not adhere to the customs union the Russians want, it will cut off supplies?  I ask that the Minister be sympathetic to the conditions prevailing in Ukraine and the pressures it is under.<\/p><p>  I welcome that Albania is about to engage in the accession process.  Having been to Albania, I was most impressed by its rate of development, given its history and its isolation in the past.  It also should be encouraged.<\/p><p>  The key areas and the challenges the European Council will have to confront are very interesting.  The migration flows issue is coming very much into focus, particularly in the Mediterranean regions.  In terms of the different roles, which I do not fully understand, is Frontex the agency of the European Union that will control migration?  Is the Minister happy that it is sufficiently resourced?  Could he explain Frontex's different functions with the European External Action Service because in the future we will have the debate about military security?  We saw that the French had to act alone in going into Mali to release prisoners.  I know that piracy and kidnapping in Africa, involving captains of ships, is common.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that we can play a sufficient role with our partners in identifying the threats made against European interests by these pirates?<\/p><p>  The youth guarantee is the key issue.  The Minister of State might have some information but I understand the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, was in Europe discussing the youth guarantee.  I hear figures of &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million may be available here to target youth projects.  Will the Minster confirm the approximate figure?  I believe the ballpark figure for Europe is &euro;6 billion.  Has the Minister any idea of the type of funding Ireland might be able to claim of that &euro;6 billion?<\/p><p>  I refer to the Minister's contribution.  One of the main priorities of the coming year is modernising public administration.  I do not know whether that is in reference to European or Irish public administration.  We have just gone through two and a half years of the bailout and we had to restructure our entire society.  Will the Minister of State tell me, under the modernisation of public administration as a priority aspect, if there is a view that Irish public administration is in further need of modernisation?  Can the Minister give us a hint as to the area of modernisation that is required?  I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111400006#E00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1384440000,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his attendance and for his comprehensive report of the previous meeting.<\/p><p>  I wish to focus on a couple of points.  To what extent has the EU studied the areas most likely to contribute to economic recovery throughout the Union, particularly in terms of extended and increased employment?  We all remember being told eight or nine years ago that the future would be the digital economy.  While that is the case, it has appeared for some time that the traditional areas of employment are those that have delivered the most in the response to the economic downturn, both here and abroad.  For example, Germany has been relying heavily on exports.  To what extent has the EU studied this issue with a view to maximising employment potential and, as used to be said, lifting all boats on a rising tide?<\/p><p>  Is each EU country able to access sufficiently the digital economy in order to capitalise on it in terms of employment creation?  Ireland is not able to fully access its most modern elements.  Be it Europe or this jurisdiction, we do not do enough forward planning.  The problems with accessing the digital economy should have been dealt with ten years ago when plenty of resources were available to do so.<\/p><p>  There is a particular need to ensure that state-of-the-art technology is available in all EU countries.  We are dependent on one another.  If there are gaps in the system in Ireland or its adjoining economies, they will show up in the extent to which the EU and its Single Market are competitive, for example, the degree to which we have state-of-the-art broadband.  Ireland does not have it.  Many people in my and my colleagues' constituencies, including not far from where we are, must roam around their buildings to find the hottest spots for accessing broadband.  This is disgraceful and should not be the case.  The EU should have identified the need for an emphasis on these issues years ago, not now when the problem is there for everyone to see.<\/p><p>  I have welcomed the semester concept for a long time.  It gives the EU the ability to assess progress under various headings on an ongoing basis.  This would identify deficiencies or inefficiencies and the potential to maximise the benefits of the Single Market.  Unless all of these factors fall into place simultaneously and we move together in the Union, the concept of the Single Market will fall by the wayside.<\/p><p>  The Chairman will be glad to know that I will make my last point.  I would be interested to know what our colleagues in the Netherlands will say about subsidiarity and proportionality.  I have had views on these issues for some time.  Previously, something was applied to every country on the basis that it suited one country.  However, this does not follow, nor should it.  It must be recognised that not every economy is starting from the same base or is in the same position.  To capitalise on the benefits likely to accrue from the semester and the examination, it is necessary that we emphasise this point.<\/p><p>  I could discuss other issues, but the Chairman will be glad to know I will not continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111400007#F00100","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1384440000,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I thank all members for their questions and the Chairman for the opportunity to answer them.

If colleagues put their energies into deliberating on points, I want to register them and be able to revert to them each time.<\/p><p>  I will begin with the Chairman's good self and some of the points he put to me.  A review takes place each year at European Council level regarding the enlargement process.  This will occur at the December European Council.  The Chairman referred to Turkey.  The Irish Presidency worked hard on that matter.  Chapter 22 was opened up via this month's intergovernmental conference, IGC.  We are supportive of that process.  I have met the Turkish ambassador and discussed the matter with him.  This relates to one of Deputy Byrne's points.  Turkey understands our support for progress by the IGC on this chapter.  This issue was agreed without discussion at the last General Affairs Council, in large part due to the work done by the Irish Government.  If the Chairman is interested, I can provide a detailed update on where the work stands at future committee meetings, but the first meeting on commencing the work happened only a week ago.<\/p><p>  As to the other countries relevant to this discussion, consideration will be given to Albania's candidate status at the December meeting.  Deputy Byrne asked me about this situation.  There also will be discussion on the initiation of accession negotiations with Macedonia.  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be discussed at next Monday's Foreign Affairs Council, where we believe the emphasis will be on the need for people within its communities to do everything they can to take responsibility for the process.  In the coming months, the EU will take stock of our work with them and what else can be done.  Negotiations have begun on Kosovo's stabilisation and association process.<\/p><p>  At the December European Council meeting, an overview will be taken of the total enlargement process, which leads on to the points made by the Chairman and Deputy Byrne about Ukraine.  I will attend the partnership summit in Vilnius in two weeks' time.  It will address this and a number of other issues.  Ireland is disposed towards signing and supports the association agreement, but we want to see progress made on the issue of selective justice.  We will examine closely what happens in that country during the coming weeks, but we are also conscious of the pressure on Ukraine and other countries and the work being undertaken by their leaders.  The coming two weeks will be important, in that they will confirm what our position, and that of other members states, will be.<\/p><p>  Regarding the European semester, I am supportive of the role of social indicators in gaining a more holistic assessment of where economies and societies stand within the European project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111400007#F00200","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384441200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013111400009#H00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1384441200,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I am at pains to avoid blaming European institutions if things are not being done well by national governments.

Arising from discussions with colleagues about the Semester process, I have learned that if engagement does not happen early between national governments and the European institutions - particularly the Commission - and if the quality of bilateral discussion is not there, we will not get what is required from that process.  I support that process because of the difficulty that Ireland is in.  If it was just our own difficulty, I think we would have had the measure of it.

I propose to explain what we are doing, what we can do better and what needs to happen for our dying patients and their families in our hospitals.  I am one of the senior nurse managers in charge of the hospital and work weekends in this capacity.  My experience to date is that patients do not always die between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, when all services are in place.  Often one is faced with very profound experiences involving patients and families outside these times.  I was involved with a family whose adult child had died tragically.  On receiving the news, I contacted the hospital Chaplain and we discussed where would be the best place to take the family.  Their adult child had not died in hospital so we would not be involving a ward area but we needed an appropriate space.  In difficult sensitive situations like this, one acts quickly and makes decisions.  Time is of the essence.  We were very conscious of where we would take the family because additional news of a distressing nature needed to broken.  We agreed a space - a small office area - and met the family when they arrived at the main entrance.  We offered our condolences, made tea and were present with the family while tragic news was broken.  It was difficult in this small room for them to move around to comfort each other.  Later, when they were able, we brought them to the Mortuary to see and spend time with their child.  Our viewing area in the Mortuary for families is far from ideal and is outside the main building.  The Chaplain, hospital porter and I tried to make it as tolerable and presentable as possible.  We brought back the family to the room and stayed until they were ready to face their difficult journey home.<\/p><p>  At times like this one becomes totally absorbed and anxious for the family because one really wants to do the right thing for them in their distress.  This experience affected us and had a profound effect on me.  I wanted to share this with the committee this morning as it captures some of the challenges we face on the ground in providing good end-of-life care in our hospitals. Good end-of-life care is everyone's business, the nurse, the chaplain, the porter.   We get only one chance to get it right.  What I have described indicates the importance of staff having the necessary skills in communication and awareness around end-of-life care to ensure all patients and families are treated with dignity, respect and sensitivity.  We must have appropriate spaces within in our hospitals that afford privacy when breaking bad news to the patient and their family.  We need to ensure our viewing areas in our mortuaries are improved.<\/p><p>  As a result of the programme, some of this work has started and is progressing.  The programme invites hospitals to embrace their role in supporting all patients at end-of-life, regardless of diagnosis, whether their death is expected or sudden.  It acknowledges that end-of-life care is a core activity in our hospitals.  Almost half of us in this room today will die in a busy acute hospital and almost half will die in a busy ward area as opposed to in the privacy of a single room.  Almost half of us will not be involved in discussions regarding our care.  Staff find it easier to talk to relatives than to the patient.  We know this is based on the results of the national audit on end-of-life care which suggests there is substantial variation in the quality of care offered to patients and relatives at the end-of-life.  The audit concluded that there are 17 ways to improve dying in hospitals, one of which is to ensure the patient is cared for in a single room.  We are short of such spaces and have competing priorities such as income generation and infection issues.<\/p><p>  How would one know if a hospital is a hospice friendly hospital?  At its simplest, it is a hospital that takes end-of-life care seriously and is implementing the quality standards for end-of-life care in hospitals, which set out a shared vision for what hospitals should be aiming for and what patients and families should expect.  At its heart, it is the culture change programme which introduces numerous practical resources to enhance the culture at end-of-life.  I want to bring the end-of-life care symbol to the attention of the committee this morning.  This has been developed to respectfully identify items connected with end-of-life.  It is inspired by ancient Irish history and is not associated with any one religion or denomination.  When one sees this displayed in the hospital ward it signifies that a person is very close to death or has died.  It signals to all staff, other patients and families that an intensely personal and profound experience is happening to a person and their family in this ward at this time, of which they should be mindful.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee for reading my submission and ask that all the recommendations therein be given consideration.   I would like at this point to highlight three of the recommendations.  We have excellent committed staff in our hospitals and we need to support and invest in them to ensure they care for our loved ones with competence and compassion.  We need to ensure we have adequate numbers of staff on the ground that can provide compassionate care and be present for patients and their families.  We need a national end-of-life and bereavement strategy to cover all aspects of dying, death and bereavement in Ireland.  We need and can do so much better for our dying patients and their families.<\/p><p>  When pressed, most of us in this room this morning will say we wish to die at home.  My wish for members and I is that this will happen.  If not, I hope that by the time they die, every hospital in Ireland will be a hospice friendly hospital and offer them patient-centred, compassionate care, because they matter.  The following is a link to a five minute DVD entitled, &quot;A Wish&quot;:<i>irishhospicelibrary.wordpress.com\/2012\/07\/18\/a-wish-new-animated-video-from-the-hospice-friendlv-hospitals-programme\/<\/i>.  It captures and explores the important role all staff play in providing end-of-life care for those of us who will die in hospital.  I ask that the committee watch the DVD.  A good death in hospital is possible.  Our challenge is to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Bree"},{"type":"speech","time":1384421700,"counter":592,"content":"<p>Thank you.

Whether one includes taxes, as did Benjamin Franklin, is a moot point as there may be ways to avoid taxes but none to avoid death.<\/p><p>  End-of-life care in the emergency department is a recently coined phrase but the concept predates all of those in this room.  Most people who contemplate the end of their own lives fear certain aspects of it, in particular the risk of pain or indignity.  Whereas it was common up to 50 years ago for people in this country to die at home, it is increasingly uncommon.  Some 48% of deaths occur in acute hospitals, 20% in long-term care facilities, 25% at home and only 4% in hospice care.  When expected, arrangements may be in place to deal with the concerns of the dying person and their relatives.  When unexpected, or precipitate, such plans may be thwarted or simply not yet in place.  Interestingly, surveys have shown that most medical doctors would opt to die at home, if at all feasible.<\/p><p>  An audit study from four years ago showed that 84% of patients dying in hospital had accessed the hospital via the emergency department, with 24% of the deaths being unexpected.  End-of-life care in the emergency department is opportunistic in that it depends on many factors coming together at the one time.  It relies on the determination of the staff to ensure the best possible experience for their patients and the patient&rsquo;s relatives or friends.  It requires determination to deliver quality care in what is perceived by many outsiders as a chaotic setting.  Every dying person has physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs.  It is relatively uncommon for one person to be able to support each and every one of these needs.  Instead, a team effort is essential.  This team must be prepared and, like an elite squad, practised at its task.<\/p><p>  The barriers to a high quality death in the emergency department include the physical setting, often overcrowded, noisy, and with high intensity lighting 24 hours a day.  It is psychologically extremely difficult to be plucked from one&rsquo;s bed at home, gasping for breath, and be brought by ambulance, careening through the streets with sirens blaring, to a noisy environment, where the bustle of life-saving measures applied to one person may interfere with the peace and quiet required by a dying woman contemplating her last few hours or minutes on this earth.  There is an understandable reluctance to spend a lot of time with a person known to be dying, whose life cannot be prolonged by any means within the power of nursing and medical staff.  While staff are concerned for these people, the pressure of other patients&rsquo; needs can be very distracting, running the risk of a lonely death in a crowded room.<\/p><p>  What of the tensions within a family whose loved one has been injured in a  traffic collision or in a murderous assault and now lies sedated, ventilated and paralysed, unable to communicate his or her needs, with no prospect of survival?  All deaths in the emergency department or within 24 hours of admission must be reported to the Coroner.  Post mortem autopsies will be carried out on a high proportion of these, otherwise the legal requirements for death certification will not be fulfilled.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400004#E00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Plunkett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384422300,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I now call Dr. Geoff King, who is director of Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and clinical lead of the HSE national transport medicine programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400005#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384422300,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I will take the liberty of leaving the committee with my background paper and will speak briefly off the cuff.

I will only leave if my second wife wants to leave, because my first is not going anywhere.<\/p><p>  I was medical director of the flying doctors in Queensland until 2001.  We covered a population of 4 million, which is similar to the whole of Ireland.  I was happy there and had 50 doctors reporting to me.  We had about 100 nurses in the team.  It is at the acute sharp end - better than some services in the world and probably could learn from some others.  I arrived in Ireland as the inaugural director of a nice piece of secondary legislation to establish pre-hospital services in Ireland, which at the time had a basic life-support service.  The ambulances were driven by what were called \"drivers\", which offends me.  They were not regarded by the community or people as clinicians but were regarded as drivers who would transport the nurse out and bring patients back into hospital.<\/p><p>  When I arrived I wondered what I would do.

Everyone thinks these scenes are dignified but they are not; they are full of vomit or whatever.  The tubes have made it more dignified.  The view is that the job is done but there are two more to do.  We cannot pronounce death.  Now, the paramedics cease resuscitation but they must wait for the doctor or general practitioner car.  At night time, they may be at the scene where a person has died in home or on the roadside.  They pronounce death but nothing is going to be done and they must wait for a doctor.  It could be ten minutes, one hour or the next day.  Hours are wasted when those people could be out resuscitating others who could survive.  What we need is endorsement.  We do not even need legislation because the city coroner is on board, and we are going to meet the coroners, but we need support for the view that it is legitimate to do what they do in the United Kingdom and Australasia.  It should be signed off that a paramedic can pronounce death.  It is safe.  It is crazy that we have to wait for a doctor, who has other work to do, to do it.  That is where we need help.<\/p><p>  There is another issue relating to the do-not-resuscitate order.  Let us think ahead.  The HSE has a draft document on do-not-resuscitate orders and the executive must plan to legitimise it.  We need to have it legitimised because we are currently in no man's land and people who do not want to be resuscitated are being resuscitated.  In those last two instances we were missing response times.  The committee members have read the paper.  People who could be saved are not getting a shot because we are wasting time on the acceptance that only a certain person should be able to pronounce death and an acceptance that we need do-not-resuscitate orders.  We do not need legislation but the legislation could help, perhaps, in a secondary way.<\/p><p>  Finally, we need more ambulances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400006#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Geoff King"},{"type":"speech","time":1384422900,"counter":600,"content":"<p>Our next speaker is Margaret Naughton, secretary of the National Association of Healthcare Chaplains.

I am here to represent the National Association of Healthcare chaplains, NAHC.  The NAHC is a professional association whose members serve in hospitals and health care facilities.  The purpose of the NAHC is the mutual encouragement and support of its members in ministering to patients, their relatives and staff in health care facilities.  This organisation, founded in 1981, is in essence a proven professional support body for chaplains.<\/p><p>  What exactly is a chaplain?  A chaplain is a person appointed to provide spiritual and religious care to all patients, visitors, staff and volunteers in the health care setting regardless of faith or no faith.  A chaplain can be ordained or lay.  Chaplains are people of faith who have engaged in the clinical pastoral education programme, a hospital-based experiential programme founded by Anton Boisen to work with and minister to living human documents.<\/p><p>  Thomas Moore, in his book, <i>Care of the Soul<\/i>, wrote:<blockquote>Modern medicine, on the other hand, is hell-bent on cure and has no interest in the body&rsquo;s inherent art.  It wants to eradicate all anomalies before there is a chance to read them for meaning.  It abstracts the body into chemistries and anatomies so that the expressive body is hidden behind graphs, charts, numbers, and structural diagrams.<\/blockquote>However, hospitals are not populated by numbers or ailments.  They are populated by men, women and children of different ages, classes, creeds and nationalities who all have one thing in common: they are all ill.  Charles Vella, a hospital chaplain and priest who has written extensively on the care of the sick, argues strongly that one's suffering is augmented by the humiliation of being thought of as a number on a bed, totally divested of human dignity.<\/p><p>  A chaplain works to provide empathy and support to those who find themselves in a health care system increasingly coming under pressure for many reasons.  Chaplain address the spiritual and religious needs of the patients they encounter on the wards.  By listening with empathy in a compassionate non-judgmental manner, a chaplain provides support for those who are struggling for whatever reason.<\/p><p>  It must be remembered that a hospital is a microcosm of society.  I mean that all the problems that exist in our society exist also in our hospitals.  After all, the problems that people have in their daily lives come with them when they enter hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400006#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Naughton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384423500,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Naughton and welcome Dr. Deirdre Madden, lecturer in law in University College Cork, UCC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400007#H00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384423500,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to speak today.  While my background is as a senior lecturer in law in UCC, specialising in medical and health care law, I have also been involved in the area of medical ethics and patient safety for many years.  Although most of us would prefer to die at home, unfortunately it is not always possible for various reasons.  A hospital environment often can be a busy, noisy, crowded place to die with too little time and space given to the privacy and dignity of the person.  Bad news is delivered in wards with other patients overhearing from behind the bed curtain, families wait anxiously for hours to catch a quick word with a busy consultant and patients often are left wondering what is happening to them.<\/p><p>  I do not intend to speak about the physical environment in which people die, as the joint committee has already heard submissions on this topic.  However, I would like to speak about the duty of care owed by a hospital to patients and their families and what this means.  I am not speaking specifically about a legal duty, breach of which might result in litigation for negligence, but rather a broader ethical duty of care that imports the values of respect, compassion and honesty.  To my mind, such a duty arises from the inherent nature of health care itself, which is to care for the person, physically and psychologically, to cure where possible and to provide relief, support and comfort where cure is not possible.<\/p><p>  The importance of respect for the dignity of the dying person is a principle with which no one would argue.  While we all appreciate the huge and important advances that have been made in medicine, at the same time we must ensure the care of the person does not become overly medicalised to the extent that sight is lost of the fact that the person in the bed is an individual with a voice, wishes and interests, who may have already come to terms with his or her impending death and is not simply a patient for whom treatment is being provided by numerous health care professionals across multidisciplinary teams in an attempt to maintain vital functions.  Although palliative care has encouraged medicine to be gentler in its acceptance of death, medical services sometimes continue to regard death as something to be resisted, postponed or avoided.  The challenge for doctors here is to balance technical intervention with a humanistic approach to their dying patients.  We need practices and structures that offer a compassionate and competent response to illness, fragility and mortality.  We need a patient-centred approach, which will focus on the patient&rsquo;s health, identity and relationships, as well as the processes that support the delivery of good care.<\/p><p>  I wish to draw the joint committee&rsquo;s attention to the national consent policy that was published in May 2013.  This policy is intended to apply to all health and social care services conducted by or on behalf of the HSE.  I was the chairperson of the national consent advisory group that drafted this policy and I look forward to its effective implementation to ensure a consistent and high-quality consent process in all hospitals across the country.  There are a few matters in the policy to which I wish to draw members' attention.  First, on the theme of respect and dignity, consent is a process whereby a person gives permission for an intervention following communication of information about that intervention.  The ethical rationale behind the importance of consent is the need to respect the person&rsquo;s right to self-determination, that is, his or her right to control his or her own life and to decide what happens to his or her own body.  Good health care decision-making involves trust between the patient and doctor, open and effective communication and mutual respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400007#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Madden","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384424100,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Madden for her presentation.

We welcome this opportunity to talk to the committee about staff development and education in regard to good end-of-life care in Ireland.  It explicitly acknowledges that we can make a difference through awareness-raising and training for health care staff and professionals.  At the end of the day, I am here to remind everybody that fundamental to good end-of-life care is the person, the patient or the resident.  We have to keep them at the centre of everything we do.<\/p><p>  As we have heard, end-of-life care is important to every one of us.  It will be of interest to all of us.  Sooner or later, it will be us or someone we know and love.  Death and dying are part of the human experience.  In the Irish Hospice Foundation, we believe that nobody should die alone, frightened, lonely or in pain.  Unfortunately, for people in Ireland today, death and dying can be a very lonely experience.  If one was parachuted into Ireland from outer space and landed at a funeral, one would think we were brilliant at death and dying.  We are great when people are dead.  It is no problem in that we do not have to talk to them.  We can talk about them and we turn up in our thousands to celebrate their passing and it is a wonderful experience.  People often say they are not afraid of being dead but that they are really scared about what comes before it and about the dying process.  Why are they scared about that?  They are scared because it is the loss of autonomy, the loss of their sense of control, the loss of their dignity and the fact that nobody will engage with them about what is important to them and their concerns.  <\/p><p>  It is estimated there are approximately 95,000 people working in health care in Ireland.  If one is working in health care, potentially, death and dying will be part of one's job and we need to recognise that.  Today in Ireland, 80 people will die, five of whom will die in a hospice which is the five star care one will get.  What about the other 75?  Can we ensure that those 75 have access to good care too?  The only way we will do that is if we train and enable staff through good education programmes so that they will be able to engage with patients or residents about their concerns and end-of-life.  Unfortunately, at the moment, it is a little bit of a lottery and it is down to whom one meets on the day and how comfortable the person who is dealing with one or one's family is with end-of-life, conversations about end-of-life and what is important.    <\/p><p>  The Irish Hospice Foundation has been involved in developing or grant-aiding the development of a wide range of initiatives aimed at health care staff in the last decade or so.  We have provided training for more than 5,500 people - members of staff in the health care setting - in the past three years to help them to make a difference to people at end-of-life.  We have three different staff development workshops.  Two of these workshops specifically focus on communication and connection with people at end-of-life.  The third helps staff break bad news more sensitively.  Details of the workshops are in my written submission.  We know these workshops work.  We have had them evaluated by UCD in 2011 and by Trinity College in 2013 and both of those evaluations attested to the overwhelmingly positive reactions of those who attended.<\/p><p>  What are we trying to do?  The aim of the workshops is to try to help staff to be a little more confident, competent and comfortable around the people for whom they care at end-of-life and to be confident enough to talk to them about what really matters to them.  In this sense, our workshops are very focused on person-to-person communication because we know communication is central to good end-of-life care.  In addition to everything else members have heard, I am here to remind them it is fundamental to good end-of-life care that we keep the person at the centre of everything we do.  We remind staff that good end-of-life care is fundamentally about respect and about really connecting with the person.  There is no better way to show respect to someone than to talk to them and to listen to them, especially at a time of loneliness and distress.  There is no better way to care for somebody than to actually give somebody one's wholehearted attention and to allow him or her to express his or her concerns and for us to do our best to facilitate his or her preference.  A frequent outcome of participation in our workshops is that staff discover that they can become more relationship-focused within the course of the normal working day and that it is not just about the task but about seeing the person.  <\/p><p>  We take a hearts and minds approach.  When the thank you cards come in, they thank the staff for being so professional and compassionate.  They always link the two.  People want us to be professional - that we know what we are doing and that we are confident in what we are doing - but they want us to be compassionate as well.  When we have the balance of hearts and minds, then one can fly if one is the patient receiving that service.  We look after people's minds.  We educate minds by giving staff good practice tools and theories about how to talk to and listen to people about their concerns and preferences and about how to break bad news, which is the hardest part of anybody's job, how to help people deal with the impact of that news and how to initiate difficult conversations and respond to difficult questions.<\/p><p>  We also put a lot of emphasis on communication about the heart aspect that death and dying are not just about procedures but about my passion that we need to get this right.  People only die once, so it is not a one size fits all.  We cannot pick the book off the shelf and read all about it and have all the answers.  We are all different, we have different needs and different worries and concerns.  I cannot assume I know what someone wants unless I ask the person.  I will not find out what is important to the person unless I take the time to listen.  All too often, patients and residents will worry about their deteriorating condition and make many efforts to engage with staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bryan Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384424700,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan.

In our own department, for example, 43% of our patients are over the age of 80 although by strict definition one is elderly when one reaches 65; that usually insults most people who are 65, myself included.  There is that total patient approach but there is a confusion of terminology.  What is end of life care?  What is terminal care?  What is a patient who is dying, and are we good at picking up those particular elements of the life cycle?  In some respects we are not, and that comes back to education and training and awareness.<\/p><p>  Historically, in palliative medicine - members have heard a good deal about specialist palliative care and I support the strong call for its expansion where it is particularly deficient in numbers - those involved looked after patients only with cancer.  Fortunately, that is no longer the case because as we all recognise, there are many illnesses other than cancer for whom there is a phase beyond the curative, which requires support.  For example, in terms of somebody with advanced heart failure, and there is a gradation of heart failure, 70% of patients in the grade 3 or 4 heart failure category will die within 12 months but we do not suddenly announce 12 months before they die that they dying.  Our approach to their management, as in specialist palliative care, will be to look after them to the best possible extent symptomatically through their final months but a recognition in that phase is important from an entire spectrum of issues.  Have they sorted out their family arrangements?  Do other family members realise the circumstances and so on?<\/p><p>  We have heard already about the numbers of deaths and where they happen.  Each death is unique, whether it is following a traumatic event, a murder, a car accident or an acute medical insult.  A different set of activities might need to be activated in the context of a sudden unexpected death but there must be a series of policies to look after that particular case.<\/p><p>  In elderly care medicine, most of the deaths are relatively predictable in the sense that they have multiple conditions that, ultimately and unfortunately, will be responsible for taking their life.  My interest in this subject was energised considerably when I was invited to become a member of the Hospice Friendly Hospitals Programme steering committee in 2005.  To some extent I was embarrassed that I had worked for 40 years as a doctor and never questioned the inappropriateness of multi-bed facilities in our hospitals.  If any of us go to London for the weekend with our spouse and we put the card into the bedroom door we do not expect four other couples to be in the room when we arrive.  Were that to happen we would be appalled but we think nothing of having sick people in multi-bed facilities.<\/p><p>  In the context of end-of-life, it is essential that patients and their families have the opportunity of being in a private area but that is difficult to realise when the percentage of single beds in our hospital construct is so small.  There is an infection control policy, which I support to some extent, to the effect that if somebody is readmitted to hospital who, in a previous admission, had MRSA up their nose, for example, which is of no injury to anybody unless they travel up their nose, they must be put into a single room on readmission to hospital.  We do not have any such diktat stating that if somebody is dying we should put them in a single room.  This event occurs 29,000 a year and I suggest it needs some addressing.<\/p><p>  Roger Ulrich, whom I reference in my paper, has done a good deal of work on this area and the advantages are far greater than just dignity, respect and privacy for a patient and his or her family when they are dying but he has proven financial savings and greatly reduced hospital care infections by a single room policy.  In my view every bed in a hospital should be a single, with the obvious exception of intensive care and high dependency units.  That should be the target.<\/p><p>  The benefits of hospice care are well-established and we are indebted to those in specialist palliative medicine for the degree to which they have raised our awareness of it.  A different philosophy is required for dealing with patients coming towards the end of life.  An interesting paper was published this year in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine, <\/i>which I reference, entitled Generalist plus Specialist Palliative Care.  It states: &quot;[M]any elements of palliative care can [and should] be provided by existing specialist or generalist clinicians [general practitioners and other health care professionals] regardless of discipline&quot;.<\/p><p>  Who has responsibility in this regard?  We all have responsibility.  The national advisory committee on palliative care defines three levels which I instance in my paper.  Level 1 is a core skill that every health care professional working in a hospital or a community care setting should be able to deliver.  As a geriatrician I could not possibly be asked to look after every old person who is sick, and a specialist in palliative care cannot be asked to look after every person, regardless of age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400009#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Cillian Twomey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384425300,"counter":612,"content":"<p>Our final speaker is Ms Joan Kelly who is a nursing services manager with the Irish Cancer Society.

I want to speak about the needs of cancer patients and make recommendations for end-of-life care for them that will better meet their needs.  Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in Ireland and cancer patients are the largest group to avail of specialist palliative care.  This is unlikely to change.<\/p><p>  Cancer accounts for over 8,600 deaths in Ireland every year.  It is predicted that the number of cancer cases will increase from around 30,000 as it is now, to 42,000 in 2020.  Improvements in cancer detection and treatment mean that cancer survival rates are improving, with 65% of all patients diagnosed surviving their illness.  New treatments mean that patients with cancer live longer but will require end of life care.  An ageing population with complex medical needs is likely to increase demand for palliative care services.  This presents a significant challenge for a health system undergoing extensive reform in the face of increasing financial difficulty.  Palliative care is an approach to caring for people with and illness that will not be cured or is life-limiting.  It can be delivered in a variety of settings and no doubt the committee has heard more about that in the past few days.  It is also important to note that palliative care can be delivered in any setting, acute hospitals, community hospitals, nursing homes, hospices or in the patient&rsquo;s home.  The Irish Hospice Foundation found in 2004 that two thirds of people wish to die at home but unfortunately the national average is approximately 26%.<\/p><p>  In supporting end-of-life care for cancer patients in the primary care setting the Irish Cancer Society provides a night-nursing service to patients in their own homes.  This service began in 1986.  It is the only national palliative care service available to cancer patients at night in their own homes.  The Irish Cancer Society receives no State funding for this service and depends entirely on public donations.  The service plays a vital role in supporting integrated palliative care without which many patients would have to be admitted to hospital and could not continue to receive care in their own homes.  An admission to hospital for people who are as ill as these patients are would unfortunately result in their death's occurring within 24 or 48 hours.  It is imperative that patients being cared for at home continue to be cared for there and have the choice of place of care for their death.<\/p><p>  In 2012 the Irish Cancer Society provided 7,600 nights of care to over 2,100 cancer patients.  The average cost of a night of care is around &euro;350.  The demands for this service are increasing at a rate of  approximately 7% a year.  It costs the society approximately &euro;2.6 million to provide night-nursing to the entire country.  The Irish Cancer Society will seek further funding and policy development to support integrated palliative care in primary care and recommends that the money-follows-the-patient model should incorporate end of life care at night in the patient&rsquo;s home.  There is a gap in the provision of home care as the Irish Cancer Society night nurses are available generally between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.  In general day services operate between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. which results in a gap in provision between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and 11 p.m.  This can cause considerable distress and is a barrier to patients&rsquo; remaining at home.  The gap needs to be bridged by integrating night-nursing services into palliative and primary care services so that patients have access to 24 hour care if and as required.<\/p><p>  Palliative care patients require timely access to services and care and should be able to access those services in the most efficient and stress-free manner.  Patients with a terminal illness are entitled to an emergency medical card, valid for six months.  A doctor&rsquo;s or consultant&rsquo;s letter stating that the patient is terminally ill or at the end of their life is required to obtain such a card.  Patients with an incurable cancer who are not expected to survive longer than six months must be reassessed on financial grounds if they survive longer than six months after the card was provided.  This requires extensive paperwork at a time of considerable distress for the patient and the family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400010#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384425900,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kelly for the presentation and for coming in at such short notice.

I will not touch on every presentation but a general thread running through them was the relationship between the staff, the patient and the relatives - the triangle, so to speak.  Mr. Nolan spoke about staff being confident, competent and comfortable but my thoughts were about the patient and words such as \"consent\", \"choice\" and \"control\".  Listening to what many people said, I believe we remove much of the control from the patients.  Dr. Madden said that the patient is the expert.  I wonder if that should be the title of our report in terms of putting the patient first and foremost.<\/p><p>  This morning we are focused on the care element at end of life.  Everybody focuses on the end of life and forgets the care element that is so important but there is an issue about control and the interaction with relatives.  I agree with Mr. Nolan on the staff training issue but relatives also face a cliff edge and in that respect they do not know the vocabulary or whether they are taking the right approach because they do not necessarily believe that somebody is advocating on behalf of the patient.  They often do the wrong thing in trying to do the right thing for their relatives.  Do the witnesses have views on how we can raise greater awareness among the public in that regard?<\/p><p>  That brings me to a specific issue raised about which I am concerned, namely, the \"do not attempt to resuscitate\" issue.  I did not realise that the legal basis was unclear.  Dr. Madden spoke about the issue of consent, and Dr. King raised it also, but because it is not clear my experience is that the relatives have to unnecessarily repeat the request, which can sound callous at a very sensitive time for the patient and the family.  That aspect hit home for me.  There has been talk about advanced care directives, and the issue of the timing of when those advanced care directives should be discussed arose.  That is something we must take on board.<\/p><p>  Dr. King gave us compelling messages on the human tissue Bill.  <\/p><p>  I agree strongly with Professor Twomey on the issue of single rooms.  Having that space is important on so many levels in terms of the patient's dignity.<\/p><p>  On the medical card issue raised by Ms Kelly, we have had discussions here with the Minister for Health and representatives of the Health Service Executive about the six months aspect.  Effectively, a patient almost has to apologise for living more than the anticipated six months.  We have heard of cases where the patient does not want it written on their form that their condition is terminal.  The family and others may know but we all know people approach these matters differently and to have the word \"terminal\" written down can be distressing.  A number of issues intermingle in that regard.<\/p><p>  I thank the witnesses and ask them to reflect on some of the issues I believe are important.  Relationships matter greatly.  In terms of the chaplain service, I would consider providing facilities and spaces.  I am sorry but I had not realised that the HSE employs chaplains.  We need to examine all those inter-relationships with a patient.<\/p><p>  My final point is about a concern I have that an allocated staff member deals with the death discussion.  If a patient were to ask that question, my understanding is that all staff should be present, certainly from listening to what several witnesses said, including Mr. Nolan, and not postponing that discussion.  It should not be done bluntly but there is a way to do it.  When we are considering our report we must ensure that it is not about having designated people.  It is too easy, when considering reports, to say we will designate people to do this and that because from what I am hearing we should be providing a seamless service.  That is more of a commentary, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400013#Q00400","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1384426500,"counter":627,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations but also for their dedication and commitment to the work they are doing.  It is important that we give recognition to the important part they play in this country's health service.<\/p><p>  I come from a legal background and many of the issues raised touch on the legal area.  I listened to what Dr. King said about not doing resuscitation but an issue arises in that respect.  If medical personnel who are called out to a house arrive and are seen not to take any action, the blame game starts and they find it difficult to try to explain the reason they are not taking action.  The easiest course for them to take, therefore, is to take action even though it might not be the best approach if the person has died but they are afraid to be seen to be not taking action.  That is an issue that arises for staff in those circumstances.<\/p><p>  Likewise in hospitals, medical negligence is the biggest growth area.  It is not necessarily about the standard of care being provided but that people appear to have more access to information and are more willing to go down the legal route.  That is a huge issue for medical staff.  Professor Twomey will find from his experience that it is putting people into various corners from a medical care point of view.  I do not know how we can deal with that but it must be tackled.  We set up the Injuries Board to deal with claims arising out of car accidents and industrial accidents but we have done nothing to review and change the way we deal with litigation involving medical negligence cases.  That is something we need to review.<\/p><p>  Dr. Madden spoke about the role of the family in a hospital setting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400013#Q00500","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384427100,"counter":629,"content":"<p>We will start in reverse order with Professor Twomey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400014#R00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384427100,"counter":630,"content":"<p>Deputy McLellan asked whether the percentages of deaths can change.  First and foremost, nobody wants to die.  If we were to ask somebody where they want to die, they would first say that they do not want to die at all.  By that I mean that we do not really think about dying.  It is kind of a taboo subject and people have very different and personal understandings of it.  That is again an educational deficit that needs to be addressed.   When people are asked where they would best like to die when they die, they all say they would like to die at home.  That is nice and appropriate, but we must caution that sometimes it is not appropriate that they die at home because their needs are such that they need to be looked after in a separate environment.  Even though Mr. Nolan provided the figure that five people will die today in a hospice, several people will die today at home who are part of the specialist palliative care team and are being supported by the home care team at home.  All three levels of palliative care I described need to co-exist and be organised for it to be done properly.  There should be much fewer people dying in acute hospitals than is the case, but that will not happen unless we put the structure in place in the community or at home.<\/p><p>  Advanced care planning might help a lot to inform progress in the area of residential care centres.  The consultation does not take place when a person is near death or dying.  It could take place today when a person is perfectly well, and the person is asked what kind of care they would like in the event of something happening to them.  Professor Molloy devised Let Me Decide, which is a worldwide document that has been used along these lines.  It is a tweaking of that booklet which is part of the pilot survey.  The initial reaction from this pilot project is that relatives have not been shocked and horrified by the discussion and instead have welcomed it.  Some might say they do not wish to talk about it at all, but many appreciated doing so.<\/p><p>  A reference was made to Leas Cross.  Without doubt Leas Cross scared the living daylights out of people in many places, because owners felt that if anyone died in their facility, there might be a Leas Cross type inquiry.  HIQA standards for residential care specify there need to be end-of-life care discussions with all residents, so that one has a sense of what should be done in the circumstance.<\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout spoke about 80 year olds who are perfectly fit and well, and she is speaking to the converted in that respect.  The majority are well.  A figure was bandied about, which is correct, that 25% of those over the age of 85 get dementia, but that means 75% of people over the age of 85 do not get dementia, and many of the 25% who get dementia retain capacity.

Some of the questions we ask about testing capacity are not very relevant.  That comes together in the context of wills and testamentary capacity.<\/p><p>  The issue of litigation is slightly outside this debate, but I agree that it could arise.  In my view, collaborative practice mediation is an area of dealing with concerns that needs to be developed very strongly.  These issues arise nearly always out of a communication deficit, and we should try to make ourselves more available for that.  That is easily said but less easily delivered.  In practice, I did rounds on three different wards every week, and at the end of each round I had a meeting with relatives, which is communicating.  I was conscious of the importance and I explained things in plain language and so on.  However, I got into the habit after a while of asking the person to whom I was talking if he or she could provide a synopsis of what he or she thought I had said.  Sometimes I would be horrified as I thought I had not said that at all.

There is a substantial need for education in the health service.  Years ago people had natural skills about how to deal with end-of-life issues, because their relations all died at home and neighbours came in and laid them out and so on.  I have met fully qualified staff nurses who have never even seen a person die or never even seen a dead person, so we cannot assume the people looking after the dying person know what is appropriate and what happens next.  We would say that everybody needs some education.  There are some who need more and then a small group of people probably need everything.<\/p><p>  I would like to provide an example of how important the Final Journeys programme can be.  Sometimes care is being delivered within a space.  We do not even recognise who is delivering that care.  In one Dublin teaching hospital, we took a group of staff who were working in a particular area - from the doctor down to the tea lady - and we asked them when end-of-life care begins.  The clinicians all said it begins at diagnosis, and that when a person gets a bad diagnosis, we start caring for him or her in an end-of-life care way.  We started drilling down through that idea.  The next thing was that a little voice uttered: \"I think that when she stops taking her tea, there is a change.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400014#R00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bryan Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384427700,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Deputy McLellan asked about the capacity laws.  The capacity laws in Ireland are inadequate.  They are also offensive.  The current capacity law is based on the lunacy regulations from the 19th century and obviously the language of those regulations is very offensive.  I was happy to see the recent publication of the assisted decision making Bill, the theme of which is the promotion of autonomy.  I like that it clarifies what people working in this area know already, that there is a presumption of capacity.  It clarifies in law that this is the case.  One starts from the basis that everybody has the capacity to make their own decisions.  That is very important.  It also ensures Ireland is compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It provides a suite of decision-making options to facilitate the patient's autonomy, while recognising that he or she might need support or assistance or a surrogate decision maker, if necessary.<\/p><p>  Two other aspects of the Bill that are very important are the advanced health care directives, to give support to the legal recognition of those, and the extension of the power of attorney laws to health care.  Both of those will add to the options that are available to try to facilitate autonomy as much as possible.<\/p><p>  I am delighted Senator van Turnhout picked up on the patient as expert.  That is very important.  She spoke about consent as being choice and control.  It is also about capacity and knowledge.  We can only exercise that choice and control if we, as patients, are informed.  Consent and communication are obviously a process, not a once-off thing.  Professor Twomey spoke about the difficulty for clinicians in giving information, asking the patient to say what they have learned or appreciated from the discussion and having them tell one something completely different.  That is always a difficulty.  There are language and communication difficulties, but these can be circumvented.  One can have visual aids, such as pictorial representations of what one is trying to explain.  There are many different ways in which one can aid that communication, but it is a process and skills are very important in that.<\/p><p>  Senator Burke mentioned two matters in response to what I said.  The first related to the do-not-resuscitate position.  Bryan Nolan referred to this as well, the expectation of relatives that something should be done.  As with all clinical decisions, the welfare of the patient must be first and foremost.  It is important we do not allow unethical or inappropriate practices to take precedence, such as slow coding or sham resuscitation, where there is a pretence for the family's sake of providing resuscitation.  In my view, that is unethical and inappropriate.  The Senator also spoke about the difficulty for staff who are caught in the middle when there is a difficulty with the family.  Again, why is there always a tendency to defer to the family, regardless of whether they have been heavily involved in the care of the patient, as opposed to the patient?  The staff might have concerns about capacity, which I have mentioned, and there might be legal confusion.  They might feel the next-of-kin has some type of legal authority, which they do not.  They also do not wish to have confrontation, which is perfectly understandable.  They need to have personal strength of commitment to put the patient first.  It is all about communication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400015#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Madden"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384427700,"counter":637,"content":"<p>A question was posed to me about bereavement.

I would make two points.  The legal requirements needing to be changed will change with initiatives 1 and 2.  There are some advantages to coming last.  We are the only regulator in the world that registered three levels of professional: EMT paramedics, advanced paramedics and UK-registered paramedics.  Other places do not do that.  We have had the tight regulations and the laws changed.  Practitioners in Ireland must practise at the sharp end.  They need to be working for an organisation approved by us, whether it is private, voluntary or statutory, they need to be registered on our register, and they need to be acting under our guidelines and under the medicines regulation.  That is a triple-lock mechanism that no one else has.  In terms of the sharp end, we are getting there.  Do we have enough?  We want more but we are getting there.  I am very happy with the sharp end.<\/p><p>  On the nuances, the professional always makes the decision.  I remember when I had just graduated I was told by the hospital that there was a ship at sea and they needed someone to go out to treat a person who had had a heart attack.  We found out that a team of sailors had been resuscitating the person.  It was somebody who was cold.  We did not tell them that what they had done was stupid.  We told them that we thought he had passed.  We did 20 minutes resuscitation and we finished.  If that is done professionally, discretion is used and there is good training, that will happen.  The bigger risk to me is if someone is doing that because they are scared of litigation whereas the employee should be scared of litigation if somebody is 40 years old and healthy and could survive and one has one's people deployed on a cold body.  That is where the litigation would be.<\/p><p>  That aside, I would not be genuine if I did not say that those are the two biggest issues for me at the sharp end.  We are even setting up a retrieval service and the HSE has asked me to lead on that.  We have a neonatal service that everyone knows brings in sick patients.  Every other country has had these wall to wall for ten to 15 years, but we will be going 24-7 with neonatal and probably before the end of the year.  We also have money to establish these for adults in Cork and Galway, seven days a week daytime, and in Dublin.  We are also setting it up in paediatrics.  Before long, not only are we getting the pre-hospital sharp end, we are getting the in-hospital process.<\/p><p>  There is too much discussion about response times.  The ones in the law are flawed and meaningless.  The biggest risk to patients currently, and we have only snapshot data, is what happens between hospitals.<\/p><p>  The second point is that this country's system is logjammed.  If one goes to any hospital in the country - Dublin or elsewhere - one has the wrong patients in the wrong places and they cannot move.  There are people in one hospital who need to be in another because they cannot be looked after in the hospital they are in.  They miss the window.  When they are being transported, they are at greater risk of a bad outcome and dying than those in the community making a 999 call.  That is where I see the risk.  That is in the mix for consideration under the service plan.  It was in the mix last year.  The bid to support it did not get up.<b><\/b>We are not talking about the sharp end.  We want EMTs with only four to six weeks training.  It is a low level of staff cost and a low level of ambulance cost.  In terms of this year, if it does not come out now, if we do not get them this year, I will be thinking that next year the same thing will happen.  Everybody will be logjammed.  The system will be stuck.  I am very nervous about how it will come out in the process this year, but I will be around every year from here and the issue of providing a sufficient number of ambulances will be constantly to the forefront until it is fixed.<\/p><p>  We have a legacy where the thinking was that if someone was in a hospital they were safe and that if they were in the community and they ring 999, they were not safe but the opposite is the case.  If someone is in a hospital or between hospitals, in my view they are at greatest risk.  In terms of the system here, I agree with every bit of the reconfiguration of acute services, including the grouping of places and linking those.  Every bit of it is sound, but if the ambulances are not put in to do it, it cannot be unlocked and these people will not end up where they need to be.  If the members visit any hospital - Letterkenny, Monaghan, which I have visited, and down to the Beara Peninsula - everyone will tell them they have somebody who needs to be in another hospital because if he is not, he will not get his pPCI and will instead get open surgery or medication.  They are out of their depth where this person is concerned but the right hospital does not have a bed while there is a person in the right hospital which the original hospital wants back.  It is logjammed.  That will be the case every year until it is fixed.  It would be disingenuous of me if I said otherwise.<\/p><p>  My priorities and what we are working on are the two issues to which I referred.  They do not need a change in the law.  They just need consensus, we will get there, and the committee members can help.  Until the other issue is resourced, that is it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400016#T01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoff King"},{"type":"speech","time":1384428300,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I call Professor Patrick Plunkett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111400016#T01400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384428300,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I do not know where to start.

That said, above all there is an attitudinal element which we can address much more effectively, certainly in the emergency departments, that it is the patient's pain.  It is not one's own pain on which one must decide whether one is giving enough or not enough or one must not give any more.  One must interface with the patient who will say when they have enough.

I think it is the recognition that staff are our greatest resource and that we need to invest in them.  There is high expectations of our staff in very challenging and demanding environments.  We really must invest in our staff.   Some of the challenges we are faced with is to try to get staff released for 20 minutes, 30 minutes or one hour in our busy clinical environment.<\/p><p>  In regard to investing in the training of staff, that is a key priority but we have to look at some of the statistics that came out in the end-of-life audit, where some 56% of staff were distressed or troubled after their experience and exposure of dealing with families and dying patients.  We do very little to support our staff.  That is an issue that needs to be looked at as part of a national bereavement strategy.  Senator Colm Burke referred to death happening in areas where that does not normally happen.  When one is in an acute medical area, where there would be high numbers of deaths every week and sometimes very difficult scenarios, it is very difficult for staff to keep continuing.  That must be acknowledged.  We need to mind our staff because they are our resource and none of this will happen unless we invest in them as well as mind them.

I  draw the attention of members to the comments by the actor Gabriel Byrne to Simon Carswell in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> of 13 November.  Perhaps he was resonating the points made by Professor Plunkett's today.  Telepathy is good.<\/p><p>  I thank all the witnesses.  Over the past number of weeks we have had six sessions to look at the end-of-life care in Ireland and what can be done to ensure that people of all ages can end his or her life in a way that is dignified.  We have heard from a wide range of experts, including academics, practitioners, policy makers, advocates, service provides and charitable groups.  All who appeared before this committee shared their experience with us and gave us an insight into the reality of death, the humanity in our society and also the inevitable outcome that awaits us all.<\/p><p>  At the outset of these hearings I made the comment that we have a long tradition of dealing sympathetically and respectfully with end-of-life care and bereavement.  I hope these hearing in the past number of weeks have shown the importance of that caring and respectful approach.  While we have a great deal more to do, it highlights the need for the same approach to be reflected in health policy so that the health services can provide that type of end-of-life care.<\/p><p>  Both Professors Plunkett and Twomey outlined how people die, that 25% of all deaths occur at home, the focus on hospice care, the issue of long-term residential facilities and acute hospitals.  They underlined the multiplicity of places in which death occurs.  However the issue that does not get noticed in public health policy is that death is a reality for all sectors in the health system, no matter what part.  It is not just confined to one section.  It is important that a comprehensive policy of end-of-life care be developed in which we reflect the totality of the health system and make it workable across all sectors of the health service.<\/p><p>  One of the key points I learned from our witnesses is that providing quality and respectful end-of-life care is not just about money and resources but about care, consideration and communication, the expression of the human element and taking time to talk to people.  It is very often, as has been borne out strongly today, an issue of a respectful environment for the patient, in which he or she can have conversations, say goodbyes and provide space and support for loved ones and families to grieve in the immediate aftermath of the death.
