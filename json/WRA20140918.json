One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel.  The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA).  In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces.  This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct.  Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. <br\/><br\/>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the PDF after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.<br\/><br\/>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<br\/><br\/>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  I understand that discussions have been taking place with the Representative Association under a special Subcommittee of Conciliation Council.As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.The need for continuing recruitment to the Defence Forces of young and fit men and women so that the Defence Forces can discharge all the roles assigned to them by Government, both at home and overseas is an issue of which I need to be cognisant.It was for this very reason that this policy was introduced in the first place. <br\/><br\/>I would not like to pre-empt or second guess the outcome of current discussions at Conciliation Council and it would not be appropriate for me to comment publicly on the matter at this time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800041#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naval Service Operations","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800042#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[34539\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800042#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the position regarding Ireland&rsquo;s naval base allowing non-manned aeroplanes or drones to land.","asker":"998","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>The Defence Forces currently operate an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System, commonly referred to as UAVs.

The Green Paper noted the requirement for a UN resolution as part of the &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo; reflects the central importance of the UN in granting legitimacy to peace support and crisis management missions. The Green Paper also noted that at the same time, the &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo; also constitutes a self imposed, legal constraint on the State&rsquo;s sovereignty in making decisions about the use of its armed forces.<\/p><p>  The Green Paper recognised that on balance the advantages of retaining the &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo; mechanism can be seen as outweighing the disadvantages.

The current deployment, the 44th Irish Infantry Group UNDOF, comprises 130 troops and consists of a Force Reserve Company and support elements. Their role includes the provision of a Quick Reaction Force which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility.    Since its establishment in 1974, UNDOF has successfully supervised the implementation of the Disengagement Agreement between the Israeli and Syrian forces, maintaining an area of separation between the forces which is over 75 kilometres long. The mission has also been successful in supporting the efforts of the international community both in the Golan Heights region of Syria and in the broader Middle-East region. <\/p><p>  Since 1974, the mandate of UNDOF has been renewed every six months. Over the years, while recommending the next extension of the mandate, the UN Secretary-General has repeatedly observed that unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East problem was reached, he considered the continued presence of UNDOF in the area to be essential.<\/p><p>  The escalation of the present conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic has affected the UNDOF area of operations significantly. In light of the evolving security situation in the mission area, I have requested the UN to review the capacity of the mission to fulfill its mandate. The UN Security Council will be briefed later today on UNDOF and how the mission can respond to the changed circumstances.  Already, there has been fundamental realignment of the mission over the weekend reflecting the situation on the ground. The Force Headquarters, including the Irish contingent, have been redeployed from Camp Faouar to Camp Ziouani, which is on the Israeli side of the separation zone, in response to developments on the ground.<\/p><p>  The outcome of the review by the UN may result in significant changes to the mission that will permit Ireland&rsquo;s continued support and participation. The Irish contribution to UNDOF is an important element of the Force.  In this regard, I would like to pay tribute to the members of the 44th Infantry Group in their role as UNDOF&rsquo;s Quick Reaction Force in discharging their duties effectively in the challenging operating conditions they face in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800043#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Missions","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800043#WRC01125"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[34554\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800043#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of Permanent Defence Forces personnel currently serving on overseas missions; the type and location of each mission, including the lead organisation; if authorisation for participation is kept under review in view of the changing security context at various locations; if he will provide the procedures that would be followed for the withdrawal of personnel if the risks involved exceeded acceptable levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The term overholder is used to describe former members of the Defence Forces and their families who refused to leave married quarters, when obliged to do so.   Presently, there are twenty four overholders remaining on military lands within the Curragh Camp.  This represents a relatively small group in relation to the large number of military personnel who occupied such quarters over the years but who returned the properties to the Department on their retirement, as they were required to do.  <\/p><p>  Nine of the overholders referred to above do not pay charges in respect of their use of the property and in some cases there are arrears due for the use of electricity.  <\/p><p>  The situation of overholders continuing to occupy married quarters is no longer sustainable and measures to resolve this are being progressed.  My Department is therefore, in accordance with normal procedures, seeking vacant possession of married quarters which are being overheld and will continue to do so until the overholding issue is resolved.<\/p><p>  In the period since January 2013, thirteen properties which were being overheld on military lands within the Curragh Camp have been returned by the occupants.  <\/p><p>  Officials from my Department have met with a number of overholders to discuss and examine what assistance can be provided in order to bring about a resolution to the problem of overholding.  From these discussions and from its records the Department is aware that a small number of occupants may be particularly vulnerable due to their personal circumstances.  The process of engagement with overholders is ongoing and the Department will need time to consider all the issues raised on a case by case basis.  It is hoped that the discussions will provide an opportunity for both sides to work together in order to bring about a resolution to the problem.  <\/p><p>  The Department has also initiated discussions with Kildare County Council to determine whether there was a possibility of a joint initiative to provide solutions to the overholding issues in the Curragh.  The Council indicated that, due to budgetary constraints their policy now is to lease suitable properties in order to provide accommodation for those who meet the criteria for social housing assistance.  The Department have advised overholders where appropriate to apply for social housing and have supplied supporting documentation for the Council when requested.<\/p><p>  Any initiative to resolve overholding must support and complement the current policy which dates back to 1997 of withdrawing from the provision of married quarters.<\/p><p>  It is preferable not to have to use legal means to obtain vacant possession of the properties concerned.  However, the ongoing illegal occupation of military property by those who have no entitlement to do so cannot be supported.

The term was previously used to describe a feature of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme and referred to aspects of the means assessment which applied to certain categories of self-employed fishermen and were discontinued under measures in Budget 2012 and Budget 2013.  Self-employed fishermen who are in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance may qualify for JobsPlus subject to general scheme criteria being met.  Eligibility can be established online using the jobsplus website or by calling to one of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo centres or local offices.<\/p><p>  At the end of August 2014, 2,236 employers received payments in respect of 2,952 employees who were previously long term jobseekers.

rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 73,800 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.<br\/><br\/>Rent supplement expenditure from 2008 to August 2014 is provided in the attached tabular statement. Statistics in relation to rent supplement expenditure by category or household type are not available. Overall expenditure on rent supplement has decreased from a maximum spend of over &euro;516 million in respect of over 97,000 recipients in 2010 to some &euro;373 million in respect of almost 80,000 recipients in 2013. Changes in expenditure are attributable to variations in recipient numbers experienced during the economic crisis, the transfer of recipients to social housing, changes in maximum rent limits and increases to the minimum contribution payable by rent supplement tenants.<br\/><br\/>The most recent review of maximum rent limits was completed in June 2013 with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013. Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%. Separate to the county limits, higher rent limits were provided for North Kildare which were increased by up to 25% for single persons and up to 10% for families.<br\/><br\/>A rent limit review has commenced within the Department and will feed into the budgetary process. This review involves a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the Central Statistics Office rental indices, relevant Departments and Agencies, and non-Government organisations such as Threshold, Focus Ireland and the Society of St Vincent de Paul.<br\/><br\/>The current difficulties in the rental market and the difficulties faced by prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, is a shortage of supply of suitable properties in areas of high demand including the areas in Kildare referred to by the Deputy.  I would be concerned that raising rent limits is not the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students. The Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy with the aim of increasing housing supply generally.  <br\/><br\/>Statistics are not maintained on the numbers of recipients that have had their rent supplement withdrawn due to the rent being over the limits or the number of notifications issued as referred to by the Deputy. However, I can assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met. Discretionary powers are available to the CWS staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant. A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy, has recently been circulated. <br\/><br\/>In view of the current supply difficulties, the Department has agreed a protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf. Since the launch of this initiative in mid-June 2014, approximately 115 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.<br\/><br\/>The fact that almost 74,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement shows that a significant number of landlords are accommodating and negotiating with applicants of the scheme. The Department is aware that some leading property websites ask potential landlords to indicate whether they will accept rent supplement tenancies. It is the Department&rsquo;s expressed position that this practice should cease and the matter has been raised with the leading websites.<br\/><br\/><b>Rent Supplement:  End of Year Recipient Numbers &amp;amp; Expenditure: 2008 to Date<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Recipients<\/th><th>Cost &euro;000<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>74,038<\/td><td>440,548<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>93,030<\/td><td>510,751<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010 <\/td><td>97,260<\/td><td>516,538<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>96,803<\/td><td>502,747<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>87,684<\/td><td>422,536<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 <\/td><td>79,788<\/td><td>372,909<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>End August 2014<\/td><td>74,080<\/td><td>229,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800045#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Schemes","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800045#WRE00950"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[35028\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800045#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the numbers of persons here who are not in education, training or employment and who do not qualify for a social welfare payment; if these figures are available broken down by local authority area; if so, if she will provide same in tabular form; if she will list the data sources her Department uses when determining an accurate figure for persons who fall into this category, including information categories from the Central Statistics Office; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>My Department does not collate information relating to the numbers of persons who are not in education, training or employment and who do not qualify for a social welfare payment. <\/p><p>  The Central Statistics Office, as part of their Quarterly National Household Survey, reports on persons in Ireland by their Principal Economic Status.

While the contribution conditions applying to the various insurance benefit schemes can vary, a claimant must, in general, have<br\/><br\/>a. Paid a minimum number of weekly contributions and<br\/><br\/>b. Have a certain number of contributions or credits over a specified period; in the case of short-term benefits this is the relevant tax year, while in the case of long-term benefits (e.g. pensions) this is on the basis of the yearly average number of contributions and\/or credits over the person's working life.<br\/><br\/>Credits cannot be used to satisfy condition (a). Thus, credits are only of value to a person who satisfies this &quot;paid contribution&quot; test. <br\/><br\/>Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer's Allowance in the following circumstances:<br\/><br\/>- if the claimant was employed and paid PRSI contributions prior to receiving Carer's Allowance s\/he may be entitled to credits. If, however, there is a gap of two years in the claimant's insurance record, credits are not valid until at least 26 PRSI contributions have been paid.<br\/><br\/>- if the claimant was in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance (provided s\/he has at least one paid Class A PRSI contribution) Jobseeker's Benefit or Illness Benefit immediately prior to claiming Carer's Allowance.<br\/><br\/>In addition under the Homemakers Scheme, which was introduced in 1994, a person who gives up work to take care of a child under age 12 or an incapacitated person over age 12 can be classified as a homemaker. Complete years spent out of the workforce looking after a child or an incapacitated person, are disregarded when working out entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory). <br\/><br\/>This scheme was introduced to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties - up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age and\/or an incapacitated person can be disregarded.  <br\/><br\/>However, it is important to note that the scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied. <br\/><br\/>For those who do not satisfy these conditions, and have an income need, a means-tested State pension may be available.  <br\/><br\/>It is planned that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory). The proposed date for the introduction of this change is 2020, but this may be subject to change.  <br\/><br\/>The total contributions approach (whereby the pension payment will be based on the number of contributions paid and credited) will remove the current anomaly whereby people can achieve a higher average contribution rate, and thus a higher level of pension, even where they have a lower total number of contributions paid. This move will bring transparency and fairness to the eligibility for pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800045#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Customer Charters","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800045#WRE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[35042\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800045#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide a list of the incidences in the past two calendar years and to date in 2014 where a complaint was registered against an employee of her Department by a member of the public who was interacting with her Department over a social welfare payment; if she will categorise these incidences by type of complaint; by location; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s Customer Charter and Action Plan 2013-2015 sets out the level of service customers can expect to receive.

This is resulting in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices, which will provide a full range of services, including the CWS and these will, in general, be available in one location.<br\/><br\/>The Department is currently examining the operation of all its services in the context of the Pathways to Work commitments and the development of Intreo services nationally. As part of this programme of change approximately 430 CWS satellite clinics were closed over the last 3 year period facilitating the redeployment of some 300 staff to activation and case management support services, with the majority coming from the CWS. There are approximately 200 full time equivalents administering the rent supplement scheme. Statistics are not maintained in relation to the number of CWS staff withdrawn or redeployed on a county basis or who have retired or been promoted in the past three years. <br\/><br\/>A tabular statement is attached showing the number of CWS clinics that were closed from October 2011 to date in 2014 on a county basis. A detailed listing providing details of the closed clinics by town will issue separately to the Deputy. <br\/><br\/>Where the CWS has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.  In general, this means that the frequency of available public clinics is increased.

With this type of policy the benefit or surrender value is linked to the value of units in the life company unit fund.\u00a0 As the value of the units increase so does the value of the policy, or, as the value of the funds fall so does the value of the policy.\u00a0 If the fund achieves this assumed rate of investment return then the policy should be able to sustain the current level of cover.\u00a0 If however the fund does not achieve this anticipated return, the encashment value of the policy depletes as the cost of covering the benefits exceeds the premium being paid.\u00a0 If this continues, the encashment value of the policy could run out eventually and the life cover would cease. These are\u00a0distinguished from &quot;Term Life&quot; insurance policies which pay a specified amount on death during a\u00a0fixed period of time such as 10 or 20 years and have a fixed premium unless index linked. <\/p><p>  As a Unit Linked Whole of Life policy does not provide a guaranteed benefit throughout life for a fixed premium, most firms state in their current terms and conditions of these policies that they will carry out regular post sale reviews.\u00a0 The post sale policy review will determine if it is likely that the premium currently being paid can maintain the current level of life cover until the next review date.\u00a0 If it seems likely that the fund value of the policy will not be sufficient to maintain the policy to the next review date, the firm will recommend that the policyholder either increase their premium or reduce the level of life cover provided by the policy.<\/p><p>The Central Bank Consumer Protection Code was introduced in 2006.\u00a0 It requires firms to act honestly fairly and professionally in the best interest of consumers and prohibits firms from misleading customers.

Over the course of the consultation process on the new Rural Development Programme, which extended for a year and half, we have adapted and rebalanced our proposals for commonages quite significantly in the light of those concerns.  A Commonage farmer shall apply individually for GLAS declaring that s\/he\u00a0is complying with the GLAS Commonage Management Plan (CMP).  The CMP is to be submitted by an advisor i.e. one advisor and one plan per commonage. <br\/><br\/>Where DAFM identifies that the 50% level of active shareholders cannot be reached the matter will be referred to the Commonage Implementation Committee for consideration and recommendation.<br\/><br\/>I think it is particularly important to point out that the 50% requirement is based on active farmers only, i.e. those actually grazing the commonage.  To give an example, if there are 20 shareholders on a commonage, and 15 are claiming shares under the Single Payment Scheme, but only 10 of those are actively grazing the land at present, the 50% requirement to trigger priority access to GLAS is just <b>5 farmers<\/b>. <br\/><br\/>I do not believe that a minimum participation requirement based on this model is insurmountable but where real difficulties are being encountered the farmers concerned can approach the Commonage Implementation Committee for assistance.

In 2013, the value of dairy exports increased by 1 5% to some &euro;3 billion for the first time.  Inevitably there will be fluctuation in the market and more recently we are seeing the combined effect of an increase in global supply and the Russian agri-food products ban.  The direct effect of the loss of the Russian market is a concern but equally, if not more important, is the issue of the displacement effect for European exports and the need to find alternative markets, with the loss of a market as large as Russia having knock-on effects for all EU producers. <br\/><br\/>In response to this issue, the European Commission ha s promptly introduced APS (Aids to Private Storage) for Skimmed Milk Powder, Butter and Cheese, and extended the Intervention period for butter and Skimmed Milk Powder to the end of the year.

I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.

While no mission is without risk I am satisfied that appropriate security measures are in place for all Defence Forces personnel serving overseas.<br\/><br\/>Troops selected for overseas service, including those currently deployed to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) mission, undergo a rigorous programme of mission specific training, which included Chemical, Biological, Radiation and Nuclear training. Such training, which is updated on an ongoing basis in the light of increased threat, has been designed to allow Defence Force personnel to carry out their tasks and to provide for their protection. Defence Forces personnel serving on all overseas missions are equipped with the most modern and effective equipment. This equipment enables troops to carry out the roles assigned, as well as providing the required protection specific to the mission. <br\/><br\/>As regards Defence Forces participation in the UNDOF mission, the civil war in Syria has demanded changes to the manner in which the mission carries out its current mandate. Indeed, the ongoing viability of the mission has been called into question by recent events in the mission area.  While Ireland remains committed to the mission, at the same time, I have requested that the UN fundamentally review the capacity of the mission to fulfil its mandate in the light of the ongoing civil war in Syria. I have personally discussed the review with the Under Secretary General in the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations.The UN Security Council will be briefed on the mission in detail today by the UN Secretary-General and the views of the Force Commander about the future structure of the mission will also be taken into account during this Security Council session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800051#WRL01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Properties","counter":310,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800051#WRL01550"},{"type":"question","counter":311,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[35060\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800051#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which the various military installations decommissioned over the past number of years have been disposed of or continue to be used for alternative purposes; if rent is payable on foot of any such use; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":312,"content":"<p>My Department has been engaged on an ongoing programme of barrack consolidation since 1998.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel. The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995. In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the PDF after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. <\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.<\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.<\/p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. I understand that discussions have been taking place with the Representative Association under a special Subcommittee of Conciliation Council.

The following tables contain the above mentioned strength, broken down into Army, Naval Service and Air Corps by gender and rank groupings.  The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.<br\/><br\/>A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces including:<br\/><br\/>the introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants,&middot; special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment,&middot; there is balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards,&middot; all promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit,&middot; A Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces.<br\/><br\/>I am advised that unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties.

To this end, as part of the recent recruitment campaign for enlisted personnel and the Reserve, specific efforts were made to increase the number of female applicants. These efforts included school visits, media engagement including national and local radio, targeting sports clubs and use of social media. At the closing date for this recruitment campaign on 9 April 2014 there were 755 Female applicants or 10.3% out of a total of 7,295 applicants for the Permanent Defence Force and 320 female applicants or 14.9% out of a total of 2,146 applicants for the Reserve Defence Force. On the face of it these figures appear to be disappointing. However, I believe that a key issue in recruiting and retaining female personnel lies in societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers.

RIA currently provides full board accommodation and ancillary services to just over 4,300 persons in 34 centres across the State.<\/p><p>  In relation to statistical queries such as these, it is important to state that RIA is keen to provide as much detail as is practicable on the system which it is charged with operating.  Extensive statistical information is on its website - www.ria.gov.ie including Annual Reports covering the years from 2007 to 2013 inclusive. These Annual Reports provide a variety of information, including a breakdown of the numbers of adults and children in each direct provision centre and the length of time persons, overall, have been residing in the direct provision system.  This is also provided on a centre by centre basis, and the counties in which these centres are located are identified in these reports.  The latest 2013 Report has all of the latest available information sought in these questions.<\/p><p>  More generally, I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed. The Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 includes a commitment to reduce the length of time the applicant spends in the system through the establishment of a single applications procedure, to be introduced by way of a Protection Bill as a matter of priority.  Moreover, there is a further commitment to establish an Independent Working Group to report to Government on improvements with the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers. My intention is to proceed with the establishment of that Working Group in the near future whose mandate will include reporting back to Government on improvements to direct provision.  I am, in advance of establishing the Working Group, holding a round table on 19 September to provide non-governmental organisations active in the field of asylum the opportunity to outline the key issues for them in relation to the State's current arrangements for asylum seekers.

It broadly describes a range of non-violent crimes that people in positions of responsibility and trust commit for their own personal gain. It can cover fraud, embezzlement, insider trading on the stock market, bribery, corruption and regulatory offences in specialist fields such as financial activity, occupational health and safety, environmental protection, and food safety.  My Department has responsibility for legislation addressing some aspects of white collar crime including fraud and corruption.  Other aspects, such as insider trading, Companies Acts offences and environmental offences fall within the responsibility of other Government Departments.<br\/><br\/>There is extensive legislation on the statute book addressing white collar and corporate crime and amendments to this legislation are also considered in the light of the experience of law enforcement agencies such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in operating the legislation and in light of relevant court rulings.  Where there is an identified requirement for additional legislative provisions to further enhance existing provisions in the law, I will not hesitate in bringing forward proposals.  <br\/><br\/>I would draw the Deputy's particular attention to the Criminal Justice Act 2011, as a recent example of such developments in white collar crime legislation, and one which represents an important step in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle white collar crime.  Its main purpose is to facilitate the more effective investigation of white collar crime and to reduce associated delays.  The Act provides for new procedures to facilitate Garda access to essential information and documentation to assist in current and future investigations of white collar crime.  The Act is targeted at specified serious and complex offences (&ldquo;relevant offences&rdquo;) attracting a penalty of at least 5 years imprisonment, including offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption. The Act will provide vital assistance to the Garda&iacute; in the completion of current investigations as well as providing assistance to them in investigations undertaken in the future.<br\/><br\/>Another recent provision of relevance to white collar crime is Part 5 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013.  It makes provision for the selection of up to 15 jurors to serve in a criminal trial which is likely to last more than 2 months, with 12 jurors to be selected to consider the verdict.  These provisions, which give effect to a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recent Report on Jury Service, are of relevance to lengthy trials involving fraud or other complex financial matters where there is a risk of jurors becoming unavailable during the course of a protracted trial.<br\/><br\/>While the breadth and diversity of the issues faced in addressing serious, organised and white collar crime are such that no one piece of legislation could effectively address it in all its facets, the overall body of legislation in place is comprehensive and, as I have outlined, is continuously under review and development in light of operational experience and other relevant considerations.<b><\/b><br\/><br\/>In terms of forthcoming legislation, the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010 will be replaced by the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill which will be published in the coming months.  The Bill will:<br\/><br\/>- replace and update the offences of giving and receiving bribes contained in the old legislation<br\/><br\/>- address the bribery of foreign public officials<br\/><br\/>- provide for the liability of corporate bodies for the corrupt actions of their directors, employees and agents  <br\/><br\/>- include discrete offences outlawing trading in influence<br\/><br\/>- take account of the Mahon Tribunal recommendations to criminalise the making of payments knowingly or recklessly to athird party who intends to use them as bribes<br\/><br\/>The Bill is also intended to enhance the ability of the DPP to bring prosecutions by providing presumptions of corrupt gifts or payments such as:<br\/><br\/>- where an interested party makes a payment to a public official;<br\/><br\/>- where a public official has failed to declare interests as required by ethics legislation; and<br\/><br\/>- where an official accepts a gift in breach of ethical or disciplinary codes.<br\/><br\/>Penalties of up to 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment and unlimited fines are envisaged for persons convicted on indictment.  It is also intended to allow a judge to order a public official convicted of an offence to forfeit their office and exclude them from seeking public office for a period of years.  These forfeiture provisions will apply to senior office holders as well as a wide range of civil and public servants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800053#WRN02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Magdalen Laundries","counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800053#WRN02600"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[35036\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800053#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent of compliance among religious orders and institutions in relation to the transfer of records and archives relating to the Magdalene laundry redress process; the orders which have yet to comply; the number of requests that have been made in each case; the options that are available to the redress board to ensure that records are made available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The free preschool provision represents an annual investment of approximately &euro;175 million.<br\/><br\/>The free preschool initiative has been welcomed by the child care sector and is a very positive development in the area of preschool care and education.

However, this would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the preschool provision is key to good outcomes for children.

Last October, the Government approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the <i>Steering Group on a National Substance Misuse Strategy.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The aim is to reduce alcohol consumption to the OECD average by 2020 (i.e. 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per capita per annum) and to reduce the harms associated with the misuse of alcohol.  A broad range of complementary measures is required to achieve this goal.  The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing, regulation of the marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products.  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing and is hoped to publish a General Scheme of a Bill in the Autumn.<br\/><br\/>Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels  per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  This is a targeted measure, designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  Its primary function is to discourage at risk levels of alcohol consumption and is targeted in particular at harmful and hazardous drinking.  The Government has also introduced new low risk limits for alcohol consumption based on the Irish standard drink of 10 grams of alcohol i.e. 112 grams of pure alcohol per week for women (11 standard drinks) and 168 grams of pure alcohol per week for men (17 standard drinks).<br\/><br\/>The other measures set out in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, 2012<\/i>, were endorsed by Government and are to be progressed by the relevant Departments and organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800057#WRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme Eligibility","counter":487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800057#WRR00400"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[34905\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800057#WRR00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the committee which is currently reviewing eligibility for medical cards will consider the question of eligibility for long-term illness cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":489,"content":"<p>The Government decided that, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Public Expenditure, the Minister for Health would revert to Government with options for providing eligibility for a range of health services on the basis of specific and defined medical conditions.

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). <br\/><br\/>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. Due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment in which the Government targeted additional savings in health expenditure of &euro;619 million in 2014, which must be achieved while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible, the HSE decided it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br\/><br\/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of Fampridine.

'Mental health difficulties' are considered to be encompassed within the area of behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention was launched in January 2013. It was developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  A similar document for primary schools will be available shortly. <\/p><p>  The Well-Being Guidelines provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. The Guidelines have been developed to bring coherence to and build upon the multitude of practices that are already in place in schools to promote well-being. They emphasise the need to use a co-ordinated whole-school approach in the promotion of positive mental health. Support for schools' implementation of the guidelines is shared by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS), the Special Education Support Service (SESS) and the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS).   The work of these services complements the work of the Health Promotion and Information Officers of the HSE in their health promotion work which encompasses mental health promotion.<\/p><p>  The guidelines highlight the fact that school personnel are the best placed professionals to support and work sensitively with students. The NEPS psychologist, can support school staff, in particular guidance counsellors, in the identification of students with mental health difficulties and can advise schools on the development of policies related to student well-being and on issues such as bullying. Copies of the post-primary guidelines have been circulated to schools authorities.<\/p><p>  The guidelines outline how mental health difficulties are addressed through appropriate curriculum delivery in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers. In addition other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally are available to schools. Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth which is pertinent to addressing mental health difficulties. <\/p><p>  Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle since 2003 and is designed to promote positive mental health. Comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support is accessed through the PDST which provides training and advice for schools and a resource directory.  My Department has also issued guidelines to schools on the development of whole-school policies in the areas such as anti-bullying, relationship and sexuality education, substance misuse, managing critical incidents, whole-school guidance planning etc. which are also important in promoting positive mental health.<\/p><p>  The Framework for Junior Cycle, published in October 2012, is underpinned by 8 principles one of which is &quot;Wellbeing&quot;, Through Wellbeing the student experience will contribute directly to their physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing and resilience. Learning takes place in a climate focused on collective wellbeing of school, community and society. The Framework contains 24 Statements of Learning which students should experience. One of these statements aims to ensure that the student takes action to safeguard and promote his\/her wellbeing and that of others.  In addition, there are six key skills required for successful learning by students across the curriculum and for learning beyond school. One of the six key skills of Junior Cycle is Staying Well.<\/p><p>  As part of the revised Junior Cycle, short courses are being prepared by the NCCA in SPHE and PE.   These courses may be assessed as a part of the School Certificate in the new Junior Cycle.<\/p><p>  My Department's National Educational Psychological Service was established in 1999 to support the personal, social and educational development of all children in primary and post-primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice, having particular regard for children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>  NEPS psychologists can support the mental health and well-being of students and teachers at all levels of the school system. The NEPS service provides direct and indirect support to individual students through consultation and casework.<\/p><p>  The service also provides systems level support to schools which aims to be preventative and developmental and promotes a continuum of support approach for students with learning, social, emotional or behavioural difficulties. This approach is outlined in the publications Behaviour Emotional and Social Difficulties : A Continuum of Support (2010)   and A Continuum of Support Guidelines for Post-Primary Schools (2010) which include resource materials. <\/p><p>  NEPS also provides teacher support in implementing the Friends for Life programme. This programme uses a cognitive-behavioural approach to managing anxiety and has both primary and post-primary components. It is complementary to the SPHE curriculum. <\/p><p>  Student support is promoted in schools through year head and key tutor systems, home\/school links, etc. This is one of the key areas which is evaluated by the Inspectorate as part of a Whole School Evaluation. Psychologists support the student support team and NEPS has produced a booklet Student Support Teams in Post-Primary School which provides advice to schools on reviewing or establishing student support teams. NEPS psychologists will be actively engaging with schools in regard to this guidance in the course of the current academic year. <\/p><p>  An important role for NEPS psychologists is the provision of support and advice to schools in relation to managing critical incidents, i.e. traumas, which affect the school community. Each school has been provided with a copy of Responding to Critical Incidents Guidelines for Teachers and Resources Materials (2007).  NEPS psychologists have also guided many schools in the development of a critical incident management plan. This enables and empowers schools to respond effectively when an incident occurs.  Psychologists are available, upon request from school authorities, to provide advice and assistance to teachers and pupils in the aftermath of such incidents.<\/p><p>  NEPS liaises with HSE professionals such as the primary care teams and child and adolescent mental health teams to ensure that pupils with significant mental health difficulties are identified and referred to those teams for support.<\/p><p>  In the broader context my Department has allocated teaching resources to a number of Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS) units in order to provide for a level of continuity of education to be maintained for pupils who have been admitted to CAMHs units, and who may therefore miss time from their main school.<\/p><p>  My Department also allocates Home Tuition hours in order to provide a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic mental ill-health, are unable to attend school or are absent for a significant proportion of the school year and where the degree of absence is such that without supplementary instruction the pupil is unlikely to perform academically at the level appropriate to his\/her level of ability. <\/p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's  second question, he will I know, appreciate  that the term 'mental health difficulties' can represent a broad spectrum of problems and  conditions  relating to behavioural, emotional and social well-being of the student which can  range from mild to severe, and transient to enduring.  It is considered best practice that the provision of learning support needs for those involved should not involve labelling with a diagnosis. <\/p><p>  It would not therefore be feasible or necessarily useful, to provide a count of pupils who could be described in this loose category, nor does my Department have any facility to so do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800061#WRV00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800061#WRV00900"},{"type":"question","counter":619,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[35005\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800061#WRV01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of students that did not sit the State examinations in 2012 due to mental health issues; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":620,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[35006\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800061#WRV01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of students that did not sit the State examinations in 2013 due to mental health issues; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":621,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[35007\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800061#WRV01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of students that did not sit the State examinations in 2014 due to mental health issues; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":622,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[35008\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800061#WRV01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the procedures that are in place for a student with mental health difficulties to take State exams; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":623,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 to 223, inclusive, together.<br\/><br\/>The State Examinations Commission operates a scheme of Reasonable Accommodations (RACE scheme) designed to assist candidates with special needs at the certificate examinations.

The Local Government (Reorganisation) Act 1985 (section 27) was designed to allow for a basic element of proportionality in appointments to committees etc. However, many local authorities operate (as they are entitled under the Act) their own local and more finely developed arrangements to ensure fair play for all concerned.  It is, however, impossible to legislate fully for such good will and practice.  Therefore, it is all the more important with the SPCs that all local authorities adopt and implement (and be clearly seen by the public to do so) an approach which ensures that the various political and other interests represented on the full council are treated fairly, and equitably represented in the SPC system<\/i><i>&quot;<\/i>, and<br\/><br\/>-  <i>&quot;The allocation of SPC chairs should also reflect equitably the spread of elected representation on the council, including, as far as it is practical, be representative of each of the municipal districts in the local authority.The points made above as to good will and fair play are equally relevant here.  However, where agreement in this regard is not possible, the group of SPC chairs to be appointed should technically be treated for appointment purposes as if it constituted a separate committee, to ensure an equitable spread of representation as SPC chairs<\/i><i>&quot;<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The guidance which accompanied Circular LG 07\/201 was issued under &ndash;<br\/><br\/>- Section 133(10) of the Local Government Act 2001, as inserted by section 48 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, in relation to Corporate Policy Groups (CPGs), and  <br\/><br\/>- Section 54(2) of the Local Government Act 2001 in relation to Strategic Policy Committees (SPCs),<br\/><br\/>which empower the Minister to <i>&quot;issue general policy guidelines to local authorities&quot;<\/i>in relation to these matters.<br\/><br\/>Ensuring compliance with general policy guidelines issued under sections 54(2) and 133(10) of the Act, as required by the Local Government Act 2001, is a matter for individual local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800063#WRX01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Meters","counter":682,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800063#WRX01250"},{"type":"question","counter":683,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[35045\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800063#WRX01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to ensure that householders can read the reading on their water meters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":684,"content":"<p>The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the company the necessary powers to allow it to undertake the metering programme. <br\/><br\/>Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that the water meters in use by Irish Water comply with the Measur ing Instruments Directive. <i>In common with meters for other utility services, the meters remain the property of Irish Water.

The Scheme offered a basic and affordable broadband service to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated rural areas where the extent of broadband coverage by commercial operators, at the time the Scheme was launched in 2008, was deemed to be inadequate.

The nomination process is initiated by the State authorities drawing up a Tentative List of what they consider to be the most important heritage sites within their national boundaries.  A particular criterion is that a site must be considered to be of outstanding universal value, defined by UNESCO as meaning of &ldquo;cultural and or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity.&rdquo;Following a public consultation process and consideration by an expert advisory group, a new World Heritage List Tentative List for Ireland was approved and submitted to UNESCO in March 2010 containing the following sites:<br\/><br\/>- The Burren;<br\/><br\/>- The C&eacute;ide Fields and the North West Mayo Boglands;<br\/><br\/>- The Monastic City of Clonmacnoise and its Cultural Landscape;<br\/><br\/>- The Historic City of Dublin;<br\/><br\/>- Early Medieval Monastic Sites;<br\/><br\/>- The Royal Sites of Ireland; and<br\/><br\/>- The Western Stone Forts.<br\/><br\/>The case referred to had not been identified as a potential nomination at that stage and consequently was not part of the deliberations of the expert advisory group. <br\/><br\/>The nomination of a property to the World Heritage List is a significant undertaking that requires the development of comprehensive nomination documentation, including a management plan for the property.  Following submission of a nomination to UNESCO, it is evaluated by three advisory bodies:<br\/><br\/>- the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS);<br\/><br\/>- the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); and<br\/><br\/>- the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property(ICCROM).<br\/><br\/>Once the site has been evaluated, the intergovernmental World Heritage Committee makes the final decision regarding the site&rsquo;s inclusion on the World Heritage List.  <br\/><br\/>My Department&rsquo;s policy, which mirrors that of UNESCO, is that nominations for world heritage status must be driven in the first instance by local authorities and communities.  Against that background, my Department hosted a seminar in September 2013 for local authorities and community representatives from the areas of the sites on Ireland&rsquo;s current Tentative List to gauge the level of interest in the potential nominations and to clarify the significant research and other requirements involved in preparing nomination documentation.  Discussions have subsequently taken place in relation to all the sites on the Tentative List and my Department is working with stakeholders to consider and advance the next steps in these cases.  <br\/><br\/>As indicated above, the site referred to by the Deputy is not on the current Tentative List.  However, I am aware and encouraged by the extent of the local interest and support for the plans to bid for World Heritage inscription. My Department has met with local representatives on a number of occasions to discuss the advancement of the project and will continue to support these efforts to the greatest extent possible within available resources and in light of the need to service the nominations that are already on the existing Tentative List.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800067#WRBB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Leathanbhanda","counter":784,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800067#WRBB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":785,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[34943\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014091800067#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"cad iad na pleananna at&aacute; aici chun an tseirbh&iacute;s leathanbhanda a fheabhs&uacute; sa Ghaeltacht; an bhfuil s&iacute; ar an eolas faoin iliomad fadhbanna sa Ghaeltacht de dheasca easpa seirbh&iacute;se leathanbhanda; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.

The Strategy promotes a holistic, integrated approach to the Irish language which is consistent with international best practice. The Strategy sets out nine areas for action, including education, the Gaeltacht, the family, public services, the media, the economy, legislation and various cross-cutting initiatives.While my Department has the overarching responsibility for the Strategy, it is working in co-operation with other key stakeholders to implement the Strategy on an incremental basis. Progress is being made with regard to the systematic implementation of a wide range of measures under the Strategy within the resources available. In this regard, I would like to refer the Deputy to the progress report on the implementation of the Strategy during the period 2010-2013 and to the implementation plans published by the relevant Departments, 11 in total, in July 2013. These documents reveal a coherent approach to the implementation of the Strategy which will have a positive impact on the language in the long-term. It is envisaged that updates will be published shortly on the implementation of the Strategy by the relevant Departments over the past year. <br\/><br\/>Significant progress has been made by my own Department with regard to the implementation of the Strategy since the progress report was published last year.

Notices, which officially commence the language planning process, have been published in relation to 9 areas. Another 4 notices will be published in the autumn, with the final 13 notices being published in 2015.<br\/><br\/>- As a result of submissions received under a public consultation process, my Department will publish a list of towns shortly which could be recognised under the Act as Gaeltacht Service Towns.<br\/><br\/>- In the case of the Irish Language Networks, I understand that Foras na Gaeilge intends to announce its Irish Language Network Scheme later this year. <br\/><br\/>For the first time ever as part of the 2014 Revised Estimates, a specific allocation of &euro;0.5 million was provided to my Department for the Strategy.
