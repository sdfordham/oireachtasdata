Following the recent snow event and Storm Emma the residents of Portrane are extremely upset and worried about the further coastal erosion in the area.  There is a real risk now of many homes being flooded by the sea.  If the Minister of State saw the news last night, he would have seen Grainne Hannigan talking about her home which is now in grave danger.  Nothing real or practical has been done either by the Minister of State's Department or by Fingal County Council in many years and local residents are angry, frustrated and feel forgotten.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Canney, visited the area last year and saw at first hand the disastrous situation facing families in Portrane.  He gave a commitment to fund the necessary works.  I believe the Office of Public Works, OPW, operates a minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme under which applications for funding from local authorities are considered for measures up to &euro;750,000 in each instance.  Funding is also available for coastal erosion risk management studies.  The funding is made available for areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss of economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding.<\/p> <p>I know that Fingal County Council applied for and received funding of &euro;57,800 under the scheme in 2012 to carry out a coastal erosion risk management study of the coast from Portrane up to Rush.  However, none of the coastal protection measures assessed and recommended was implemented due to \"a combination of negative cost benefit ratio analysis and environment constraints\".  I believe no additional funding has been sought by Fingal County Council to put any measures in place in Portrane.  Perhaps the Minister of State could confirm whether Fingal County Council has made contact with his Department in recent days considering the extent of the damage in Portrane since Storm Emma and the recent snow event took place.  Their impact has been very dramatic and if the Minister of State saw the news last night he would understand how dramatic it has been.  If he did not see it, I would urge him to contact Mr. Paul Reid, the chief executive office of Fingal County Council, and ask him and his officials to prepare a report on Portrane as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>The former Minister of State, Deputy Canney, said last year that the funding is there.

If we can do something in Portrane, I believe it could be echoed around the entire coast of the country but we have to start thinking outside the box when it comes to coastal erosion.  We cannot have an application going in and being examined and investigated by the planners who then say the proposal does not blend in with the area.  I do not want that because we will never see anything done about coastal erosion.  For the past 20 years, Governments have ignored the problem of coastal erosion.  I am giving the Senator a firm commitment that I am not ignoring it because in 20 years from now I believe coastal erosion will be one of the biggest issues to hit this country.  We will lose many properties to the sea if we do not act now.<\/p><p>I visited Scotland recently where I was told that 97 properties had fallen into the sea as a result of this problem.

I am very conscious of the Minister's commitment to entrepreneurship in terms of education.  I see reference to education in his jobs document.  I want to keep this issue active.  It is very active in certain schools but in others there is not much of a focus on it and we have got to ask ourselves the reason for that.<\/p> <p>I have chosen to raise the five \"Es\", namely, engage, energise, enable, encourage and enterprise.  When I talk about engage I mean how we can engage and communicate with younger people about the importance of entrepreneurship, business and all that goes with that.  How can we energise, stimulate and be creative and innovative in terms of capacity building among young people regarding enterprise?  How can we enable and encourage our young children to think critically and in a bigger way about enterprise and the importance of commerce in their lives?  I believe we would find that young people by their nature are very enterprising.  I can speak for myself in that regard.  I recall keeping rabbits as a young child, brushing the Angora wool off them, sending it to the United Kingdom and getting British stamps in exchange, which I then had to sell to somebody else.  Where people are given a yearning and a learning for enterprise they respond very well.  I took the time to look at the Erasmus support, advanced learning and training opportunities, SALTO, participation EU programme and there are huge opportunities in that in terms of developing enterprise.<\/p> <p>Every school should foster entrepreneurial skills through new and creative ways of teaching and learning and all young people should benefit from at least one practical entrepreneurial experience before leaving secondary school.  I cite the mini-companies and mini campus companies.<\/p> <p>I do not doubt the Government's commitment in this area.  I do not doubt the Minister's commitment or that of the Department but we need to address the reason it is not happening to a greater extent in some schools and is happening in some schools over and above others.  It is an important part of education.  Education is more than formal learning.  There is informal learning also, and we know from experience that one can learn to be an entrepreneur.  I would like to hear the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#D00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.

This amazed me because, following the difficult period in our history between 2009 and 2014, the teeth of the crash, many people set up their own businesses for the first time.  Had they not done so, 100,000 fewer people would be at work.  Their impact, even in the worst of times, is significant.<\/p><p>In good times, it is important we nurture entrepreneurship and develop a strategy in that regard.  As the Senator rightly acknowledged, part of our action plan for this year is to produce a policy on entrepreneurship.  It is important that we do this.  We should set a national ambition that it will be part of our DNA to encourage entrepreneurship.  One point I learned from my last ministerial job was that a wide range of factors helps a country be entrepreneurial and develop new businesses.  One of them is culture and education.  Of course, there are the financial services area, access to finance, government policy and so forth.  However, the most enduring piece is to have the right attitude in encouraging people to take risks in their lives, cultivate curiosity, as well as the capacity to take on these issues, and that this is done from the earliest stage.<\/p><p>However, against the backdrop of the 2026 target to have the best education and training service in Europe, this is one area in which we need to do better.  Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe which has not explicitly developed an educational strategy for entrepreneurship.  This needs to be corrected.  To be fair, our education system, along with the reforms we have made to it, has greatly cultivated creativity, problem-solving and the sorts of skills which are important to entrepreneurship.  These are now embedded in our curriculum.  Increasingly in the junior cycle, there is much more emphasis on self-led learning where one is encouraging an entrepreneurial spirit in the learning activity itself.<\/p><p>We have a wide range of excellent initiatives of mini-companies and local enterprise offices cultivating school competitions.  There is much extracurricular work in encouraging young people to test their skills in an entrepreneurial environment.  We can do more, however.  We intend to develop guidelines for schools.  Clearly, much can be done within the curriculum itself, along with the promotion of extracurricular activities.  We can ensure education recognises the importance of risk-taking in its various curricular activities.  It must also increase the exposure to entrepreneurs at an appropriate age.  The transition year is a particularly important year when people can get exposure to different experiences.  This too should be developed.<\/p><p>I am looking forward to working with experts in the field and practitioners at the coalface to develop a policy which will set us in the right direction for the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#D00400","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#E00150","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>It is nice to be appreciated, Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#E00175","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","time":1520346600,"counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#E00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Bruton, for coming to the House to deal with this important issue.<\/p> <p>Doolin national school has 91 students.

We have learned by way of the reply to a parliamentary question tabled by the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, that the State provides a mere three specialist beds at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin for adults with this condition and that there are no dedicated child and mental health services, CAMHS, beds for those with eating disorders.  Anorexia nervosa is a disease with a shockingly high mortality rate of 20%.  Families throughout the country are crying out for inpatient beds for their children and young adults.  I brought a case to the attention of the Minister and provided him with a myriad of general practitioner reports recommending urgent inpatient treatment for the individual in question, but, to date, treatment has not been made available.  While the individual in question has spent a number of periods in St. James's Hospital receiving acute treatment, this does not address the underlying issue or provide a long-term remedy in treating the illness.<\/p> <p>Over the weekend we saw great work being done by the emergency services.  Many doctors also did stellar work on the ground on some of the coldest nights to ensure homeless persons were brought in from the cold.  I noted two specific cases involving homeless persons being committed to hospital.  Although I struggle with the concept of committal, I accept and understand doctors on the ground acted professionally and responsibly.  Through their hard work, for which I commend them, two people did not remain outside in the cold overnight when they might have died.  If inpatient beds can be provided in such circumstances, it must be possible to provide inpatient beds for persons with anorexia nervosa whose families are crying out for beds for them.  Unfortunately, the disease primarily affects women.  I have copies of multiple reports from a general practitioner which support the case for providing an inpatient bed for the individual in question, yet none has been made available. <\/p> <p>I congratulate the emergency services - members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the fire service, the ambulance service and the Irish Red Cross - as well as staff in the homeless agencies, farmers, local authority staff who cleared roads, the ESB, gas services and the many groups which came up trumps for us during the storm over the weekend.  I also welcome the decision of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, to double the fuel allowance paid last week.  Fuel poverty is among the toughest hardships experienced by people on the margins.  On my walkabouts I am constantly greeted by people at their door, especially on cold winter nights, who are wrapped up in layers of clothing and wearing gloves.  Many are ready to go to bed at 6 p.m. because they do not want to waste money on fuel for the evening.  Sadly, this sight is all too common.  While Members take a warm house for granted, many others do not.  The increase in the fuel allowance was welcome, but we must do more to eradicate fuel poverty and ensure that, rather than worrying about substantial fuel bills, elderly people will be comfortable in their homes in their time of need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#O00500","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Having watched television and listened to various politicians speak about the emergency weather conditions in recent days, I was surprised to note that few of them, if any, referred to the Defence Forces.

They do a damn good job and need to be respected for it.<\/p><p>I want to bring two issues to the attention of the Leader.  The first is that I would like to have a debate in the House on bullying in the workplace.  It is a serious issue.  It is known that I have an interest in this particular area but of late the number of people contacting me on the issue of bullying has been shocking.  I wonder why the workplace has become such an unhappy place.  I am not sure whether we should be talking to the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection but we need to have that debate.  I will divert to the Leader to choose the correct Minister.<\/p><p>The other issue I wanted to raise relates to an email I received this morning from a young man seeking car insurance.  He has a 2006 registered car worth approximately &euro;2,000 and he was quoted &euro;2,600 for an insurance policy on it.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, did a lot of work on that issue when he was at the Department of Finance.  Do we have an update on where it is going?  The young people of this country are being ripped off left, right and centre while insurance companies are paying dividends.  Last week a dividend of 34 cent on the share was paid to shareholders in FBD Insurance.  I think it was 34 cent.  It is amazing that FBD can pay dividends to shareholders but cannot provide reasonably priced insurance.  The price of insurance for that young man is more than the value of the car.  All he wants to do is to be legal on the road.  We need to have an update from the Department of Finance on that issue.  If the Leader had one, it would be very helpful.  I expect him to deal with that in his own time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#O00600","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Like many others I am glad to be back in Leinster House after the snow last week.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Taoiseach and his team on how Storm Emma was handled last week.  It is hard to get every single detail right in these emergency situations but, credit where credit is due, it was handled very well.  As many have said, enormous credit must also go to the front-line workers who kept vital services going when conditions were at their worst.  It was really inspiring to see doctors and nurses braving the snow to make it into hospitals and to see bus drivers getting people home safely.  There was a great sense of community in certain areas.  In my own area my neighbours came out and dug my car out at certain points.  One does not get to see one's neighbours that often but there was a nice sense of camaraderie.  I hope we remember this dedication and community support when people raise their concerns about resources and pay.<\/p> <p>One thing that does need to be improved however is communication from Irish Water.  We saw increased usage during the storm but it was very late in the day that Irish Water announced supply restrictions from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.  The notice was incredibly short and communication was not so widespread.   Many people were therefore not expecting to wake up this morning with no water.  It would be good if the Minister could ensure that Irish Water keeps restrictions as low as possible, that the deadline is stuck to, and that Irish Water communicates better in cases such as this.<\/p> <p>Finally, I was a little disappointed that last week's closures meant that the debate on councillors' conditions was postponed.  I have been speaking to many councillors, from every corner of the country, in preparation and I want to make sure that their concerns are heard.  For when will the debate be rescheduled?

In the case of my local hospital, St. James's Hospital, many residents offered beds to staff who were trying to keep the system going by making arrangements such as shift changes to ensure their colleagues who lived further away would not have to come in, thereby putting themselves at risk.  The extreme weather protocol took account of and properly recognised the remuneration of staff who were exposed to danger while working and travelling to work in hazardous conditions.  The Taoiseach told people to make sure they were indoors from 4 p.m. on Thursday - this was done because of health and safety factors - but the national shutdown did not, unfortunately, apply to many front-line emergency workers.  We need to find a way to recognise and acknowledge the efforts of staff who braved the elements to go to work last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  When the group of health unions meets tomorrow to discuss the protocol for adverse weather conditions, perhaps it might find a way to thank those who went to work at serious risk to themselves.<br\/><br\/>I support the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, in calling for the first two weeks of March to be treated as an emergency period in the public health service.  The INMO was extremely concerned about the pressures that were already on the health service but which were brought to bear to a greater extent in the emergency care area during the five-day period of severe weather.  It is calling for an emergency period to be declared for three main reasons.  First, the extended period of severe weather led to delayed discharges and caused a backlog in patients being scheduled for admission for elective procedures.  Second, rosters will have to be rearranged to accommodate the rest periods needed by INMO members and other front-line staff who have worked tirelessly over extended periods.  This, in turn, will reduce the number of staff available to provide services in the short term.  Third, was 19% higher than for February 2017, with for inpatient beds, which indicates that hospitals were already overburdened before the adverse weather event and are now bursting at the seams.  For these reasons, emergency status must be afforded to the next two weeks.  All measures to resource and staff the health service properly must be explored.  The assistance of private acute hospital services should also be sought.  I welcome the HSE's statement today confirming that it will prioritise vulnerable persons when appointments are being rescheduled.  Another difficult issue about which we need to think is the inability of some home helps to access people who were snowed in.  What happened was a true meitheal in a very true Irish sense of the word.  <br\/><br\/>I note that Mr. Tony O'Brien has just announced that he will retire from his position as director general of the HSE in the coming months.

One medic working for M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res in eastern Ghouta described it as a catastrophic experience, where people are being denied access to food, medicine and shelter and referred to the immense psychological stress of being under constant bombardment.  Rather than having a debate, perhaps we should instead consider a cross-party Seanad motion of the sort we passed on condemning the bombardment of Aleppo.  I am happy to work with the Leader and others to try to draft an appropriate motion to bring to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Russian ambassador and others.  I will take that up further.<\/p><p>I support the Barnardos lost child campaign.  It met with colleagues today about the campaign, which aims to ensure that no child is lost and to ask the Government to take a number of steps to support children through childhood, including ensuring they have somewhere suitable to live, the extension of the ECCE scheme for an additional year and other measures which Barnardos said would cost just under &euro;250 million in a full year.

I was there yesterday evening and there is nothing like standing within 3 ft. of a 20 ft. precipice to remind one of how severe a situation is for a family.  Four years ago it was 50 ft. away.  On the beach one can see the sand bags that were put down next to the cliff edge to protect it in 2014.

People who do not know the area, older people or children could easily have a serious accident.  The situation for this family is that three generations are living there - Gr&aacute;inne, Amy and Faye.  Gr&aacute;inne showed me a video of a young man trying to hold the sea back at the height of the tide coming in.  He was trying to keep a flimsy galvanised fence up because the original paling they had put up had fallen in.  Those people are about to lose their house.  We had the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, in the House this morning and he told us that he is open to having the situation addressed but we need Fingal County Council, which has done sterling work during the emergency in recent days, to take action and to act now in a compassionate and humanitarian way and with a sense of urgency.  We have a homeless crisis and we are now going to add three more people to the homelessness list.  We could have a fatality.  The situation is very unsafe.  There are 14 other houses at immediate risk.  How many houses are going to fall into the sea before we take action?<\/p><p>It is time to put aside all the red tape.  We have had reports.  The then Minister of State, Brian Hayes, was in Portrane in 2012 and we have had several Ministers there since.  The time for talk is over and the time for action is now.  We can have a medium-term solution.  I call on the Minister of State to bring together Fingal County Council, the heritage people and the environmental people with the community to resolve this issue in the medium term, but we need immediate action now to allow this family to save their home.  They have been there since before the 1960s, as has that house.  Instead of focusing on reasons why we might not, should not or could not do something, could we please take action and prevent another three generations of a family being made homeless?  I address this to Fingal County Council.  Could we not do the right thing - the humanitarian thing - and resolve this issue and allow those people to save their home that has been in their family for decades?<\/p><p>I will finish by saying that if action is not taken very soon, not alone will this house go but 14 other houses and businesses - a pub, restaurant and chipper - will go as well.  Once they breach a little mound, which is only a short distance away, the whole of the Burrow of Portrane will be isolated with 1,200 to 1,500 people living there.  How much will it cost to fix that and to put in a new road and bridge?  I urge Fingal County Council to please act and to show the humanity I know those involved have and save this house and this family from becoming homeless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#S00800","speaker":"1421","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I too pay tribute and thank the front-line staff, the in-house staff and those who worked in hospitals and were out clearing roads and all the volunteers as well as the Army, the Civil Defence, the Garda and council staff - everybody who was involved in the clean-up right around the country.

It is very interesting.  There is an enormous cleared vacant site.  It is about the size of a city block.  It is owned by a State company, the ESB, and in the 1960s it took on the longest continuous Georgian streetscape in the world and devastated it.  It was quite extraordinary.  It was an Irish State-owned company and it hired English architects who came here and made the most ridiculous and offensive comments.  I recall one of them saying that buildings have a lifetime and these houses were beyond their lifetime.  Look at Amsterdam or Rome.  There is a church in Rome that was used as a pagan temple during the Roman empire.  It is complete and absolute nonsense.  This represented the greatest, most ignorant and concerted attack on our cultural heritage.  There is nothing like this streetscape in the entire world.  The ESB was originally told by the planning department in Dublin County Council to reinstate the facade it had destroyed but apparently it managed to weasel around that.  It now intends to put up some other modern architect's idea of what a Georgian facade should be.  I suppose it is too late to rectify this but I wanted to express outrage and also to say thank you to people like Desmond and Mariga Guinness who in the 1960s took up this very unpopular cause and set out to defend our Georgian heritage.  It is a very sad day when an Irish State-owned company would launch such a devastating attack.  This streetscape is irreplaceable.  It has gone from being the longest continuous Georgian streetscape in the world to just being another inner city area.

All these combined weather conditions have damaged the pavement of the roads considerably, creating a network of potholes and, as a result, havoc.  It is a serious issue across the country and particularly acute in County Cavan.  Up to 96% of the road network in Cavan is made up of smaller county and regional roads.  The regional roads linking towns in County Cavan are effectively primary roads for those who work and live in those towns and surrounding areas.  These county roads are a vital network for farmers and others engaged in various activities.  We got a welcome increase of 20% in the road allocation this year.  However, that was on foot of a 50% reduction during the recession.  Road grants came back up 10% last year and 20% this year.  There is still a long way to go, however.<\/p> <p>The Minister must be invited to the House to discuss giving a special allocation to the county councils to deal with the road crisis.

It is one to which we really need to return, particularly to consider the plight of younger people who have returned from abroad, perhaps having had to leave through no fault of their own.  They are finding that their driving experience abroad is not being taken into account when premiums are being calculated.  This is a source of serious concern and an issue we should discuss.  <\/p><p>There has been a lot of talk about the Government's promotion, through the strategic communications unit, of Project Ireland.  Much of the talk has focused on whether the lines were blurred between the giving of legitimate public information at taxpayers' expense and party political propaganda in which election candidates were featured and so on.  I am disappointed that the best argument the Government seemed to come up with was that the other crowd had just been as bad in its day.  That may well be true, but people should go back and look at the McKenna judgment and what it had to state about the use of taxpayers' money by the Government in promoting one side of the argument in a referendum.  It should be learned that there is a spirit in the use of taxpayers' money.  I am disappointed that the media have focused on whether the lines were blurred, not on the question of whether it was appropriate in the first place to spend millions of taxpayers' money to tell people about what the Government was proposing to do, which might or might not come to pass, and which the media would be in a position to cover.  This is not about the seeking of submissions in advance of a report being produced or telling potential victims about sources of redress and that there is a place to which they should go.  It is not about telling social welfare recipients what their entitlements are in the light of certain changes.  That would certainly involve the legitimate spending of public money, but spending large amounts of public money to tell people about a grand plan, however good it is, is an abuse.  It is a misuse of the booty of power by those who happen to be in power.  All of the main parties stand accused of being flaith&uacute;lach with the people's money in a way that may be allowed technically but which still happens to benefit them in a way that is mainly political and which carries relatively very little benefit for the public.  I would really appreciate a debate on the issue.  Regardless of whether I am right or wrong, I am raising a legitimate issue about when it is appropriate to spend taxpayers' money and whether we have become too loose about the criteria under which we allow ourselves to spend taxpayers' money when in government.  There is much to be commended in what the Government has done in recent years and I am sure there is much to be commended in the plan, but if the Government wants to subvent local media - I am all for this - it should do so directly.  On doing so under the guise of telling people about projects, if there had been similar expenditure in promoting electronic voting, in retrospect, would we have considered it a good use of money?  The answer to that question is clearly no.  When there is something the public needs to know, by all means spend taxpayers' money, but when a Government is trying to tell it what it proposes to do in the future if it stays in office, frankly, that is spending that goes too far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#V00300","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I also wish Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, well.

This is about ensuring people can access services but, equally, I agree with the Senator that there is an issue relating to CAMHS, which needs to be fundamentally addressed, and it is not good enough or acceptable that there are waiting lists for CAMHS.  The HSE, as part of its plan, announced in January a step-down model of care delivery, a specialist training programme along with a dedicated national eating disorder network and specialised inpatient eating disorder programmes within key psychiatric units nationally as well as in local hospitals, and the creation of additional care teams through the dedicated network.

The men and women of the Defence Forces also deserve huge admiration and praise for their role in peacekeeping and for the role they play in the State.  The Senators were correct to raise that.<\/p> <p>Senator Black raised the issue of Irish Water communications.  There is a need to communicate strategically, properly and in a timely manner.  Irish Water is doing a good job in communicating.  This issue again makes the case for the strategic communications unit and the need to provide more information.  When it became clear that there was an issue with water supply, Irish Water mobilised on social media, although I accept that not everybody is on social media.  Those who opposed Irish Water and payments to ensure we have running water now have a question to answer in the context of the company today.  I take the Senator's point regarding the need for timely communication.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senators Black, McFadden and Coghlan raised the issue of councillors' pay and conditions.  As the Cathaoirleach knows, it was on the cl&aacute;r for last week but because of the decision to close the Houses, it was not debated.  That debate will now take place on 27 March.  It is not that we will not debate it.  It has just been delayed.<br\/><br\/>Senator Devine referred to the health service, health care workers and the INMO campaign.  I would be happy to have the Minister attend the House on that matter.<br\/><br\/>I congratulate Senator Bacik on her sterling work on V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100.  I hope that we will all join her and our colleagues on international women's day on 8 March as we celebrate the centenary of women's suffrage.  It is important to have that debate, which the House will in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>Tomorrow's statements on foreign affairs will be an opportune time to debate Syria with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney.  I would be happy to facilitate a cross-party motion on Syria.<br\/><br\/>I am tempted to remind Senator Leyden that 2010 was the last bad outcome for snow and ice and that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was in government.  We have learned from its mistakes.<br\/><br\/>Senator Boyhan raised the important issue of horticulture and the 21 key action points.  I would be happy to have the Minister attend the House to discuss the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senators Reilly, Devine, Feighan and Bacik referred to the impending resignation of Mr. Tony O'Brien, chief executive of the HSE.  As a former Chairman of the health committee, I pay tribute to Mr. O'Brien and thank him for the professional and courteous manner in which he dealt with the committee, and particularly me as its Chair.  I always found him to be a most engaging and committed person who had only one motivation, that was, to ensure that we had a competent, caring and strong health care system that worked for the patient.  I wish him well and thank him for his service.  As Senator Feighan rightly stated, he has left the health service in a better place than when he found it.  He is not universally popular because of some of his decisions, but he managed the health system and HSE in a time of diminished budgets.<br\/><br\/>Senator Reilly also made an impassioned plea to Fingal County Council regarding a particular family.  I hope that it will listen to him.  This is about ensuring that the family is safe from homelessness.<br\/><br\/>I join Senator Byrne in congratulating the people of the mid-west on the 600 new jobs.  Members will be glad to hear that it is the largest number of jobs announced outside of Dublin, which shows that the Government governs beyond the M50.  I congratulate Limerick and commend all involved in Innovate Limerick.<br\/><br\/>Senator Norris mentioned the ESB building on Fitzwilliam Square.  The ESB began a major overhaul of that building at the end of last month.  I wish it well.  I was not around when it demolished the old Georgian streetscape.  The Senator made a good point.  This was the subject of an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in recent days and there have also been previous decisions.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senator O'Reilly made a pertinent contribution on the issue of roads.  As we all know, there are craters in our roads and footpaths have deteriorated as a consequence of the storm.  The knock-on effects of the storm will have a profound impact on county and city councils.  I join the Senator in asking the Minister to consider giving them extra funding to repair roads, some of which have crumbled to the point of needing complete overhauls as opposed to patching.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mullen raised the issue of the strategic communications unit, SCU, and the national development plan.

It relates \"suitable and specific measures\" for processing.  This term is invoked 16 subsequent times in the Bill.  It was conceived originally to be used in respect of special categories of personal data.  In the general data protection regulation it is indicated that the processing of special categories of personal data may be necessary for reasons to do with the public interest in the areas of public health without the consent of the data subject and that such processing should be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons.  The term \"suitable and specific measures\" appears throughout the Bill where the measure will replace consent, although it might not be mentioned in the sections, particularly a number of sections in the 40s.  These are cases in which the obtaining of individuals' consent will no longer be a requirement for data to be processed.  Where legislative permission has been given for the processing of personal data that bypasses the requirement for consent, suitable and specific measures are to be brought forweard as a further safeguard, given that the key and primary safeguard of a requirement to obtain consent has been removed.<\/p> <p>The Minister might note that I have tabled a number of amendments on this issue, but I will not push all of them.  This section is not very clear and is quite wide.  I was concerned that what was clear in it was that elements such as explicit consent; measures to prevent unauthorised use, the disclosure or erasure of data; time limits for the erasure of data; and training for those dealing with data were entirely optional and at the discretion of the Minister.  The section states specific measures may be taken and regulations made under the Bill which \"may\" include these areas.  I had hoped we could deal with concerns about the many sections later in the Bill, but I hoped that we could first replace the word \"may\" with \"shall\" so as to ensure the toolbox of protections for individuals and their data would always be used in its fullest sense.  However, looking at places where the phrase \"suitable and specific measures for processing\" is used, it seems that it is utilised in a wide set of circumstances, which presents a problem.  It is used in parts that are not clearly framed within the GDPR.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The GDPR is clear, for example, that suitable and specific measures might be appropriate for archives, public health and certain other areas.  However, the GDPR does not want suitable and specific measures to be used as a mechanism to bypass consent when it comes to how personal data is used in, for example, elections or political opinion, which is dealt with later and we will discuss that later.  The problem is that the phrase &quot;suitable and specific measures&quot; is widely used.  I may proceed with my amendment that seeks to change the word &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot; but I recognise that there are situations, such as instances where criminal proceedings are under way or archival work, where consent may not be appropriate or even possible.<br\/><br\/>I am still extremely concerned about this section and I wish to advise that I shall return to it on Report Stage.  In the interim, I am intent on proposing a measure today as a basic safeguard, which I hope the Minister will accept because it will indicate the grounds for us to work on the improvement of this section.  I wish to refer to section 32(b) that reads: &quot;limitations on access to the personal data undergoing processing,&quot; which refers to instances where consent has been removed and bypassed.  In cases where permission has been given for the processing of specific personal data, I want to ensure that there are limitations placed on the access to that data in order to &quot;prevent unauthorised consultation, alteration, disclosure or erasure&quot; of personal data.<br\/><br\/>Minister, I cannot foresee any situation in which any Minister, making regulations on the processing of personal data, would not wish to ensure and, indeed, needs to ensure that there are limitations on how that data is accessed in order to prevent unauthorised use, consultation or other actions.  <br\/><br\/>My amendment No. 9b reads:<\/p><blockquote>In page 23, to delete lines 28 to 33 and substitute the following:&ldquo;must be necessary and proportionate, shall include limitations on the access to the personal data undergoing processing within a workplace in order to prevent unauthorised consultation, alteration, disclosure or erasure of personal data, and may include&mdash;<blockquote>a) explicit consent of the data subject for the processing of his or her personal data for one or more purposes,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>I emphasise the words &quot;shall include limitations on the access to the personal data&quot;.  At the start of my amendment No. 9b I introduced the words &quot;necessary and proportionate&quot; because that element is used as a standard test throughout the GDPR and, therefore, should be reflected in this legislation.  My amendment also stipulates &quot;may include&quot; when it comes to the other elements of the toolkit.  I wish to advise that more work may need to be done on this aspect on Report Stage.  As amendment No. 9b may need further work I shall refrain from pressing my amendments Nos. 10 and 11 now.<br\/><br\/>My amendment No. 11a is another key amendment.  It provides that a Minister may make regulations on what safeguards may be put in place in terms of how personal data is processed.  It reads &quot;the Minister has consulted with such other Minister of the Government as he or she considers appropriate and has also consulted with and sought the advice of the Commission&quot;.  I included that provision because we have seen, and we have very visible examples at the moment, whereby Ministers may well consult with the current Data Protection Commissioner or the new data protection commission.  However, consulting the data protection commission does not give us any assurance that the Ministers will take on board the advice that they receive from the Data Protection Commissioner or the data protection commission.  I shall outline a worrying example that is in play at present.  The Data Protection Commissioner has indicated her extremely serious concern about the manner in which the public services card has been rolled out.  These are serious concerns not only about the legislative basis but about the facilities to ensure appropriate access.  A number of concerns have been expressed but I will not fully elucidate them here.  Despite such concerns the roll-out of the public services card has been accelerated, not only by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection but also the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Recently these issues were discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, of which I am a member.  On that occasion we specifically discussed the card with the Department official from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who directly advised us to talk to the Minister for Justice and Equality about the Data Protection Bill as the legislation is the best way to address the matter.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am now trying to follow up on that advice and address the concern that a Minister may disregard the advice given by the data commission and proceed with suitable and specific regulations which the data commissioner may consider inadequate.  Given that the data commissioner constitutionally cannot trump the Minister, which I recognise, I have put forward an additional safeguard whereby the Minister, having sought the advice of the commission and consulted with any other Ministers he or she considers appropriate, should, if he or she intends to set out regulations which are not compliant with the advice of the commission, produce a written rationale for the decision not to take the advice of the commission, and seek and receive Cabinet approval for the proposed regulations.  This is a very mild additional safeguard that will ensure that if the very serious decision to disregard the advice of the data commission is taken, we will have the rationale for it and it will at a minimum be discussed at Cabinet.  Having spoken to other Oireachtas Members since submitting this amendment, I know that others may seek to strengthen it further.  Other Members may wish to ensure that where the advice is not taken, that would be discussed by the Oireachtas committee or the Houses of the Oireachtas and a rationale laid before them.  My amendment is comparatively mild and simply calls for collective Cabinet responsibility of in terms of addressing this issue.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 12 to 14, inclusive, regard the deletion of \"may\" and substitution of \"shall\" in various parts of the section.  The problems involved in the earlier discussed deletion of \"may\" and substitution of \"shall\" do not apply in these instances. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 14a amends section 32(5) by inserting that whatever regulations for suitable and specific measures are made under subsection (2) as discussed should have regard to \"the necessity and proportionality of the processing\" in addition to the current provision for \"the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing\".  This addresses the necessity and proportionality test that used to be applied throughout.  It is important that it should be directly considered in this section.  I particularly hope the Minister might be able to accept this amendment because it is quite mild and very much in tune with the aims of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.<\/p><p>As regards amendment No. 18, we will have a more lengthy debate on section 42 when we reach it so I will not speak at length on this amendment.  It concerns the example I gave of an area where suitable and specific measures have been added in and it is very important under such circumstance in regard to electoral activities that there be no bypassing of the issue of consent.  The GDPR addresses appropriate safeguards for the use of data by political parties but there are numerous problems with that section so perhaps it is not appropriate to dive into it in too much detail now.  I note that under the wide frame that is currently put on it, the consent of a person whose political opinions are being discussed would and should be a requirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#BB01300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I am willing to have a fresh look at section 32 and to bring forward amendments on Report Stage if the Senator is minded not to press the amendments to section 32 on this Stage.  I remind the House that the purpose of section 32, which is entitled \"Suitable and specific measures for processing\", is to establish a toolbox of specific and appropriate measures to be applied in the context of data processing under later sections of the Bill, namely, sections 40 to 44, inclusive, and 46, some of which have been mentioned by Senator Higgins.  She is correct that we will have an opportunity to go through those section by section.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->All of the relevant sections make the use of suitable and specific measures mandatory.  The choice of which measure from the toolbox could, should or may be used will depend on the circumstances of the processing.<\/p><p>I stress that these safeguards are in addition to, rather than a substitute for, the technical and organisational measures required under the risk based approach in Article 24 of the general data protection regulation.  These additional measures are brought forward by virtue of the fact that they will apply to the special categories of personal data, which are referred to under Article 9 of the GDPR.  In some cases, encryption of the personal data concerned might be highly desirable, while in other cases, the appointment of a data protection officer by the controller might be more effective.  In this context, it is important that we consider the text of 32(4), which will permit the specification of compulsory safeguards in respect of certain types of data processing. <\/p><p>Having listened carefully to the Senator and examined her amendments, I accept there is a need to clarify what can best be described as the interplay between this section and the later sections which require the use of the toolbox measures.  I am willing to review matters in light of the Senator's comments.  Rather than dealing with the matter conclusively today, I ask her to consider withdrawing the amendment and not moving her other amendments to the section, in return for which I will give a commitment to introduce appropriate amendments to the section on Report Stage.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 11 and 18 in the Senator's name del awith consent-related issues.  I understand they are part of the group because, as the Cathaoirleach stated, amendment No. 11 is an alternative to amendment No. 9b to which I have made reference.  With regard to amendment No. 11, there is no need to insert the word \"informed\" after the word \"explicit\" because this is already an essential requirement for what could be described as a valid consent under the GDPR.  The definition of \"consent\" in Article 4 makes clear that the matter of consent must always be freely given, specific and informed.  Section 2(3) makes clear that a word or expression used in the Act that is also used in the GDPR has the same meaning in this legislation as it has in the GDPR unless the context otherwise requires.  Amendment No. 11 cuts across this and I am not minded to accept it. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 18 proposes to insert a consent requirement in section 42, which seeks to give effect to Recital 56 of the general data protection regulation.  I am open to considering the possibility of imposing a consent requirement.  In any event, we will have an opportunity to discuss the issue again when we deal with amendments Nos. 19 to 21, inclusive. <\/p><p>Having listened carefully to the Senator's submissions and the reasoning behind her amendments, I give a commitment to return to the issue on Report Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#DD00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the Minister's commitment and acknowledge the interest his officials have shown in engaging in this area.

The main concern is that, while provisions are made in respect of specific and, in some cases, appropriate circumstances that we have already discussed with the Minister whereby personal data might be processed, section 34 is wide in terms of what is construed and potentially construable as the public interest.  It allows for the processing of personal data by any local authority where considered necessary and includes an extensive list of bodies, for example, museums, agencies, broadcasters, financial bodies like NAMA, tourism boards and housing agencies.  It also makes further provision for the disclosure of personal data for the purpose of preserving the common travel area by air carriers and leaves to the discretion of the Minister, without accountability to the Cabinet, D&aacute;il or the Oireachtas, the determination of what data are necessary to be processed and under which conditions.  This is an extraordinarily wide remit and the section needs substantial revision.  I hope that there will be scope for us to work across the Houses on that revision.<\/p> <p>I support Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment, as the list of bodies established by enactment is long.  We need to be more specific.  My amendment is a small one and I hope that the Minister will take it on board.  The section reads: \"The processing of personal data shall be lawful to the extent that such processing is necessary for\".  As has been well aired, necessary and proportionate is the test under GDPR.  My amendment reinserts \"and proportionate\" in that context.  Notwithstanding the wider discussion that we might need to have on the section, the inclusion of the necessary and proportionate test is appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#LL00800","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":179,"content":"<p>The short answer to Senator Higgins is that I will not accept her amendment, minor and all as she suggests it is.  Actually, she used the word \"small\", which is somewhat different.  I would be pleased to give it further consideration and see how we can meet each other on Report Stage, but I will not accept it as currently drafted.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 15 proposes the deletion of section 34(1).  I will give vent to a number of reasons as to why I will not accept it.  Article 6.3 of the GDPR provides that the basis for the processing referred to in Article 6.1(c) and (e) shall be laid down in EU law or national law and that the purposes of the processing shall be laid down in that legal basis.  Unlike the position in some member states, however, Acts of the Oireachtas that confer statutory functions on public authorities and bodies do not normally provide specifically for the processing of personal data for the purpose of discharging statutory functions.  The same applies to functions deriving from our Constitution.  The processing of personal data for those purposes is implicit rather than explicit.<\/p> <p>This is an issue of legal certainty, and to ensure that, section 34(1)(a) provides that the processing of personal data shall be lawful to the extent that such processing is necessary for the performance of a function conferred by an enactment or the Constitution.  This is fully in line with Article 6.1(c) of the GDPR which provides that data processing is lawful if it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.  What is important here is that, first, a statutory function must have been conferred on the controller by law and, second, the processing shall be lawful to the extent that the processing is necessary for the performance of that function.<\/p> <p>Section 34(1)(b), which the amendment also seeks to delete, provides a statutory basis for data processing that necessarily arises where non-statutory schemes, programmes, funds or arrangements are administered by public authorities, such as a Department, in the performance of a function conferred on them by an enactment or the Constitution.  Let me give an example.  In terms of social welfare, some important and valuable schemes are administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection but operate on a non-statutory basis.  I am referring to, for example, the free fuel scheme, the free travel scheme, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the school meals programme.  Such non-statutory schemes have also been put in place in the past to deal urgently with emergency situations such as our current adverse weather conditions, the aftermath of a storm, flooding, landslides, farm crop destruction and fodder shortages, of which Senator Coffey and others will be aware.  Passing specific legislation to deal with such cases is not something that we do because we do not deem it necessary.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is also the question of timing and of the need for the Oireachtas to respond urgently to supply aid or assistance to communities.  All these schemes will require the processing of personal data of applicants and beneficiaries.  This is widely permitted under the terms of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  Recital (41) states: \"Where this Regulation refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require a legislative act adopted by a parliament.\"  I invite Members to agree with me that there are circumstances where these non-statutory schemes, or other similar non-statutory measures, are important and beneficial to communities.  We should not put them at risk by creating conditions of legal uncertainty following the coming into force of GDPR later in the year.  In these circumstances I suggest that amendment No. 15 be withdrawn because of the uncertainty that will ensue. <\/p><p>I am concerned that acceptance of amendment No. 15a may also jeopardise operation of certain statutory and non-statutory schemes and measures.  I wish to impress on Senators the fact of Article 61C GDPR being based on a necessity test.  It does not incorporate a proportionality test but inserting a reference to proportionality here could well have an adverse impact on some of the schemes whose administration we from time to time facilitate.  It could leave them open to challenge and to an interpretation of uncertainty.  I will give further consideration to amendment No. 15a but I will not accept it today.  I do have a difficulty with amendment No. 15 and ask Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile to reflect on my point.  If he were to withdraw it he could reserve the right to come back on Report Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#LL00900","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I never question the bona fides of the Minister.

I appreciate that the Minister is interested in considering it.  I do not think anybody in this House would disagree about the circumstances the Minister has outlined where it would be appropriate.  The concern is that as it stands subsection (1)(a) does not cover only urgent situations.  It covers any situation or law that is brought in.  I am more concerned about it now because the Minister said it may not require legislation brought through the House but may be another legislative measure.  Would that be a ministerial order?  We are using the word lawful but the GDPR is law.  We are introducing a new hierarchy whereby the GDPR would be subservient to any other law that might be brought in in respect of data processing.  The reference to \"any other future or current\" raises serious concern about how wide this is.  I appreciate that, as the Minister said, there are circumstances where urgency is needed and my amendment sought to deal with that by ensuring it is proportional.  For example, where the Minister described a need to respond in urgent situations such as flooding and crop shortages, any test of proportionality would find that the processing of data was appropriate.<\/p> <p>The proportionality test is not designed to tie the hands of Government.  As I understand it, section 34 is wider than some of the sections we have debated because it does not even require ministerial responsibility.  Subsection (1) refers to \"the performance of a function of a controller conferred by or under an enactment or by the Constitution\".  That is very wide.  We will not necessarily know what decisions may be made in interpreting the performance of their functions.  Certain functions of controllers predate the legislation before us today.  We should endeavour to ensure that the functions of any controller or anybody charged with data protection are brought into line with these new higher standards we put forward rather than saying that these standards may not apply where an existing way of functioning existed.  It does need revision.  We are happy to work with the Minister on the proportionality question.  I will not press the amendment now because there is much ground to cover today.  If there are exceptional circumstances let us legislate for those and not for the blanket provision.  <\/p> <p>I may return to this point on Report Stage, even the very limited safeguard of \"suitable and specific measures\" which I had concerns about in a previous section is not included here.  I do not see where the safeguards are in the absence of a proportionality test.

Aspects of the amendments are far-reaching.  The importance of the text is influenced by a recent recommendation of Joint Committee on Justice and Equality arising from pre-legislative scrutiny of the Communications (Retention of Data) Bill 2017.  The joint committee's report has only been tabled recently, and the Government, including, importantly, the Office of the Attorney General, has not had the opportunity to examine the recommendation in the detail that is required.  That is why I agree with Senator Higgins that these issues can be examined at a later stage.  They are far-reaching, detailed and important.  Second, I reiterate that the legislation is not the correct vehicle for such a wide-ranging and far-reaching statutory provision.  The Long Title confines the content of the legislation to data protection matters.  The Senators have gone beyond those in the amendments.<\/p> <p>The provision in section 38(3) whereby the High Court could permit identification of confidential sources of information where a journalist \"is the subject of investigation for suspected commission of a serious criminal offence\" raises important issues that go well beyond data protection matters, and the GDPR and this legislation, which is a direct consequence of the GDPR.  For example, what is a \"serious offence\"?  I do not wish in any way to take from the importance of the amendments but balancing the right of journalists to protect their sources with other rights is a matter for the courts.  The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has underlined, for example, that protection of confidential sources is an essential means of enabling the press to perform its important function on a daily basis and it should not be restricted or inhibited.  The important role of the press as public watchdog should not be interfered with except in exceptional circumstances where a vital public or individual interest may be at stake.  I do not want in any way to detract from the importance of the amendments.  I suspect that there is a relationship between the tabling of the amendment and the joint committee's report, which deserves due and careful consideration.  It would not be appropriate to insert such a far-reaching, consequential amendment in this legislation.  I am not minded to accept it for the two reasons I outlined.  The first is the recent origin of the amendment but I will certainly examine that issue.  I have a difficulty with the wider issue, which I hope Senators will accept in the spirit in which I tender it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#NN00400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I am reluctant to divide the House on this issue because of the Minister's comments.

I do not propose to press amendment No. 20 as I do not wish to create an artificial disadvantage for new candidates compared with existing representatives.  I recognise the concern that has arisen on this matter, on which I have engaged with the Department.  Nonetheless, there remains a concern that the section, as constituted, goes significantly beyond what is envisaged in the general data protection regulation regarding the use of data collected for electoral purposes.  The relevant section of the GDPR refers to data that are designed for use by political parties.  This is very much the way in which its use is constrained.<\/p><p>I recognise that we have many independent candidates and representatives, including me.  The electoral purposes envisaged in the GDPR appear to be those that are internal to persons who are putting themselves forward for election to public office.  However, the provision in this section is constructed with a much wider scope.  We discussed the fact that a body established by or under an enactment is extremely wide in scope.  It could allow, for example, political opinions to be processed for electoral purposes or to influence such matters as manifestoes.  It potentially blurs the line between the role of various bodies established under enactment and the role of political parties, government and Departments.  The section is unclear and I expect it was designed to encompass, for example, a referendum commission and similar bodies.  However, it is framed much too widely and could potentially lead to inappropriate use.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 21 is a much more important proposal providing that the section will &quot;not permit the sharing or processing of personal data revealing political opinion with or by any private or commercial company, even when that private or commercial company has been contracted by the actors or entities specified under <i>paragraphs (a)<\/i>, <i>(b) <\/i>or <i>(c)<\/i>.&quot;  We have seen the role played by companies such as Cambridge Analytica in the Brexit vote and Trump campaign.  There is a real and present danger of private companies being contracted to influence and shape electoral outcomes.<\/p><p>The Standards in Public Office Commission has indicated it is not satisfied with the adequacy of regulation in respect of how social media advertising and promotion are being and could be used to influence electoral outcomes.  If we include in the Bill a provision that results in a politician, party or aspiring candidate being able to share with a private company information about citizens' political opinions, which may have been entrusted to the candidate in confidence, for example, in the course of constituency work, democracy will find itself on dangerous and shaky ground.  This is a serious concern.<\/p><p>I do not want to focus on one company.  With regard to the forthcoming referendum, for example, analytics companies have been hired which have very close relationships with companies that were highly active on the vote on Brexit and various elections.  This is a real and present danger and one which is not exclusive to extreme cases.  A well resourced political party should not be in a position to share extensive information on the political opinions of citizens with an expensive company.  While I do not wish to digress, we have seen in recent weeks how strongly members of the public feel about the importance of integrity in communicating messages and advertisements and promoting positions.  Absolute transparency is needed on how such communications are conducted.<\/p><p>While I acknowledge that this section does not explicitly provide for a right to share personal data related to political opinions with private companies, it does not preclude the sharing of such data.  I hope the Minister will be able to work with me to ensure the legislation preclude the sharing of such data.<\/p><p>It may be more effective to divide section 42 into two sections.  Anyone who has sought or seeks political office will know the publicly available register of electors may be used to ensure his or her message is communicated.  It may be effective to deal with issues such as the register of electors in a specific section.  Other areas of political opinion, which extend beyond information that a person has or has not voted or is registered, could be teased out in another section.  This may a constructive approach to addressing this issue.  I do not expect people to stand in the Minister's way on the use of the register of electors.  We could have a separate section on that issue and another section dealing with other uses of data related to a person's political opinion.  It is not clear whether the provisions of section 42, as currently worded, include data on persons who may have contacted political representatives by email or other means expressing a political view on an issue of the day.  Perhaps the Minister will assure me that such data are not covered by the section.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#OO00700","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I concur with Senator Higgins.  The Minister is speaking to colleagues on the issue of political representation.  Members of the public want to be updated on the work being done by political representatives.  My understanding, which may be incorrect, is that a new set of guidelines will be introduced to deal with this issue.  Similarly, if a member of the public contacts a Member of the Oireachtas with a specific query, Members will find it difficult to engage with various Departments on the issue.  The Minister is aware of this as an issue because he has been a politician for a long time, probably longer than I have been around.  He knows exactly what is required of us in the Irish political system, which is different from most other political systems.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The only similar system is in Malta, which has a proportional representation single transferable vote system akin to that used to elect the Irish Parliament.<\/p><p>Irish people have a certain expectation of Members.

It is very important for that to continue because although, thankfully, many people now know their rights and are able to advocate for themselves, there are still many people who are unable to access information or advocate for themselves and do not know how to go about simple tasks such as applying for a medical card.  If constituency offices around the country are hampered in this very important advocacy role, the data protection legislation will have gone too far.  When one contacts Departments, depending on who speaks to, one may be put through a list, including some looking for written consent.  In one situation involving SUSI of which I am aware there had been a marital breakup and written consent had to be obtained from the student and both parents.  Such requirements make the work of a public representative in terms of advocating on behalf of people very difficult.

There are issues in the context of the Bill that require careful scrutiny along the lines he suggests.<\/p> <p>As regards amendment No. 21, I listened carefully to the consideration given by its proposer, Senator Higgins, and, on reading section 42(a), (b) and (c), I do not see where there is any legal basis for the sharing of personal data revealing political opinions.  I do not, therefore, see the necessity for amendment No. 21.  I do not disagree with the points raised by Senator Higgins but she is reading far too much into section 42.  There is no legal basis for the issues that she wishes to amend and amendment No. 21 is not required.<\/p> <p>The purpose of section 42 is to give structure and substance to Recital 56 of the GDPR, which provides that \"Where in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system in a Member State requires that political parties compile personal data on people's political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons of public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established.\"  It is a loosely worded recital.  It is unusual that there is no corresponding substantive provision in the GDPR and the objective of section 42 is to limit potential misuse of recital 56 through making the processing for its purposes subject to suitable and specific measures, as referred to in section 32.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 19 proposes the deletion of subsection (b).  Although I accept that the provision is drafted in a broad manner, the intention is to underpin any processing of political opinion data by a referendum commission.  I note the point raised by Senator &Oacute; Donnaghaile in that regard but I think he said he was not going to press it.  However, I am willing to redraft that subsection in the context of a Report Stage amendment, which will trigger corresponding changes in sections 52 and 53.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 20 proposes the deletion of the words \"a candidate for election to, or\" in paragraph (c) of section 42.  That would mean that although an elected representative could take advantage of the section, a candidate who might be competing and seeking election for the first time could not, which may be less than consistent.  I do not believe that is the import of what Senator Higgins wishes to achieve, so I will not accept the amendment.

Section 44 will be the subject of amendment on Report Stage.  It involves the bundling of two purposes - insurance and pensions - which should be separated into two sections because different provisions may apply to each.  Although it may be appropriate to process special categories of personal data in regard to pensions, the GDPR, in a continuation of the section I read earlier regarding the question of public interest in areas of public health without consent, states that suitable and specific measures could be inserted at that point.  However, there is a clear interpretation of public health being, \"all elements related to health, namely health status, including morbidity and disability\" and so on, but the key point is that \"Such processing of data concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or insurance and banking companies.\"  Section 44 contains provisions relating to the mortgaging of a property, health insurance and health-related interest.  Although I recognise public interest in the area of health is not what is being evoked in the section, I nonetheless believe that the spirit of the GDPR is quite clear in its interpretation, in that it does not seem to consider that the processing of personal data without consent - because we are clear that, wherever suitable and specific measures apply, such processing is likely to be without consent - would be appropriate by entities such as insurance or banking companies.

I support the spirit of it.  I know there may be issues relating to the question of impact assessment and who the appropriate person to perform an impact assessment is, whether the data controller or the Data Protection Commissioner.  The key to this and the spirit in which it was discussed earlier is something the Minister will have seen a strong feeling about across the House, and I hope he will be able to work with us all on it because it will come up in multiple sections.  Throughout the Bill, it simply allows Ministers to act following consultation with the commission with no guarantee that the decisions made by the Minister will in any way reflect the advice of the commission or even have due regard to it.  There is far too much ministerial discretion.  We need to have other safeguards.  I think that the safeguards proposed under subsection (e) of the amendment, \"In the event that the Minister does not follow the recommendation of the Commission, the Government shall cause to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas a statement containing a reasoned written explanation of the decision of the Government not to follow the recommendation of the Commission\", is stronger than what I had put forward relating to section 32 and is probably better.  All parties, with the exception of the Government party, have expressed concern about the formulation throughout the Bill which allows Ministers to seek advice and then act as they wish without giving any explanation when they choose to stray, dissent or override the commission.  Given the huge importance of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, as we have heard eloquently expressed by the Minister on Second Stage, surely we need to have some kind of safeguard.  I urge the Minister to note that this issue is arising in multiple places from multiple sources and to look genuinely to how, every time we have a point of pure ministerial discretion, we at least ensure that there will be some kind of written rationale for the decisions being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#QQ00900","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 23 seeks to insert paragraphs into section 45 and amendment No. 36 seeks to insert the same paragraphs into section 54, which is why we are taking them together.  The position here is that the imposition of a statutory duty on the Data Protection Commissioner to conduct an impact assessment on regulations to be made under section 45(2) is in conflict with article 36(4) of the GDPR.  That provision states that a member state's data protection authority must be consulted on proposals for any legislative measures to be adopted by a national parliament or a regulatory measure based on such a legislative measure which relates to the processing of data.  The GDPR imposes an obligation on controllers and on processors, in certain cases, to carry out data protection impact assessments.  There is no such an obligation on the data protection authority itself.  The imposition of such an obligation not only would have resource implications of some significance but would, in essence, be in conflict with the complete independence of the supervisory authority that is required under Article 52.  It will be open to the Data Protection Commissioner to request a controller, whether a Department or any other public authority with a regulation-making power, to carry out such an assessment when it is consulted on the proposed legislative measures.  The carrying out of data protection impact assessments will be an obligation on controllers and processors.  That is clear under Article 35 of the GDPR.  The tasks of the data protection authority specified in Article 57 do not really foresee such a role or obligation.

This relates again to Article 22.1, which states, &quot;The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her &quot;.  However, the Government exempts itself from that under the section, which states that those protections will not apply where &quot;the decision is authorised or required by or under an enactment&quot; and either &quot;the effect of that decision is to grant a request of the data subject&quot; or &quot;in all other cases ... adequate steps have been taken by the controller to safeguard the legitimate interests of the data subject...&quot;.  The concern is that the Government is giving itself permission to have an automated decision made in respect of an individual, which directly contravenes the spirit of Article 22.  I recognise that there may be circumstances in which it might be expeditious when a large volume of requests are being put through that they are processed in a positive way.  However, I am concerned that section 51(b)(i) provides that an automated decision could be made which would deny a request made by the data subject.  Somebody may, for example, be subjected to an automatic refusal in respect of a social protection payment, with the decision not made with due consideration by an official but by an algorithm.  It would be deeply contrary to the spirit of the GDPR, which specifically seeks to safeguard against the impact of automated decision-making.<\/p><p>I acknowledge section 51(b)(ii) states, &quot;in all other cases (where subparagraph (i) is not applicable), adequate steps have been taken by the controller to safeguard the legitimate interests of the data subject which steps shall include the making of arrangements to enable him or her to make representations to the controller in relation to the decision.&quot;.  This means that the data subject can be automatically refused on the basis of his or her data being processed automatically by an algorithm or other programme but he or she can then make an appeal.  In many cases, the gap between the refusal and the taking of the appeal could have negative consequences for an individual.  This does not exclusively relate to social protection schemes but the Minister will excuse my mind going there because this concern has been raised in other jurisdictions and I am a member of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  If persons were automatically refused disability or child benefit or, for example, refused a driver's licence, the impact would be significant and immediate.  Simply knowing that they can make representations and have a period to appeal is not adequate.<\/p><p>The amendment provides that there can be an automatic decision where that decision grants a request when, for example, 1,000 people have been asked to apply and it would not have a detrimental effect but automatic decision-making should not have a detrimental effect on people.  We should be true to the spirit of Article 22.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#SS00800","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":246,"content":"<p>My concern is the unintended consequences of the deletion of section 51(b)(ii), which is the import of the amendment.

Section 51 gives further effect to Article 22 of the GDPR, which deals with automated processing of personal data, including profiling.  Paragraphs 2(a) and (c) have direct effects.  Section 51 ensures an appropriate level of safeguards by requiring that any automated processing must be authorised or required by or under an enactment and, furthermore, that the effect of any decision is to either grant a request of the data subject or that adequate steps have been taken to safeguard the interests of the data subject.  The section makes clear that these steps must include an arrangement whereby the data subject has the opportunity to make representations in respect of an intended decision.  This means, in the first place, that a data subject has to be informed of any proposal to make such a decision and, second, have the opportunity to bring concerns to the attention of the data controller.

Basically section 54 relates to the restriction of the exercise of the data subject rights.  Data subject rights are the core reason we have the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR.  The function of GDPR to a large extent is to ensure appropriate protection of data sets.  These are the circumstances under which it might be restricted.  Again we see the situation whereby the scope of the Government to restrict a data subject's rights are very widely interpreted in the section.  <\/p><p>Section 54 (2) states:<\/p><blockquote><i>Subsection (1) <\/i>is without prejudice to any enactment or rule of law which, on the coming into operation of this section, restricts the rights and obligations referred to in that subsection.<\/blockquote> <p>Section 54 (5) also gives wide-ranging powers to any Minister.  We have the same concerns on the levels of ministerial discretion, which have and will be raised again and again throughout the section.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 30 seeks to delete section 54 (3)(a) and (3)(a) (i) to (iv), inclusive, because I believe they are very wide.  The term &quot;data subject&quot; refers to individuals not just citizens but any individuals resident in the State, effectively the people in Ireland and their data rights.<\/p><p>This Bill is fundamentally about enshrining and supporting the data subject rights of people.  Under section 54(3) all of their data rights may be restricted where it is viewed to be necessary to safeguard the courts, Cabinet confidentiality, to deal with prosecutions, for the administration of taxes, but also for the purposes of estimating the amount of the liability of a controller on foot of claim.<\/p><p>Section 54(3)(b) states: &quot;the personal data relating to the data subject consist of an expression of opinion about the data subject by another person given in confidence or on the understanding that it would be treated as confidential to a person who has a legitimate interest in receiving the information, or.&quot;  The scope of the section is wide.  I understand some of the provisions, and some of them stand up, but I would like to see them teased out so that is the reason I have tabled amendments.<\/p><p>The crucial amendment is amendment No. 32, in which I propose to delete lines 1 to 42, and in page 37, to delete lines 1 to 12. <\/p><p>Section 54(7) sets out the objectives of general public interest.  Earlier in the Bill, the question of public interest was discussed as a basis on which decisions may be made.  Later in section 54(7) examples of public interest are set out.  I have a real concern that the examples of public interest might apply here in terms of the limitation of data subject rights but they may also be used or interpreted in relation to earlier points in the Bill, where public interest was invoked.  I have a number of areas of concern in regard to subsection (7), however I want to highlight section 54(7) matters of public interest include, in particular &quot;(h) matters relating to international protection and immigration&quot;.  Will individual's data rights be constrained or overridden when it relates to immigration?  What are the circumstances in which this will apply?  I think there is a danger of inequity of treatment, and prejudice.  I have a real concern, that any person, be they a citizen, an immigrant, or an EU citizen and sharing the rights of the GDPR as well should be subject to data protection in the same way as other person.  I feel there is a lack of clarity in paragraph (h) which refers to &quot;safeguarding the economic or financial interests of the European Union or the State, including on monetary, budgetary and taxation matters&quot; and it would be a very serious concern if immigration became in any way a basis for the restriction of a data subject rights. <\/p><p>That would be fine in respect of taxation matters, but what is not clear to me is what would happen in a case where an individual's exercise of his or her rights were to have a cost to the State, for example if an individual is asking to be informed of any breaches of his or her personal data.  An individual's right to have the appropriate treatment of his or her data should not be removed simply because by exercising that right, the individual may have put a cost on the State.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Section 54(7)(i) would allow a Department to say that, if it allowed an individual to exercise his or her rights, it may have to increase his or her payment or to offer compensation and might leave itself open to a suit in the European Court of Justice or elsewhere under the GDPR.  There is a real concern that we could see access to justice and rights in the area of data protection being precluded simply because giving such access might cost money.  I know the Minister will say there are other points to consider such as the necessity test but I feel this section is wide-reaching.  Perhaps the Minister could fully assure me in this regard, but that is my concern in respect of section 54(7).<\/p><p>I will not go through each amendment in detail because I will not be pressing any of them.

I did indicate already that I would revisit it, and I will.  These amendments to section 54 give effect to Article 23 of the GDPR.  I accept that there has been some public commentary about this section which, in many respects, has involved some misunderstanding as to the likely impact it will have.  The overall purpose of this section is to offer protection to the public.  These objectives are very much in the public interest.  I do not see any circumstances in which it could be described as restricting the data protection rights of citizens.  I would not like that interpretation to endure because the overall purpose of the section is to provide protection to the public and individuals. I will give some examples of what is intended in this section.<\/p> <p>If we take, for example, the Medical Council or the Property Services Regulatory Authority, both embark on investigations from time to time in respect of doctors or estate agents on foot of complaints from clients or patients who allege that a serious breach or lapse has occurred or, in many cases, that a person is unfit to practice.  If the data protection rights of the doctor, estate agent or auctioneer concerned are not restricted on a temporary basis while the complaint is being investigated, it would be open to that person to apply to have the data rectified, restricted or even erased completely.  Of course any of these actions would have the consequence of ensuring the investigation would not be satisfactorily concluded or even take place, which would be against the interests of the person making the complaint and may well be against the public interest in the matter of the investigation of a complaint.<\/p> <p>I would like to make it clear that regulations made under this section will permit the regulatory body concerned and other similar regulatory bodies to carry out their statutory obligations to conduct inquiries or investigate complaints in the knowledge that the individuals being investigated will not be permitted to exercise data subject rights in a manner that could derail or jeopardise such activities.  Those being investigated and who are the subject matter of a complaint will not be permitted to exercise these rights to rectification or erasure while investigations are ongoing. <\/p> <p>In a similar manner, section 54(7) will permit investigations of, for example, an alleged harassment or sexual harassment incident in the workplace and will not permit the alleged perpetrator of such an act to obstruct or frustrate the investigation that will take place by seeking to exercise rights of access, constriction, rectification or erasure of personal data.  That is important.  Article 23 of the GDPR allows limited restrictions on data subject rights for such purposes, and this section gives effect to that article by allowing such restrictions in order to safeguard important objectives of general public interest.  It will introduce higher levels of data protection safeguards which will be superior to or will bolster restrictions already in place under section 5 of the Data Protection Act 1988, which will be well known to Senators. <\/p> <p>I want to stress that the restrictions permitted by Article 23 of the GDPR are far more limited that those permitted under current law.  In future, restrictions will be subject to the following conditions: they must be set out in a legislative measure, that is either in primary legislation or in regulations; they must respect the essence of the individual&rsquo;s rights, which of course involves respect for individual freedoms; and they should be necessary and proportionate in a democratic society.  These three important conditions are met in the text of section 54. <\/p> <p>Sections 54(1) and 54(2) give effect to the introductory text of Article 23(1).  Section 54(3) restricts the exercise of data subject rights and corresponding controller obligations in respect of the important objectives of general public interest outlined in sections 54(3)(a) to 54(3)(c).  These include, for example, the matter of Cabinet confidentiality, the independence of the Judiciary, and the matter of parliamentary privilege, which would be well known to us here in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the case of parliamentary privilege, the right of a data subject named during debates in this House to have his or her personal data erased from the record of proceedings is restricted in section 54(3).  The manner in which data subject rights could be exercised in respect of parliamentary proceedings was raised with my Department by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission during preparation of the Bill.  This provision has been included in order to address the matters that were raised on that occasion. <\/p> <p>I will give a brief example of an issue relating to section 54(3)(b), which carries over section 4(4A) of the 1988 Act, which is important in the context of protected disclosures and other activity that might be described as whistleblowing.  This provision will protect those who wish to provide information about wrongdoing in confidence and in the knowledge that the origin of the disclosure will not be made known to the individual about whom they are providing the confidential information.  Like the previous examples I have given, this section is included because it is in the public interest that the provision of such information be protected and that this new data protection regime does not in any way become an obstacle to such activity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Subsection (6) creates a regulation-making power whereby such restrictions on the exercise of data subject rights and corresponding obligations on the controller may also apply in the case of processing for other important objectives of general public interest, including those set out in subsection (7).<\/p><p>I want to turn now to the specific amendments.  For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 29, 30, 32 and 34, which seek to delete important subsections, namely, subsections (3), (4), (6), (7) and (8) from the Bill.  I am, however, willing to revisit amendment No. 33 on Report Stage.  It currently refers to \"matters relating to international protection and immigration\".  I take on board the concerns expressed by Senator Higgins and I accept that the wording can be improved.  It is intended to deal, for example, with cases involving fraudulent applications or cases where applications for protection would be based on illegality or misrepresentation.

The report of the data commissioner highlighted the very large number of breaches of personal data that have taken place in the State.  For example, in regard to the HSE, personal files have been left in public places or found in the street.  Those are examples of accidental and inadvertent but nonetheless very serious data breaches.  Crucially, there have also been cases of criminal and inappropriate data breaches such as the case in Donegal involving an official in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection who sold the personal data of individuals to insurance companies for less than &euro;30 each.  Prosecutions in such cases will, of course, follow in the normal course but this section relates to a person's right to know when their personal data has been compromised and breached.  It deals with a person's right to know if his or her data has been hacked, his or her files have been left in a bag in a public place or his or her data has been sold.  These are very serious concerns in terms of the right of the subject to know of such breaches.  The subsection does not deal with the point of redress but, rather, the right of a person to know if there has been a breach of his or her data that should not have happened and is not allowed for under the Act or the many wide exemptions that are given.<\/p><p>However, section 81 introduces a number of circumstances under which a person might not be informed about a breach of his or her personal data.  Subsection (2) provides that a person does not have to be told about a breach of his or her personal data where the controller has implemented appropriate technological and organisational protection measures and the measures, such as encryption, render the personal data difficult to understand or unintelligible to any person, or &quot;the controller has taken measures in response to the personal data breach that ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of a data subject from the breach is no longer likely to materialise&quot;.  I am very worried by section (2)(b) because it removes the right to notification if the controller does not think anything bad will happen or a risk is unlikely to materialise because of the breach.  Is it a three second rule or what are the rules in that regard?  The phrasing of the subsection is very wide.<\/p><p>Subsection (4) is of particular concern.  It provides that a controller does not have to tell an individual about a breach of his or her data where to do so would involve a disproportionate effort.  The question of what constitutes a disproportionate effort arises in that context.<\/p><p>Subsection (6) introduces a measure governing a situation where a controller notifies the commission of a data breach but has not notified the data subject to whom the personal data relate under subsection (1) or (4), as the case may be, of the personal data breach.  It is a safeguard whereby the controller can tell the commission of the breach and the commission may choose to notify the data subject.<\/p><p>Subsection (7) is entirely reasonable and provides that a controller may restrict the exercise of the right of a data subject to be notified of a personal data breach where to do so constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society.  It sets a high bar.<\/p><p>Although I have concerns about all of these subsections, my amendment is extremely mild.  It is milder than my concerns.  I do not currently seek to remove those provisions, although I may do so on Report Stage.  The amendment still allows for a controller to be permitted not to inform somebody of a data breach under these dangerously wide circumstances but I am trying to put in a very basic safeguard such that if a person inquires as to whether his or her data has been breached, the issues of whether the commission has been notified under subsection (6), the information was presented in an easily intelligible manner if a high level of effort was made to communicate it should not restrict the person's right to know whether his or her data has been breached.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I will come back to our example in Donegal, or the example of the case files left in the street.

This section of the Bill places a clear obligation on the data controller to inform a data subject if there is a high risk to the data subject's rights and freedoms arising from a breach.

Some of the high-profile cases, tribunals of inquiry and debates we have had here in Ireland in recent years have pertained to areas of criminal justice.  Questions of inappropriate breaches have arisen in the areas of criminal justice, criminal investigation and policing.

I acknowledge the reasons advanced in support of the far-reaching new section that is being proposed.  The position I am adopting in respect of it is the same as the position I adopted earlier when I dealt with a proposal that was first mooted at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  I am not going to accept it now because I believe we need an opportunity for further consideration of its provisions.  I will revisit this amendment, which seeks to deal with the risk that a data protection officer may encounter a lack of co-operation, on Report Stage.  I may even have an opportunity to come back to him in advance of Report Stage.  In exploring whether an effective remedy is already available to data protection officers, I will look in particular at the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  Senators will be aware that a disclosure of relevant information is protected under that Act if, in the reasonable belief of a worker, it tends to show a relevant wrongdoing and it came to his or her attention in connection with the worker's employment. Section 5(3) of the 2014 Act defines &quot;relevant wrongdoing&quot; as including circumstances in which &quot;a person has failed, is failing or is likely to fail to comply with a legal obligation&quot;.  I think this would include the obligations of a data controller under the general data protection regulation and this legislation, including the controller's obligations towards the data protection officer.<\/p><p>Section 6 of the 2014 Act provides for the making of a protected disclosure to a worker's employer.  Section 7 of that Act provides for disclosure to an external person who has been prescribed in an order made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We will come back to this.  I draw the further attention of Senators to Statutory Instrument No. 339 of 2014, in which the Minister prescribed a range of persons whom, by reason of the nature of their statutory responsibilities or functions, appear appropriate as recipients of protected disclosures.  This order prescribes the Data Protection Commissioner as a recipient of disclosures in respect of all matters concerning compliance with data protection law.  Subject to verification, I am of the view that this may provide an effective remedy when a data protection officer is concerned that he or she is experiencing difficulty in the performance of his or her functions.  A further advantage would be that any data protection officer making such a protected disclosure would be in a position to draw on the extensive protections provided under Part 3 of the 2014 Act.  When we come back to this matter, I will have a further opportunity to give the Senator appropriate assurances that this matter has been adequately dealt with and to see whether I can accommodate the proposal she has made.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Senator to give me a further opportunity to get back to her with appropriate assurances that the matter has already been adequately dealt with or that we will see if we can accommodate the proposal made by the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#XX01300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>It is important to say, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, at this juncture that I am always far-reaching so I will always stretch my neck out.

Section 89 refers to the restrictions on the exercise of data subject rights.  This is another section that restricts the right of an individual in terms of data protection.  My amendment expresses my concern, which has been flagged very heavily, about simply allowing ministerial discretion after taking advice from Cabinet.  I tabled these amendments quite early.  My proposals for section 32 might be more appropriate here.  I wish to note the proposal put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in in respect of the following idea.  If a Minister is going to decide to restrict an individual's or a data subject's rights, or produce regulations that allow for such restrictions, it should not be enough to simply take advice from the commission.  Instead, if a Minister chooses not to follow advice then he or she should explain the rationale for his or her decision.  <\/p><p>My amendment No. 51 seeks to insert the phrase &quot;subject to Cabinet approval,&quot; which is in the spirit of collective responsibility.  I tabled my amendment to prevent a situation where an individual Minister may, for example, choose to introduce regulations that restrict data subject rights without the full knowledge of all of the Government, given that the consequences of a breach of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, will certainly fall on all of the Government and, indeed, the State as a whole.<\/p><p>I will not press my amendment.

As a whole, the Bill provides a number of exemptions for public authorities and, as I mentioned at the very beginning of our discussions, it is not robust enough in ensuring effective mechanisms for the realisation of rights with data.  We have a situation in the Bill where for the individual who wishes to call on, or invoke, his or her rights to data protection, that individual's rights to insist on data protection are voidable in many circumstances in relation to public authorities and very difficult to enforce in relation to private companies.  To a large extent, the only course of action for an individual who wishes to pursue his or her rights and justice in terms of data protection in respect of the data controller is to go to the data commission.  However, the data commission is empowered to not take on an individual's concern.  Any individual can pursue a case to the European Court of Justice but that is a very high bar.  It is not something available to most people.<\/p><p>In many cases, people will want to seek justice or redress at the earliest point.  They may not be interested, for example, in pursuing cases through the courts for compensation.  In many cases, individuals may simply want an appropriate action to be taken, perhaps, for example, to have their data removed if it has been inappropriately held or their data not to continue to be shared, if they believe it has been inappropriately shared.<\/p><p>For people who find their data rights contravened, or for people who believe they have been contravened, after going to the local data controller, the main course of redress they have is to go to the Data Protection Commission.  However, in this section, the Data Protection Commission is given the right to refuse to investigate a complaint.  I am aware that under this Bill the Data Protection Commission will a huge volume of work placed on it.  That is clear in all the sections of the Bill.  However, I am concerned that the commission may choose to deny an individual an investigation of his or her complaint.<\/p><p>My amendment reads that the commission shall investigate the complaint, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the complaint, unless the commission considers the complaint to be frivolous or vexatious.  This is to introduce a higher bar for any case where the data commission may choose not to investigate a case.  We all know there may be cases which would be frivolous or vexatious.  However, those should be the bars rather than a danger that it may be refused.<\/p><p>The other point is that section 104 states that the commission shall examine the complaint and shall, in accordance with this section, take such action in respect of it as the commission, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the complaint, considers appropriate.  Amendment No. 61 seeks to insert the following words: &quot;with the consent of the parties concerned&quot; after the word &quot;Commission&quot;.  That is in respect of consent around further action.  I understand there may be situations whereby a criminal justice issue arises, so I am not going to press that amendment because I realise it is imperfectly worded.  However, the spirit of that amendment is to try to say there should still be a level of consent of the parties involved.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I previously spoke about the amendment of the Bill on page 85, line 6, saying the rejection of the complaint would only arise where the commission considered it to be frivolous or vexatious.  Amendment No. 63 reads: \"In page 85, line 7, to delete &ldquo;dismissal of the complaint&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;dismiss the complaint if the Commission is of the opinion that an infringement of a relevant enactment has not taken place\".  It is not clear if dismissal will be a matter of judicial interpretation.  Will it be dismissal on a specific basis or simply a dismissal?<\/p><p>Amendment No. 66 reads: &ldquo;(iii) rectify or erase personal data or restrict processing pursuant to Article 16, 17 or 18, and, in respect of that action, to comply with Article 19 and, where applicable, Article 17(2)&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The last point is probably one of the more important as we know it can cause distress.  It refers to where an action has been taken.  When the commission has made a decision, it should give the complainant a notice in writing informing him or her of the action taken and also the rationale for said action.  For example, if it believes the complaint has no basis, that there has been no transgression or that it is vexatious, the reason the action is being dismissed should be given.  It is part of a wider concern I have.  <\/p><p>I will not press any further amendment since I know that we are coming close to the end, but how does the Minister see individuals being able to effectively take action when their data rights have been breached?  They will, of course, complain to the data controller, but will it be done through the data protection commission?  If the commission refuses, what recourse will there be?  On Report Stage I may seek to bring forward certain mechanisms to, where there is a large volume of individual complaints, trigger an automatic investigation.  There may be a large number of individuals who feel powerless to complain on a subject.  Perhaps where a large volume of individual complaints have built up, it might trigger an automatic mechanism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#ZZ02600","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":421,"content":"<p>There are seven amendments being discussed, five of which are in the name of Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, while two are Government amendments.

Appreciating that the Minister may come at this issue by suggesting it is effectively a zero-sum game, what we would like to do is ensure there would be repercussions and examples set for organisations and bodies which might be in breach of data protection legislation.

I put forward reasons administrative fines should be imposed on public authorities and bodies only where they were acting as undertakings as understood under competition law.  It is important that we distinguish between the public and private sectors because, unlike the private sector, a fine imposed on the public sector has the effect of reducing the funds available to it to carry out its statutory functions.  For example, if a local authority was to face a fine of &euro;100,000 or more, this would undoubtedly result result in a restriction of services.  The sanction would ultimately be felt by the citizen, user or potential user of the public services concerned.  That is why fining public bodies differs from imposing the same sanction on private bodies.  Of course, the general data protection regulation leaves it to member states to decide whether such fines should be imposed on public authorities and bodies and, if so, to what extent.  If public bodies were to be fined, Senators would undoubtedly seek redress or funding in lieu of the fine imposed.  Were such replacement funds to be provided to compensate for funds lost in paying a fine, there would be a circular flow of public funds.  Where a public body is acting as an undertaking and in competition with the private sector, for example, in the provision of transport or hospital services, the Bill allows for the imposition of fines.  In that way, we ensure fair trade and a level playing field and that there will not be an element of discrimination between the public and private sectors which might otherwise be the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#CCC00800","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":519,"content":"<p>There is something fundamentally wrong.  The rights of the private sector in terms of competition are carefully and preciously guarded, but those of an individual to see to it that there is a consequence when data protection legislation is breached do not seem to carry the same weight and the imposition of fines in this area is not considered to be necessary.  We know and have seen the consequences when someone acts with impunity.  There will be investigations and reports, but, in the end, there will be no consequences, except where there was an advantage against a private company in terms of its profits.  The principles are not defended properly.  It is important that there be consequences when data protection legislation is breached.  It may be that funds will be reduced and need to be replaced, but they can be replaced with further conditions and caveats imposed.  For example, there is nothing to stop rules from being put in place to state there will be a stay on funds where a fine has been administered.  If there was no fine, perhaps moneys might be escrowed, subject to compliance and satisfaction of concerns.  Otherwise, what will stop public authorities which are defined widely in the Bill from stating they were caught again and again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#CCC00900","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1520346600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1520346600,"counter":521,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#CCC01000"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I must interrupt proceedings to hear from the Leader.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#CCC01100","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":523,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding what was agreed to on the Order of Business today, it is proposed that the House adjourn at 9.30 p.m. or on completion of Committee Stage of the Data Protection Bill 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018030600002#CCC01200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1520346600,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It does not seek to restore the full, large-scale fines under the general data protection regulation, given that they include fines of 4% of income, turnover and all the rest.  It would simply give a power to the commission.  I do not believe the commission, as established under the Bill, would be acting frivolously if it were to choose to impose an administrative fine on a processor which was a public authority or body.  We would not be triggering automatic fines which might be found to relate to private entities under the general data protection regulation.  Nonetheless, we are seeking to ensure the commission would have an additional power to impose a fine where a public body or authority was flagrantly disregarding the general data protection regulation and had repeatedly been found to be in breach of it.  That would be appropriate.  Will the Minister speak specifically to that question?  Is there a reason he believes the commission should not have the power to impose an administrative fine on a controller?  I am sure caveats that the commission would act in accordance with due diligence and that there would be proportionality, a necessity to do so and all the rest could be added.  It could even be seen as a measure of last resort that would be triggered after multiple breaches of data protection rights.<\/p> <p>I am also concerned about where public authorities and bodies are considered to be undertakings.  The concern is that the private sector should not be disadvantaged where the public sector acts as an undertaking.  However, a division has perhaps been inadvertently opened between those public sector bodies which are acting as undertakings and those which are directly delivering public services.
