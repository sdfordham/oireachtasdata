Once again I am raising the issue of medical cards.  I understand the task force has stated eligibility must be assessed on the basis of financial means but I deal with the whole area of discretionary medical cards every week.  People who have been diagnosed with terminal or very serious illnesses are coming to me.  They have never claimed from the State, always paid their taxes and have children in college without a grant or any form of assistance from the State and yet when they are extremely ill, having been diagnosed with cancer, and look for support to cover their medical expenses, their applications are refused.  I have raised the case of one family in my area.  The person has been diagnosed with stage 3 cancer.  This person applied for a medical card earlier this year and the application was refused.  Additional and pertinent information was submitted and the application was again refused.<\/p> <p>This person applied for a medical card as an individual.  The application was not on behalf of an additional member of the family, a spouse or anyone else and yet when the response came back, the whole family was ruled ineligible.  The point being made was that the application was not in respect of the family but rather the individual and that, please God, when the person would recover, that would be it.  The card was wanted for the duration of the illness alone.<\/p> <p>We should be examining the issue.  There was a time when things were examined at a local level, people knew the genuine cases and they were looked on favourably.  It is an additional stress for people who have been diagnosed with terminal or very serious illnesses that the card is not afforded to them.  The circumstances as such do not matter but it is particularly stressful for people who have worked all their lives, paid all their taxes and done everything for the State.  These people have never claimed anything.  Several of these families have pointed out to me that if they had never worked and spent their lives on the dole, they would automatically be entitled to a medical card.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State re-examine the situation?  Also, when these medical cards are being applied for, what exactly is being applied for should be examined.  This case did not involve an application for a family medical card.  The application was on behalf of an individual and yet every time that was pointed out, a letter was received stating it is family related.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#A00600","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  We have the details of the particular case to which the Senator refers but it would be inappropriate to discuss an individual&rsquo;s circumstances in public in the Seanad.  I know Senator Moran agrees with that.  However, I understand from the HSE that this application was unsuccessful as the means were in excess of the qualifying threshold for a medical card or GP visit card.  I have been advised by the HSE that additional information has been provided and the case has been referred for a discretionary review.<\/p> <p>The Senator will be aware that, in accordance with the Health Act 1970, as amended, full eligibility and a medical card are awarded to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  That is the reason the letters received by the individual refer to dependants.  In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.<\/p> <p>The Senator is aware of the Keane report, to which she referred on several occasions, on the expert panel on medical need for medical card eligibility, published in November 2014.  A key recommendation of the report was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  That was the main issue of contention.  It has been repeatedly stated that one cannot issue medical cards or GP visit cards for condition-specific reasons alone.  It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  The rationale behind the recommendation will be clear to the Senator.  On foot of the report, my Department and the HSE are undertaking a suite of measures to improve the operation and administration of the medical card scheme.  A number of those are already in place and are having a positive impact on how the scheme operates.<\/p> <p>A key element of the programme is the work of the clinical advisory group on medical card eligibility which was established by the director general of the HSE.  The group has been tasked with developing a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme.  The clinical advisory group made an interim recommendation to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.  The director general of the HSE accepted that recommendation and it has been implemented since 1 July 2015.  The clinical advisory group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving a significant burden due to an illness.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to advise the Senator that, on foot of these reforms, the HSE is exercising greater discretion.  That is evident in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation which increased from approximately 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 at the beginning of November this year.  Until we have universal health care and everyone has eligibility for health services, one will always have anomalies.  There will always be someone who is just above the means threshold, who does not have the prescribed disease or whose condition is not sufficiently severe and, as a result, those individuals will not meet the assessment criteria.  Universal health care, to which I am committed, is the only solution to address this issue.  However, as Senator Moran can see from the reply, we are taking another look at this application.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#B00100","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I am pleased to hear the Minister of State will look at the matter again.

People have enough things to worry about but when they have a medical card that is one less thing to worry about.  I read the Irish Cancer Society's report on additional costs.  Most costs relating to cancer treatment are met by the State whether or not one has a medical card because the treatment is in a hospital setting.  That is right and proper and that is why we have such success in terms of treatments and outcomes.  I hope Senator Moran's friend will have an equally good outcome.  The security element of the medical card is really what it is about.<\/p> <p>I accept there are additional costs for transport and being out of work.

The harbour has silted up to such an extent in recent years that the situation in Howth is bordering on being dangerous.  Even medium-sized fishing trawlers cannot enter the harbour at low tide whereas a few years ago, the harbour was accessible in all but the worst of weather.  Now boats have to lie off before entering the harbour for fear of catching the bottom and damaging their vessels.  Also, movement around the trailer basin at strong low tides is impossible.  Groundings are now more commonplace and can result in serious engine damage.<\/p> <p>The silting has also created problems for the Dublin Bay ferry service which has found it cannot keep to its schedule because it is restricted in terms of entering the harbour at Howth.  The ferry also uses Dublin Port and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Port and does not have such problems there.  Leisure boats encounter difficulties, which is likely to have a seriously detrimental effect on Howth Yacht Club's ability to hold major national and international sailing events.  I have also been told that it is now a regular occurrence for visiting boats, in particular, to run aground in the entrance channel and within the harbour.  I have been warned that it is only a matter of time before the harbour is blocked by grounded vessels, compromising safety and potentially preventing the operation of emergency services, including the lifeboat.<\/p> <p>I understand that even after a decision to dredge the harbour has been made, it may take two to three years to carry out the dredging programme as the necessary permits and licences will have to be obtained.  In the meantime, the crisis will get worse with more groundings and more risk to harbour users.  The annual accumulation of silt may cause some harbour activities to completely cease within two to three years.  Potential future business opportunities and proposed leisure activities and events will not be given a chance without a scheduled commitment to dredge the harbour.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Averil Power:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2351\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2351&amp;amp;pid=AverilPower&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For these reasons and others, it is essential that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine commits now to dredging Howth Harbour as a matter of priority and immediately sets aside funding for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#B00600","speaker":"1200","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Power for raising this important issue.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine is responsible under statute for the six fishery harbour centres located at Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Dingle, Rossaveel and Killybegs.  All six fishery centres are first and foremost working fishery harbours, which provide essential services and facilities to the fishing industry around the coastline of Ireland.  Each fishery harbour centre has unique features which facilitate a broad range of other diverse activities which are important from both an economic and social perspective.  The Department is conscious of the need to facilitate and further develop the fishing and non-fishing activities at the harbours.  This involves day-to-day operational support by harbour staff and management and development and repair of infrastructure subject to available financial resources.<\/p> <p>I am happy to advise the House that, notwithstanding the prevailing economic environment in which we operate, in excess of &euro;4.2 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Howth as part of the Department's annual Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme from 2011 to 2014.  For 2015, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, approved funding of &euro;1.79 million for the maintenance and development of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre.  Major works for 2015 include the continued upgrading of the electrical system, provision of a small craft pontoon and traffic management works.<\/p> <p>Siltation in Howth is recognised as an issue, as the Senator rightly pointed out, and is being kept under review.  It has been discussed with various stakeholders and officials from the Department attending the Howth Harbour Users Forum on 29 January 2015 used the occasion to have a number of meetings with users, where the issue of dredging was discussed.  A further meeting with Howth Yacht Club was held on 17 July where again the question of dredging was the main item of discussion.<\/p> <p>As part the 2015 fishery harbour centre development programme, the Minister sanctioned &euro;150,000 to carry out site investigation works in Howth for the west pier pontoon and the middle pier upgrade.  The site investigation contractor commenced work on site in early November and that is expected to be substantially completed by the end of this year.  It is anticipated that the report on the site investigation will be issued in early 2016.  This report will include information on the nature of the material to be dredged and extent of contaminated material within the dredge footprint.  This information is required to prepare a dumping at sea licence application, which will be necessary for the commencement of any dredging project that is needed in the area.  It will also provide the basis for an informed estimate of the cost of dredging the harbour at Howth.<\/p> <p>As with all other developments in the six fishery harbour centres, a dredging project at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will be considered under future capital programmes on the basis of available Exchequer funding and competing priorities.  The suite of projects for inclusion in the 2016 programme is being considered at present and the Minister will make an announcement on these in due course taking into account what has been said here and the value of Howth, particularly given its location on the east coast.

When speaking last summer, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was quoted as saying: &quot;Under our Constitution pensions are preserved property rights. I can no more take somebody's pension than I can arbitrarily decide to take their house&quot;.  That comment was published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in June 2015.  While this may be true, for some it is not true.  Some 80 former garda&iacute; who despite having the required five years minimum service, did not have their pensions preserved until the age of 60 because they were dismissed or resigned from the service prior to 1976.  This group, the majority of whom are now aged over 70 with many of them now partners or widows of former garda&iacute;, are naturally very aggrieved at this injustice and are seeking an immediate legislative remedy.<\/p><p>The background to this is that in 1978 the Garda Representative Association, GRA, reached an agreement with the Departments of Justice and Finance that members of Garda rank who resigned from the force on or after 1 October 1976 would have their pensions preserved to the age of 60.  This is the agreed report No. 218 of the Garda Conciliation Council.  This was followed by agreed reports Nos. 530 and 543, which provide for the preservation of pension entitlements for members who left the force for any reason after 1 October 1976.At the heart of the injustice is the fact that the details of the agreed reports, to which I referred only, came to light when members of the pre-October 1976 group approached the age of 60 and were informed by letter from the Department that they had been excluded without their knowledge.  Since then a group, led by councillor Pat Hynes from Galway, has been actively engaged in seeking justice and has made innumerable representations to the Department of Justice over the years but to no avail.  It is further notable that since 1976, these agreed reports have operated on an administrative basis only and have not been incorporated into a statutory instrument or underpinned by any amendments to the primary legislation, the Police Forces Amalgamation Act 1925.  It is therefore easy to revise them via legislation.<i><\/i>In the opinion of Mr. Gerard Hogan, senior counsel, &quot;members of the Oireachtas ought in justice, to rectify this wrong by means of the enactment of legislation to cater for the very discrete category of pre-1976 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&quot;.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2402\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Mr. Justice Hogan also reminded us that there is a precedent as legislation was passed retrospectively to enable a former Minister to apply to preserve his ministerial pension entitlements, even though he had not done so on time in the past.  This refers to the case of the former Minister for Education and Science, Dr. Michael Woods, who missed out on applying for a pension entitlement by the date provided for in the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act.  It would appear that where there is a political will, there is a way.  <br\/><br\/>I do not believe there is a citizen in the country who would begrudge these men their pensions.  To have their pensions restored to them would be viewed favourably by all as an indicator of a compassionate, paternalistic Government.  When one considers that &euro;7 billion was taken from the National Pension Reserve Fund to bail out two banks, the sums involved here are a drop in the ocean.  In terms of administration, resolution of this issue does not have to be done on a case by case basis.  It is more than an administrative issue; it is a constitutional right issue for which there is legal precedent.  In Lovett <i>v.<\/i>Minister for Education, 1997, Mr. Justice Kelly held that the right to a statutory pension was a property right protected by the Constitution.  In the past, former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter and others have defended the Government's decision to stand over the agreed reports, saying they were decisions reached through negotiations between the Garda representative body and the Department of Justice.  In light of the Lovett case, this defence no longer holds water as the fundamental constitutional rights of citizens cannot be negotiated away through union or any representative association.  The agreed reports amount to an unreasonable and unjustified interference in the rights of 80 people affected by this decision.  They are seeking nothing more than the justice they deserve.  They did not voluntarily agree to forfeit their pensions.  Most of them were not even aware that this had occurred.  <br\/><br\/>In the course of the judgment in Cox <i>v.<\/i>Ireland, 1992, Chief Justice Fennelly referred to certain property rights protected by the Constitution, such as the right to a pension gratuity and other emoluments already earned.  The pensions to which I refer have already been earned and it is unreasonable to withhold them any longer.  I respectfully ask the Minister of State to revisit this issue as a matter of urgency.  It is a matter of dignity and due respect to those who have served the State as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for many years.  The Government is to be complimented on the number of long-standing injustices that have been addressed over the past five years.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment to bring legislation before the Oireachtas in the next session to deal with this as many of those affected are well over 70 and have waited long enough for justice?  It is not only former garda&iacute;, most of whom are men, that are missing out.  Their widows are also missing out on this entitlement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#C00600","speaker":"1196","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I will stick rigidly to the script because it is an area I am not familiar with.

I will not be making any comment other than what is contained in the written reply but I am sure the Senator's remarks will be duly noted.<\/p> <p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who unfortunately cannot be here, I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  The issue was addressed in this House by the Minister's predecessor in April 2012 but I am happy on her behalf to set out the position to the Senator.  The terms and conditions of pension schemes have evolved over the years and continue to do so.  New terms and conditions are introduced with effect from a specific date and apply to members of the scheme from that date onwards.  Prior to 1 October 1976, where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resigned or was dismissed before reaching the age and service at which he could retire on pension, that member forfeited all superannuation benefits under the then Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na superannuation scheme.  This situation was changed following discussions at the Garda Conciliation Council, the industrial relations machinery for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was agreed at that time by both sides - the official side and the Garda representative associations - and endorsed by the then Minister for Finance that the new arrangements should apply to members of the force serving on or after 1 October 1976.  By extension, these new terms did not and cannot apply to members who had left the force prior to that date.  These discussions concluded in what are known as agreed reports.  Generally speaking, these agreed reports provide that a garda who resigned or was dismissed on or after 1 October 1976 can have the superannuation benefits that had accrued to the date of resignation or dismissal preserved until they reached 60 years of age.  There was no provision for the preservation of superannuation benefits in the case of members who resigned or were dismissed prior to 1 October 1976.  <\/p> <p>The then Department of Finance, and now Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which continues to have overall responsibility for public service pension matters, agreed with the proposals for a cut-off date for eligibility for preserved benefits.  This date varies depending on the particular organisation involved and the conclusion of negotiations between management and the relevant staff interests.  The cut-off date for civil servants was agreed by all parties to be 1 June 1973 and the cut-off date for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was agreed by all parties to be 1 October 1976.  I must stress that this was an agreed date between all of the parties involved in the discussions and was not imposed.  It is an inevitable consequence of the introduction of improvements in pension schemes that members of that scheme who had left it prior to the effective date cannot avail of that benefit.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#D00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister of State is speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality and can give no commitment.

The Minister would like to thank the Senator for raising this matter and wishes to assure the House that the education of children with special educational needs remains a key priority for the Government.  She welcomes the fact that even in the constrained economic circumstances faced in recent years, we have been able to continue to meet the needs of children with special educational needs attending our schools and to increase provision to address emerging needs in this area.  The SNA scheme, in particular, has been a major factor in ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and in providing support to pupils enrolled in special school and special classes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I hate that term.  It should be changed to &quot;specialist schools&quot; - that is a personal view.  In July last, the Minister secured Government approval for an additional 610 SNA posts to the end of 2015, in addition to the 365 SNA posts provided in 2015, to take into account increased demand and demographic growth and to ensure children can continue to have access to additional supports in school.  There is now provision for 11,940 SNA posts in 2015, which is the highest level of SNA provision that we have ever had, and is an increase of 13% on the number of posts available since 2011.<br\/><br\/>The Minister assures the House that schools which have enrolled children who qualify for support from an SNA will continue to be allocated SNA support in a manner appropriate to their needs.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The council operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support and these criteria are set out in the Department's Circular 0030\/2014.  All schools were asked to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2015-16 school year by 18 March 2015.  Of course, the NCSE continued to accept applications after this date in recognition of the fact that enrolment may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed.  Details of SNA allocations to schools for 2015-16 is available on the NCSE website at <i>ncse.ie<\/i>.  Each school's allocation of SNA support can change from year to year and may be increased or decreased as students who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school.  New students with care needs may enrol to replace students who have left, for example, or SNA allocations may be decreased where a child's needs have diminished over time.<br\/><br\/>The Senator's specific query relates to the allocation of support to an individual school.  The Minister can confirm that the NCSE has advised the Department that the school currently has an allocation of 0.5 SNA for the 2015-16 school year.  This represents no change over the SNA allocation to this school in the previous school year.  The NCSE has also advised the Minister that this allocation to the school was not the subject of an appeal and it has received no new applications for additional SNA support for this school.  On this basis, the council is happy that the school currently has the appropriate level of SNA support to meet its needs  The Minister would like to thank the Senator once again for the opportunity to clarify the position.

I, therefore, propose an amendment that the relevant Minister come to the House for an emergency debate on the flooding issue.  As we know, the forecast this evening for counties Clare and Kerry, all counties in Connacht, County Donegal and other parts of the country is again very bad.  In 2012 the Taoiseach spoke about the need to have much more sophisticated early warning systems and a system that would operate to best advantage for everybody.  After 2013, during which we saw the worst storms for 143 years, we heard the first calls from Met &Eacute;ireann for additional staff.  I see that, as part of the Government's announcements in recent days, the extra staff needed can be recruited by Met &Eacute;ireann, but it is too little too late.  An allocation of &euro;14.5 million for flood relief schemes for this year alone remains unspent.  While we welcome the provision of &euro;15 million to aid communities under siege because of recent floods, it is truly disturbing to listen to communities throughout the country, including in Athlone and Bandon and farmers along the western seaboard.  Last evening I spoke to somebody in Sligo whose house was completely flooded and who was in urgent need of somewhere to rent in order that they and their family could begin preparations for Christmas.  We are not ready for this and never have been.  Despite a series of measures announced by the Government in 2012 and specifically in 2013 when we witnessed the worst storms for 143 years, it seems we are as unprepared as ever.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, said there had been unanticipated delays in providing the funding required to deal with this issue.  What is the reason for the delays?  The Army needed to be called out much quicker to prepare by providing sand bags and making other preparations to mitigate the effects of the disaster that has taken place.  It is our contention that an urgent debate is needed.  The House is entitled to know that all hands are on deck and what measures will be taken in the coming days as conditions continue to worsen.  As we know, many families do not even have insurance because of what happened in 2012 and 2013.  Following very bad floods in the United Kingdom in 2013, the Government there undertook to sign a memorandum of understanding with the insurance industry in order that people who had experienced flooding in the past would still be in a position to take out insurance on their homes at affordable rates.  That is not the case here and one of the questions we want to put to the relevant Minister is whether there has been such contact with the insurance industry and whether a scheme is being prepared to ensure families will have this protection into the future.  <\/p> <p>We will push the amendment proposed to the Order of Business to a vote and I hope the Leader will be in a position to bring the Minister to the House to reassure us on what is taking place to mitigate the effects of a disaster that may get worse if the forecast as outlined is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#G00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I am sure the Leader will respond on the flooding issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, I welcome the allocation of &euro;5 million announced by the Government this week to assist small businesses that have suffered damage as a result of the flooding.  I also welcome the clarification from the Department of Social Protection of the scope of the humanitarian assistance scheme.  I note that the Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to individual households under the scheme, again in respect of flood damage.  All Members will be watching with great concern to see what happens regarding the predictions of rainfall and flooding across the midlands and along the River Shannon today.  While it is clear a great deal of work has been done to try to minimise any damage, it is certainly a matter of grave concern.  However, I welcome the measures which are already in place and which have been announced this week.<\/p><p>I also welcome the announcement made yesterday evening by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, that she intended to delete Rule 68 for primary schools.  This is the rule that enables religion to permeate the school day, which has been a huge issue for many parents across Ireland in the schooling of their children and which may not be in accordance with their conscience and lawful preference.  This change is long overdue and the deletion of the rule was recommended by the national forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary sector established by the former Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I welcome the announcement made by the Minister that she will do this in the new year.  I also note the passage through the D&aacute;il last week of the Private Members' Bill that had started as a Labour Party Private Members' Bill in this House to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act to ensure schools would no longer be able to discriminate against teachers on the basis of lifestyle or because they offended or were seen to offend their ethos.  This is hugely welcome, particularly for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, teachers and I am glad that it has been done.  The deletion of Rule 68 is a further step in making the school system more reflective of the reality of pluralism in society.  I ask the Leader for a debate on this matter in the new year because the Minister also has stated she recognises that an amendment will be necessary to equal status legislation to ensure schools will no longer be able to discriminate against pupils or prospective pupils on the grounds of religion.  I will be speaking this Saturday at the launch of a new campaign, Education Equality, which has been established by a group of parents who have been relatively prominent in the media in recent weeks, that is seeking to ensure this change will be made and that schools will no longer be able to discriminate on the basis of religion in their admission policies.  I also note that the Minister has stated, regretfully, the likelihood is she will not be able to get the admission to school legislation through in the lifetime of the Government.  This is a reform that must happen.  I commend the organisers of Education Equality for putting together a campaign in which it will seek to bring it about early in the lifetime of the next Government, if not before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#G00400","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I second the amendment proposed to the Order of Business by my colleague, Senator Marc MacSharry.  It is absolutely appropriate that the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, come into the House as a matter of urgency to explain what measures have been taken.  Government Members may not be aware that the amount of capital funding for flood defences this year is being cut from the amount allocated last year.  There was a reduction in the funding allocated prior to the storms and Members need to know what is happening.  I assure the Leader that there has been a cut in the budget and the figures are available.<\/p> <p>I wish to deal with a couple of items.  First, on 29 November I referred to three cystic fibrosis drugs that had been approved by the European Medicines Agency, EMA, on 20 November.  As I wrote to the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, on 1 November, in advance of approval by the EMA, I was on top of this issue before the recent issues arose in the funding of these drugs.  The Minister issued a statement yesterday that he was considering funding these drugs, which I welcome, but all Members should remember the nature of cystic fibrosis.  It can be a highly debilitating and life shortening illness.  These three drugs offer enhanced quality of life and extended life expectancy and if the figure is &euro;92 million, it would be &euro;92 million well spent.  There should be no further delay on the part of the Department of Health in approving them to make sure they will be available to the thousands of cystic fibrosis patients and sufferers in Ireland, many of whom are children.  I, again, ask the Leader to use his good offices.  I have written to the Minister, but I have not had a response since 6 November.  However, I intend to follow up on the matter.<\/p> <p>In the light of Senator Ivana Bacik's remarks, while some people in Ireland believe religion might be an offence, may I remind Members that it is an entitlement of educators to protect their religious ethos?  On foot of the proposed deletion of Rule 68, I ask Senator Ivana Bacik and others how Church of Ireland schools will protect their religious ethos in what is a minority religion?  How will the single Jewish school in the State be able to protect its religious ethos?  I remind colleagues opposite that in the most recent census 82% of Irish people declared themselves as Catholic, while a further 8% declared themselves as Protestant.  There are people with religious beliefs which also must be respected.  While I am all for equality in this regard, I do not desire to have a situation such as obtains in the United States of America or Britain where those who want their children to be educated within a certain religious ethos must choose private schools.  I do not want that to happen.  Has the Government agreed to the deletion of Rule 68?  Senator Ivana Bacik, as leader of the Labour Party in this House, has welcomed the proposed deletion of the rule, but that is a serious step forward.  I agree with Archbishop Diarmuid Martin in that under no circumstances do I believe children should be baptised or included in any faith community simply to obtain a school place.  That absolutely should not be done.  However, what about the millions of people who hold fast and firm and respect their religious ethos?  The Labour Party, in particular, appears to think anyone who holds a religious belief is inferior to its members and their views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#H00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>We never said that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#H00500","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I refer to respecting people in a republic.

It has finally come to people's realisation that we have a serious problem with flooding, be it coastal flooding or rivers bursting their banks.  I wrote about this extensively after the flooding that took place in 2014 along the coast of County Clare and all along the west coast.  Up until a few years ago, approximately &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million per year was being spent on flood defences.  While, thankfully, this figure has increased, it is now necessary to engage with the European Union to have an aggressive flood defences mechanism and programme under which the investment of hundreds of millions of euro is envisaged.  The same approach must be taken to flood defences in Ireland as was taken to building motorways during the era of the Celtic tiger.  Ireland has a fantastic road network because billions of euro was invested, rightly, to ensure its provision.  It is now necessary to spend billions of euro on flood defences.  We are an island nation surrounded by water and people live in coastal communities nationwide.  The homes of people in Clonlara, County Clare and other counties are being flooded and the people affected will be in a worse position in a few hours time.  Members must up the ante and there must be a realisation of the necessity to spend billions of euro on flood defences.  Moreover, such a programme must be put in place urgently.  While the State does not have the money to do this, we are a member of the European Union.  As an island nation at the extremity of Europe, we have as many rights as citizens of Germany, France, Italy and every other member state.  We must exercise these rights and apply for billions of euro in EU capital funding to ensure our citizens will not, from one month to the next, be fearful of inclement weather.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#H01500","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Aonta&iacute;m le cuid mhaith den mh&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite maidir leis na tuilte ar fud na t&iacute;re at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh an t-uaf&aacute;s dam&aacute;iste.  I support the call for a debate on flooding, which is serious in the west, in particular, and the south.  It has come to light that many of the issues arising in local areas are due to a lack of maintenance work being done during times when the weather is not bad.<\/p> <p>During recent briefings given by the local authorities in Galway city and county, we heard about the frustration of the management of both authorities in respect of their lack of resources and funding as a result of all the changes introduced by this Government under the Putting People First policy of former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan.  I have never seen local managers as agitated as they have been in the past two to three weeks.  For example, there are huge issues around housing and a lack of forward planning in terms of the hand-over of the administration of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  We are told that owing to inadequate numbers of staff to handle the transfer of thousands of applicants from the Department of Social Protection to the local authorities, serious issues will arise after Christmas.  <\/p> <p>Many of the flooding issues arising in local areas are due to blocked drains and work in that regard not being done during the summer.  Owing to the reduction in the number of staff on the ground and a lack of funding for maintenance work - such as drain unblocking and road-sweeping and fixing - this work is not being done.  When we approach local authorities about these issues, we are told there is no money available to do the work.  We are also told that Irish Water is putting pressure on the local authorities to cut job numbers and that this is likely to occur in the next couple of months.  Instead of increasing staff numbers, there is a huge push to get rid of people who are working on contract for Irish Water in the local authorities.<\/p> <p>There has been much debate in recent times with regard to housing and so on.  We need to continue that debate because of the lack of social housing, the homelessness crisis and so on.  Following the terrible tragedy in Carrickmines, we heard that many local authorities had returned unspent allocations for Traveller accommodation.  This was refuted last week by Galway County Council.  According to that council, its applications for funding under the Traveller accommodation programme were turned down.  We need clarity on this issue.  Somebody is not telling the full truth on these matters and we need to address that.<\/p> <p>A debate on the issues relating to storm damage and to the need for ongoing maintenance work to be carried out between storms and for the requisite resources to be provided is vital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#J00100","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Like previous speakers, I would welcome a broad debate on the issue of flooding throughout this country.  Global Flood Solutions, a company based, in part, in Athlone, County Roscommon - ironically, one of the worst hit areas in terms of the flooding - sells flood relief products all over the world yet the Irish Government will not do business with that company in the interests of solving the problems that are being experienced in places such as Athlone and Athleague.  It beggars belief that nobody from Government is willing to engage with this company, which could assist us in solving the problems - albeit temporarily - of the many families and businesses throughout the country that are suffering today because of flooding.  I would welcome a debate on this issue as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#J00200","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I support the call for a debate on the current flooding crisis.

I understand that this company has been seeking engagement with the Office of Public Works for many years about its products and that its requests have been refused thus far.  In 2009 I spoke in this House about the village of Athleague, which was under water at the time.  Three public houses in that village remained closed until after Christmas that year because they were under water.  Two of those pubs have since ceased trading, which is illustrative of the affect of flooding on an area.  Athleague village is now under water again.  While local people are assisting each other in terms of the clean-up of houses, etc., the local pub remains closed.  The local butcher shop, a chemist's premises and other shops are also closed.  The situation is distressing.  The proposed budget to address this crisis is inadequate.  One fifth of the money being allocated could be spent in County Roscommon alone, where Golf Links Road and Lanesboro Road are, for a second time in six years, flooded.  This Government has stood idly by since 2011 and has not put any investment into addressing this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#J00300","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>The Senator is wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#J00400","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>In 2014-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#J00500","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il did a lot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#J00600","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>-----it abolished the drainage board, which could have assisted in alleviating the flooding in Athleague-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#J00700","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il was going to drain the Shannon 100 years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#J00800","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>-----by widening the outlet there.

It is important that this issue be resolved.  It is also important, in the context of the negotiations relating to the drug, that we get value for money.  There has been much coverage in the past couple of years with regard to the availability of particular drugs and the fact that the latter comes down to the bargaining positions adopted by those involved, which is unfortunate.  I accept that a great deal of time and money has been spent on researching and producing the drug in question but it is important that we get value for money from the process.  I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien that this drug should be made available at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p> <p>Two recent requests by me for a Commencement matter debate on the issue of two facilities in Cork that can cater for 35 homeless people but have been lying vacant for four or five years were ruled out of order.  These properties were purchased by Cuan Mhuire and were to be used to provide accommodation for people who have completed treatment for alcohol addiction and who are now on the road of recovery.  It is sad that these facilities remain vacant.  I sought to have the relevant Minister address this issue by way of Commencement debate, such that these facilities could be brought into use at the earliest possible opportunity at a time when we need them.  It is unfortunate that my requests were ruled out of order.  While I fully respect the Cathaoirleach's ruling on this matter, I believe that, given the urgent need for these facilities, the relevant Minister should come to this House to explain why they remain idle.  I ask that the Leader inquire from the Minister why there has been no co-ordination between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the relevant local authorities in this matter.  One of the units is located in Cork county and the other is in Cork city.  As I said, these facilities, which can cater for 35 people, remain vacant.  We need those facilities up and running as soon as possible.

One of the concerns is that in attempting to bring the living wage up to a level that would be acceptable, we could damage jobs.  Employers might find that if they had to pay an awful lot more, they would not be able to do what they would like to do.

The forum on patronage and pluralism reported two years ago and recommended dissolving rule 68.  That report went to the Minister back in 2012.  It is not throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  The rules for national schools, of which rule 68 is one, were devised 50 years ago.  The language used in all of the rules should and will be revised, presumably, along with rule 68.  We would not have any problem at all with reviewing the language used in another piece of legislation from 50 years ago.  One of the rules states that junior infants should be taught by the mistress - a woman.  Maybe that was a good idea or maybe it was a bad idea.<\/p> <p>I would go along with looking at all the rules.  When we are doing so we must pay attention to what we put in their place.  There is a new articulation of language recognising that there are many types of children, as Archbishop Martin has said himself.  Baptising a child just to get him or her into a school is not the way to do it.  I would go along with retaining a lot of rule 68 but under a new guise.  It has good things like charity, justice, inculcating truth, patience, obedience - there are lots of good things there and it is not all bad.  We want to ensure that we include all children of no religion and some.  <\/p> <p>I call for a debate on the Growing Up in Ireland survey, particularly on one aspect of it.  Some 28% of all deaths among children between 0 and 3 years of age in the EU are due to injuries.  A particular report in Ireland targeted accidents involving children between the ages of 1 to 3 and asks for a review of education of parents, how to avoid accidents or whatever.  The percentage of children in Ireland who are hospitalised is very high.  The Growing Up in Ireland study called for a review.  I would like a debate on how we are going to address this issue.  Accidents are also higher in boys than girls.  Recklessness would come to mind.

Rule 68 is an archaic rule.  Children have a human right under the European convention to a neutral studying environment, and that is clearly not the case in this country.  There is a lack of choice for parents who do not wish for their children to receive religious instruction.  We have seen the difficulty this country has had over the years with how religion can take precedence over instruction and education.  We have seen the abuses which followed as a result.  No parent or child should be forced into a situation in which religious instruction underpins their day.

That person has been told the time limit has expired, although I was not even aware there was a time limit, and will now have to make a fresh application, which requires a voluminous amount of documentation.  This is a lone parent on social welfare with a sick child but the number of documents required in order to be considered is shocking.  Not only has the person now been advised to apply again, three or four months after they applied, but they have to supply more up-to-date documentation and a repeat of everything they supplied before because the centralised medical card agency in Dublin lost the documents.  Not only that, but when I asked, on this person's behalf, if they could have the documents returned, given these included a P45, of which there was only one copy, I was told the only way they could get the documents returned was by putting in a freedom of information request.<\/p><p>What sort of an inhumane system have we, as legislators, created?  When the medical card system operated at local level, it was a very simple matter, as anybody in this House who has experience of it will know, in that one could get through to the person involved in the local office and he or she was able to sort it out.  There were never difficulties surrounding medical card applications.  I am appalled at the manner in which this applicant has been treated.  A very inhumane system has been put in place.  As a result, I have initiated through the Oireachtas Library and Research Service a full review of how these regulations came into place, who put them in place, what statutory regulations have been put in place and what are the legal requirements that mean a person has to go through the freedom of information process to get documents back.<\/p><p>I want the Minister for Health to come to the House.  The buck has to stop with him because he is the person in charge, although he likes to think and to tell the general public that he is not in charge at all, that he is only passing through and that he is a commentator.

We have all seen the footage of the floods, ruined homes and businesses and the Christmas plans that have been destroyed.  There have been four Atlantic storms this year.  However, there are two things that are predictable, severe weather and the pathetic response from Government.  Each time it happens, we get too little, by way of a response, and too late.  It seems to have come as a revelation to the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, that legislation prevents flood relief compensation to businesses and that only households may benefit.  This is a Government that prides itself on getting the economy going again and getting people back working.  How can it be jobs-friendly if businesses are allowed to suffer in this way?<\/p> <p>When this crisis happened last year, along with others, I called on the Government and the then Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, to take concrete steps to mitigate the harmful effects of future storms.  The Government should have applied to the EU solidarity fund but it did not.  It should have aided small businesses with a Government subsidised insurance scheme where people are not able to get private sector cover but it did not bother to do that either.  The  Government has chosen to do nothing for small businesses impacted by flooding.  It is too little, too late to be talking about frustration with the situation on the eve of a general election.  People are rightly frustrated with the lack of emergency funding for individual home owners and a lack of financial cover for businesses.  Any further delay is inexcusable.  Like others, I have been driving in east Galway where the flooding has been extremely difficult and frustrating for people.  It is time the Government realised it is in government and did something about this.<\/p> <p>Many of us grew up enjoying the romanticised versions of private investigators' lives - I think of \"Magnum PI\" and others.  When we look at the reality of what private investigators get up to, however, it can be more sordid and grubby.  Senator Craughwell's amendment, which I want to second, calls on the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to tell us what she knows and what she is going to do in regard to the necessary investigation of not just the activity of private investigators but also of officials in the Department of Social Protection.  This is an important issue.  It is yet another example, perhaps, of the creep that goes on where banks and officials of State collude to subtract from people's rights, in particular, the right to privacy and the privacy of their data.  I want to second Senator Craughwell's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#L00500","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Given that business is scheduled until 10 p.m., the Leader is unlikely to be able to accede to a request that the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, would come to the House to discuss the flooding issue.

Educators should be entitled to protect their religious ethos.  I agree it is unacceptable that people cannot get places in schools but perhaps that is because the Government has not provided enough school places and it has very little to do with religion.<\/p> <p>I wholeheartedly support the comments of Senators Craughwell and Mullen on private investigators.  The issue has been raised for a number of years.  It was raised previously by Senator Michael D'Arcy, by the Leader and by me.  On one occasion I brought to the attention of the House a situation involving a young man who had paid 75% of a loan he had on a truck to provide employment for himself and a number of other colleagues.  He fell on hard times as a result of the recession and missed two payments.  While he was attending an interview to seek employment, thugs arrived at his house, intimidated his mother - an ill elderly lady - robbed his truck and sold it for a pittance.  That is the type of activity that was going on a number of years ago but, unfortunately, it continues to go on.  So-called reputable financial institutions - I hesitate to use the word \"reputable\" due to their history - continue to use such practices and they are getting away with it.  That is totally unacceptable.  We must have a debate on the issue.  I call on the Leader to facilitate a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  She is due in the House on Friday and perhaps she could stay on for an extra few minutes and we could discuss this very serious situation.  It is well known that private investigators are going around snooping, as Senator Craughwell said, on private individuals and leaking information to media outlets in order to embarrass them.  It would be worth examining the situation to find out what the State-sponsored banks are paying such individuals.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact that the Government has handed the &euro;5 million in emergency aid to the Irish Red Cross to distribute.  It is a most appropriate organisation for that purpose.

I visited Craughwell and Athenry in recent days and met with families affected by flooding.  I am dismayed at what they have gone through.

This rule states that religious education is by far the most important part of the school curriculum.  Currently, children spend 30 minutes per day, or two and a half hours per week, on religious education, which is incredible when one compares it with some other core subjects.  Even physical education gets less than an hour per week.<\/p><p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently reviewing the national school curriculum with recommendations to be published some time next year.  I call on the Minister to ensure that the time allocated to physical education is increased and that the manner in which it is delivered changed in line with the Points for Life initiative that was introduced in the Seanad and delivered in a pilot programme in 2013 and 2014 under the guidance of the Professional Development Service for Teachers.  It is not just me requesting this.  There are teachers, parents, coaches and many people in our community who unanimously agree that it should be done.  We all know about the value and importance of physical education in a child's development and overall well-being.  It is now time to do something about it and I believe this is the way we can go forward.  I call for a debate on this issue at some time in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#M03100","speaker":"1165","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>A Private Members' motion from the Social Democrats was moved in the D&aacute;il last night calling for the establishment of an anti-corruption agency.  This is most timely.  It is something we announced a number of weeks ago.  The \"RTE Investigates\" programme was only the tip of the iceberg.  Corruption is endemic in public life and includes more than just three county councillors.  It stretches to the heart of what we do.  We have seen it in the past in respect of various tribunals such as the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals and issues relating to land rezoning.  There could have been a tribunal for each local authority in the country.  If one scratches the surface in respect of many of the land banks that could no longer be financed by local government, were bought at a premium level during the boom years and are now under the Local Government Management Agency, which is essentially a NAMA for local government, and if one saw the deals that were done in acquiring those sites one would draw some very interesting conclusions.  From issues relating to Anglo Irish Bank, which has become IBRC, to the sale of Siteserv and NAMA properties, one can see that it is rotten.  Some parties are decrying it when they have been complicit in it for many years.  Some of the more newer Members of Leinster House have been giving out about corruption.  Parties that cover up other areas like child abuse and sex offences cannot have any credibility when it comes to issues relating to corruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#N00200","speaker":"1209"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Can the Senator clarify what that means?

I am doing my best to facilitate the House.  I do not propose to address the question of flooding, which so many Members have raised.  We will leave it for the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>Senators Ivana Bacik, Darragh O'Brien, C&aacute;it Keane, Eamonn Coghlan and M&aacute;ir&iacute;a Cahill spoke about Rule 68.  I hope we would have a debate on that matter early in the new year.  Certainly, respect must at all times be given to people's religious beliefs.  Everybody would go along with that.  The ability of people to have a religious belief and send their children to the schools they wish to send them to is sacrosanct.  In respect of repealing Rule 68 and all the other matters, the Minister for Education and Skills stated last night that she intends to do it some time in January so we might have an opportunity to discuss that matter and other educational matters in January when we come back.  <\/p> <p>Senators Darragh O'Brien, Fidelma Healy Eames and Colm Burke spoke about the new drug for cystic fibrosis sufferers.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Health.  I do not know whether the Senator raised the issue as a Commencement Matter.  If he did not do so, I suggest that he raises it as a Commencement Matter and gets a full reply on the matter from the Minister.  One of the good things about this House is that we can call in a Minister to deal with a Commencement Matter, so if a Senator is not getting a reply from the Minister, I suggest he raises it as a Commencement Matter.  <\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about staffing in local authorities to deal with the HAP scheme, housing and Traveller accommodation.  I agree with him that if Galway County Council said it applied for funding for Traveller accommodation and could not get it, it should be investigated as a matter of urgency because we have been told that money is available for Traveller accommodation.  There is no question that there is more than sufficient money available for local authorities who wish to draw down funding for housing.  <\/p> <p>Senator Kelly spoke about companies dealing with flood relief in his constituency.  Again, this may be a matter for the Minister of State to deal with.  Senator Colm Burke spoke about accommodation for homeless people in Cork city and county and asked that some properties that are not in State ownership be funded.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maurice Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a matter for the local authorities and the agency which owns these properties but I am sure that if they applied to Government for funding, it would be seriously considered by Government.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn called for a debate on a report compiled by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, entitled Low Pay, Decent Work and a Living Wage.

It is a very crude instrument of taxation which is why we are committed to removing the burden of USC from hundreds of thousands of people and reducing all the rates of USC in this Finance Bill.  Ultimately, we are also committed to the abolition of the USC.  The priority of the Government and Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan is to abolish the USC over time.  His preference at the moment with the limited fiscal space available to him is to reduce the various rates.  The Bill provides for an increase in the entry point to USC from &euro;12,012 to &euro;13,000 from 1 January 2016.  It is estimated that over 700,000 income earners will not be liable for any USC at all in 2016.  The entry point to the USC was &euro;4,004 when we came to Government and this will be the third occasion on which Deputy Noonan will have increased the entry point.<\/p> <p>The number of income earners exempt from the USC is affected by the condition of the economy because as the economy continues to improve, more people will be earning more than the entry point to the USC.  The increase in the minimum wage from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.15 per hour will increase the hourly income of minimum wage workers by over 5.7%.  It is preferable for an individual to pay some USC and have a higher net income than to be exempt from the USC and have a lower net income.  The changes announced in the budget will mean that all income earners who pay the USC will see a significant reduction in their USC bill from 2016 for the same level of income.<\/p> <p>I take the broader point that Senator Barrett is making but it is the policy preference of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to work towards the abolition of the USC.

We can only make recommendations here.  The purpose of this recommendation is to reduce taxation on low income earners who earn less than &euro;19,752 a year.  We came to that figure by way of our own proposal to raise the minimum wage by &euro;1.50.  At that level, we believe it would be at the threshold of a normal week's work for a worker.  We feel that the &euro;13,000 figure that the Minister has selected falls too short.  Those on minimum wage in the State are hit hardest with regard to the challenges of rent, education costs and the different expenditures that people have in terms of day to day living.  We believe there is a necessity to move towards a living wage and we seek to ensure that there is space available for people to be able to live on that wage.  Taking anyone earning less than &euro;19,572 a year out of USC would allow for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#R01400","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Reilly for her recommendation.  It would appear from the wording of the proposed recommendation that it is the Senator's intention that all those earning up to &euro;376 per week, just over the earnings of a full-time worker on the new minimum wage of approximately &euro;357 per week, should be exempted from the charge to USC entirely.  It is unclear whether the Senator also intends that this recommendation would consider all income earners with income of less than &euro;19,572, rather than just workers.  I do not think that is what the Senator is trying to do but it is a little vague in that regard.  Such a group would also include pensioners and people with income from their investments.<\/p> <p>The Senator will be aware that the budget contained a number of measures specifically targeted at supporting those on lower incomes.  With regard to USC, the changes proposed to the Finance Bill include the extension of an exemption threshold to &euro;13,000 per annum.  This measure alone removes an estimated 40,000 low-income earners from liability to the charge entirely.  It is now estimated that over 700,000 individuals - 29% of all income earners - will not be liable to USC from 2016.  In addition to this, as a result of a reduction of the two lower rates of USC and the extension of the ceiling for the second rate of USC from &euro;17,576 to &euro;18,668, all those earning the increased minimum wage with an average working week of 39 hours will remain liable to the two lower rates of USC, notwithstanding the increase in their gross income.  Senators may also be aware of the new PRSI credit which was introduced in the budget in order to address the PRSI step effect, which otherwise would have negatively impacted on workers on the increased minimum wage.  This is a further measure aimed at supporting those on lower incomes, by smoothing entry into the PRSI system.<\/p> <p>With regard to the proposal from the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators who would like a report prepared on options to increase the USC exemption threshold to &euro;19,572, it should be noted that this would increase the entry point above the current entry point to income tax, which stands at &euro;16,500 per annum for a single employee.  As a result, such an individual would pay no tax, no USC, and would have a minimal liability to PRSI.  To do this would seriously undermine the original rationale for the introduction of the USC, so we need to look at it in the context of how one phases out the USC in a fair manner.  In addition, the USC was intended to ensure that for as long as it lasts most individuals would make some contribution towards the provision of services and towards assisting in restoring the public finances.  The removal of individuals earning up to &euro;19,572 would obviously not achieve this.  <\/p> <p>When the Government considers options for a budgetary tax package, it must take account of all the parts of the package and therefore single measures could not be contemplated in isolation.  Taking these factors into account, the Minister is not minded to expend resources of the Department on the production of the report requested by the Senator, and therefore cannot accept the recommendation.  On the issue of a living wage and how we ensure people earn a decent wage, there will obviously be different policy proposals from all parties on that.  I fear that increasing the minimum wage by the rate that Sinn F&eacute;in proposes would have the unintended consequence of stalling job creation.  We can debate that issue at another time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#R01500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

It has been made in this and the other House on numerous occasions and we are all very familiar with the arguments for and against it.  The Minister of State knows what I will say and I know what he will say but God loves a trier.  At the heart of the recommendation that a report be produced on options to introduce a third rate of tax, payable at 47% on income over &euro;100,000, is the question of how to have an income tax rate that would allow people work to hard and take home more money that would allow them to live comfortably, while contributing more.  It would put a brake on the growth of the income chasm between the and poor that we discussed on Second Stage.  We need to ask ourselves how this could be done in a way that would not penalise people on middle incomes and who might be squeezed.  On every &euro;1 over &euro;100,000 we suggest an extra 7 cent should go into the State's finances which would have the effect of creating a more equal society, putting a brake on the growing disparity in incomes and bringing hundreds of millions of euro into the State&rsquo;s finances to address some of the problems being experienced by those in the lowest third of the population&rsquo;s earners.<\/p><p>On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il my colleague, Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, related this to the concept of price elasticity saying there was not necessarily a linear relationship between tax or price and behaviour.  He said if people were asked if they would be happy to pay a little more tax in order to have a health service in which patients would not wait on trolleys, 90 year olds would not have to wait days and children would not be forced to take painkillers for tooth pain because they had been waiting months for dental surgery, most would say they would be willing to pay a little extra if necessary and if they could afford it.  This recommendation proposes that those on high incomes could contribute 7 cent more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#S00200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>As the Senator said, we have this exchange regularly in this House and the D&aacute;il and know one another&rsquo;s positions clearly.  I do not buy into the logic that if taxation was increased on something, it would yield more.  While accepting that everyone has to pay his or her fair share and that the system has to be progressive, there is significant evidence to suggest that if we want more of something, we should tax it less.  If we want more jobs and productivity in the economy, we should not hike up taxes, particularly when living on an island with two jurisdictions.  If the Senator is in favour of a united Ireland and having an all-Ireland economy, having two very different marginal tax rates, whereby somebody in Northern Ireland pays a much lower rate than somebody in the Republic, would not be good for investment in the Republic and would not make much sense in the promotion of an all-Ireland economy.  It is important to note that the top 1% of income earners pay 22% of the total income tax and universal social charge take.  That is up from 21% last year and 19% the year before that.  I am absolutely in favour, as is everyone in this House, of progressivity and people paying their fair share, but we need to ensure there are no unintended consequences.<\/p> <p>The basis for the recommendation is having a report laid before the D&aacute;il on the options for introducing a third rate of income tax of 47% on individuals&rsquo; income in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment is not to increase top marginal tax rates.  A third rate of tax of 47% would increase the top rate of tax by seven percentage points.  It would also have the effect of increasing the top marginal tax rate to 59% for employees and 62% for the self-employed.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, discussed this proposal at length with Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  He expressed his concerns, supported by research from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, that tax rates at such levels would be anti-competitive and could drive skilled workers out of the country at a time when we needed to battle to attract skilled workers and talents into the country and to stay here.  His view is that this recommendation would damage rather than support the economy.  Marginal tax rates influence individuals&rsquo; decision to work more or work at all.  Higher marginal tax rates for earners might also incentivise a greater level of tax evasion and contribute further to the development of a shadow economy.  As the Minister stated in his Budget Statement, it is his desire to have every worker progressively moving to a point where the marginal tax rate will not be more than 50% for all workers.  We think this would make Ireland more attractive for mobile foreign investment and skills, including for returning emigrants and attracting and keeping skills in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#S00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449657000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Recommendation put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449657000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Sections 15 and 16 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449657000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>SECTION 17<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449657000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 17 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I tried to research the estimate of &euro;70 million per production and found completely contradictory estimates, some as low as &euro;4.5 million and some much higher.

It is an important point and I asked officials in the Department to liaise further with them.  They corresponded by e-mail with the Senators to explain the rationale behind this measure.  It is not a case of the Government or Ireland deciding on a measure but of recognising the EU rules around it.  It is not entirely clear from the wording proposed in the recommendation what the specifics are that the Senator wishes to be contained in the proposed report.  We can engage on that matter and, I hope, provide him with whatever information he needs between now and Report Stage. <\/p> <p>The EII scheme is targeted at job creation and retention and available to the majority of small and medium-sized trading companies.  However, as it is a state aid scheme, the Irish authorities were required to make changes to the qualifying company criteria in order to comply with the new guidelines that came into effect recently.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Harris:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2338\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, as the EII is a state aid scheme, the Irish authorities were required to make changes to the qualifying company criteria to comply with the new guidelines that came into effect recently.  The alternative could have resulted in the scheme being in breach of state aid rules.  In such a scenario, the Commission could have requested the suspension of the scheme in its entirety and launched a full investigation regarding its compatibility with the internal market rules.<\/p><p>In allowing for state aid for risk finance investments, the Commission has moved away from qualification criteria based on whether an enterprise is in seed, start-up or expansion phase and has now set new criteria on the type of companies that can qualify.  These new European rules stipulate that a qualifying company must not have been operating in any market; have been operating in any market for less than seven years following their first commercial sale; or require an initial risk finance investment which, based on a business plan prepared in view of entering a new product or geographical market, is higher than 50 % of their average annual turnover in the preceding five years.  That is how we arrived at that.<\/p><p>In addition, regarding follow-on investments, the following three criteria must all be met: the lifetime limit of &euro;15 million is not exceeded; the possibility of follow-on investments was foreseen in the original business plan; and the company has not become linked with another company such that it would no longer be an SME.  The revised guidelines from the Commission take account of the fact that SMEs may face difficulties in gaining access to finance, particularly in the early stages of their development.  The Commission notes that business finance markets may fail to provide the necessary equity or debt finance to newly created and potentially high growth SMEs resulting in a persistent capital market failure, which negatively affects SMEs growth prospects.<\/p><p>The Commission, therefore, made the changes to the qualifying company criteria in recognition that newer SMEs find it more difficult to raise funding via traditional routes. Such companies typically create more employment than companies that have been operating for longer periods and this furthermore justifies the targeting of the relief.  Regardless of whether I agree with the recommendation, the hands of the Government are tied in this regard.  We need to make sure an investment scheme put in place to support start-ups and SMEs is compliant with EU rules.  If it is not compliant, we risk jeopardising the scheme.  The Commission had been monitoring this and its view is clear to the Department.<\/p><p>We published the detail of the changes in the financial resolution on budget day.

However, this also misses out on public transparency.  It is interesting that the public is not allowed to know what is happening.

As such public transparency is important, I ask the Minister of State his opinion as to whether he considers it right there should be transparent public knowledge on country-by-country reporting.

However, I also greatly respect taxpayer confidentiality.  Where should one draw the line?  Do people want to see the Senator's tax affairs or my tax affairs?  While it is important that the Revenue authorities should see them, they are confidential, are independent and are held in high regard by the public.<\/p> <p>While understanding the rationale behind the Senator's recommendation, the main reason I am not in a position to accept it is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process is a highly-positive step forward in that our tax authority, and indeed every other tax authority signed up to the OECD BEPS process, will be able to receive this country-by-country reporting.  That means not only will the Revenue Commissioners in Ireland know about the level of tax paid by certain companies here, they also will know about the level of tax paid in other OECD countries.  This can only be a good thing in respect of tackling aggressive tax planning, tax evasion and various other concerns that are shared by Senators on all sides of the House.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge this is an issue Senator Barrett raised in the Chamber yesterday.  However, were we to do anything that goes further than the OECD BEPS process, we would be giving a reason, an excuse or a way out to other countries not to share that information with our tax authority.  In other words, the agreement on the BEPS process is there will be country-by-country reporting and tax authorities will share the information.  The agreement is, however, that such information remains confidential to tax authorities.  What I do not wish to do, I respectfully suggest the Senator does not want me to do it either, is to undertake to do anything that would jeopardise receiving additional information which the Revenue Commissioners do not possess today but will have as a result of the OECD BEPS process.<\/p> <p>That said and in fairness to the issue raised by the Senator, it is a matter the European Commission is examining separately.  The Commission is examining the issue of public country-by-country reporting.  This would require companies themselves to make publicly available information about their operations, activities and profits in each country in which they operate.  As I am sure the Senator is aware, the Commission recently held a public consultation on the issue and has now commissioned an impact assessment.  The Government awaits the outcome of its impact assessment, which I consider to be the prudent thing to do.<\/p> <p>One must ascertain the impact of any of these measures on jobs and investment but in any event, the Government will continue to engage actively in the debate on this issue at a European Union level while proceeding, through this Bill, with the introduction of country-by-country reporting to tax authorities, as agreed at the OECD as part of the BEPS process.  In general, I believe that on this issue and all international tax issues, it is important to have a kind of global consistent approach.  This is what has been agreed in respect of country-by-country reporting.  It is a significant step forward and will provide a lot more information to our tax authority and many others.  However, the Government cannot take the next step the Senator proposes it should take for the reasons I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#U00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Briefly, does the Minister of State have an idea as to when the European Commission's impact assessment will be published?

The basis for many of the changes is that Ireland has been regarded as an outlier in respect of corporation tax, which some people state has cost us dearly in respect of the amount of tax we should have been receiving for many years.  While the changes that have been made are welcome, as is country-by-country reporting, when people such as the Trinity College academic Professor Jim Stewart, using information from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the effective corporate tax rate paid by foreign firms is 2.2%, the damage caused by this shocks to the bone and affects people's human experiences.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the Minister of State has observed that a change from the agreed negotiated position would reduce the ability of that to function properly.  While there is logic to that position, it would be important in this regard that public information be given and for this report on the effective rates of corporation tax to be provided.  Some people would contest the figures that have been put forward.  I believe the Minister previously has used a figure of 10.7% as being the effective rate but Members of the other House have contested some of the figures there.  The introduction to some of the papers set out a broad spectrum of different effective rates, depending on how someone chooses to calculate it.  However, it would be important to have a report on the effective rates of corporation tax, which would go a long way towards that issue of transparency.  It is a highly topical issue that has been raised within recent months in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#U00700","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Briefly, I have certain reservations on the recommendation tabled on the effective rates.  There are many valid reasons the rate might be lower than the standard rate.  This probably will be my only opportunity to make this point but in respect of the &euro;2.47 billion in additional tax revenues up to the end of October, I note that more than 80% of it was made up of corporation tax receipts.  While this is certainly welcome, I read further in details published in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>last Sunday that ten of Ireland's largest foreign direct investment, FDI, companies are responsible for approximately 80% of the corporation tax revenue.<\/p><p>I need not tell the Minister of State that previously, there was an over-reliance on one-off taxes.  While these are not one-off taxes, the Department of Finance must pay close attention to over-reliance on certain multinational companies that are located in Ireland.  These companies are transient and if someone else offers them something better, they will consider it and will move.  I believe what is being done disproportionately, in this year in particular by way of the budget, the Finance Bill and the way in which money is being spent pre-election, is the use of a sizeable chunk of corporation tax receipts, which depend mainly on ten large companies.<\/p><p>We must be extremely careful in this regard and that is why there must be careful consideration of reporting, not necessarily on the effective rates of corporation tax, but the quarterly reports will come from Revenue and the Department.  I will conclude on this point but I simply ask the Department to give careful consideration to the top ten corporation taxpayers in this country, to how secure they are within this country and, therefore, how secure is that tax revenue into the future.  When the State is dependent on such a small number of companies for such a disproportionately large amount of its corporation tax receipts, it is at risk to the possibility of any of them moving, which then would change everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120900002#U00800","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1449657000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>As the Minister noted on the last day, section 35 replaces the existing capital gains relief applying to disposals of qualifying business assets by individual entrepreneurs and business people with a simplified relief that will apply from 1 January 2016 and the new rate is 20% rather than 33%.
