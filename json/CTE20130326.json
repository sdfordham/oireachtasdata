Ms Cahill will speak later about what it is like to be an independent retailer in today's environment.  I will begin by explaining a little about Musgrave and the unique relationship we have with independent retailers around the country.  Musgrave is a family business, founded in 1876 in Cork, where we still have our headquarters.  The company was founded by two brothers, Thomas and Stuart Musgrave, and the family ethos prevails throughout the company.  We see ourselves as a family business supporting other family businesses around the country working in the local community, such as that owned by Ms Cahill.  Between ourselves and our retail partners in Super Valu and Centra, we employ approximately 30,000 people.  That means we are the largest employer in the State after the Government.<\/p><p>  These employers are in local communities in urban and rural areas.  Often, our retail partners are not only the largest employer, but they may sometimes be the only employer in an area.  This is a responsibility that they and we take very seriously.  An independent retailer owns his or her store and it is his or her name over the door.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel Clancy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364310900,"counter":10,"content":"<p>There may be a vote in the Seanad and, therefore, the committee has agreed that Senators can put questions first.

She referred to the foundation of the Musgrave Group in Cork.  I discovered some years ago that Thomas and Stuart Musgrave came from my home town of Drumshanbo, Country Leitrim, before migrating to Cork to set up Musgrave Brothers.  I was not aware of the significance of that until I took my first job with Lairds, which produced Bo-Peep jams and marmalades.  The Musgrave Group was one of its main customers and, as a result, the entire population of Munster grew up on these jams and marmalades.  I have a particular interest in the ongoing development of Musgrave Group and I compliment her and her company on the manner in which it has risen to the challenge of multinational operators who dominate the market.  The company has held its market share and will increase it.  It is probably only right and proper that a Centra outlet operates successfully in my home town as a continuation of the Musgrave connection.<\/p><p>  As I come from a Border county, I am interested in the company's view of the narrowing of the gap in food prices between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  Over the past two years, despite campaigns by Centra, which is prominent in seeking support for local businesses and local jobs, the fear has increased that because the  price gap is narrowing between both, it is becoming more attractive for southern customers to travel north.  Is the Musgrave Group aware of this?  Does it keep a vigilant eye on price changes in Northern Ireland?  I appreciate currency differences must be taken into account as well as economies of scale, which sometimes are not appreciated here because Northern Ireland is part of the larger UK market in terms of how it is supplied.  The VAT rate in the North also increased, which also helped considerably.  The long queues of cars travelling north are long gone and I hope that will continue but I am anxious to establish whether the group is aware of a creeping narrowing of the price gap and that could quickly change.<\/p><p>  Will Ms Clancy address the perception that a cartel operates among all suppliers in Ireland?  Despite the detailed presentation she has given about how the Musgrave Group prices and how competitive it is, we all know the retail grocery market is probably the most competitive market in Ireland and Musgrave Group is always looking over its shoulder.  Whenever consumer commentators in the national media receive consumer opinion, there is a perception that special offers and promotions mask the underlying price structures and because all the major retailers are watching each other, they do not stray far from each other on price, yet Aldi and Lidl are eating into their market share because they do not seem to operate under those rules.  It is a perception and I do not suggest it is the reality but it needs to be clarified.<\/p><p>  With regard to the company's support for local produce, it stocks jams, marmalades and other specialised foods from small suppliers at local level but there is a problem with these cottage industries in that they produce good food but they do not always market themselves terribly well.  Has the company a policy in place nationally to encourage these cottage industries, which have a proven success rate, to develop their products or is the policy operated on a store by store basis?<\/p><p>  The company agrees with the code of practice in principle but Ms Clancy then stated additional regulation and red tape could make it more difficult and consumers could be impacted on by the additional costs of compliance.  Will she elaborate on that?  How will the code of practice work?<\/p><p>  I refer to labelling.  She stated the group continues to invest heavily and work closely with its suppliers and its traceability systems stand up to rigorous scrutiny.  Did the company stock any of the meat products in which horse DNA was found?  If the company has invested heavily and works closely with its suppliers, how did this happen?  I acknowledge that Ms Clancy said the group's dealings with suppliers are at the secondary stage of the supply chain and that, for example, it does not purchase beef directly from farmers but buys it from Kepak.  Do company representatives go into these factories?  I am trying to establish how this happened.  With such strict regulation in the food industry, given how important it is to our national and international image, I would have expected major purchasers such as the Musgrave Group to be keen to ensure the integrity of traceability is maintained.  Has Ms Clancy an insight into how this happened?  Can we be assured it will not happen again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600005#D00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1364310900,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Musgrave Group representatives for their presentation.  I also come from County Leitrim and we have a number of good SuperValu and Centra shops around the county.  There is a new one in Manorhamilton, for example.  The jobs provided by these shops are important.  Ms Clancy said all the beef, chicken and lamb purchased by the group is Irish.  Who decides the price the company pays?  I come from a farming background and it is important that the farmer gets a fair price for his product.  Does the Musgrave Group or the factory decide the price?  These products are labelled Irish.  Does the group import other products, add something to them and then label them as Irish?<\/p><p>  Horse DNA was found in food products.  The driving down of prices determined that somebody had a go at sourcing products that were not genuine.  We all know burgers cannot be sold for 15 cent each.  That was part of the problem.  I do not suggest the Musgrave Group was involved in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600005#D00400","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1364310900,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Clancy and thank her for her presentation.

It is important that this continues because the group has 700 stories under its different brands.

I have two questions following on from Senator Paschal Mooney's contribution.  Will one or all witnesses please comment on pricing and the incredible pressure due the times we live in?  Invariably the retailers are there for the customer, the consumer, who demands more and better value, high quality and cheaper prices and will go anywhere to get that.  We certainly know the consumer wants good and better value, all of the time, but enormous pressures have been put on the retailers to meet huge volume market demands as cheaply as possible and, conveniently, and just in time.  This leads me to the horsemeat scandal.  I do not think the Musgrave Group has been involved at all.  Yet if we go into a SuperValu or Centra and scanned all the freezer on the shelves, there would be a lasagne or hamburger and one cannot look into the intricacy of every single product.<\/p><p>  An except from <i>The Week <\/i> magazine states that a typical product of the horsemeat scandal was the beef lasagne produced by Findus which turned out to contain 100% horsemeat.  The lasagne was supplied by a French food manufacturer, Comigel, who had subcontracted the order to a factory in Luxembourg which had bought its meat from a middleman who had got it from a Dutch meat trader who was searching the markets for the best price he could find for that format at that time and thought he had found what he needed in Romania.  I could continue reading this all day.  I believe there were 27 people in the chain.  Sometimes here we talk about the primary, the middle man and the retailer but the chain has become very complex.  I believe that China and India are opening up.  That they like chickens' feet, noses, liver and offal will put even more pressure on finding the off-cuts needed to make what I would call convenient and ready meals.  Have the witnesses any views on the incredible complexity the modern world has brought upon us?  There is nobody who can unravel the supply chain.  Are there any plans to shorten it?  If so, we would love to hear them.  Unfortunately it is not simple.  It is not just a steak or a hamburger, it is also all the ready meals.<\/p><p>  On the issue of labelling, having been a member of this committee for the past two years and having been in the marketplace and in the food industry, I am not supposed to wear the Irish jersey - sometimes the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine slaps one on the back of the hand but I do not care - but the labelling drives us all mad and we need to be together on this issue.  We know we are European and we have got to trade on the European market but if we choose to buy Irish we want to be able to do so.  For once and for all, can we sort out whether &quot;smoked Irish salmon&quot; was smoked in Ireland, or caught in Ireland and smoked in Norway?  I think the witnesses know what I mean.  One of the Centra stores asked if the chicken was bought in Brazil or something was done with it here.  If those in the food and retail industry do not understand whether something is 100% Irish, how is the consumer to know?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600006#E00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1364311500,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Perhaps Ms Clancy will respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600006#E00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364311500,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I will deal first with the horsemeat issue because it was common to a number of questions.  As stated in our statement we conducted extensive tests on our own brand meat and all of those tests came back clear in all of our own-brand beef in Ireland and in the UK.  In regard to the code, there is something here in terms of the role of the European Union and the example described is an EU-wide issue.  As such it needs to be dealt with on a cross-Border basis.<\/p><p>  In regard to Musgrave particularly and our own supply, we work closely with our suppliers and check factories.  We walk those factories and check all of the documentation, we order everything and we do our own testing.  In regard to beef, our supply chain and our traceability systems were validated in the past few weeks.  Going forward, our commitment to Irish supply will continue.  For fresh meat we will continue to source 100% Irish beef, lamb, chicken and pork.  We have very strong relationships with those suppliers.  We source 100% of our beef from Kepak which came through unscathed from the recent scandal.  We work with Kepak on an ongoing basis.  This leads to the question of the relationship with primary producers.  It is important to make clear that in regard to fresh product we do not hold the relationship with primary producers, we hold the relationship and negotiate directly with Kepak.  On the question of the price going back to farmers, the reality is that in regard to beef, particularly, 85% to 90% of the beef produced in Ireland is exported.  Therefore, the price that goes back to the farmer is determined at an international level.  Regardless of the number of promotions that we work through with Kepak on steaks or whatever it might be, over a 12 month period, that does not affect the price that a primary beef producer gets.  In recent years, beef producers have had price increases in the range of 35%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel Clancy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364312100,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Have consumers gone too far in their demands and have the retailers gone too far in pleasing them?

There are so many different factors at play, such as the cost of fuel, which is quite different compared to when there was that big outflow of customers to the North in previous years and trends to which Ms Clancy would have alluded earlier.  Consumers are shopping much less, but more often.  It does not lend itself to big trolleys of shopping.  Consumers are strapped for cash in today's environment and they are watching everything they spend.  They are spending very little, and often.  Day to day, they are working through their budgets.  It is something of which we are mindful.  We watch rates on a daily basis but, as of yet, there is no movement back to that trend that existed a number of years ago.<\/p><p>  If it were to be the case that it started up again, value is front and foremost in consumers' minds today.

I will be brief.  I wish to raise two questions on pricing and impact on primary and secondary suppliers.  Following on from what Senator Pat O'Neill asked, in respect of the statement that the company has invested &euro;290 million to deliver price cuts, I would be interested to hear the breakdown in terms of how much has been carried by the Musgrave Group and how much has been carried by suppliers?  In regard to the code of practice, the document states that an unintended consequence of the code of practice could be making sources in the United Kingdom and abroad even more appealing.  How appealing is it now and what impact could the code of practice have on it?  The document also states that clarity needs to be given to how the benefits of a code will be passed on to producers.  Perhaps the witnesses would expand on the clarity needed in respect of the code of practice?  Will they also explain why Irish food prices are 18% higher than the EU average?  What is the Musgrave Group policy on timely payments to suppliers and ensuring they are paid within a reasonable time?  What is the time period for payment within the group?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600008#G00800","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1364312700,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee.  The witness said there should be a voluntary code of practice and she would prefer to go down the European road.  I understand the Musgrave Group is part of a European organisation that deals directly with various countries and complies with the United Kingdom code of practice.  The United Kingdom put a new independent adjudicator in place in January and the Musgrave Group complies with all its regulations.  Why then would the group consider going down a different road as it complies with the United Kingdom code on a different basis from a European code?  There is no reason an organisation should not be able to comply with our own code of practice.  The code in the United Kingdom is very straightforward where there would be an independent arbitrator.  Would the witnesses have any problem in dealing with an independent arbitrator who may come in to investigate any potential breaches of code of practice?  I am not suggesting there are any such breaches but if there were and if fines were imposed, would there be a problem with that as opposed to going down a voluntary road which, as the witness appears to suggest, might be a better road?<\/p><p>  On the issue of actual costings, the Musgrave Group and two other retailers dominate the market, effectively controlling 80% of the retail business in Ireland.  At the same time we in Ireland pay a high cost for groceries, 18% higher than the EU average.  Mr. Allen has suggested that consumers will drive down prices.  Is it really the consumer who drives down prices or is it the fact that three main players dominate the market and to a certain extent, as Senator Susan O'Keeffe mentioned, is it a closed shop between the main competitors in the market?  Ms Clancy mentioned earlier that costs from an agricultural point of view are continually increasing.  She also mentioned that the Musgrave Group deals directly with Kepak from a beef point of view but there are more products involved than beef, there are vegetables.  There are a lot of costs involved in producing those as the costs are increasing time and again.  If costs are increasing and if, as the witnesses say, the consumer is driving down prices on one side, we need to get a balance.  How can we arrive at a balance in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600008#G00900","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1364312700,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives for appearing before the joint committee for what is an important dialogue and debate.  As most of my questions have been asked I will not go over old ground.  In her presentation, Ms Clancy said that any code to be introduced should protect both supplier and retailer in a fair and balanced manner.  Does she believe the relationship at present is fair and balanced?  The Musgrave Group is slightly different.  It has a different model and has various arms and perhaps many people in the middle.  Does that lead to a point where the group has a greater margin expectation because of having more people in the middle who have to get a cut?  Much has been said about competition in the grocery sector. I know the witnesses will touch on that area in reply to questions from my colleagues.<\/p><p> The IFA farm income review in 2012 showed an increase in product price but that increase was outstripped by an increase in input costs.  I accept Ms Clancy's point that the group buys beef directly from Kepak and does not deal with the producer.  In some instances the group deals directly with the producer initially.  Does it have cognisance of the input costs on the producer and a bottom line in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600008#G01000","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1364312700,"counter":43,"content":"<p>With my colleagues I welcome the representatives of the Musgrave Group as it employs many people and is one of the few Irish firms that has reached the level it is at and will open a new store in Clare in the near future.  I note that the witness said that the Musgrave Group sells only 100% fresh Irish meat.  I apologise if I am duplicating a previous question, in which case I hope the Chairman will correct me.  From that I assume that porkmeat is 100% fresh meat.   When one says 100% fresh meat, I presume bacon, ham, rashers and sausages are excluded, which would be an important portion of meat sold in the group's shops.  What percentage of pigmeat sold in its shops is Irish, taking into account that bacon, ham, sausages and so on are staples of the Irish diet?  Do the witnesses agree that the label \"produced in Ireland\" is misleading?  I am not saying that is unique to the Musgrave Group, far from it, but is it misleading generally?  People may pick up a packet of rashers which states that it is produced in Ireland.  The paper it is written on may have been produced in Ireland, it may have been wrapped in Ireland or cut in Ireland but the pigmeat could be from Denmark or anywhere else.  If so, is this an issue that should be addressed?  The same happens with milk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600008#G01100","speaker":"977","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364313300,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I wish to apologise for being late but I was in the D&aacute;il for Question Time.<\/p><p>  This committee is trying to ensure that primary producers are in a sustainable position.  We are also trying to ascertain the pressures on primary producers concerning conditions and price.  I accept what the witnesses say in their document, which is that in large measure they do not deal with primary producers but with processors and big factories.  Ultimately, however, the squeeze put on the processor is also put on the primary producer.  We are not examining this issue to be confrontational but to deal with what we have been told is a major issue with long-term implications for primary producers.  We want to see what the driving factors are, including those for the consumer.  The difficulty is always to get the right balance - there is no black or white, right or wrong.<\/p><p>   One shop may be slightly cheaper than another, so all the emphasis is on price.  In another shop the emphasis may be on price and quality, but the prices may not be marginal.  A third shop may put more emphasis on quality and sourcing Irish products.  Do we have evidence from consumer research that the vast majority of customers go for price, which is paramount?  Or are there other issues, such as local suppliers and keeping local jobs, that might provide a counterbalance?  In other words, how much do we know about consumer tolerance and behaviour on all these issues?  <\/p><p>  I think it would be fair to say that if one empirically asked members of the public if they support Irish products, they would say \"Yes\".  There is no question or doubt about it.  Where one product is cheaper than another, however, does the \"support Irish\" principle go out the window in practice, despite what people might say?  We do not know the answer to that.  Presumably these are issues the witnesses have to deal with daily in making their hard choices.  They must compete in the marketplace with people who might put price ahead of everything else.  I wonder, therefore, how much we actually know about these various stimuli.  <\/p><p>  Perhaps the witnesses can explain to us why it is that own-brand milk, coming from the same dairy processor, is always cheaper than branded milk.  My understanding is that SuperValu, Tesco or Dunnes Stores own-brand milk is always cheaper than Dairy X's brand.  What is the explanation for this, given that the document states that all the milk and meat comes from one supplier?  It is not as if the company is playing suppliers off against each other without customers knowing it.  I am interested in the dynamics of that and how it works.<\/p><p>  I wish to give full credit to Super Valu.  A number of years ago I was working with small food producers and one of the difficulties they had with some multiples was getting on the shelf.  It is fair to say that in a Super Valu supermarket one is more likely to find small suppliers, including local producers of potatoes and other vegetables.  Given that retailers are independently franchised out, what leeway do retailers have with local purchases?  Is there some agreement whereby they can purchase up to a certain amount locally?  If they are buying locally, are there central constraints concerning quality and the provenance of goods?  It would be good for us to get some feel for how this system is operated.<\/p><p>  Major products such as meat and milk come from national suppliers, but there are also niche food products, in addition to potatoes and other vegetables, that could be supplied locally.  Does this operate by local discretion and, if so, are there ceilings to the amount of local discretion?  Are standards set down by which these apply?<\/p><p>  This brings me to the question of ugly fruit and vegetables, either washed or unwashed.  My understanding from suppliers is that most supermarkets buying centrally will demand strict size standards.  I am not talking about quality in the sense of being in good condition, but they will not take a carrot with two legs.  They want products washed and pre-packed.  How much freedom do local purchasers have to set their own standards?  In other words, is there a market for people who feel that there is more nutrition in a product that comes unwashed from a field?  Who decides the standards for the size and shape of vegetables?  My understanding is that if one is buying local produce it would be very wasteful to throw out all the good, nutritious food, such as unwashed fruit or vegetables, that may not conform to some standards of size and shape that are preordained by somebody else.<\/p><p>  Apart from price, another issue concerns the details of contracts which can put much pressure on suppliers.  Once one enters a three or five-year contract is that it, effectively, or is there any flexibility?  Depending on what conclusions we come to after all these hearings, it is fair to say that we will be looking at the possibility of education, regulation and legislation.  Education would be to explain to consumers the importance of having quality and nutritious foods, in addition to maintaining Irish industry.<\/p><p>  Regulation and legislation are obvious.  We must ensure that there is a balance in the relationship between retailers-wholesalers, processors and suppliers.  We do not want to tilt it totally in favour of one, but if one side of the equation is much stronger than the other, there must be a balance.<\/p><p>  I was interested in what witnesses had to say about the code of practice.  If it is not perfect at the moment, then the balance could be better.  This problem is not only being grappled with in Ireland, but is also recognised internationally as a problem in Europe.  Even in America, they recognise this as a problem, so it is not something that members of this committee have made up.  The debate is taking place and the more we all engage in it, the better and more balanced the answers will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600009#H00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364313900,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I will deal with some of the issues Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised because they are linked to some of the other questions that were asked.<\/p><p>  First, I will deal with the code.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the United Kingdom.  We have two brands in Great Britain, Budgens and Londis.  The code does not apply to us in the United Kingdom and we do not have any experience of it there.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v articulated, I return to the point that an EU-wide solution must be found because these problems are not stopping at national borders.  We must take a joined-up approach to solving the problem, which is why we are in favour of a voluntary code.  If one goes down the road of a national statutory code here in Ireland, the reality is that we are an island off the coast of Europe which has international products and retailers and the question will become how widely applicable an Irish code will be.  I believe we need a European solution to this issue in which one creates that fairness and balance between retailers and suppliers.<\/p><p>  We may have to tweak such a solution to work in Ireland because we have a unique market here.  Retailers such as Ms Breda Cahill are competing head to head and toe to toe every day with international retailers.  I will hand over to her in order that she may speak about that.  She shares a wall with one of those international retailers.

As I mentioned earlier, the Musgrave Group has a policy to source 100% National Dairy Council milk.  We do not source from one supplier and, in fact, we are the only operator that has a local strategy in this regard.  We have regional suppliers, namely, Glanbia, North Cork Co-op, Wexford Creameries, Donegal Co-op, Clona Dairies, Connacht Gold, Dawn and Arrabawn.  That is important because 25% of the milk market here comes from Northern Ireland.  There is a good reason for that, which is that it is cheaper.  We have turned our back on that, however, and will continue to source 100% NDC approved milk.<\/p><p>  The Deputy talked about own-brand and branded milk, but the dynamics of the market have completely changed in terms of milk purchasing these days.  The vast majority of milk bought now is two-litre own brand.  We are paying the same for branded or own-brand milk, so I wanted to clarify that point.<\/p><p>  The question of contracts was also raised.  We have a structured process for negotiating with suppliers and we agree terms.  After that we do not change terms unilaterally or retrospectively.  However, as Mr. Allen said, there is an ongoing relationship with the supplier.  Market changes evolve and consumer tastes change.  As we go through the year we would have ongoing conversations and engagements with suppliers.  If we have to change a promotion we will go back to discuss and negotiate it with the supplier.  We do not do it unilaterally.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel Clancy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364314500,"counter":53,"content":"<p>That works both ways.

The point was made that the witnesses have no problem with written contracts, as they form an integral part of the business, and that they favour the codes of practice in principle but would prefer if they were voluntary.  There is some acceptance of the need to have a Europe-wide code in place.  What is the view of witnesses on the introduction of a mandatory, overarching code of practice at European level that could be applied according to the interpretation of individual member states?  It could include a provision whereby the terms and conditions of contracts with individual suppliers would be held and published.  I refer to promotions in particular, not so much for bigger suppliers but for smaller, secondary processors and primary producers of, for example, fruit and vegetables.<\/p><p>  I accept Mr. Allen&rsquo;s point about climate factors coming into play in terms of the availability of products that could make a contract difficult to pin down.  Would the witnesses consider putting provisions in place in an opening year contract to allow for variations to provide clarity for all concerned at the end of the year?  We have heard much in the committee about stability and certainty in the context of the development of Food Harvest 2020 and the development of sustainable businesses.  One of the points we hear regularly from suppliers is that there is much uncertainty.  Deputy Pringle referred to people wondering when they will be paid and if the terms of the supply contracts will vary, and who carries the impact of a reduced price during a market promotion.  They are the salient points.<\/p><p>  What we believe consumers want more than anything is to know that the food they buy is what is specified on the label, and if it is said to be from a local supplier, that is the case.  Reference was made to the issues by the witnesses.  One can go to any town in this country and see Fairtrade tea and coffee.  We would like to be able to reassure people that the food produced by the primary producer and processed by an Irish processor has a Fairtrade label attached to it covering all of the people involved in the food chain.  It is a European problem but it is a problem in this country as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600012#L00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364315100,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I wish to clarify the point raised by Deputy Pringle on the &euro;290 million.  That consists of a number of different categories of product.  International branded products often invest in the promotion of their products and that is included in the sum of &euro;290 million.  When it comes to fresh food produced in this country, such as beef, potato and sprouts at Christmas time, for example, we agree a seasonal price with our supplier who goes back to the primary producer to agree a price and that price is fixed.  If we promote thereafter, for example, beef, irrespective of what happens at the farm gate in terms of whether prices go up or down, we will still promote the product and fund the investment.  The &euro;290 million consists of both scenarios.  Suppliers support investment on the branded side but when it comes to fresh food it is predominantly Musgrave that invests in it.

We will be dealing with the four topics we have been asked to address: the proposed code of conduct in the grocery goods sector; pricing and impact on primary and secondary suppliers; support for local produce; and labelling.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Dermot Breen, director of corporate affairs, and Ms Anne Cleary, our Government affairs manager.<\/p><p>  Tesco runs 142 stores across 25 counties in the Republic of Ireland.  We have been a major investor in the Irish economy, investing &euro;1.5 billion since 2000.  Our value to the Irish economy is calculated to be in excess of &euro;2.7 billion per annum.  We buy more than &euro;2 billion of Irish goods and services annually and employ more than 15,000 directly, 7,000 of them in new jobs since 2000.  We know a further 29,000 additional jobs exist to support our business in suppliers, manufacturers and supporting partners, including 11,000 farm families supplying fresh produce to Tesco on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  There has been a lot of discussion on the need for regulation in the grocery sector and we are aware some people have been calling for a statutory code.  On the face of it, this might appear to make sense.  We believe there is good and bad in any code, with advantages and disadvantages.  Like the Competition Authority, we believe the case for a code has not been made.  We believe, however, that the EU code that is on the way provides a reasonable alternative in that it avoids some of the red tape and the administration costs that are likely to accompany the proposed national code.  The EU code is based on a number of principles.  We respectfully suggest the code could provide a framework to proceed on.  Essentially, however, this is a matter for Government to decide.<\/p><p>  There has been a lot of talk about pricing in our sector.  There is a view that the larger multiples are forcing prices down and not passing them on.  Against a background where the grocery market in Ireland is highly competitive, the Competition Authority has studied the retail sector in detail and has concluded there are normal healthy tensions between retailers and suppliers.  Our focus is on the hard pressed consumer but also on supporting a viable and sustainable supply base in Ireland.  We know food prices in Ireland are determined not just by domestic but also by international market forces, including commodity price movement, input costs, seasonality and quality standards.<\/p><p>  I draw the committee's attention to the chart on page 7 of the pack we submitted.  It shows the independent data from the CSO covering 2010, 2011 and 2012.  Under the heading of general consumer prices, there are general price increases across the market in those years as follows: 1.3% in 2010; 2.5% in 2011; and 1.2% in 2012.  Retail food prices in 2010 declined by 0.3%, increased by 0.9% in 2011 and by 1.4% in 2012.  Irish supplier food prices increased in 2010 by 6.4%, in 2011 by 4.6%, and in 2012 by 2.3%.  Agricultural farm gate prices in 2010 increased by 15.6%, in 2011 by 15.9%, and in 2012 by 3%.<\/p><p>  That clearly shows retail food prices have increased far less than supplier prices since 2010, and typically by less than the general consumer price index, with wide variants in 2010 and 2011.  This demonstrates the level of competition within the sector and confirms that the market is functioning and prices agreed at farm gate level are not necessarily passed on to consumers.<\/p> <p> Tesco is very proud of its support for Irish products.  This is a core and fundamental part of the way in which we do business and we provide this support for good reasons.  It makes good business sense, customers demand it and Irish products are second to none.  Tesco is extremely proud of the work we do to enable local suppliers to develop into national and, on many occasions, international suppliers.  As I noted, the value of our purchases of Irish products for local and export sales is running at more than &euro;2 billion per annum.  We have 400 Irish suppliers, ranging from artisan companies to large, medium and small suppliers.  Of these companies, 300 employ fewer than 50 people, while approximately 80 are exporters which support 29,000 supplier jobs and the 11,000 farm families who supply us with fresh food. <\/p><p> Tesco operates with Bord Bia an active Irish supplier development programme in which we recruit suppliers and offer them support on business and product development and market learning and access.  We actively recruit new suppliers on an ongoing basis and run exhibitions around the country for this purpose.  Last year alone, we engaged 71 new Irish suppliers and we intend to add more this year.  I will cite two current examples.  Keogh's crisps from Oldtown in County Dublin is one of our suppliers which came through the Bord Bia programme.  It supplied 600 Tesco stores in the United Kingdom over St. Patrick's weekend with 100,000 bags of crisps, which was a fantastic achievement.  Glenilen from Drimoleague in west Cork also came through our supplier development programme and has developed from being a local supplier in County Cork into a regional supplier in Munster and, more recently, a national supplier.  In two weeks, it will become an international supplier to 60 Tesco stores in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p> Tesco is the largest buyer of Irish produce, spending &euro;177 million annually on beef products, which is equivalent to 14% of total beef exports.  Our dairy exports account for &euro;178 million, or 13.3% of overall dairy exports from Ireland.  These are primarily supplied to Tesco customers outside Ireland, mainly in the UK.  We are committed to maximising Irish sourcing, particularly in fresh food and have a strong and growing story of commitment.  All our fresh milk comes from Irish farms and is approved by the National Dairy Council.  All our fresh pork, beef and lamb is 100% Irish, as are all our eggs.  Tesco poultry also comes from Ireland, 50% from Northern Ireland and 50% from the South.  Tesco brand sausages, rashers and cooked meat, bacon and ham are 100% Irish.  In season, we support the growing of Irish berries, salads, peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes and work on import substitution with our supply base, replacing &euro;100 million of imported tomatoes with tomatoes grown in Ireland.  Tesco brand bread is 93% from the Republic, with the remaining 7% from Northern Ireland.  We are extremely proud of this track record and keen to expand our Irish supplier development programme in future.<\/p><p> As I noted, Tesco is also a significant export player, as the chart shows.  Tesco exports are valued at &euro;705 million annually, which means 9% of total Irish food and drink exports go to Tesco customers outside Ireland.  These are mainly in the areas of meat, where exports are valued at &euro;205 million, dairy, with exports worth &euro;178 million, and drink, with exports of &euro;116 million.  Our Irish supply base is also extremely proud that it produces products that can achieve such export figures.  We aim to continue our strong support for the Irish supplier development programme and continue working with Bord Bia.  We have already kicked off our 2013 programme and arranged meet-the-buyer sessions, marketing events, workshops, technical support on-site and mentoring sessions.  Tesco aims to be a strong contributor to the Government's Harvest 2020 export growth objectives.  We will work hard and continue to build relationships across the Irish supply industry. <\/p><p> The need for accurate and comprehensive food information labelling is a fundamental prerequisite for consumer trust.  The recent horsemeat contamination scandal has shocked customers and retailers.  Customers have told us they want better information about what is in their food and where it comes from.  Our commitment is to ensure that which is on the label should be in the product, nothing more or less.  We accept that failures have occurred throughout the food chain and this requires committed engagement of everyone in the food supply chain, not least the retailers.  Our investigation into what occurred has been methodical and thorough.  We are committed to taking every step needed to ensure this does not happen again.  The report of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the horsemeat scandal clearly identifies failures in the supply chain and the European Union is investigating this matter on a wider basis.  There is clearly a need for reform and Tesco will play its part in correcting this problem and setting new standards.  We have promised our customers that we will ensure they have the confidence in the food we sell in terms of quality, provenance, nutrition and value. <\/p><p> Tesco has already put in place better surveillance and tighter controls, including DNA testing.  We intend to shorten and simplify the supply chain.  We will continue to ensure we source local meats from Irish farmers and producers.  We will build on existing good relationships with Irish farmers and growers, working more directly with them and ensuring longer-term, reliable supply agreements.  Labelling will be more important in future and we hope the new labelling regulations being developed by the European Commission will fully address consumer concerns while also being commercially practical.  In the meantime, we will include a hybrid of the GDA and traffic light coding information on Tesco products to provide nutritional information and enable informed consumer choice.  <\/p><p> Tesco is committed to further developing the growth of our business in Ireland through continuing to deliver value and quality in everything we offer.  While we are conscious of our scale and the contribution we make to the economy, we are also very aware that this comes with responsibilities.  As one of the largest employers in the country, we provide good opportunities for people to succeed and a great place to work.  As the largest supplier of food to Irish people, we are dedicated to supplying the widest range of good quality food at affordable prices.  As the largest exporter of Irish food, we are dedicated to sourcing more and more products in Irish companies and helping them to export and expand to international markets.  I assure members that Tesco is committed to its long-term future in Ireland for the benefit of consumers, suppliers, primary producers and all of our stakeholders. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600013#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Keohane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364316000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of Tesco for coming before the joint committee and providing a very interesting exposition of the company's policy.  It is very difficult in unequal relationships for everybody to get an equal result.  One of the issues of concern is that we have powerful and dominant players in the market relative to the suppliers.  The failure to secure a contract would spell disaster for some suppliers, including some significant companies.  What checks and balances are in the system to ensure there is a fair relationship between the supplier and purchaser under current rules?<\/p><p>  Consumer law is all about consumers, which is fine because we all want consumers to get good prices.  However, we do not wish to do so at the risk of putting suppliers, including farmers who are the original supplier, out of business.  Will Mr. Keohane outline how Tesco approaches purchasing?  Does it decide what price it will pay for a product and then ask suppliers to provide the product at this price or is an open tendering system used?  If the latter is the case and the tenders do not offer the product at the price Tesco wants, does it refuse the tenders and seek a lower price?  These mechanics determine how the relationship between purchasers and suppliers operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600014#N00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364316600,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank the Tesco representatives for their presentation.  My first question relates to the code of conduct.  As was mentioned in the presentation, the EU code of conduct is due to be introduced towards the end of this year.  What would Tesco's view be if the Irish Government decided to put that code of conduct on a statutory footing?  In their presentation, the witnesses quoted the Competition Authority's belief that a code of conduct is not necessary for the retail sector.  However, the authority has said that it does not have the resources to carry out any investigations or to examine any industries here.  The last report produced on the retail sector dates from 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600015#O00200","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364317200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  The IFA farm-income review for 2012 indicated that while there was an increase in product price, this was outstripped by a greater increase in input cost, with fuel costs having increased by 30%, feed costs by 70% and fertiliser costs by 25% in recent years.  What is Tesco's view of the increase in input costs as outlined by the IFA?  How does that impact on the company's dealings directly with suppliers?  As the Musgrave Group indicated earlier, I am sure Tesco deals with processors in the middle, but where it deals directly with smaller suppliers what cognisance does it take of that?<\/p><p>  On the labelling and the horsemeat issue, the Tesco presentation stated that it accepted that there were failures throughout the food supply chain which requires the committed engagement of all of those involved in the food supply chain.  Does Tesco have a bottom line on extracting better terms from suppliers and primary producers after economies of scale have been exhausted?  I am mindful about the burgers found at Silvercrest that were retailing for 20 cent each.  Obviously Tesco was buying them for considerably less - perhaps 8 cent or 9 cent per burger.  How can the company stand over a product for which it is paying so little and still expect it to be a beefburger product?  What is its bottom line?  Processors can only be pushed so far.  Without letting processors off the hook for mistakes they have made, we need to be mindful of the pressure they are under.<\/p><p>  Tesco presented independent figures from the CSO under the slide on competition and pricing in the Irish grocery market.  It is easy to produce agriculture farm-gate prices for 2010 given that we were coming from an extremely low base because 2009 was a dreadful year.  Milk prices had been 37% lower in the previous year as a result.  It is very easy to compare with a low base and make figures appear somewhat different.<\/p><p>  Some years ago Tesco restructured its offices in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, putting emphasis on its remaining staff spending more of their time in its UK headquarters.  I know it claims that 71 new Irish suppliers were added in 2012 and that it intends to add further suppliers in 2013.  How many of the team based full time in D&uacute;n Laoghaire have jobs focused on targeting new Irish suppliers?<\/p><p>  Does Tesco transport its goods around the country under its own brand or is there an individual contractor to do that?  If it is one individual company, is it an Irish company?  Does that company employ Irish drivers or does it contribute in any way to the Irish economy by buying fuel, getting vehicles serviced and buying tyres, etc., here?<\/p><p>  Tesco referred to CSO figures so I will refer to a report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation in February 2011, entitled Matters Concerning the Retail Trade in Ireland.  It stated: \"Large retailers are using their disproportionate share of market power to impose unfair conditions on suppliers.\"  It referred to hello money and unwarranted payments, which represented a misuse of their market power in an unethical fashion.  I ask the witnesses to comment.  Does Tesco demand very large cash payments from suppliers to supplement its significant profits?<\/p><p>  What is Tesco's view on the new UK groceries code adjudicator?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600016#P00200","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1364317200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I welcome the deputation from Tesco.  I seek more detail on Tesco's relationship with its suppliers.  If I want to supply vegetables to Tesco tomorrow, how do I go about it?  Do I need to pay money upfront?  Do I need to get onto a list and if so will that cost me substantially?  The presentation mentioned Food Harvest 2020, which is a very ambitious plan to improve our production over a number of years.  If, as has been suggested in the past rightly or wrongly, suppliers have made substantial payments to get their products on Tesco's shelves, would that not have a detrimental effect on what money might be available to primary producers to develop their own systems in order to try to achieve the Food Harvest 2020 targets?<\/p><p>  Deputy Pringle asked about the payment procedures to Tesco's suppliers.  During the Superquinn crisis a number of years ago, some suppliers had not been paid for 120 days or more.  There has been speculation that there may have been disputes involving some of Tesco's suppliers over a small portion of an invoice involving perhaps &euro;100 leading to a delay in payment of a &euro;100,000 invoice.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the matter.<\/p><p>  Groceries in Ireland cost on average 18% more than in our European competitors.  Why is that the case?  Does Tesco have any policies to try to reduce the price of groceries while at the same time maintaining quality, which is obviously crucial?  Education should play an important part in that.  Obviously Tesco is under no obligation to declare its own finances and so forth.  On 3 November 2010 <i>The Irish Times <\/i>reported that Tesco made more profit in Ireland than in any other part of the globe, bar South Korea.  That is a big statement and we are a small country.  It would suggest that Ireland is being continually squeezed to Tesco's benefit.  Even though there is no obligation to do so, from a transparency point of view would it not be appropriate for it to declare the profits it makes in this country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600016#P00300","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1364317200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I wish to apologise for missing the earlier part of the meeting but I was speaking in the Chamber.

That suggests there is some type of statutory basis or footing for this EU code when it is implemented.  If that is the case, it will apply across Europe.

I will deal with a number of them and my colleague, Dermot Breen, will deal with some as well.  On the question of relationships with suppliers, we are absolutely clear that our relationships with our suppliers are long-term relationships.  Most of our growers and producers have been with us for ten or 15 years.  It is a big deal to get a contract with Tesco and it is a big deal to lose such a contract.  We are with them and they are with us for the long term.  We believe there are checks and balances within our process for dealing with them.  We have very good long-term contracts and long-term relations with them.  We have regular meetings with them and we take issues on board as they occur.<\/p><p>  The point with regard to the farm gate prices and so forth was primarily to demonstrate that the market is working.  When and where there are issues and where there are supply pressures, albeit some of those supply pressures might come from outside the State or for other reasons, the market and the supply base is able to bring those points to the retailer and cost prices are adjusted.  The suggestion, which I think is absolutely bizarre, that the Irish supply base is unable to speak its mind and make its case is quite frankly not true, from where we stand.  The Irish supply base is very capable.  They are good suppliers with good product and they are well able to make and present their case when they need to.  That is demonstrated by that chart.  In addition, we do not make any products.  We need suppliers and a supply base.  We need a growing Irish supply base and we are in the business of securing long-term relationships with our suppliers.  We are not into short-term gimmicks of any type.  I am not aware of any suppliers who are afraid to meet us.  As I said previously, there are a number of avenues available to our suppliers if they wish to make contact with us either directly or indirectly.  We have a confidential line that suppliers are aware of if they need to make a confidential comment to us.<\/p><p>  We also survey our suppliers every year.  We call it Viewpoint, a viewpoint on suppliers.  The vast majority, over 80%, of those suppliers respond confidentially and positively.  We do this because we know it is in our and everybody's long-term interest that our relationships with suppliers are on a firm footing, where issues can be brought forward and resolved and adjustments made.  With regard to our contracts, we are going through a check at present to ensure all our suppliers who want to have contracts have them.  We will be offering all our suppliers those contracts.  The contracts allow for joint business planning, where promotions and business growth are agreed.  We work jointly on those.  We have beefed up, which might be the wrong words, our team in D&uacute;n Laoghaire to cope with the increase in the Irish supply base.  We are currently putting in some extra resources in D&uacute;n Laoghaire to meet the requirements both of the increasing number of suppliers who want to deal with us and also to cope with the current challenges in the marketplace.  We know we must keep in regular contact with suppliers and our aim is to do that.<\/p><p>  On the question of local suppliers, there was a time when we needed somebody to supply all our stores nationally.  If they could not supply them all, we could not manage it.  We can now manage one supplier, one product, one shop.  We can manage one supplier, three products, five shops or any variation.  Our systems will cope with that.  Our normal supply route is through our distribution centres.  We have one for fresh products in Ballymun and one for non-fresh ambient temperature products in Donabate.  Most of our goods flow through those supply bases, with daily deliveries to all our shops.  However, we are also capable of taking, and we do take in, local suppliers on a very local basis when there is need and when we agree to do that.  Whether it is Cork, Galway or Tipperary, we take in local suppliers through the old-fashioned back door system.  Our aim in most cases would be that those suppliers would grow to be bigger suppliers in that area or region and then come into the depot.  We do that for efficiency and temperature and quality control reasons to make the whole thing work both for us and the supplier in the interests of our customers.<\/p><p>  The difference between our system and what the committee might have heard from earlier presentations is that we do not use the word \"central\".  Everything is approved centrally but it can be done locally.  There is not a tolerance for the local management to make a call; that still must be approved at the centre.  However, the mechanics of getting the goods in can be done at local level.<\/p><p>  I will ask my colleague, Dermot Breen, to respond to some of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013032600017#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Keohane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364317800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I will address the issue of the code of practice, which was raised by a number of the members.

Not everybody has agreed to it and not everybody believes it is necessary, including the Competition Authority.  It will involve an enormous amount of red tape and additional cost.  The main cost will be in legal fees.  The legal profession will do very well out of it, if it goes on a statutory basis.  That is an issue of concern.<\/p><p>  The Competition Authority has carried out a detailed analysis of the sector and a review of the proposed code.  It has concluded it is not necessary as there is plenty of scope within existing legislation to deal with any of the issues, that setting up an apparatus that will be very costly and involve a new quango is perhaps unnecessary and unwarranted and that it is adding cost which will inevitably ultimately affect the pocket of the consumer.

When I was in school, there was an idea that one cannot create nor destroy energy.  This is not altogether true because a nuclear reaction can destroy matter and turn it into energy.

The difference between North and South is 15%, yet we are on the same landmass.

The product's price was determined by the company, not its cost of production.  I will take a great deal of convincing to believe otherwise.

While the Competition Act creates a new quango, it merges two;  therefore, there is not one extra quango, there is one less.  I would not like it to go out from here that we are in the business of creating extra quangos when we are actually closing them.<\/p><p>  On the basis that the EU code of practice has been agreed and signed up to, I do not know whether it is voluntary, but it appears to be underpinned by some form of legislative structure that has recourse for abuses, and sanctions that can be applied.  We need to understand that and how it is structured before making a recommendation on our own proposed code.  On the one hand it appears to be voluntary while on the other it seems that a number of sanctions apply.<\/p><p>  Today's meeting has been useful.  Were it not for the horsemeat scandal the witnesses would have appeared at an earlier date.

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Dave Flynn, programme support manager for Skillnets, and Dr. Lorc&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in, programme manager for ManagementWorks.  We would be very happy to deal with any question from members about the wide variety of initiatives that Skillnets is involved in.  In my opening remarks I will, as outlined by the Acting Chairman cover the following areas: the effectiveness and relevance of the Skillnets enterprise-led model in the current economic climate for developing the current and future skills needs of enterprise and the workforce; the appropriate use of conversion courses as an effective policy response in filling skills gaps and labour market activation; and the importance and impact of boosting the management capability of our SME owners and managers to sustain and grow their businesses and the role that the new ManagementWorks initiative plays in delivering this.<\/p><p>  Let me start by addressing who we are, what we do and how we address the current and future skills needs.  Skillnets was established in 1999 and is an enterprise-led support body dedicated to the promotion and facilitation of training for enterprise in Ireland.  We aim to increase participation in enterprise training by Irish companies, most particularly SMEs that form more than 95% of all the companies we support, to improve competitiveness or business but also to provide improved access for their employees and since 2010, for jobseekers to skills development and enhanced employability.  We are funded by the Department of Education and Skills from the national training fund.  In 2013, our total funding allocation is &euro;14.5 million.<\/p><p>  We have a community of training networks which comprise groups of companies from the same sector or region who come together, identify their common training needs and seek to deliver on those needs.  We currently have 55 such training networks operating across the country.  At the core of our model it involves companies being directly involved in the identification, design, delivery and evaluation of skills development, either as lead bodies or in partnership with other organisations.<\/p><p>  What do we mean by the enterprise-led approach?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013032600003#B01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Nuzum","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364305500,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nuzum for that insightful report.

ManagementWorks is probably a departure from Skillnets original core mission.  How many have gone through it at this stage and what is Skillnets doing to promote it?<\/p><p>  I note that Skillnets has &euro;500,000 available for the private sector.  Skillnets documentation states that it is targeting regions and industries not fully serviced by the training networks.  I note it refers to the Border and midland regions.  Why is there a reluctance in those two regions to engage in networks?  Has Skillnets attempted to get in there previously?  Has it any specific industries in mind to target?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013032600005#D00300","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364305500,"counter":159,"content":"<p>To take Deputy Calleary's first question about ManagementWorks as to whether it is a departure from our core mission, the answer is \"No\".  It is a complementary expansion of what we have been doing since 1999.  Over the years the vast majority of our networks have engaged in some form of management development support and training but it tended to be of the short, sharp intervention variety and quite subject specific.  For example, in recent years there has been significant demand for programmes on matters such as credit control, seeking finance and greater efficiency in business.  We have always been active in the management development space, particularly with SMEs.  As I stated earlier, over 95% of the companies involved are SMEs.  We would see this as a further expansion, a more deep and meaningful engagement and support for companies.<\/p><p>  It is interesting to note that the attrition rate of those starting the programmes has been virtually nil.  This involves employers having to take a full day each month away from their business.  That is encouraging for us.<\/p><p>  In terms of promotion, we decided to create a separate brand, ManagementWorks, but to leverage the Skillnets brand as well because we would be well known within the SME community already.  We have engaged in a fair amount of traditional promotion of it - press, radio, etc.  Perhaps it has passed Deputy Calleary by.  It is difficult to get one's message across to SMEs because they are being assailed with a constant barrage of the latest tools that will help their business.  There are two areas where we found most traction.  Social media has been successful for us, in particular, Facebook, where one can profile and hone one's message a little more specifically to the audience one wants to reach.  Probably, the most effective promotional tool of any new initiative that we have ever launched is a slow burner, that is, the word-of-mouth promotional piece.  It uses the early movers as champions and advocates to widen it in an almost viral form.  For example, and partly to answer one of Deputy Calleary's questions, none of the programmes have completely finished yet because, starting in September, they are typically between six and eight months long.  It is a proper in-depth engagement.  The earlier groups that started in September are, in the next month or so, nearing completion.  We have 320 participants.  By mid-May, we hope to have reached the 600 mark in terms of participants.  We wanted to try to answer the question in terms of proof of demand as to whether there is a genuine demand.  It involves a cash investment but, probably more importantly, a time and energy investment by the SMEs.  With a very low attrition rate, we are confident that we have got the formula just about right.<\/p><p>  The &euro;500,000 Deputy Calleary mentioned is the funding that has been set aside for the creation of brand new networks.  This has been a feature of our development over the year.  Between one thing and another, we have probably funded over 300 networks since 1999.  Some networks have a natural life.  Many of our current networks comprise old networks coming together to form a new single entity to generate greater economies of scale.<\/p><p>  Border and midlands were identified as areas, not where we did not have a representation but where the number of companies active in those counties was low compared to the number of companies that we had logged as member companies in other parts of the country.  Deputy Calleary might be interested to know that the highest concentration of both Skillnets networks and member companies is in the west.  They seem to get clearly the networking piece.  We have over the years had a number of networks active in those areas.<\/p><p>  One of the barriers in the Border areas, although it has reduced significantly over the years, was that the level of subsidy available for support for matters such as training was very high for all sorts of EU and structural reasons.  Basically, we operate on a 50:50 model which involves a serious commitment in cash terms from companies, but the playing field is now much more level.  We have generated a good deal of interest.  We specifically went to both Cavan and Tullamore with our road show to drum up local interest in it and I think we will have some success in that regard.<\/p><p>  In terms of sectors about which Deputy Calleary asked, these are more sub-sectors than whole sectors.  For example, within the ICT area where we would be active in general hardware and software, we were completely under-represented in gaming and animation.  I am a member of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and the gaming and animation sector is one that is a little fragmented.  They do not tend to join the trade associations or whatever.  They tend to do their own thing.  That was one sector that we have actively gone after.<\/p><p>  Also, there are parts of the green economy that we support, for example, we have a wind skillnet.  One interesting area includes green finance, such as carbon trading, in which there is much activity in and around the IFSC at present.  We are trying to leverage the potential growth of a sector like that in terms of teaming it up with other parts of the green value chain in terms of the funding, for example, of green projects worldwide where Ireland has great potential for being a hub for the management of that kind of activity.  As well as what is going on in the economy, we are talking about a potential global reach there.<\/p><p>  In the food and agri-space, we have some active networks.  When one looks at the size of the sector, there is plenty of room for sub-sectors to be developed.  I hope I answered all of Deputy Calleary's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013032600005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Nuzum"},{"type":"speech","time":1364305500,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nuzum for his contribution.

I ask him to elaborate.<\/p><p>  I note Mr. Nuzum is a member of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.  The committee is conscious of the group's reports here too.

I did not want to talk too much at the start but value is key.  At its most basic level, we must consider the cost of the training.  Whereas the subsidy for companies is not huge it is enough for it to make the investment in training a sensible decision.  I mentioned the 50-50 model earlier but once the network has covered its general costs the typical subsidy that a company is getting is probably between 20% and 30%.  The companies are paying the lion's share.  In our research we found that one of the main reasons that companies engage with the Skillnets network initially is to save some money but once they are in it, the top reason they stay is because of the quality of the training.<\/p><p>  Value is also very important in terms of job seekers.  All training provided by Skillnets network is free to jobseekers.  I mentioned earlier that jobseekers may receive training alongside those in employment.  For a jobseeker to access training in that context on their own bat they would have had to pay to participate in an open course.  We have also developed a very strong and effective relationship with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that jobseekers' participation in the wide variety of courses that we provide free of charge to them does not impact on their benefits.  That has not been an easy result to get.  It has involved a great of deal of collaboration and negotiation with the Department of Social Protection but I must take my hat off to them, having seen the demand by jobseekers for the types of courses we are doing, particularly with the progression outcomes I have outlined, the Department sees the value of them.<\/p><p>  Quality is about the relevance of the training to the person and to the company.  It is important to get the two elements in balance.  What the company wants effectively is training that will make an employee more productive, able to do cross-functional work and to take on new work.  Therefore it improves the company's competitiveness and impacts on its survival.  From the point of view of the employee, he or she is looking at employability and perhaps has one eye on his or her current job but another on the ifs of being out of a job.  It is a serious challenge for a jobseeker to make a choice on a career area.  When one looks at the vast and increasing array of training and education opportunities available to jobseekers, either publicly funded or what they fund themselves, how can they answer the question, \"Is this what I need in order to get a job?\".  If one is participating in training that has been designed by and is in demand by enterprise, it goes a long way to answering that question.  The Skillnets networks have a quality mark as they are designed and endorsed by enterprise.<\/p><p>  Access is another key element.  At its most basic level one will see from the list of our networks that many are based in regions around the country, from the north west to south Kerry to Galway to the south east and so on.  We bring training to where people are.  The individual companies in the SME sector would not have enough people to justify the cost of drafting in a trainer, so the option was to send staff to major centres, such as Dublin, Cork or Galway, however our services makes training accessible.  We have not just one network, but 55 networks with access for all companies within all the networks to training in other networks and access for jobseekers not just in their local area but if they wish to travel to sector specific training, it is there as there are hundreds of different courses available on our websites.  That was a long answer to a short question.<\/p><p>  In response to the question on the expert group, I have been a member of the expert group since 2007.  We find it an excellent direction finder for us in terms of what is going on out there.  We, through our networks have been able to provide input to all of the sectoral reports that the expert group will have commissioned.  That helps us to get our message across.  The quality of the research they produce is of such a high order that we rely on it and it certainly has not let us down.  I fully endorse their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013032600006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Nuzum"},{"type":"speech","time":1364306100,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I am very supportive of the work that is being done in this area.  It is very important, given our current situation.  There is a role for a former agency that deals with developing skills in the employers group and the businesses themselves.  That is very important.  What is missing in Ireland, although some European countries are excellent at it, is fostering the culture of learning and upskilling within companies.  Companies can encourage their employees to upskill and avail of training opportunities within existing companies.  If that was happening on a more sustained basis it would negate the need to troubleshoot.  When a company is in crisis and goes bust, we see the need for upskilling and retraining workers.  We are not very good at looking at where problems might arise and looking at the generic skills that workers need to have to transfer to other employment.  The situation that arose in TalkTalk is a good example.  Training was provided and there was a high level of skill in the area.  When H-Tec was formed, it was on the basis that people in the area had the core skills as well as management and business skills and had the support of Skillnets and Enterprise Ireland.  They were able to give that support because the staff had the skills base.<\/p><p>  I would like to see training and upskilling embedded in enterprise.  That is crucial for the country.  What more can Skillnets do?<\/p><p>  Mr. Nuzum mentioned six key growth areas.  This will differ from region to region.  I come from the south east and I know this region majors in life sciences, pharma, medical devices, engineering, food and tourism.  There is a need for upskilling in the tourism sector.  The counties of Wexford, Waterford and Kilkenny are now being called a tourism triangle.  One of the things that has come up in meetings I have attended is the need for bespoke training courses in customer service and many other areas in regard to tourism and the food sector.  In relation to the regional element, how does Skillnets tailor what it does to meet the strengths and needs of regions?  Skillnets networks has identified growth areas, but obviously this may differ within regions, and other sectors in a region may need to be considered.  Is additional funding being made available for regions that are losing out disproportionately or underperforming?  This is happening in the Border counties.  However, the rate of unemployment in the south east is 25% above the national average.  Skillnets needs to focus more on areas in which they are high levels of unemployment.<\/p><p>  It is always important to measure success.  How is it measured?  Has  Mr Nuzum any information on additional posts that might have been created in companies to which Skillnets has provided training and supports both for the employees and the employers?  Has he figures on the cost of such services?  It would be important to measure the success of what has been done and the costs involved.<\/p><p>  I thank Mr. Nuzum for his very insightful presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013032600006#E00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364306100,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I will try to cover the questions but I will get some value from my colleagues as well.<\/p><p>  Senator Cullinane made some very good points.

Are patterns developing for gaps and particularly in the leadership area?

Is Skillnets considering that?<\/p><p>  I understand that only one gentleman in the south is running the ManagementWorks area.  Hopefully, extra funding can be considered because it is an very large area for one individual to manage, as well as encouraging all the companies to get involved.

We have approximately 350 people on programmes and we have 18 programmes running across ten different locations.  A couple of issues arise.  Sometimes the training needs are fundamental.  We encounter many business owners who, by their own admission, are relatively weak in financial skills and financial planning.  The concept of having cashflow and cashflow plans is a significant area of deficiency.  Small business owners, traditionally, are very good at managing their bank balance.  They are very aware of where they stand on a day-to-day basis but not necessarily of what lies six or eight weeks ahead.<\/p><p>  The one general finding is the sense of confidence that is coming back to people who engage with programmes.  We had a meeting last week with two of our participants who talked about the difference it has made to them psychologically in terms of their confidence about business reflecting on what they are doing.  Peer-to-peer learning is a big issue for us.  The groups are composed of owner-managers or people at a senior management level in an organisation.  The opportunity to engage with people from six or eight multi-sectoral businesses makes a real difference.  People are given an opportunity to articulate what they are doing and then to be questioned by others who are not familiar with the type of business, which can fundamentally challenge the assumption business owners sometimes make about their business.  That has proven to be useful.<\/p><p>  The core programmes we run have an element of mentoring incorporated in them.  We find that owner-managers are sometimes a little nervous about that at the beginning because the idea of being accountable to somebody else can be off-putting.  Without fail, all of the participants have said that engaging with mentors has made an enormous difference to what they do.<\/p><p>  Mr. Nuzum mentioned in his opening remarks that mentoring is part of a learning journey and that it is making a fundamental difference.  Two things seem to happen.  One is that it is the nature of the human condition that when we commit to someone else to do something, we are much more likely to try to do it.  At the end of our sessions the trainers inform participants that they will have a mentoring visit in the next two to three weeks and ask what they expect to have achieved by then.  That requires people to make a statement of intent.  There is a realisation that the first question they will be asked by their mentor &ndash; not in a confrontational way &ndash; is how they got on.  Most people will try to have an answer.<\/p><p>  On a more practical level what also happens is that implementation is never as easy as it seems.  When one is sitting in a workshop and someone talks about an idea one can think it makes sense and decide to do it.  There is a saying that the best war plan does not survive the first encounter with the enemy.  Implementation can be difficult.  It is helpful to have an opportunity to sit down with a mentor and say one tried something but it did not work and to ask what else one could do.  It allows a review of what was done and how well one understood the task.  The transfer of learning from a workshop-type environment to the specifics of a person&rsquo;s business is not as simple as it seems and mentoring makes a big difference.<\/p><p>  We have three regional managers.  Someone is based in Dungarvan who covers the south.  Someone in Galway covers the west and north and someone in Clane covers the north Leinster and Dublin area.  Our experience to date is that the current level of coverage is sufficient in terms of trying to meet the scale of demand we can meet in a pilot programme.  In the past three months, through those three people, we have had some level of engagement with approximately 3,000 businesses.  I am not certain there is much more they can do at that level in terms of physical numbers.  We are monitoring carefully the level of engagement and the response we get.  We also engage with people in information sessions.  At this stage the coverage is probably adequate for the pilot programme.  It is a different issue if the initiative is to be rolled out more substantially and we would have to examine it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013032600008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorc&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1364307300,"counter":172,"content":"<p>When is the pilot programme due to end?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013032600008#G00300","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364307300,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Realistically, in quarter two of this year.

This presentation does not purport to be a solution to all different flooding scenarios that exist around the country, given the variety of scale, complexity and cost that may be involved in addressing problems nationwide.  However, we will endeavour to reflect examples of solutions that may have secured positive outcomes.  The fundamental approach we have adopted in dealing with flooding problems is based on a number of principles.  First, we have taken a strategic view on flooding issues based on specific flood studies leading to the development of major and minor work programmes.  We have been informed by the National Climate Change Strategy 2007&ndash;12 and have endeavoured to secure a co-ordinated response from all the relevant stakeholders.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, is one of the central stakeholders involved in all the schemes.  Some years ago, we also decided to set up a dedicated resource within Kildare County Council to deal with this issue and Mr. Alan Dunney is leading that section.  We have undertaken and continue to undertake extensive consultation with elected members, local communities and other stakeholders.  In light of the limited resources available, we work towards pooling interagency expertise and financial resources.  We prepare an annual work programme linked to the strategic overview and engage with persons experiencing insurance cover difficulties.  While they come to us, I make the point that our role is to reduce and not to eliminate the risk of flooding.  Mr. Dunney will allude to this point in his presentation to members.<\/p><p>  Our approach has been to focus on small schemes where limited resources can secure significant results.  This has been done primarily through Mr. Dunney's work in respect of developing plans and working with the various agencies.  Obviously, we also are involved in the larger catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, studies with the Office of Public Works.  As the Vice Chairman has indicated, the colleagues accompanying me are Mr. Joe Boland, director of services, who has responsibility for the water and environmental services portfolio for the Kildare local authorities and Mr. Alan Dunney, who manages the flood alleviation programme.  We supplied a written presentation for members, which I assume they have to hand.  However, we also have decided it might be appropriate to make a PowerPoint presentation to give the joint committee some examples of the work on the ground and with that, I will hand over to Mr. Dunney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013032600004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364307300,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I thank the county manager and will do my best to get through this presentation in a timely fashion.  I will consider the subject under nine headings as follows: the background; our approach to delivering schemes; the various schemes delivered under the capital programme with the OPW; the schemes delivered under the non-coastal minor works programme with the OPW; the level of expenditure; our future programme; our engagement with the OPW in respect of the CFRAM studies; the planning context; and to tie it up in conclusion, how the county council deals with the issue of property insurance.<\/p><p>  By way of background, there have been six fairly major flood events in County Kildare since 1993.  They took place in June 1993 and November 2000 and on 9 August 2008, 16 August 2008, 27 November 2009 - which was a very big one - and 1 January 2010.  After the flood events of 1993 and 2000, Kildare County Council commissioned a number of reports for areas that generally have been at risk of flooding in the county.  A lot of work was done on this before 2008, particularly along the Morrell River, as well as some bits and pieces in Leixlip.  Thereafter, in August 2008, the county council set up a dedicated flood alleviation section, which I head.<\/p><p>  Since 2008, our approach has been to develop a good working relationship with the OPW and the other agencies that have an impact on the county, such as Waterways Ireland, Irish Rail, Naas Town Council and our own area engineering offices.  As members can imagine, two canals run through County Kildare, as do two rail lines and three motorways.  Consequently, we must deal frequently with the National Roads Authority in addition to Waterways Ireland and Irish Rail.  We undertake much liaison with local community groups, residential groups and so on, as well of course with our area committees and local authorities that is, Kildare County Council, Naas Town Council and Athy Town Council.<\/p><p>  Under our work with the OPW, we undertake two types of scheme, namely, under the capital programme and the minor works programme.  The capital programme is for works in excess of &euro;500,000 and, to date, we have undertaken two fairly big schemes.  The first is the Johnstown flood alleviation scheme and the second is the Leixlip flood alleviation scheme.  Johnstown has a population of approximately 1,000 people.  Funding from the OPW was approximately &euro;2.7 million and flood protection measures have been built on three rivers, namely, the Morrell, Anagall and Hartwell rivers.  The job has been successfully completed.  It is more or less finished, with just bits and pieces of reinstatement measures left outstanding.  The Leixlip flood alleviation scheme was a very big scheme for us, for which &euro;3.5 million came from the OPW.  The town has a population of nearly 15,000 people and the scheme comprises flood protection in an urban area on the Rye Water and Silleachan rivers.  It has been completed successfully and, touch wood, we have not seen any flooding in Leixlip since.<\/p><p>  I will turn to a couple of case studies.  The Johnstown flood alleviation scheme involved the construction of flood walls, flood embankments, the upgrade of bridges and the construction of a bypass channel on the Anagall River, which has brought flood flow around the south of Johnstown village, rather than across through the village, which is what used to happen.  Kildare County Council led the way in respect of planning and land acquisition, while the OPW led the way with funding and actually built the scheme with its direct labour crews.  The scheme has been substantially completed.  I will show members a couple of pre-construction photographs of flooding in the village, as well as an example of a widened bridge located in the centre of Johnstown village.<\/p><p>  Our biggest scheme to date has been in Leixlip, in the north of the county.  It involved the construction of flood walls, flood embankments, upgraded bridges, the upgrade of channels and of an existing outfall through Marshfield House, which is a protected structure in Leixlip just on the banks of the River Liffey.  The OPW constructed highly complicated engineering works using direct labour.  Again, Kildare County Council undertook the Part 8 planning and the land acquisition, while the OPW funded the scheme.  The OPW constructed the scheme with its direct labour crew and the scheme has been substantially complete.  The slide now on display is an example of the work.  The photograph being shown to members on the right is an apartment block that has been built on Mill Lane, Leixlip, with a flood embankment and a flood wall protecting the apartment block.  The photograph on display on the left is an upgrade of the Silleachan stream or river channel and Marshfield House is visible in the distance.<\/p><p>  The second scheme, which the OPW developed approximately three years ago, is the non-coastal minor works flood alleviation scheme, which funds works up to and including &euro;500,000 and the county council has undertaken quite a few schemes under its auspices.  These include, for example, the Sallins flood alleviation scheme, which is associated with the Waterways estate in Sallins, the Butterstream flood alleviation scheme in Clane, Newtown near Kilcock, the Toni River in Celbridge, which was a complicated job in an urban area, the Ardclough flood alleviation scheme and the Confey flood alleviation scheme, which also was in an urban setting in Leixlip.<\/p><p>  If one takes the Sallins flood alleviation scheme as a case study, there was a single flood event in the Waterways estate on 27 November 2009, in which approximately 40 houses were flooded.  The flood protection measures constructed comprise the upgrading of an existing canal feeder to the north of the housing estate, as well as the construction of two 1,200 millimetre diameter culverts beneath the Cork to Dublin railway line at Sallins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013032600004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dunney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364307900,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Michael Malone, Mr. Alan Dunney and Mr. Joe Boland for the presentation.  I always thought Kildare was a very dry county as I passed through it on my way to Dublin from Laois.  In the north of the county, however, there was clearly a serious problem.  I was interested that the work was done using direct labour from the OPW, although contractors are used for heavy equipment and so on.<\/p><p>  A group from Cork appeared before the committee and they outlined that it can be difficult to get from the report stage to the commencement of construction and I was told in reply to a parliamentary question that more than &euro;7 million allocated for flood relief works was not spent last year by the OPW.  Are any schemes awaiting funding?<\/p><p>  Is the attenuation system in place on the N7 adequate?  Waterways nearby seem to have huge deluges of water, particularly the Barrow.  Substantial attenuation was allowed for at construction stage but is it still adequate at every point?<\/p><p>  The Barrow Drainage Board receives funding from Kildare County Council and from Laois County Council.  Good work has been done by that board but the council must be vigilant because this can cause substantial problems for farmers and rural residents along a line to Monasterevin and the area to the east.  That area has seen substantial flooding and will require ongoing maintenance.<\/p><p>  To carry out &euro;1,000 of work to remove a branch that had fallen into a river and a small amount of silt that had built up behind it, one county council had to get bird studies done under the habitats directive.  The bird study that had been done the previous year and which cost &euro;4,000 was not sufficient.  Are there similar delays in the Kildare County Council area because of the habitats directive?  I do not expect the witnesses to savage the National Parks and Wildlife Service but this issue has been raised regularly in meetings of the joint committee by people from various areas that have been flooded. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013032600005#D00200","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364308500,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  As they are aware, the joint committee is doing a report on flooding and insurance.  Of the various elements involved in this issue, prevention is the best.  Bodies such as the Irish Insurance Federation have called for more money to be spent on flood alleviation measures.  I proposed that the joint committee invite some of those who have direct responsibility for doing remediation work to appear before us as this would allow members to learn lessons about where the system works, where logjams are to be found and so on.  That was my motivation for making the proposal.<\/p><p>  The photographs provided must have been taken on a summer's day because the areas shown do not look like that at the moment.  That the apartments in case study 2 were flooded up to first floor level indicates the extent of the damage that flooding has done.  The good news is that despite flooding taking place since some of the works were completed, the locations in question did not flood.  That is the best test of flood remediation works.<\/p><p>  On the issue of geocoding, I have been contacted by people who have been refused insurance despite their properties having never featured on plans for flood alleviation because they have never experienced flooding.  I presume the council will be willing to provide a letter to confirm this is the case.  Perhaps the county managers association could consider the universal application of such a system to confirm that houses have not been flooded.  In many cases, insurance companies will refuse insurance for properties located within 500 m of a water course, even where the area has not flooded in the past.  This is highly unfair.<\/p><p>  I am interested in learning a little about OPW direct labour.  What size is the crew available to the office?  It is useful to have this expertise available for deployment to various locations.<\/p><p>  On the process of providing flood remediation, one of the criticisms we have heard is that it takes a long time to have remedies put in place.  Are there logjams or particular points in the process that could be improved, especially in the interaction between local authorities and the Office of Public Works?  Could the joint committee make recommendations in this regard?  While money will always be short, it may be useful to issue some practical recommendations.  Have the witnesses any advice?  They may revert to us on that matter as it is the type of thing that would be useful to have in our report.<\/p><p>   Deputy Stagg will be familiar with the area of the River Liffey near Straffan known as \"the jungle\".  The stretch of river in question has a large amount of silt and the water course is so narrow as to make flooding inevitable.  The habitats directive has a bearing on this matter.  Perhaps the witnesses will talk us through if and how this problem could be remediated.<\/p><p>  The works that were done in the case study of Johnstown were started upstream.  There is, however, another problem further downstream.  Ideally, one would start works downstream before moving upstream.  It would be easier to provide a justification for works on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis if where they are proposed is close to a large number of houses.  Does the case in Johnstown defeat the purpose a little?  Could the scheme be implemented in a manner that achieves a better outcome, perhaps by taking on board a larger catchment area?  I understand the flooding further downstream had not been bad until work was done upstream, although I may be wrong in that regard.<\/p><p>  On geocoding, it is appropriate to obtain information on which areas may flood as it helps to avoid the mistakes of the past when development took place in areas prone to flooding.  Unfortunately, the insurance companies or the Irish Insurance Federation appear to be using information that should be used to make good decisions in a manner that disadvantages people when they seek insurance.  This was not the purpose for which the information was intended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013032600006#E00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364308500,"counter":199,"content":"<p>As many of the questions asked are technical in nature, I will ask Mr. Dunney to respond to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013032600006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1364308500,"counter":200,"content":"<p>The direct labour crews of the Office of Public Works built the works in Johnstown and Leixlip.  Deputy Stanley asked about the timeframe from the commencement of our engagement with local residents until completion of the schemes.  It probably took four years to complete the process, from the time representations were made to completion of the works.  Having received representations, we carried out a preliminary design and cost-benefit analysis for a scheme, obtained approval from the Office of Public Works to proceed with planning and detailed design and then secured landowner agreements.  It probably took two years to move on to the site and a further 18 to 24 months to carry out the construction programme.  Construction is substantially complete, with the exception of reinstatement which can be done when the weather improves.<\/p><p>   The Deputy pointed out that the Office of Public Works has not spent &euro;7 million of its allocation and asked if any Kildare County Council schemes have been delayed.  We have by and large obtained funding for all schemes that we have proved to be cost-beneficial.  The main issue is to show a scheme is cost-beneficial. <\/p><p>  Under the minor works programme, the cost to benefit ratio is 1:1.5, which means that if the benefit of a scheme is estimated to be &euro;15,000, it must cost less than &euro;10,000 to fix the problem.  Under the capital works programme, the cost-benefit analysis is more complicated and involves discounting the scheme over its lifetime, which is defined as 50 years.  Once this is shown to be positive, the scheme will generally be considered but it will fall into an overall national programme.  In other words, it joins the queue, as it were.<\/p><p>  The issue of hard surfaces on the motorways was raised.  On the attenuation areas on the M7, while I was not involved in the design of the route, I assume the motorways have been designed in accordance with sustainable urban drainage system, SUDS, requirements.  Under SUDS, the post-construction scenario should mimic the pre-construction scenario in terms of drainage.  In other words, the pre-construction run-off should be mimicked by attenuating anything above the pre-construction, if members understand what I mean.  That is the idea behind the attenuation basins.<\/p><p>  Regarding the Barrow Drainage Board and Monasterevin, I am still on the Barrow Drainage Board.  We did some work in this area last year and we must do some more work this year.

There could be a levy and insurance companies could be involved in the payment of some such schemes because there is only a finite sum of money coming from Government in this regard.<\/p><p>  Many of the contracts with the OPW involve fairly large sums of money.

That is a very real issue because the height of the river is affected at times of high water and the backup into the drainage streams is also adversely affected.  I spoke at one time - I am not sure whether to Mr. Dunney or to another of the engineers - about the possibility of Venturi turning of the drains as they meet the main flow to draw them out, even if the level was higher.  That would be very effective, and certainly would be cost-effective because it would cost very little but would save a lot.<\/p><p>  The actual silting of the river is a serious matter.
