He will be aware that the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted in July 2015.  It was introduced by the previous Government to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'. Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm\u00a0that is regulated by the Central Bank.  Relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, and the\u00a0Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears).\u00a0 It is also important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review in order to ensure that borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections that they previously enjoyed.

together.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Section 9 of the NAMA Act provides that NAMA is independent in the performance of its functions and that, under Section 10 of the Act, its primary objective is to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State from its acquired loan portfolio. \u00a0In this regard, I am advised that NAMA is confident it upheld its mandate in the Project Shift transaction.<\/p>  <p>  The Project Shift sale comprised a portfolio of German property assets held by a Northern Ireland based debtor. \u00a0I am advised that the marketing process for Project Shift began in June 2013 as an asset sale being conducted by the debtor with NAMA's consent. \u00a0This was in advance of NAMA&rsquo;s decision in January 2014 to place the Project Eagle loan portfolio on the market for sale. \u00a0I am advised that updated valuations for the assets comprising the Project Shift portfolio were secured by NAMA as part of the due diligence process. <\/p>  <p>  As I stated in my reply of 3 May 2017, NAMA, on the advice of Savills, the debtor's sales advisor, consented to the debtor entering into exclusive discussions with Cerberus which had submitted the highest bid after an open, transparent and competitive asset sale process. \u00a0However, the Project Shift asset sale did not complete prior to Cerberus being selected as the preferred bidder for the Project Eagle loan portfolio sale. \u00a0Given that Cerberus was the ultimate purchaser for both Project Shift and Project Eagle, it made sense to change the Project Shift asset sale to complete as a loan sale and thereby complete the disposal of all of the debtor&rsquo;s loans to Cerberus. \u00a0I am advised that Cerberus and NAMA agreed to convert Project Shift into a loan sale after the NAMA Board selected Cerberus in April 2014 as its preferred bidder for Project Eagle.<\/p>  <p>  I am further\u00a0advised that the debtor's sale advisor approached some 117 prospective investors and that 12 investors submitted first round offers within the relevant bid deadline. \u00a0I am advised that NAMA, acting on the advice of the debtor's sales advisor, Savills, consented to them inviting eight investors into a second round of bidding. \u00a0The eight investors were provided with access to a detailed electronic data room to carry out further due diligence. \u00a0I am further advised by NAMA that seven of the eight shortlisted investors submitted second round offers by the bid date for this transaction. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has sought information on the number of the 117 prospective investors who had originally approached the debtor to express an interest in the portfolio, if any of these investors were one of the 12 that submitted first round offers or one of the eight invited into the second round of bidding. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The information sought by the Deputy can only be confirmed by the debtor who may have been approached in the context of the Project Shift asset sale. \u00a0Given that NAMA no longer has an active engagement with the debtor, NAMA is not in a position to provide the information requested. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In case there is any misunderstanding or apprehension that contact between potential purchasers and the NAMA debtor was inappropriate in this instance, given that Project Shift was initially marketed as an asset sale, there is no reason why investors should not have approached the debtor, who owned the assets, to indicate their interest in purchasing some or all of the assets. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised that Project Shift was not discussed at meetings of the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee. \u00a0NAMA is not in a position to establish whether the person to whom the Deputy refers advised the debtor in relation to Project Shift.

These include Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Life Assurance Exit Tax, Dividend Withholding Tax, Professional Services Withholding Tax and Back Duty.\u00a0 These payments can be non-linear in nature and the timing of payments can vary from year to year. <\/p>  <p>  Overall income tax receipts to the end of February were &euro;123 million below profile.  The Revenue Commissioners have indicated that lower than expected receipts from Life Assurance Exit Tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) account for over half of this shortfall and that PAYE, the main component of income tax, was broadly in-line with profile and up 7% year-on year, which is consistent with the improving labour market.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the performance of USC was lower-than-expected by just over &euro;50 million according to the Revenue Commissioners.  My Department is currently reviewing its performance, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and the initial indications are that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the overall estimate of the Budget 2017 USC changes of &euro;335 million in 2017 was costed accurately.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, at the time of Budget 2017, the apportionment of the total USC package between PAYE and Schedule D was expected to be &euro;263 million and &euro;72 million respectively, in line with previous norms. \u00a0However, subsequent analysis by Revenue, indicates that the allocation of the USC package between PAYE and Schedule D should have been &euro;311 million and &euro;24 million respectively, due to the dynamics of the USC package.\u00a0\u00a0While, this helps to explain some of the current under-performance of USC against profile, it is important to point out that this reapportionment\u00a0should have no adverse impact on the overall collection of USC receipts as this should equalize later in the year when self-employed returns are made.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the continuous efforts to improve the Department&rsquo;s tax forecasting performance, joint research conducted by the ESRI and Department examined the sensitivity of income tax and USC revenues to changes in income.  As a result of this work published in March, my Department has revised the elasticities used in the forecasting of USC, which will affect these forecasts from 2018 onwards.<\/p>  <p>  However, my Department along with the Revenue Commissioners will continue to examine this issue and consider all relevant developments. \u00a0In this regard, the Deputy should note the USC from PAYE taxpayers came in much closer to profile in March and April, albeit still a little below expectations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since its introduction in 2011, USC has undergone many alterations including rate and threshold changes.\u00a0 As the public finances have improved in recent years, progress has been made in reducing the USC charge, particularly for low to middle income earners.  Budget 2017 has, for the third year in succession, introduced reductions in the income tax burden for all those within the scope of USC.  The three lowest rates of USC were reduced from 2%, 4% and 7% to 0.5%, 2.5% and 5% respectively.  This is important progress in making work pay and supporting individuals returning to and remaining in employment.  As the Deputy will appreciate, considering the magnitude of these recent changes, it has made the USC more difficult to forecast.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that we were in a similar position\u00a0at the\u00a0end of\u00a0the first quarter in\u00a02016\u00a0when income tax was down 3.4% against profile.\u00a0 However, due to a pick-up in receipts throughout the remainder of last year, income tax finished 2016 ahead of target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800057#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Debt Servicing","counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800057#WRA02600"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[18352\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800057#WRA02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to refinance a quarter of the State's national debt between October 2017 and October 2020; and the steps being taken by the NTMA to minimise the risks to the State in this period of great economic uncertainty.","asker":"1361","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>As I have outlined in my previous responses to the Deputy&rsquo;s recent questions on this topic &ndash; PQ 16418\/17 and PQ 18095\/17 &ndash; I am confident that the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) is pursuing the optimal strategy in its management of this debt. <\/p>  <p>  The NTMA has already taken numerous steps to significantly reduce the refinancing requirement in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  It continues to pre-fund ahead of future obligations and to build up significant cash balances.\u00a0 These balances stood at over &euro;15.5 billion at end-April meaning that in effect the October 2017 bond redemption has already been funded.

Furthermore, granting special treatment to certain kinds of public expenditures could create incentives for creative accounting. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s guidance on the implementation of the &lsquo;unusual event clause&rsquo; in the preventative arm of the Stability and Growth pact (SGP) allows for exceptional spending directly linked to unusual events outside of the control of Government, if this spending does not endanger fiscal sustainability in the medium term.  This clause is granted on the basis of individual case-by-case assessments and, to date, has only been granted to six Member States in light of refugee-related costs and three Member States following submissions based upon security-related expenditure.  It should also be noted that any Member State availing of this clause must still meet their SGP obligations when the additional spending on the unusual event provided for in the clause is excluded. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, any application for leniency under this clause would require that Ireland demonstrate that the British exit from the EU has had a &ldquo;major impact on the financial position of the general government&rdquo;.

This approach is considered to be more robust than simply asking firms to estimate the amount of R&amp;D they conduct due to the tax credit.\u00a0 The evidence from the evaluation indicates that the R&amp;D Tax Credit is responsible for 60% more R&amp;D being conducted that would be the case if there was no R&amp;D tax credit in place.

This plan contains a significant volume of\u00a0responses to the current housing crisis, of which the HTB incentive is just one.\u00a0 The comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.<\/p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Help to Buy scheme should be considered.  Its role is to complement the other measures in the Action Plan.  The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases.  Therefore, the impact of the HTB\u00a0incentive on property prices should not\u00a0be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply.  In this regard I note\u00a0that a\u00a0number of indicators point to a strengthening recovery in the housing market.  The latest Ulster Bank construction PMI indicates a pickup in the rate of construction activity growth of approximately 1 per cent between March and April.  The index suggests that housing activity has continued to expand each month since July 2013. <\/p>  <p>  From a supply perspective, commencement notices in the 12 months to February 2017 (13,169), increased by approximately 27.4 per cent compared to the same period in 2016 while new house guarantee registrations (6,537) increased by approximately 53 per cent.  ESB connections, a proxy for house completions rather than the level of construction activity (15,327), increased by 15.7 per cent in the 12 months to February 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.  However, the growth in both starts and completions continues to emanate from a very low base and it will take some time for the level of new construction to meet the current demographic demand for housing.<\/p>  <p>  In my view, it is the lack of supply that is primarily responsible for driving house prices higher and I would point out that increases in\u00a0house prices\u00a0prevailed long before the introduction of the\u00a0Help to Buy incentive.  I would also point out that the incentive is targeted towards new build homes only, and to first-time buyers only, and it would be simplistic to designate this\u00a0incentive as being the sole or\u00a0the major contributor to\u00a0house price increases.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the incentive is designed to help first-time buyers obtain the deposit required to facilitate the purchase of a home.  Therefore it helps first-time buyers to meet the loan to value requirements of the\u00a0Central Bank's macro-prudential rules.  However, the loan to income requirements\u00a0of those rules must also\u00a0be satisfied and the incentive plays no role in relation to that aspect.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including movements in property prices.  In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that following a competitive tender process I have commissioned Indecon Economic Consultants to undertake an independent impact assessment of the\u00a0incentive.

I am assured by the Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. <\/p><p>This plan is progressing well. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 981 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cork Divisions in the coming years. <\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of new Garda&iacute; assigned to each Cork Division each year following the resumption of Garda recruitment in 2014 and the strength of each of the Divisions concerned in September 2014 and each year up to 31 March 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is as set out in the following tables.<\/p><p><b>Number of new Garda&iacute; assigned to each Cork Division <\/b><table><tr><th>Division<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork North<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork West<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>Strength of each  Cork Division Sept 2014 - March 2017<\/b><table><tr><th>Division<\/th><th>Sept 2014<\/th><th>Sept 2015<\/th><th>Sept 2016<\/th><th>March 2017<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td>673<\/td><td>658<\/td><td>648<\/td><td>646<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork North<\/td><td>301<\/td><td>298<\/td><td>297<\/td><td>304<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork West<\/td><td>275<\/td><td>275<\/td><td>277<\/td><td>281<\/td><\/tr><\/table>*As of 31 March 2017<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800058#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda College","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800058#WRB02800"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[23760\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800058#WRB02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when her attention was drawn to an interim internal audit into financial irregularities at the Garda training college; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[23761\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800058#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she is satisfied that the Garda Commissioner notified her promptly and appropriately in respect of the Commissioner first coming aware of financial irregularities at the Garda training college; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department received a copy of the draft Interim Internal Audit Report regarding the finances at the Garda College at Templemore from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Head of the Internal Audit on 16 September 2016.

I have not yet made any\u00a0decision to proceed with a sale of shares in AIB.  In order to proceed with an IPO I would need to be satisfied that the market is prepared to put a fair and reasonable value on the banks equity, bearing in mind the bank's current performance, its future prospects and the outlook for the Irish economy.  I would\u00a0do\u00a0so on the advice of my officials in my department and our financial advisors. <\/p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, the sale of financial assets, such as bank shares are transactions which do not result in a beneficial impact to the General Government Balance (GGB) under EUROSTAT rules.  This is due to the fact that this type of disposal is classified as a financial transaction whereby it is essentially the exchange of one form of asset (such as shares, equities, loans) for another kind (cash).  Consequently, the sale of any shareholding in AIB would not count as general government revenue.  Therefore, there would not be increased capacity to spend on capital projects as a result of the sale of shares in AIB without affecting the general government balance.<\/p>  <p>  While not improving the deficit, cash proceeds arising from\u00a0any sale of shares would result in a reduced requirement for Exchequer borrowing which ultimately results in lower debt.  A lower debt level is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability of the State but would also lead to reduced interest payments in future years.<\/p>  <p>  As public indebtedness rose partly due to the recapitalisation of the Banks, the appropriate way of treating one-off revenue from divesting the State of its banking assets is to use these proceeds towards debt reduction.  These disposals would also help contain contingent liabilities for the State. <\/p>  <p>  As a\u00a0further comment, though unrelated to banking policy, I have previously acknowledged the need for increased public investment.\u00a0 The current Capital Plan sets a baseline from which this Government intends to increase investment in critical infrastructure, and in areas such as housing\u00a0and health, as the Deputy has identified,\u00a0into the future.  As outlined in the 2017 Estimates, gross voted capital expenditure will increase to &euro;4.5 billion in 2017.  This represents an increase of almost &euro;400 million in comparison to the 2016 outturn.  By 2021 it is envisaged that Gross Voted Capital Expenditure will reach &euro;7.3 billion, an increase of over 100 per cent in comparison to its level in 2014.  Based on my Department&rsquo;s GNP forecasts, Ireland's Exchequer public investment will reach 2.7% of GNP by 2021.  These increases in investment over the coming years will be allocated to identified priorities on the basis of the outcome of the review of the Capital Plan currently underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tracker Mortgages Examination","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[23596\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Central Bank's order to lending banks to return affected customers to an appropriate tracker rate of interest has been undertaken; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that banks are free to come up with their own offers of compensation and that many banks are not offering customers effective redress; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Central Bank of Ireland published a report providing an update on the\u00a0Tracker Examination\u00a0on 23 March. <\/p>  <p>  As the Central Bank has\u00a0set out in the report: <\/p>  <p>  - approximately 9,900 customer accounts had been identified as impacted by lenders, as part of the Examination, as at end February 2017;<\/p>  <p>  - lenders had commenced contacting impacted customers identified as at end February 2017 and had rectified the interest rates applied to such impacted customers&rsquo; accounts, thus stopping further detriment; as at the date of the Report, interest rates had been rectified on more than 90% of the accounts that require such rectification; <\/p>  <p>  - to end February 2017, approximately &euro;78m had been paid in redress and compensation to approximately 2,600 impacted customers identified as part of the Examination.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank invoked its powers under Section 22 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 to set specific timelines for lenders to complete Phase 2 of the Examination, the last of which will be completed no later than end September 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding compensation, the Central Bank does not have the statutory power to set compensation levels or to compel lenders to implement redress and compensation programmes in respect of failures that occurred prior to the introduction of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (the &ldquo;2013 Act&rdquo;).\u00a0 However, as\u00a0part of the Examination framework, where customer detriment is identified, the Central Bank has clearly articulated its expectations of lenders to provide appropriate redress and compensation to impacted customers in line with prescribed Principles for Redress.  The Principles for Redress are designed to ensure that impacted customers receive appropriate redress and compensation in a timely manner. <\/p>  <p>  Key elements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s expectations in respect of redress and compensation for impacted customers include:<\/p>  <p>  - any harm is stopped at the earliest possible time after each group of impacted customers is identified;<\/p>  <p>  - the interest rates applied to impacted customers&rsquo; accounts revert to the appropriate tracker interest rate or impacted customers are given the opportunity to revert to such a rate where relevant;<\/p>  <p>  - redress will be provided to impacted customers to return them to the position they would have been in had lenders&rsquo; failures not occurred;<\/p>  <p>  - reasonable compensation, that reflects the detriment suffered by individual customers, is provided;<\/p>  <p>  - redress and compensation is to be paid to impacted customers up front at the point of offer and compensation cannot be reduced by virtue of a customer lodging an appeal; and<\/p>  <p>  - an additional payment is to be provided to impacted customers at the point of offer to enable them to take independent professional advice regarding the redress and compensation offers made to them; <\/p>  <p>  As the Examination continues to progress,\u00a0the Central Bank\u00a0will continue to challenge the position a lender has taken in relation to particular groups of customers to ensure the fair treatment of tracker mortgage customers. <\/p>  <p>  The framework of the\u00a0Examination\u00a0also provides that lenders should establish an independent appeals process to deal with customers who are dissatisfied with any aspect of the redress and compensation offers that they receive from lenders in respect of these matters.  As the Central Bank Principles for Redress provide that all redress and compensation payments are made to customers on an upfront basis, customers can accept the redress and compensation offered and still make an appeal.  In addition, the impacted customer has the option of bringing a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman\u00a0or initiating court proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[23597\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to provide financial support to companies and SMEs that may be adversely effected by Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":157,"content":"<p>Brexit and its aftermath will lead to challenges for SMEs.  The exact nature of the impact of Brexit on SMEs is not clear or definitive at present, given the uncertainty surrounding the post Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU. \u00a0However, SMEs will require support to diversify their exports to reduce their exposure to the UK, re-price their products and services as well as restructuring their cost bases so they can continue trading with the UK even with sterling at a weaker level.  The Deputy may rest assured that it is a key Government strategy to ensure State supports enable the growth of Irish SMEs by facilitating access to credit and promoting investment in SMEs.\u00a0 Advisory supports in relation to business planning, such as those provided by the Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland, will be particularly vital for assisting SMEs that may be adversely affected by Brexit and will help raise awareness of both private market financial supports and existing State supports that are available.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware there are already significant Government measures to support the financing needs of SMEs and these will be available to assist SMEs deal with the effects of Brexit.  SMEs can access lower cost, flexible finance from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  To the end of December 2016, the SBCI has lent &euro;544 million to 12,593 SMEs.\u00a0 The SBCI&rsquo;s goal is to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms than has been available in recent times on the Irish market.  The SBCI uses an on-lending model; this means it does not lend directly to SMEs.  At present, the SBCI has 3 bank and 5 non-bank on-lenders.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from a variety of business and economic sectors.  More than 80% of loans are for investment purposes and the average loan size is &euro;43,200.  There is a broad regional spread of the SMEs supported, with 84.8% of them based outside Dublin.\u00a0 As well as the SBCI, there is the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is a cross-government initiative.  By answering eight simple questions, SMEs will receive a tailored list of available Government supports to suit their needs.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at www.supportingsmes.ie.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  Further information is available on the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation website.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund - (www.microfinanceireland.ie). <\/p>  <p>  The Credit Review Office (CRO) is another government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The CRO overturns the decision of the bank in\u00a0more than 50% of the appeals it receives.

I presume that the Deputy intends referring to private equity funds.  The Deputy will be aware that international private equity funds invested much needed capital in our economy during a period of high risk and uncertainty.<\/p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted in July 2015.  It was introduced by the previous Government to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'. Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm\u00a0that is regulated by the Central Bank.  The significant point is that\u00a0the regulation is focussed at the point of contact with the customer.  Therefore relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation in July 2016.  It is also important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Central Bank is now the competent authority for the authorisation and supervision of credit servicing firms.  Credit servicing firms must comply with all relevant requirements of financial services legislation, including the various codes and Regulations mentioned already and Fitness and Probity Standards (including minimum competency requirements).<\/p>  <p>  In addition to compliance with Central Bank codes of conduct, credit servicing firms will have to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they have:<\/p>  <p>  - Robust governance and adequate resources to ensure compliance; <\/p>  <p>  - Agreements with loan owners that enable the credit servicing firm to fully comply with its obligations under Irish financial services legislation; and <\/p>  <p>  - Adequate and effective control of loan servicing in the State to enable Central Bank oversight. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 ensures that a regulated credit servicing firm cannot do something, or fail to do something, which would be a prescribed contravention if performed, or not performed, by a retail credit firm.  The legislation also prevents the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit servicing firm to perform such an action.  Therefore the borrower is protected because the owner cannot give an instruction that would breach the rules but also the instruction cannot be implemented by the regulated credit servicer, over whom the Central Bank has oversight as a regulated entity.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, my Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review in order to ensure that borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections\u00a0that they previously enjoyed.  In addition, the Department of Finance expects that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ireland Strategic Investment Fund Investments","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[23599\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of funding which has been made available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund for social and affordable housing provision; if he is satisfied with the current rates of interest being charged to borrowers through the fund; if he will review the operation of the mechanisms through which credit is accessed from the fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>In line with Rebuilding Ireland commitments, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and a number of key Government Departments are examining the feasibility of establishing a funding vehicle, in conjunction with the private sector, which could facilitate investment in social and affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  Key factors which must be addressed to facilitate ISIF involvement in such projects include: the commercial viability of proposals; Eurostat treatment of fund structures which receive a substantial proportion of their revenue from Government sources; and the ability to create off-balance sheet vehicles outside of the existing PPP model.

These hurdles must be overcome before any such proposals can be brought to a successful conclusion.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, ISIF is making a very substantial contribution to new private housing supply which is critical in terms of meeting the pent up demand for housing across all sectors of the market.

Work was carried out in the Department to assess the potential economic and financial sector implications arising, including through the ESRI-Department of Finance research programme study published in November 2015 titled 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland'.  This work was undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework established by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  Following the result of the UK referendum and to prepare for the forthcoming negotiations, work has been intensified across the whole of Government level including in my own Department.  A Brexit Unit within the EU and International Division was established in July 2016 to oversee and coordinate this work and to act as a key liaison point with the Department of the Taoiseach, in particular.  In addition, the Department of Finance staff complement in the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels has been strengthened.\u00a0 The challenges which we face as a result of Brexit is mainstreamed across all divisions of my Department and this is reflected in business planning. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2017, the Department of Finance published the Economic and Fiscal outlook which presented a full macroeconomic projection including updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and the fiscal space, taking account inter alia of the impact of Brexit. In addition, the Department published detailed analysis of sectoral exposure to Brexit across the economy.\u00a0 Utilising the Department of Finance sectoral exposure analysis, Budget 2017 included a number of measures to respond to the challenges of Brexit, to mitigate future risks, and to support any opportunities that might arise.  These include measures to support SMEs, entrepreneurship, agri-food and Irish exporters.<\/p>  <p>  More recently, the Department has worked with the ESRI to deepen the macroeconomic analysis and a report titled 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' was published in November 2016.  In April 2017, updated macroeconomic forecasts were published by my Department, as part of the Stability Programme Update.<\/p>  <p>  We know from our own published research that the potential impact on the Irish economy is significant.\u00a0 It is important to recognise that the full impact of the UK's exit is only expected to materialise over time.  As we cannot control the international environment, we will need to continue to improve our competitiveness, including by focussing on costs we can control, by boosting our productivity and ensuring sustainable public finances. <\/p>  <p>  The best and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In this context, in Budget 2017, I signalled a lower debt target of 45 per cent of GDP for the mid-to-late 2020s.  This will help to provide an additional fiscal 'shock absorber' capacity to the public finances to help withstand any shock including that of the impact of Brexit.  It will also complement the contingency or 'rainy day' fund which will be established following the achievement of a balanced budget in 2018 and will help provide a further counter-cyclical buffer.<\/p>  <p>  Continued prudent management of the public finances is a critical aspect of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to mitigate the economic challenges associated with Brexit, as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Position paper published on 2 May.\u00a0 In that regard, as the Deputy will be aware now that the EU&rsquo;s initial negotiating position is clear, the Government will intensify its focus on the economic implications of Brexit, including on domestic policy measures to reinforce the competitiveness of the Irish economy, to protect it from potential negative impacts of Brexit. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Separately, Brexit will provide opportunities for Ireland to increase its share of financial services based inward investment.  Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D. has responsibility for Financial Services, including the implementation of the IFS2020 Strategy.  The IFS2020 Strategy is a dynamic and evolving strategy.\u00a0 Brexit both underpins\u00a0the IFS2020 Action Plan for 2017 and also features in the individual measures to achieve the strategic priorities of IFS2020.  We will continue to leverage our IFS2020 Strategy to maximise any opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  The work being done by the Department will be an important input to ensuring that Ireland will be in a position to counter any negative economic impact arising from Brexit and to ensure that Ireland's interests are protected in the upcoming negotiations at EU level.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Department will continue to monitor the economic impacts, to carry out relevant analysis and to frame budgetary policy advice in this new context.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC04700"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[23601\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the discussions his Department has had with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs regarding the investigation of the establishment of a local public bank network as committed to in the programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is the lead Department in respect of the Programme for Government commitment to thoroughly investigate the Sparkassen model of local public banks that operate within well-defined regions. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, with the assistance of officials from my Department, undertook a consultation process, engaging with stakeholders.

The consultation will close on 28 June 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding any potential changes that may be made to the regulations, the legislative requirement for credit unions to ensure investments do not involve undue risk to members' savings will remain the overriding factor which must inform all credit union investment decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC05600"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[23604\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800059#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps the Revenue Commissioners have taken to identify possible customs posts on the Border; the locations that have been examined for these posts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>The Government has published \u00a0a comprehensive document on &lsquo;Ireland and the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union&rsquo; on 2 May.<\/p>  <p>  The Governments position in relation to the border with Northern Ireland in the context of Brexit is very clear - continued freedom of movement, absence of a hard border, and minimal impact on business and trade are key objectives. \u00a0Clearly in this regard the closer the trading relationship between the UK and EU is more generally the better.<\/p>  <p>  I would point out that the guidelines for the EU 27 Article 50 negotiation framework, agreed by the Heads of State and Government on 29 April, specifically refer to the need to support and protect the achievements, benefits and commitments of the Peace Process.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard the guidelines recognise the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, outlining the need for flexible and imaginative solutions, including with the aim of avoiding a hard border, while respecting the integrity of the Union legal order.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has welcomed the EU&rsquo;s negotiating guidelines as reflecting Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns and priorities.

In addition, the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (2016 Regulations) provides for services exempt from additional services requirements.  Where a credit union wishes to provide services to its members, other than those services that are provided for under the 1997 Act or the list of services exempt from the additional services requirements set out in the 2016 Regulations, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such additional services in accordance with the provisions in sections 48-52 of the 1997 Act.<\/p>  <p>  Debit card provision (and the necessary underlying payment account service)\u00a0is an additional service and as such requires Central Bank approval.  The Member Personal Current Account Services (MPCAS) which provides for a current account and a range of services\u00a0including payment instruments such as debit cards, has been available to eligible credit unions since October 2016.  A number of credit unions have\u00a0already been approved for this service which\u00a0is granted under additional services provisions (sections 48 to 52) within the Credit Union Act 1997 (as amended). <\/p>  <p>  There has been significant interest in this service from\u00a0eligible credit unions and the Central Bank is currently processing a\u00a0substantial number of additional applications.  The service approval provides for a shared services support, to bridge necessary technical expertise and scale considerations.  It is expected that once MPCAS is fully established and embedded, it is likely to be available to smaller credit unions with necessary risk understanding.  Details of MPCAS and the approval process, along with the application requirements and related guidance are on the Central Bank's website.  The Central Bank has also indicated it is open to applications for alternative debit card proposals and recommends the MPCAS framework as a\u00a0template for such alternative proposals.<\/p>  <p>  Currently credit unions can and some do provide mortgages to members.\u00a0 These type of loans are subject to certain maturity limits contained in the 2016 Regulations.  Those Regulations\u00a0set out the percentage of a credit union's loan book that can be outstanding for periods exceeding both five years and ten years, as well as limits on the maximum outstanding liability to an individual member.  Under the 2016 Regulations credit unions continue to be allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years.  In addition, credit unions can apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits (up to 40% of their loan book over 5 years and up to 15% of their loan book over 10 years).\u00a0 Approval is subject to conditions set by the Central Bank. 12 credit unions\u00a0are currently\u00a0approved to avail of increased longer term lending limits.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank informs me that the December 2016 Prudential Return indicates that for the sector overall, total gross loans over 10 years amount to c. 2.7% of total loans in the credit union sector compared to the limit of 10% (and\u00a0in some cases 15%).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that while it can see longer term lending, including mortgages, as part of a balanced portfolio of total lending, in their analyses, credit unions need to consider the impact of longer term lending on interest margins, return on assets and on balance sheet structure &ndash; the issue of funding longer term lending with short term funding is a challenge for the credit union business model.\u00a0 The Central Bank further informs me that consumer mortgage lending is an activity that has its own unique risk profile, and proposals to become involved in mortgage lending in a significant way must be supported by an evidence based business case.<\/p>  <p>  The Registry of Credit unions is currently developing a paper on key risk considerations for credit unions intending to engage in longer term\u00a0lending\/mortgages, to support their understanding of the nature of risks involved and provide a degree of clarity on minimum expectations. <\/p>  <p>  The Credit Union Advisory Committee's (CUAC) recent report provides a number of recommendations, one of which is to conduct a full review of lending limits.

Changes to these regulations would have to follow the normal EU approach starting with a proposal from the Commission before consideration by Member States and the European Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are matters within the SGP subject to the discretion of the European Commission.  The Commission regularly issues updated guidance on how\u00a0it will implement the SGP.  It is in this context that I sought and secured a major change from the Commission in achieving an annual update of the reference rate used in the expenditure benchmark. \u00a0The former practice had been to fix the reference rates for three years at a time.  This new approach significantly increases the permitted room for expenditure growth, which would not have been possible under the former practice. \u00a0In line with the principle of equal treatment for all Member States, the annual update of reference rates applied to all Member States.<\/p>  <p>  The SGP also includes flexibilities that are designed to promote\u00a0capital investment.  For instance, within the expenditure benchmark, capital formation increases are smoothed over four years with the result that only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the\u00a0fiscal space.  This provision, which means increases in capital spending for housing and other purposes can be front-loaded within the EU rules, has been utilised in Ireland's budgetary plans.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there are other flexibility provisions within the rules designed to encourage capital investment.  These are the investment clause and the structural reform clause.  Specifically, these provisions allow for temporary deviations from\u00a0the required structural\u00a0budgetary adjustment if spending on\u00a0capital investment can be shown to qualify for either the investment clause\u00a0or the structural reform clause.  Both of these provisions are subject to strict conditions; and while\u00a0Ireland has not\u00a0yet been in a position to apply given where we are in the business cycle, the situation is kept under constant\u00a0review by my officials.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is\u00a0very conscious of the need to boost the supply of critical infrastructure.  Investment in public infrastructure is vital for the medium and long-term competiveness of the economy as well as for underpinning social cohesion through the provision of vital services to people in the form of schools, public transport, housing, etc.  The public capital plan provides for &euro;42 billion of capital investment up to 2021 and the Government remains committed to this. \u00a0Further to this\u00a0the Government\u00a0set out\u00a0in the 2016 Summer Economic Statement\u00a0proposals for an additional cumulative &euro;5.1 billion in capital spending over the period 2017 -2021.  From this additional capital, &euro;2.2 billion was allocated to the Government's initiatives aimed at tackling the housing crisis, as detailed in the Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness.  Taking account of further allocations made in Budget 2017, approximately &euro;2.65 billion remains to be allocated over the period 2018 - 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has been exploring the objective to create 'off-balance' mechanisms that bring investment into social housing which is additional to\u00a0the funding being provided directly by the State.

In terms of the &ldquo;Big 4&rdquo; tax heads, corporation tax, income tax and excise duties recorded shortfalls against profile, while VAT was ahead of target.<\/p><p>Corporation tax receipts of &euro;587 million were collected to end-April.  As a result, cumulative revenues were down 27.6% or &euro;223 million against target.\u00a0 It is important to point out that Exchequer receipts from corporation tax can vary throughout the year and just over 10% of the total annual receipts was expected in the first four months.\u00a0 By comparison, over 60% of corporation tax receipts are expected during May, June and November.  Due to the non-linear nature of corporation tax receipts, the potential for company-specific factors and the low proportion of the annual receipts received to date, it would be premature to draw any conclusions about corporate tax at this stage of the year.<\/p><p>Income tax receipts to the end of April were 3.1% or &euro;198 million below profile.\u00a0 It is important to point out that income tax encompasses a broad range of elements, some of which are not directly impacted by employment or wage developments.  These include Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Life Assurance Exit Tax, Dividend Withholding Tax, Professional Services Withholding Tax and Back Duty.\u00a0 These payments, by their nature, can be non-linear and timing can vary from year to year.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the majority of these specific components are having a drag on overall income tax receipts in the first four months of 2017. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, the performance of USC is lower-than-expected, and my Department is currently reviewing its performance, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.\u00a0\u00a0The initial indications are that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the overall estimate of the Budget 2017 package in respect of USC changes was costed accurately at &euro;335 million.<\/p><p>At the time of Budget 2017, the apportionment of the total USC package between PAYE and Schedule D was expected to be &euro;263 million and &euro;72 million respectively, in line with previous norms. \u00a0However, subsequent analysis by Revenue, indicates that the allocation of the USC package between PAYE and Schedule D should have been &euro;311 million and &euro;24 million respectively, due to the dynamics of the USC package.\u00a0\u00a0While, this helps to explain the current under-performance against profile for USC paid by PAYE taxpayers, it is important to point out that this reapportionment\u00a0should have no adverse impact on the overall collection of USC receipts as this should equalize later in the year, when self-employed returns are made.<\/p><p>Furthermore, as part of the continuous efforts to improve the Department&rsquo;s tax forecasting performance, the ESRI and my Department jointly examined the sensitivity of income tax and USC revenues to changes in\u00a0income.  As a result of this work which was published in March 2017, the Department has revised the income tax and USC revenue elasticities used in the forecasting process.  This will affect these forecasts from 2018 onwards.<\/p><p>Significantly, the Revenue Commissioners have also informed me that PAYE, the most\u00a0important\u00a0component of overall income tax, has closed the first third of the year, broadly in-line with profile, and is up 7.9% year-on-year, which is consistent with the improving labour market.<\/p><p>Receipts from Excise duties amounted to &euro;1,740 million in the first four months of the year and were 6.3% or &euro;117 million below profile.  The under-performance is evident across a broad range of excise components, while others such as vehicle registration tax remains in line with profile for the year to date.<\/p><p>In relation to Stamp duties, receipts of &euro;290 million were collected to end-April 2017, which represents a 21.2% or &euro;78 million shortfall against target.\u00a0\u00a0The under-performance in the year-to-date, is primarily due to property and shares transactions.\u00a0 However, it is important to point out that while both components are currently below target, they are up in year-on-year terms.<\/p><p>With regards to other minor taxes, these are generally broadly in line with profile.\u00a0 Finally, my Department along with the Revenue Commissioners will continue to examine these tax-heads and consider all relevant developments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800060#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme Data","counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800060#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[23622\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800060#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications for the help-to-buy scheme; the amount it has cost to date; the value of homes acquired through the scheme below &euro;200,000, &euro;250,000, &euro;300,000, &euro;350,000, &euro;400,000 and &euro;450.000 respectively, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":203,"content":"<p>There were 6,084 applications for the Help to Buy (HTB) incentive\u00a0up to 11 May 2017; in the same period there were 1,677 claims. <\/p><p>The following table sets out the numbers of applications for the incentive.<table><tr><th>Application Stage<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Stage 1: Applications made (approved)<\/td><td>1,041<\/td><td>2,580<\/td><td>3,621<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Stage 1:Applications made (pending)<\/td><td>272<\/td><td>2,191<\/td><td>2,463<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Stage 2:Claims made<\/td><td>894<\/td><td>783<\/td><td>1,667<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The purpose of the application stage of the HTB process\u00a0is to allow\u00a0would-be first-time buyers\u00a0to determine whether, and to what extent, they qualify for the incentive.<\/p><p>In the above table &quot;pending&quot; means that the applicants either have to file an outstanding return or address a compliance issue, the application is to be reviewed by a Revenue caseworker, or the applicant needs to finalise his or her application.

The preliminary estimate for full-year GDP growth in 2016 is 5.2 per cent, based on National Accounts data for the fourth quarter of the year, making Ireland the fastest growing economy in the European Union again\u00a0last year. <\/p>  <p>  Importantly, domestic demand made a strong positive contribution to growth in 2016 with consumption increasing by 3.0 per cent.  This is crucial as domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich.  This is consistent with the strong labour market performance last year with employment increasing by 2.9 per cent (56,000 jobs) in 2016 on an annual basis.  As a result, the unemployment rate fell to 7.9 per cent in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Recent data published indicate that robust growth in the domestic economy has continued in 2017:<\/p>  <p>  - The volume of retail sales increased by 2.9 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2017.  Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up by 5.9 per cent over the same\u00a0period. <\/p>  <p>  - Expansion in the construction\u00a0sector continued in April with the Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Index for the\u00a0sector recording its forty-fourth successive month of expansion. <\/p>  <p>  - The Consumer Sentiment Index\u00a0rose slightly to 102.0 in April 2017, from 101.9 in March.  The index remains well above its long run average. <\/p>  <p>  - The seasonally-adjusted monthly unemployment rate for April was 6.2 per cent, down from 8.4 per\u00a0cent in April 2016.\u00a0 As a result,\u00a0the unemployment rate has fallen by 9 per cent since its peak of over 15\u00a0per cent in early-2012.<\/p>  <p>  Further, the exporting sector appears to be holding up well despite the weakness in sterling with the value of merchandise exports increasing by 10.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2017 year-on-year.  The latest data also show that Ireland continued to record a large current account surplus last year of 4.7 per cent of GDP.<\/p>  <p>  An important factor in strong export performance is competitiveness.  In this regard, significant progress has been made in recent years.\u00a0 The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland, show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe) has improved by over 20 per cent between 2008 and March 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements and\u00a0wage and price moderation.  It is important that this competitiveness is\u00a0preserved and continues to support growth.\u00a0 This is all the more important given the several sources of uncertainty which could negatively impact on the economic outlook.  In particular, the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU has added to concerns about the international outlook while the change in policy direction by the new US administration has also added to concerns about the international economy.  Weaker than expected trading partner growth would negatively impact on Irish growth through reduced exports. <\/p>  <p>  In summary,\u00a0I am confident that significant economic progress\u00a0can be made in the years ahead.  This positive outlook is reflected in the latest forecasts published by my Department in the Stability Programme Update for 2017.  My Department is projecting robust growth this year of 4.3 per cent while medium term growth is expected to average around 3 per cent per annum.  The labour market recovery is also set to continue with robust employment growth projected over the coming years and, on this basis, by the end of this decade there will be more people at work in Ireland than ever before.\u00a0 However, such progress is critically contingent upon implementing appropriate polices and that is what this Government will continue to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800060#WRD06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Regulation","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800061#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[23870\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800061#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the benefits of the review of the motor insurance sector for motorists in terms of reduced premiums;

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the majority of these specific components are having a drag on overall income tax receipts in the first quarter of 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the performance of USC is lower-than-expected, and my Department is currently reviewing its performance, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.\u00a0\u00a0The initial indications are that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the overall estimate of the Budget 2017 package in respect of USC changes was costed accurately at &euro;335 million.<\/p>  <p>  At the time of Budget 2017, the apportionment of the total USC package between PAYE and Schedule D was expected to be &euro;263 million and &euro;72 million respectively, in line with previous norms.\u00a0 However, subsequent analysis by Revenue, indicates that the allocation of the USC package between PAYE and Schedule D should have been &euro;311 million and &euro;24 million respectively, due to the dynamics of the USC package.\u00a0\u00a0While, this helps to explain the current under-performance against profile for USC paid by PAYE taxpayers, it is important to point out that this reapportionment\u00a0should have no adverse impact on the overall collection of USC receipts as this should equalize later in the year, when self-employed returns are made.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, as part of the continuous efforts to improve the Department&rsquo;s tax forecasting performance, the ESRI and my Department jointly examined the sensitivity of income tax and USC revenues to changes in\u00a0income.  As a result of this work which was published in March 2017, the Department has revised the income tax and USC revenue elasticities used in the forecasting process.  This will affect these forecasts from 2018 onwards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Significantly, the Revenue Commissioners have also informed me that PAYE, the most\u00a0important\u00a0component of overall income tax, closed the first quarter of the year, just below profile, down 2%.\u00a0 However, in year-on-year terms receipts were up 6%, which is consistent with the improving labour market.<\/p>  <p>  Receipts from Excise duties amounted to &euro;1,277 million in the first three months of the year and were 6.6% or &euro;91 million below profile.  The under-performance was evident across a broad range of excise components, while others such as the vehicle registration tax remains in line with profile for the year to date.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Stamp duties, receipts of &euro;223 million were collected to end-March 2017, which represents a 15.1% or &euro;40 million shortfall against target.\u00a0\u00a0The under-performance in the first quarter of 2017, is primarily due to property and shares transactions.\u00a0 However, it is important to point out that both components were up in year-on-year terms at March 2017.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  With regards to other minor taxes, these are generally broadly in line with profile.\u00a0 Finally, I can assure the Deputy, that my Department along with the Revenue Commissioners will continue to examine these tax-heads and consider all relevant developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800061#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800061#WRE01200"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[23875\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800061#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if working capital remains available to small and medium sized businesses with particular reference to sole traders or companies wishing to extend their customer base; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, supporting SMEs in terms of access to finance has been a cornerstone policy for Government in our efforts to rebuild the economy and bring back jobs.  Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  In this regard the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future needs of SMEs. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of monitoring the working capital requirements for SMEs, my Department commissions biannual surveys to ascertain the demand for credit by SMEs.\u00a0 This survey series, most recently conducted by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes on behalf of my Department, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs.  SMEs of all sizes trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included.\u00a0 The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources.<\/p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period April to September 2016, which can be found at www.finance.gov.ie.  The results of this survey shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 84% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.  Purchases, replacement or lease of new vehicle\/equipment is now provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 29% stating this is why they requested bank finance.  Working capital\/cash flow requirements were provided as the second highest reason for applying for bank finance with 27% of respondents stating that they required finance for this purpose.\u00a0 When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds\/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 73% of working capital coming from this source (up 6%).\u00a0 The survey also showed continued positive trends in terms of trading performance, profitability and employment.<\/p>  <p>  The SME State Bodies Group, chaired by my Department, provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Action Plan for Jobs over the past number of years has set out a range of commitments to ensure viable SMEs can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A key objective of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is to ensure that SMEs can access low cost flexible loans from a variety of sources.  The SBCI channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has three bank on-lending partners and five non-bank on-lending partners.  The SBCI has a current funding capacity of &euro;1.05 billion which it makes available to its on-lending partners as demand from SMEs arises.  To the end of 2016, a total of &euro;544 million has been lent to over 12,593 SMEs and the SBCI has committed a total of &euro;906 million to its eight on-lending partners.  In 2017, the SBCI will continue to make significant funding available to SMEs across Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people.<\/p>  <p>  The Credit Review Office is another government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The Credit Review Office overturns more than 50% of appeals it receives.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to advance policies to ensure the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800061#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":256,"content":"<p>Question No. 99 answered with Question No. 92.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":257,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800061#WRE01600"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[23877\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800061#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason home borrowers continue to pay more in interest on their home mortgages compared to those in other eurozone countries with less favourable economic achievements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>Although Ireland is in a monetary union with other Euro area Member States, it has to be acknowledged\u00a0that there are many factors, such as differences in\u00a0national legal and housing systems, cultural preferences, language, the proximity of lenders\u00a0to\u00a0borrowers, which will continue to inhibit\u00a0the full integration of the residential mortgage market,\u00a0and of mortgage interest rates, in the Euro area and the wider EU. \u00a0More directly, differences in the\u00a0nature of\u00a0mortgage and other credit markets, credit and market conditions,\u00a0mortgage default\u00a0rates\u00a0and the funding of mortgage credit\u00a0will also impact on the levels of mortgage lending rates between and\u00a0within\u00a0different\u00a0countries.<\/p>  <p>  However, there have been some developments which seek to promote a more harmonised market for\u00a0credit across the EU.

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions and the internal disbursement of funding is then a matter for the individual institution. <\/p>  <p>  IoTs are autonomous bodies and are responsible for the management of the Institute, including the allocation of all of its income (both public and private) and for the day to day operations of the Institute.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The HEA has been closely monitoring the financial position of all of the IoTs and in particular are working closely with those Institutes operating in deficit to ensure appropriate mechanisms are put in place to eliminate the deficit as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  The Financial Review of the Institutes, published last year by the HEA,\u00a0was carried out in order to provide an overview of the financial health of the sector, to consider capacity issues and to examine the challenges for the institutions given their respective plans for the future.\u00a0 The report makes a number of recommendations on how some of the issues which contribute to\u00a0funding problems in the IoT sector\u00a0can be addressed and my Department is working with the HEA in relation to those recommendations.  This includes the establishment of a Working Group in order to consider the recommendations of the report.  The report&rsquo;s recommendations will also feed into the work being currently undertaken by the HEA on developing a sustainable funding model for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  With regard\u00a0to WIT, they are in year one of a three-year plan, agreed with the HEA, to return the institute to a balanced budget.  The plan encompasses a range of activities to address declining student numbers.  These include a reinvigorated targeting of the CAO market, focused retention measures and closer enterprise engagement.  The HEA are monitoring progress of the three year plan to return WIT to a balanced budget, through quarterly reports, regular meetings and communication with the senior management.  In addition, an external financial advisor has been appointed to WIT and he commenced engagement with senior management in February.<\/p>  <p>  In line with normal business practices, I understand that WIT is reviewing its running costs and part of that process involves working through multiple scenarios for optimising resources.  Third-level institutions have autonomy in relation to promotion policies and other human resource policies, subject\u00a0to\u00a0the requirement to\u00a0comply with\u00a0Government policy in respect of employment numbers.\u00a0 Employers in the higher education sector are also required to operate in accordance with the provisions of national industrial relations agreements including the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA).  In the event that a union believes that an employer in the higher education sector is not acting in accordance with the terms of the LRA, that union can seek to have the matter addressed using the dispute resolution procedures provided for in the Agreement, and any individuals who have issues of dispute have a variety of dispute resolution options open to them.<\/p>  <p>  The appointment of a new chair of the governing body at WIT is currently underway in my Department with the co-operation of the Public Appointments Service.  The current chair expressed his wish to resign from the position, however, he is continuing in his role until such time as his replacement has been appointed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800062#WRF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Higher Education Courses Provision","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800062#WRF03700"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[23769\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800062#WRF03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the changes to the integrated pharmacy degree training programme; the details of the requirement for student pharmacists to do a four month placement in fourth year and an eight month placement in fifth year without pay; the reasons for this; when the students were informed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[23770\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800062#WRF03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason fees for the fifth year pharmacy integrated degree course in the three pharmacy schools are being increased in view of the fact students will spend eight months on placement without pay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[23847\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800062#WRF04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the changes to the integrated pharmacy degree training programme requiring student pharmacists to do a four month placement in fourth year and an eight month placement in fifth year without pay; the reason for this; the date students were informed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":323,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[23848\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800062#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason the fifth year pharmacy integrated degree course in the three pharmacy schools is being increased in view of the fact that students will spend eight months on placement without pay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":324,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130, 131, 134 and 135 together.<\/p><p>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) is an independent statutory body and is responsible for defining and ensuring the standards of education and training for pharmacists qualifying in Ireland.

As is generally the case with contributory pension systems, people with greater numbers of contributions tend to qualify for higher rates of payments, depending on their circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  If a person started work at age 18, reaching pension age 48 years later at age 66 and had 1,500 contributions paid or credited (i.e. just under 29 years contributions over a period of 48 years), this would equate to a yearly average of approximately 31 contributions, and attracts a 90% pension.   Had the same person a greater number of contributions in the same period, they might qualify for a higher rate of payment.  Similarly, if they had fewer contributions over the same period, they might qualify for a lower rate of payment.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  While this payment is subject to a household means-test, there are very significant disregards which mean that over 70% of such pensioners qualify at the full rate.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year. This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.<\/p>  <p>  Following completion of the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund later this year, my Department will conduct a consultation of relevant stakeholders.  Thereafter, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval of the new approach.<\/p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800064#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Eligibility","counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800064#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":414,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[23811\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800064#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when self-employed persons can claim invalidity pensions as announced in budget 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1348","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":415,"content":"<p>In line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Government for an improved PRSI scheme for the self-employed, I announced, as part of Budget 2017, the extension of cover for Invalidity Pension to the self-employed on the same basis as employees.

The OPW also publishes on its website, www.opw.ie, the location and details of each project approved. The commencement and progression of any works, for which funding is approved, is a matter for each Local Authority concerned.<\/p><p>The core strategy for addressing the significant flood risks along the River Shannon is the OPW&rsquo;s Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. Of the 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) nationwide, there are 66 in the Shannon River Basin District that have been assessed within the Shannon CFRAM study. \u00a0These are listed in Table 2 attached.<\/p><p>Feasible flood relief structural measures have been identified to provide protection to almost all properties at assessed significant risk from flooding. Following a public consultation process, the Flood Risk Management Plans are now being finalised, taking on board the observations received. These final Plans will include a prioritised list of feasible structural measures, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner. <\/p><p>In January 2016, the Government took decisive action to support the existing plans in place to address flooding on the Shannon and established the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group to enhance ongoing co-operation of all State agencies involved with the River Shannon and to add value to the CFRAM Programme.<\/p><p>The Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group has taken the decision to develop a plan for strategic maintenance works on the River Shannon that will complement the Group&rsquo;s Work Programme and the specific measures that are identified for the areas at risk in the CFRAM Draft Shannon Flood Risk Management Plan. The Group has established a sub-committee to address all of the necessary legal, environmental, technical and other considerations that arise in bringing forward both short term and long term proposals. The Group has now agreed to the delivery of targeted maintenance activities to be carried out in a range of locations this year in accordance with the permitted seasonal windows for such activities.<\/p><p>Since last October, the Group has also been piloting the lowering of the lake levels in Lough Allen to help mitigate potential flood risk during Winter months and has also endorsed the commencement of a specific project, led by the OPW, to identify viable flood risk reduction measures in the Shannon Callows.<\/p><p><b>Table 1<\/b><\/p><p><b>Approved Projects under Minor Flood

and 183 together.<\/p>  <p>  There is no legislative provision for access to third-party adjudication in respect of pension increases for recipients of public service pensions.  Indeed there is no such facility for recipients of the Contributory State Pension.  However, the interests and concerns of public service pensioners in relation to public service pension issues have been regularly articulated in meetings between the Alliance of Retired Public Servants and my Department.  This engagement has also included meetings between the Alliance, myself and my predecessor.  Through that process of engagement with the Alliance, I believe that public service pensioners have had, and continue to be afforded, a meaningful and direct means of articulating their concerns in relation to pensions and related issues.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The period since the Alliance&rsquo;s engagement with my Department commenced in 2013 has been marked by notable legislated pension improvements for many public service pensioners.  Specifically,\u00a0public service pensioners are benefitting significantly from the substantial reversal of the cuts to public service pensions above specified thresholds which were originally\u00a0imposed by way of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) under the FEMPI legislation. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I and my Department are fully committed to maintaining the well-established dialogue with the Alliance of Retired Public Servants.  Through ongoing recourse to that dialogue process, I believe that retired public servants and their representatives can be confident that their pension concerns will receive full and proper consideration as they have done in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":462,"content":"<p>Question No. 182 answered with Question No. 178.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":463,"content":"<p>Question No. 183 answered with Question No. 180.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":464,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":465,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[23610\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the position regarding the community bank consultation that her Department is undertaking.","asker":"1274","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":466,"content":"<p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government<\/i>envisaged that An Post, the Irish League of Credit Unions and other interested stakeholders would be asked to investigate and propose a new model of community banking, such as the Kiwibank model in New Zealand, which could be delivered through the post office network.The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to investigate the German Sparkassen model for the development of local public banks that operate within well-defined regions. <\/p><p>My Department is actively working with the Department of Finance to progress the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government<\/i>commitments.

The Government is committed to implementing Tobacco Free Ireland as outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government. Some of the key achievements since the publication of Tobacco Free Ireland are:<\/p><p>- the increase in price of tobacco products in Budgets 2014, 2015 and 2016;<\/p><p>- the commencement of legislation which protects children from second hand smoke in cars;<\/p><p>- the commencement of legislation to provide for standardised packaging of tobacco products;<\/p><p>- the commencement of legislation to transpose the EU Tobacco Products Directive;<\/p><p>- the commissioning and publication of the economic cost of smoking in Ireland report;<\/p><p>- the publication of the Health Information and Quality Authority&rsquo;s  Health Technology Assessment of smoking cessation interventions;<\/p><p>- the further development by the HSE of the QUIT campaign and the enhancement of supports for smokers who wish to stop smoking;<\/p><p>- the commencement of a process to develop National Clinical Guidelines for smoking cessation between the HSE, the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC)  and other stakeholders;<\/p><p>- the publication of research on tobacco including the potential impacts of standardised packaging;<\/p><p>- the continued enforcement of tobacco control legislation by the HSE;<\/p><p>- the continuation of an annual Healthy Ireland Survey, the Health Behaviour in School Children Study (HBSC) and the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) which gives up-to-date reliable data on the prevalence of smoking throughout the whole population;<\/p><p>- the engagement in the Healthy Ireland Framework to assist with changing social norms around smoking;<\/p><p>- the involvement of the NGO sector in supporting Tobacco Free Irelandactions;<\/p><p>- the approval of Government to proceed with drafting the General Scheme of a Bill to provide for the introduction of a licensing system and other measure for tobacco products and non-medicinal nicotine delivery systems , including electronic cigarettes; and<\/p><p>- the engagement with the World Health Organisation in implementing the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.<\/p><p>These actions together with other past initiatives have resulted in a decrease in the prevalence of smoking in Ireland.<\/p><p>Finally, the HSE has a National Clinical Programme for Asthma (NCPA).

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website . <\/p><p>Since 2013, the HPSC has held an annual &lsquo;Lyme Awareness Week&rsquo; at the beginning of the tick biting season, the purpose of which is to draw attention - particularly in the media - to Lyme disease and the ticks that can spread this disease.  This year Lyme Disease week started last Monday and will continue until 22 May, with a further media and other activities due to take place over the rest of the week. It is normally held at this time of the year to raise awareness before people engage in outdoor activities such as ramblers, campers, mountain bikers, and others who work and walk in forested or grassy, which bring them into contact with ticks.  Advise is given on how to avoid tick bites, and on what to do if you are bitten. Further information is available on the HPSC website - <i>www.hpsc.ie<\/i>- and on twitter<\/p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer and, very importantly, a representative from Tick Talk Ireland, the primary Support Group for Lyme disease in Ireland. <\/p><p>The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involved a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland.  Material has been produced which is aimed both at the general public and General Practitioners.  <\/p><p>There is extensive information for the public and health professionals on the HPSC website. This information for the public includes:<\/p><p>- Lyme Disease Frequently Asked Questions;<\/p><p>- Laboratory testing for Lyme Disease: FAQs for general public;<\/p><p>- Lyme Disease Illustrations; and<\/p><p>- CDC's instructions on how to remove a tick.<\/p><p>There is also significant support and information for health professionals on the HPSC website.  These supports include a fact sheet on tick borne diseases, including Lyme Disease.  This fact sheet gives information on clinical  the disease, transmission routes, prevention measures, diagnosis, and management and treatment.  There is also an erythema migrans (EM) diagnostic tool to aid health professionals in the diagnosis of EM, which is frequently the earliest clinical manifestation of Lyme borreliosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":492,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ05100"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[23644\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the waiting lists for a spinal consultation at Tallaght hospital; the number awaiting triage to go on the waiting list; and the steps he will take to reduce the list.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":494,"content":"<p>In relation to the query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Licensing","counter":495,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ05400"},{"type":"question","counter":496,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[23649\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ05500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons currently holding licences granted by his Department for the cultivation of hemp here in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 1164\/89.","asker":"1362","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":497,"content":"<p>As of 16 May 2017 seven licences have been issued for the cultivation of hemp.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Appeals","counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ05700"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[23658\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800065#WRJ05800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a medical card appeal by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":500,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

However, it is important to clarify that the cost of private health insurance is influenced by a number of factors, for example the number of persons in the market, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and ongoing medical innovations.  Each of these are contributors to the cost of care, the cost of claims and therefore the cost of premiums payable. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to re-state the policy rationale for the introduction of the Health (Amendment) Act 2013.  Although a proportion of activity in public hospitals involves the provision of care to private patients, the core purpose of the system is to provide services for public patients.  Government policy is to ensure that there is equitable access for public patients, that the proportion of private activity is appropriately controlled and that the costs of provision of services to private patients are appropriately recouped by public hospitals.  All patients who opt to be treated privately in a public hospital are subject to charges, as provided for by the Health (Amendment) Act 2013.  This Act addressed a situation identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2008 report whereby when a private inpatient was accommodated in a public or non-designated bed, no private inpatient charge applied.  The additional income generated as a result of the enactment of the 2013 legislation is a key element of the funding to the public hospital system and any curtailment of this funding stream would put further pressure on the Exchequer and the taxpayer in order to maintain service levels.<\/p>  <p>  While my Department has not carried out a specific assessment of the link between these charges and premium increases, it is conducting an analysis of trends in private activity in public hospitals since the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 commenced.

They have followed best international design, planning and procurement processes at each stage of the project.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2014 the Exchequer approved &euro;650m of HSE capital funding following an initial cost estimate of the construction aspects of the new children's hospital project.  This covered the core elements (new children&rsquo;s hospital and 2 Paediatric OPD and Urgent Care Centres) of the hospital construction only. The &euro;650m funding did not include equipment, educational facilities or commercial elements such as retail and car parking.  Alternative funding sources were identified for these elements, estimated to cost &euro;140m.  This brought the NPHDB 2014 cost estimate to &euro;790m.  In 2015, additional shared services for the campus were included in the project bringing the overall cost estimate to &euro;800m.<\/p>  <p>  Following the evaluation by the NPHDB in early 2017 of main construction tenders and the selection of preferred contractors, the final cost of the design, build and equipment programme for which the NPHDB is responsible has increased.  This increase has been led primarily by three factors. First, there has been an increase in projected construction inflation over the project duration of 2014-2021.  At the time of the cost estimate in 2014, construction inflation was running at 3% per annum in 2014 and is now running at over 9% per annum.  Second, the extended programme timeframe has seen longer than anticipated planning, procurement and approvals processes.  Third, market costs of the tenders came in at higher than forecast.  These three factors bring the cost from the estimate of &euro;800m to &euro;983m for all elements of construction cost and equipping.  Of the &euro;983m, some &euro;916m is Exchequer capital and &euro;67m is to be funded through commercial and philanthropy sources.

Along with managing the HSE's own ICT estate and assets they also manage shared applications and services that exist in voluntary hospitals and other providers.  These agencies in turn have responsibility for local ICT security and assets in relation to their own systems.  The Office of the Chief Information Officer also manages the health networks that connect many health care facilities across the country.  Other activities in terms of cyber security are ensuring that the infrastructure, including the data networks, file servers and personal computers are securely maintained with anti virus software and updates.  In addition, other services provided include managing perimeter security devices such as firewalls, monitoring tools, anti-virus and mal-ware detection systems and software. Staff training and awareness is also a critical element in providing a defence against cyber attacks and is provided by the Office of the Chief Information Officer.  In that regard it is difficult to quantify those costs elements that are security related from other management activities.  As other cyber related costs are not routinely available I will instruct the HSE to provide a more comprehensive breakdown of figures in relation to cyber costs to the Deputy. In relation to anti virus software the HSE spend approximately &euro;0.5m per annum.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the last week has brought home to us the importance of digital technology supports in the provision of modern health and social care services and the threats that cyber attacks can bring to undermining those services.  The HSE first became aware on Friday last of a major cyber security threat in the form of a &lsquo;ransomware&rsquo; attack on its infrastructure.  The CIO's Office coordinated and organised a comprehensive response to the cyber attacks in the last week including developing the #ThinkB4Uclick   information campaign across the health services.  Similar attacks were threatening the national Health Services in the UK and many other countries.

Recognising this frustration, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016,  I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the NBP State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the actions identified by the Taskforce will allow the business opportunities and benefits that the growth in the digital economy is bringing to be felt across the entire country.  It will also assist in the creation of a digital infrastructure that can support this growth, and that can provide nationwide coverage with sufficient capacity to ensure that data can flow at the volume, speed and reliability required to meet the demands of modern life.  Implementation of these actions will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.<\/p>  <p>  The first meeting of the Implementation Group took place on 8 March, and was followed by a series of bilateral meetings with action holders.\u00a0 These discussions have formed the basis of the first quarterly progress report, which I, together with Minister Humphreys,\u00a0expect to publish\u00a0shortly.  This report will show that considerable progress has been\u00a0made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The Implementation Group is also tasked with comprehensively reviewing progress made after twelve months, and producing an annual report summarising progress across all actions.  The Group is also mandated to recommend further actions that would result in an improved service for consumers. <\/p>  <p>  The benefits that the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report will bring will be felt across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800069#WRN02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Policy Review","counter":692,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800069#WRN02100"},{"type":"question","counter":693,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[23611\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800069#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding the Moneypoint working group; the number of times that this group has met since its establishment; and the date by which the group will publish its findings.","asker":"1274","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":694,"content":"<p>The Energy White Paper, 'Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030', published in December 2015,\u00a0notes that Moneypoint, Ireland&rsquo;s only coal burning power station, contributes to diversifying Ireland&rsquo;s fuel mix and the provision of competitively priced electricity.  The station is owned by the ESB and the White Paper recognises that key decisions on its future will have to be taken before 2020 as the station will reach the end of its operating life in its current configuration in 2025.   In addition, the White Paper recognises that increasing &lsquo;cost of carbon&rsquo; charges on Green House Gas emissions will drive up the cost of carbon-intensive energy sources and lead firms and consumers to adopt low carbon fuels and energy efficient technologies.  It is anticipated therefore that the phasing out of higher carbon fuels will be achieved by a combination of sustainable policy measures and consumer reaction to the higher price of carbon intensive fuels.<\/p>  <p>  The May 2016 Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to establish a National Dialogue on Climate Change, with one of its tasks to identify the most suitable\u00a0replacement low-carbon generation technology for Moneypoint.  This builds on the commitment in the Energy White Paper to establish a National Energy Forum to maximise and maintain consensus on the broad policy measures set out in the White Paper required to ensure the transition to a low-carbon energy future.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The future of Moneypoint is multifaceted and requires consideration of issues such as security of supply, system stability, competitiveness and sustainability.  The working group set up in my Department is an internal group of officials working together to examine the key considerations in relation to the future of Moneypoint, including the overall fuel mix in the energy sector, analysis undertaken\u00a0to date in relation to Moneypoint, and appropriate further research if considered necessary.

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) monitored the situation on Friday and over the weekend, and engaged with national and international stakeholders, coordinating the national response and informing Government of developments.

It is an offence under section 22 of the Acts not to clean up after your dog.  I believe that there are sufficient penalties in place, when enforced, to deal with the issue of dog fouling under the Litter Pollution Acts, but ultimately it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure that they play their part in preserving the environment for others through the responsible disposal of their litter, including in relation to dog fouling.<\/p>  <p>  Each local authority must determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution locally, including the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions in relation to litter and dog fouling, taking account of its own particular circumstances and priorities.  Authorised local authority officers and Garda&iacute; may issue a notice or on-the-spot fine to an individual believed of committing a prescribed offence under the Acts. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the targeted direct response to deal with litter, my Department operates an Anti-Litter and Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme (ALAGS).  Under this Scheme, local authorities can apply for funding for projects aimed at raising awareness of litter issues, including that of dog fouling.  Local authorities are asked to focus their activities under the scheme on young people and in particular on schools and community groups with an emphasis on encouraging long term behavioural change.  It is open to local authorities to utilise some of this funding to improve the situation specifically in relation to dog fouling.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Compared to 2016, I\u00a0have increased funding for the ALAGS scheme in 2017 by 28% and allocated\u00a0a total of &euro;885,000 to local authorities this year.

Since 2011 the grantees who received funding in 2011 have continued to receive an annual grant equivalent to their 2011 grant.  This Counselling Grants Scheme is for a total of &euro;245,900 annually and currently there are only 64 grantees nationwide benefitting from this scheme.  With over 4,000 schools in Ireland 64 grantees means that less than 2% of schools are in receipt of support from this scheme currently.<\/p>  <p>  The Counselling Grants Scheme which was originally established to provide counselling support for children affected by bereavement or loss was affected by austerity cuts in 2010.  The need for bereavement and loss counselling still exists in schools right around the country however without a significantly increased budget it is unfair and unethical to continue providing support to a small number of areas (64 grantees) while excluding all other schools from the scheme.  Opening up the scheme nationally with a current budget allocation of &euro;245,000 is not an option as this equates to less than &euro;60 per school.  Hence the decision was made to cease the scheme in its current format.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla Educational Welfare Services is very supportive of the provision of appropriate school counselling supports and the option of continuing the scheme with adequate funding to provide the opportunity to all schools and School Completion Programmes nationally.  All School Completion Programmes have been requested to identify unmet needs as part of their annual plan for 2017\/18.  Responses identifying gaps in service, including counselling provision for bereavement and loss, are currently being reviewed by Tusla Educational Welfare Service and a report will be forwarded to my Department when this process is complete. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800071#WRP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education Data","counter":804,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800071#WRP02600"},{"type":"question","counter":805,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[23614\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800071#WRP02700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children that will benefit from the second ECCE year in 2017; the number that have benefitted from it in 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":806,"content":"<p>Entry to the ECCE programme is based on a programme year that runs between September and August, so for the purpose of this PQ we propose to answer your query based on 2016 - 2017 and then 2017- 2018 programme years. <\/p><p>To date, approximately 14,000 children have registered for both 2015 - 2016 and  2016 - 2017 cycles and based on current registrations we would estimate that a similar number of children will register for  both 2016 - 2017 and 2017-2018.

It has been brought to my attention that Department of Education and Skills Circular Letter 0027\/2017 may apply to these individuals. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I am further advised that the costs associated with the implementation of this Circular is considerably less than the 5% increase in allocation that each of these services received this year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800071#WRP05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":830,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800071#WRP05300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Representative Organisations","counter":829,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800071#WRP05200"},{"type":"question","counter":830,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[23767\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800071#WRP05300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if consideration is being given to the requests of an association (details supplied); the proposals there are to enable Defence Forces personnel to have access to the State's industrial relations agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":831,"content":"<p>In relation to the right to trade union status for the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, I wish to advise that under the terms of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990 the Defence Forces Representative Associations are prohibited from being associated with, or affiliated to any trade unions, or any other body.  Accordingly, the Representative Associations cannot be affiliated to ICTU at present.  The basis for the prohibition is that it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to members of the Defence Forces.  The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.  This is a long standing policy position taken by respective Governments since the foundation of the State.  The Defence Forces may be called on to contribute to maintaining vital services in times of industrial action.  The potential for serious difficulties and conflicts could arise in these circumstances if the Defence Forces Representative Associations were associated with, or affiliated to ICTU, given ICTU rules in relation to such matters.  The Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) provides a formal mechanism for the PDF Representative Associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to engage with the Official side.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the Associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service.It is open to the Representative Associations to submit claims to the Official side in relation to matters falling within the C&amp;amp;A scheme.  Generally claims relate to pay and conditions, award of allowances etc.  When submitted, these claims are generally the subject of negotiations and where agreement is not reached it is open to both sides to seek the assistance of an adjudicator to settle the matter.<\/p><p>  In addition, a framework exists which facilitates the Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between ICTU and the official side at National level. <\/p><p>I have received representations from PDFORRA seeking to have access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court made available to them in the event of any future legislative changes being made to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with access to same.  I am advised that the proposals in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being granted such access will require detailed legislative changes and the Department of Justice and Equality have established a Working Group to examine in detail what future legislative changes are required. <\/p><p>I remain satisfied with the present arrangements in place for the Defence Forces.  However, in the light of PDFORRAs representations the matter is being kept under review, including in the context of any future arrangements to be made for An Garda S&iacute;ochana. <\/p><p>In relation to wage restoration it should be noted that rates of remuneration and conditions of employment in the Irish Defence Force have traditionally been set by reference to relative levels of pay across the various parts of the Irish public sector.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2013 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 (the Lansdowne Road Agreement) define current pay policy for Public Servants and members of the Permanent Defence Forces.<\/p><p>I believe that measures contained in the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA), which PDFORRA have recently signed up to, and the provisions introduced in Budget 2016\u00a0and 2017 will be of benefit generally to members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).<\/p><p>The LRA proposes to increase salaries during 2016 and 2017. These benefits come in the form of increases in gross pay in 2016 for those earning up to &euro;31,000 and in 2017 for all those earning up to &euro;65,000.  In addition the Government has introduced legislation which has commenced the process to reduce the pay reduction applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2013.  As you may be aware PDFORRA, the representative association for enlisted personnel of the Permanent Defence Force, have recently accepted the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement and the above pay provisions will now also apply to their members.  Currently my officials are engaged in arranging the payment of these pay increases.<\/p><p>In relation to the Pensions Related Deduction (PRD), which is commonly referred to as the &lsquo;Pension Levy&rsquo;, the exemption threshold for payment of the &lsquo;Pension Levy&rsquo; will increase substantially during the course of the agreement from &euro;15,000 to &euro;28,750 which means that annual income subject to the levy below &euro;28,750 will no longer be liable to the deduction. <\/p><p>With regard to the post 1994 soldier, Military life places unique demands on individuals and it is necessary that its members be physically and mentally prepared to meet the challenges of all military operations and to undertake their duties on deployment overseas.  To this end, it is vital the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised in any way<\/p><p>In regard to the use of Larium in the Defence Forces, it is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for overseas service and medical suitability, i.e. a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis.  The choice of medication for overseas deployment, is a medical decision made by the Medical Officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member.<\/p><p>Significant precautions are taken by the Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications, including identification of any contraindications and assessment of any reported side effects that may occur.  While overseas, all personnel have access to either an Irish military Medical Officer or to the UN provided medical service (depending on the particular mission) to whom they could report any complaints, including potential side effects of any medications. <\/p><p>There are no plans at this time to withdraw Lariam from the range of anti-malarial medications available to the Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800071#WRP05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Expenditure","counter":832,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800071#WRP05500"},{"type":"question","counter":833,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[23780\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800071#WRP05600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the Defence Forces budget and expenditure on information technology in each of the years 2012 to 2016 and to date in 2017, in tabular form.","asker":"1336","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":834,"content":"<p>The Defence Forces budget and expenditure on information technology in each of the years 2012 to 2016 and to date in 2017 is outlined in the table below .  <table><tr><th><\/th><th>Budget <\/th><th>Exp <\/th><th>Budget <\/th><th>Exp <\/th><th>Budget <\/th><th>Exp <\/th><th>Budget <\/th><th>Exp <\/th><th>Budget <\/th><th>Exp <\/th><th>Budget <\/th><th>Exp End April <\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>&euro;&rsquo;000 <\/td><td>&euro;&rsquo;000 <\/td><td>&euro;&rsquo;000 <\/td><td>&euro;&rsquo;000 <\/td><td>&euro;&rsquo;000 <\/td><td>&euro;&rsquo;000 <\/td><td>&euro;&rsquo;000 <\/td><td>&euro;&rsquo;000 <\/td><td>&euro;&rsquo;000 <\/td><td>&euro;&rsquo;000 <\/td><td>&euro;&rsquo;000 <\/td><td>&euro;&rsquo;000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td>6,250 <\/td><td>6,419 <\/td><td>6,330 <\/td><td>7,022 <\/td><td>6,340 <\/td><td>7,623 <\/td><td>7,140 <\/td><td>10,810 <\/td><td>10,130 <\/td><td>11,098 <\/td><td>9,933 <\/td><td>4,534 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800071#WRP05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"question","counter":837,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[23781\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800072#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the Defence Forces budget and expenditure on cybersecurity in each of the years 2012 to 2016, and to date in 2017, in tabular form.","asker":"1336","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":838,"content":"<p>As outlined in the Governments White Paper on Defence 2015, Cyber attacks have very significant implications for governmental administration, for industry, for economic well-being and for the security and safety of citizens.
