I will give some background.  Mr. Ruair&iacute; Cunningham and I are brothers and members of the Cunningham family which has been in the milk business on the island of Ireland for 150 years.<\/p><p>  As members can see from our presentation, we are Ireland's oldest family dairy.  Wherever one is in Ireland, one will find Strathroy fresh milk and dairy products.  We supply milk and dairy products sourced directly from Irish farms.  Our distribution network covers every county in Ireland.  Being deeply involved in the dairy industry, the issue we wish to raise is an urgent one.  If it not addressed, it will be bad for consumers, farmers and employment in Ireland.  In our presentation today, we outline the potential impacts of this issue and some potential solutions we would respectfully suggest to the committee.  <\/p><p>  It may seem a bit obvious for the committee but we feel we need to say that we are an Irish business.  We source Irish milk directly from Irish farms and contribute to strong prices for Irish farmers because we actively compete for their milk.  We provide over 250 jobs throughout the island of Ireland and milk and dairy products of the highest quality to Irish consumers.  The \"Guaranteed Irish\" mark is one of the oldest and most recognisable origin labelling campaigns in Ireland and one of the most trusted symbols for Irish manufactured goods and services.  We carry this symbol.  <\/p><p>  I will move on to the National Dairy Council, NDC, and its mark.  Despite everything I have just said, we do not qualify for the NDC's packaging mark \"Farmed in the Republic of Ireland\" simply because the milk we buy is processed in Omagh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500003#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Cunningham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383665400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>If I could interject, the NDC purports to educate the consumer and reassure them of the origin of the milk.

In a way, the NDC is being disingenuous and is misinforming the consumer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ruair&iacute; Cunningham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383665400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The NDC mark says \"Farmed in the Republic of Ireland\" but it does not say that in order to qualify to carry the mark, the milk must be farmed and processed in the Republic of Ireland.  We source Irish milk directly from Irish farms all over the island.  We have depots and distribution facilities all over Ireland and employ more than 250 people but because we process this Irish milk in Omagh, we cannot use the words \"Farmed in the Republic of Ireland\".  Making any distinction between cows North and South is not only bad for us but bad for the entire dairy industry on the island.<\/p><p>  Having been in the dairy industry for so long, we fully recognise the importance of issues such as quality, origin and traceability.  Consumers want to know that the products they buy have these guarantees and retailers want to know these things as well.  We can guarantee all these things to consumers.  We guarantee the quality, the origin from Irish farmers and the traceability of all of our milk and milk products.  This graphic from our presentation shows the craziness of the entire situation.  One sees the cow on the left and a map of Ireland on the right.  There is no change in what happens to the milk or where it ends up if the cow stands on the upper side.  If the cow stands in the Republic, it can carry the mark as long as the milk is processed in the Republic.  As I said at the outset, I am a dairy farmer.  I bought a group of high EBI heifers from a farmer in the South only six or eight months ago.  They crossed the Border to go to our farm.  Is anyone going to tell me there is something completely different about those cows so that they cannot carry the mark \"Farmed in the Republic of Ireland\", which they could have if they had stayed at home?  If they come to me, they cannot carry it.  It seems ridiculous.  <\/p><p>  We also had a strange situation because of the confusion around this mark at the National Ploughing Championships.  Cows were brought down from a farm in County Derry to demonstrate how a robot milker works.  As a result of the confusion, they could not decide whether the cows were Northern or Southern cows and as a result, the milk was almost thrown out.  We came down and picked up the milk.  We made a donation to Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin from the money we generated from the milk rather than let the milk be wasted but members can see the confusion this mark can cause.  The dairies that were there were worried that if they bought the milk, it might be seen as Northern milk.  Looking at where the cow is from is not the way to run a business.  <\/p><p>  Our processing facilities have been audited by all the key retailers.  They have satisfied themselves beyond any doubt about the rigour and the integrity of our processes we carry out but despite all of those measures, the NDC will not allow us to carry the mark.  This will impact our business.  As previously stated, if it is bad for our business, it is bad for consumers because we actively compete to get into shops and competition keeps prices competitive for the consumer.  It is bad for farmers because we buy milk directly from farmers and are actively competing to get farmers to supply milk to us.  They do not supply the milk to us to get a worse price.  The only reason they supply us is because we pay a better price.  We bring competition to the market base for farmers as well.  If we, farmers and consumers are lose out, it will have an effect on employment.  <\/p><p>  The NDC is not a State agency or a semi-State body.  This mark is not Government policy.  The NDC is an industry-financed organisation.  However, there is no denying the impact this promotional mark is having.  Some retailers, some of whom we are already doing business with, want it but we are precluded from having it simply because of the location of our processing plant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500003#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Cunningham","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383666000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>With regard to the issue of the NDC's promise that all milk is local, one could lift milk in Wexford, process it in a plant in Kilkenny and have it on a shop floor in Donegal with the NDC mark saying it is local whereas when we lift milk from a farm in Donegal, take it to Omagh, 20 miles down the road, process it and take it back to Donegal, it is not regarded as local.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ruair&iacute; Cunningham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383666000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>That is a local issue but if we broaden it, we must consider the impact this mark could have and the image it portrays of Ireland internationally.  With 90% of our farmers being manufacturing farmers, the majority of milk generated on the island is exported into important markets all around the world.  We would have to come against this sort of competition in other markets.  This packaging mark is anti-competitive and contravenes EU legislation.  It uses country of origin labelling in an anti-competitive way and it has implications for vital trade between Ireland and the UK and the wider EU.  It is inconsistent with national policy on food and drink, the wishes of consumers and the island of Ireland approach to animal health.  The mark is anti-competitive because it is in breach of EU legislation, the Single Market and Article 101 of the treaty on the functioning of the EU.  We received independent legal opinion, which states, &quot;The NDC mark has the effect of restricting parallel import and impeding free movement of goods throughout the EU, which will adversely affect the promotion of a single European market ... There is a clear, <i>prima facie<\/i> breach of Article 101&quot;.<\/p><p>  With regard to country of origin labelling, a report by Deloitte and the Dairy Council of Northern Ireland stated, &quot;COOL is intended to clarify the origin of food products for the consumer helping them to make an informed choice on whether to buy a local product over an alternative sourced from another part of the EU or elsewhere&quot;.  Other factors such as price and quality will form part of the consumer's decision but this labelling is not supposed to be used to interfere with the free movement of goods between member states.  The Deloitte report states in this regard: &quot;Denying Northern Ireland dairy products the opportunity to compete for a place on ROI supermarket shelves through the abuse of COOL means that consumers in the Republic are being denied freedom of choice.  This has knock-on effects potentially for vital Irish trade&quot;.  Other markets in the EU are vital for us given so much of the milk produced on the island is exported.  We do not want to do anything that could affect that negatively.<\/p><p>  I refer to a number of quotes in this regard.  Arlene Forster, the Stormont trade Minister, is exercised about this but the comments Ian Potter, an agricultural commodities trader, particularly milk quota, wrote on his blog about his reaction to hearing about the NDC are more telling.  He said:<blockquote>Meanwhile, we sit back and allow Irish cheese to flood into our market at retail, catering and government procurement levels much of it coming via the IDB\/Adams Foods ... if Southern Ireland can exclude our dairy products we should follow their lead instead of continually rolling over and hiding behind competition issues.<\/blockquote>I do not like to see this stuff written about Ireland.  Pat O'Keeffe, news editor of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i> wrote: &quot;In the case of liquid or fresh milk, my view is that the real losers in this battle for market share are dairy farmers, north and south&quot;.  James Campbell, also of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal <\/i>stated:<blockquote> The tonnages of cheese and butter sold into the UK from the RoI far outweigh the value of the entire southern Irish Liquid Milk supply ... The irony is that the money to support the NDC campaign and liquid milk producers is coming from those most in danger if there is a backlash against Irish dairy products in the UK.<\/blockquote>The quotes go on from independent journalists and commentators on the dairy industry.  They recognise the impact this could have if it was replicated somewhere else.<\/p><p>  The red tractor mark is often brought up as the UK has a similar scheme but if one looks at it closely, one will realise that this is a food assurance scheme that covers production standards developed by experts on safety, hygiene, animal welfare, the environment among others.  The logo on a pack means the food or drink has met these responsible production standards and is fully traceable back to the farm but it is not used to deny products from other member states access to shelf space.<\/p><p>  One could take any number of dairy products but I will use Kerrygold butter as an example.  If the Irish Dairy Board was to depend on the NDC mark for trading, this butter could not carry it as the board sources its milk is from the entire island.  It has more than 15% of the German market where it has been trading for 40 years.  It sells the butter at a premium and it is doing a superb job for Irish exports and the brand of Food Ireland.  The board is blazing a trail and the butter is seen as high quality.<\/p><p>  I refer to national policy that was agreed at meetings such as this.  It refers to Ireland, the food island, and an all-Ireland approach with no divide between North and South.  Bord Bia's Food Harvest 2020 strategy, which was produced in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, outlines that our national strategy for agriculture, food and fisheries is about Ireland, the food island, and there is no differentiation between North and South.  Bord Bia is the State body responsible for the commercial success of world class Irish food and drink.  It takes an all-Ireland approach and has national quality assurance marks.  The board addressed all the issues I outlined earlier relating to quality, origin, traceability and Strathroy Dairy would qualify for the Bord Bia quality assurance mark but the only problem is its remit does not cover milk.  The next slide demonstrates how the board has addressed the nuances of what lies before us.  There are three different marks.  The first states &quot;Origin-Ireland&quot;, the next &quot;Origin Northern Ireland&quot; and the final one &quot;Produced &amp;amp; Processed Ireland &amp;amp; Northern Ireland&quot;.  One could argue NDC is bringing nothing new to the party.  There are enough good strong labels in the market that cover the issues that need to be covered to give consumers the reassurance they need.<\/p><p>  This is not consistent with what the consumer wants.  Bord Bia's approach is grounded in its own consumer research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Cunningham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383666600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cunningham.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500005#E00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1383666600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

Mr. Cunningham said that Strathroy products can be found throughout Ireland.  Does Strathroy also supply own-brand products?  Obviously in such circumstances consumers would not see the Strathroy label.  Is that the reason Mr. Cunningham is saying we cannot see the Strathroy label?<\/p><p>  The National Dairy Council is financed by private industry.  It has been in existence since 1964 and was set up long before the sort of co-operation we would expect now and also before the advent of EU legislation on discriminatory practice.  In all the quotes Mr. Cunningham provided, I do not see any from the NDC.  What relationship does Strathroy have with the NDC and what conversations has Mr. Cunningham had with the NDC?  I must conclude that the witnesses are here because they are unable to make any progress with the NDC.  Will Mr. Cunningham to elaborate on what has happened with the NDC?<\/p><p>  The NDC is not a Government or semi-State organisation.  It is entitled to include the word \"national\" in its title because it has been around since 1964.  When it was established it would have been a national dairy council - exactly what it said on the tin.  I am not sure we can level any criticism at it for using the term \"national\" - many organisations do so.  Given what was going on at the time and now, it is not a crime, as far as I know, to use that term.  I have never been confused by its identity as being anything other than a privately financed industry organisation.<\/p><p>  I will cut to the chase.  Strathroy has been in business for a long time and is very successful.  It has a very good product.  As it has been in business for 150 years, that is an extremely sound reputation.  Do the witnesses feel others in the industry here are effectively protecting themselves and making it clear they do not want Strathroy as part of their club, because if it is part of their club, it may take their business, including that of Glanbia and others?  Is that at the heart of this?  Do the witnesses feel those companies are protecting themselves and Strathroy has been cut out, thereby preventing it from expanding its business?<\/p><p>  I do not deny the huge confusion over the various marks.  Mr. Cunningham mentioned Barry's tea.  Everybody knows Barry's tea is packaged in Cork and has been around for a very long time.  Nobody disputes that the tea itself, obviously, did not come from here.  Those labels have been in existence for a long time and they have different meanings.  We have raised the issue here and elsewhere that there is extraordinary confusion for consumers because those marks do not mean what they appear to mean.  Is there another trade group mark that Strathroy can use either in the UK or in Northern Ireland?  What is it about the National Dairy Council mark that is so precious, apart from the obvious reasons Mr. Cunningham has stated about the quality of Ireland's food, Irish milk and so on, which I do not denigrate in any way?  Does Strathroy feel it is being pushed out and that it would like to take a greater share of that business?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500005#E00700","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1383666600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.

I imagine that the three large processors in the South would be able to take up the slack of the small amount of milk that we are providing, but they would not replace any of the 75 lost jobs.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about another processing plant.  The answer is \"Yes and No\".  For years, there have been calls for rationalisation in the dairy industry, in that there are too many plants.  We agree.  Our plant is the best and most efficient on the island, which is the reason that we are the size that we are.  We do it better.  It is not that we have an advantage in price terms, a subject that Cormac will probably cover.  Setting up another liquid milk plant would essentially double costs.  Someone must pay.

We all have opinions on organics, but anyone producing organic milk must be able to certify 100% that it has not been mixed with or contaminated by conventional milk.  The same applies to goat's milk.  If one produces semi-skimmed milk, one must ensure that semi-skimmed goes into the semi-skimmed jar, not whole milk.  The separation of whole milk, semi-skimmed and skimmed is easy.  It costs a great deal of money, but we have done that.  We have been audited to show that organic or Republic of Ireland milk can be traced right through our plant from the start to when it is put on a lorry and delivered.

As Ruair&iacute; stated, the NDC is indirectly taking money out of farmers' pockets.  Farmers provide that money voluntarily in the misguided belief that it is to their advantage.  The majority of farmers are manufacturing farmers.  To date, the money has been spent on the NDC campaign.  It gets money for generic milk advertising, but that is supplied by Europe.  The majority of the &euro;2.4 million has been collected from the 90% of farmers, including liquid milk farmers.  Who will gain?  I would argue that the liquid milk farmers cannot gain.  There are in or around 2,000 registered liquid milk producers in the Republic.  All of that milk has been paid the full liquid premium, yet only half of it is being used for the liquid market.  The rest of it ends up in manufacturing products.  Obviously, that side is being subsidised.<\/p><p>  Let us not worry about that, as I have no problem with farmers getting a good price for their milk, but the downside of this campaign is the question of who wins.  Liquid milk farmers cannot.  Even if the market for liquid milk improved significantly, it would not create more liquid milk farmers, quota or licensed liquid producers.  There is no upside for the farmer despite having spent &euro;2.4 million.  Internationally speaking, the downside is for manufacturing farmers who are giving money hand over fist.  Their milk is being used to make cheese, butter, etc.  Per head, Ireland's level of consumption of liquid milk is the third highest in the EU.  People cannot be made to drink much more of the stuff.  The market cannot really grow, although there will be some population growth.  Would it not be better to use the money to try to find other markets?  Research was mentioned.  Some &euro;2.4 million would fund a great deal of research into various products.  This would benefit manufacturing farmers, as it would move milk from whole milk powder, skimmed powder or butter into higher value products.  Derry has one of the lowest consumption levels in Europe of desserts, yoghurts and cheese.  There is considerable scope for a marketing campaign.<\/p><p>  No matter how the campaign turns out, there is no upside from the liquid milk farmer's point of view.

I am happy enough to use that.  I have no problem doing so.  If were to use it, the issue would then disappear.  We were asked why in our view the campaign was launched.  I do not know because I do not have the NDC's ear.  In my view the reason the NDC campaign was launched was to try to force us out of the market and to give others an unfair competitive advantage over the major liquid milk processor on the island.<\/p><p>  I will provide some background.  Strathroy Dairy Limited, which was established by my father who is in the Visitors Gallery, has grown to be the second largest liquid milk processor on this island  We started out as dairy farmers and remain so.  Obviously, it is one of the main competitors.  We all know the largest competitor.  In terms of how growth in Strathroy Diary Limited can be prevented or how others can compete against it, this can be done in the area of price, quality and service.  We have no problem with that and will take them on on that basis every time.  The NDC had to come up with something with which we could not compete.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Heydon, I would say the NDC came under pressure from liquid milk producers in the South who believed they were under pressure from milk producers in the North.  In this regard, milk price was mentioned.  Prices North and South are virtually identical.  As I said, farmers do not come to us to get less for their milk in the South.  We also have southern suppliers, who get more than their neighbours.  We do not buy milk cheap and sell it cheap.  We buy it expensively, sell it and make a profit on it because we are very good at our jobs.  Obviously, farmers were coming under pressure from their processors who were going to cut the milk price because of milk coming in from the North.<\/p><p>  In a meeting similar to this, I met farmers and discussed their supplying us with milk.  A man sitting beside me at that meeting asked me if it was true that we dump milk in the South, which took me back.  My response was to ask him from where I would get milk so cheaply I could afford to dump it and if he thought the farmers who supplied me with milk were stupid.  Those farmers supply Strathroy Dairy Limited with milk because it gives them competitive advantage and pays them a good price for it.  There is no cheap milk to be bought.  There is certainly no milk to be dumped anywhere, not if one wants to remain in business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500007#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1383667800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Is the purpose of this campaign, in effect, is to allow the NDC to take from Strathroy Dairy Limited the only remaining thing it could take from it?

As a long-suffering liquid milk producer in the South - I was one of the 2,000 hard-pressed producers for a long time - I find today's debate very interesting.  I would like to ask a couple of straightforward questions.  How much money has Strathroy Dairy invested in its processing plant over the last ten years?  What is the average farm size, measured by reference to the number of cows, of the dairy's suppliers?  How does that compare to what we have in the South?  I would like to ask about the dairy's producers.  The witnesses mentioned that their company has made inroads into every county in the South.  Does it have suppliers in every county?<\/p><p>  I would like to pick up on the point made by Deputy Heydon about price.  There is a contention that those of us in the South are not operating on a level playing field, compared to those in the North.  I do not mean to keep differentiating between one and the other, as I do not think that is the whole purpose of the exercise.  We all want to get to the bottom of the whole issue.  How is it possible for Strathroy Dairy to be successful and productive if it is travelling to collect milk in counties Carlow or Kildare, bringing it back to Omagh and bringing it back down again to put it on shelves in some of the large multiples?  I will not mention any particular examples.  How is the dairy making a profit from such activity when its produce is being sold at a similar price to that produced by farmers in County Carlow who supply milk to Glanbia, which is just down the road, to be sold from a shelf just over the road?  How can that be done?<\/p><p>  There is a fear about what will happen if we open the floodgates and a large amount of milk starts to come from the South.  The fact that 25% of the milk in the North is coming down into the Southern market has been debated here over a period of time.  If the floodgates are opened, will that put more and more pressure on producers in the South?  The witnesses have said that Strathroy Dairy pays its suppliers well for their milk.  I would contend that nobody pays their suppliers well.  This issue has been discussed at this forum for a while.  The percentage the farmer is getting today is less than the percentage the farmer was getting 20 years ago.  I would not call that paying well.  How can that be achieved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500008#H01900","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1383668400,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Most of the points have been covered.

When I cannot see a National Dairy Council label on a bottle of milk, I sometimes pick it up only to see a UK label on it.  I do not see anybody complaining about the fact that it already has a UK label on it.  This label indicates that the product was farmed in Ireland.  There has to be an \"IRL\" label or some label pertaining to Ireland.  It is just that this label is a little bigger.  I wonder whether the problem with this label is that it is actually working.

They came in to the North and the South subsequently.  One can see it in the increases.  It used to be the case that every drop sold down here was home milk.  Low-fat milk is now sneaking into the market.  Between 70% and 75% of milk being sold in the North is low-fat or semi-skimmed milk.  That will trickle down.  At that time, we looked at it and saw the increase in the own-label sales.  We figured we could spend a fortune growing a brand but it would die a death anyway.  It is possible to see that with Glanbia's liquid sales at the moment.  The branded sales have fallen off a cliff.

However, the milk is not being used for liquid at all.  The idea that there could be a scarcity of milk makes no sense when the country is awash with the stuff.  There is loads of milk that can be used for liquid.  Will there be a scarcity in the winter months?  If they want to pay a liquid premium to the manufacturers farmers, they will have more milk than they will know what to do with.

Taking the island as a whole, it might be the case that farmers in the South see that the fellows in the North have decided to invest in the plant and machinery that are required to produce milk in the wintertime as well as the summertime and decided to let them tear away at it while they concentrate on specialising in other areas, such as maximising the output of grass for grazing in the summertime.<\/p><p>  My argument is that if quotas go then milk production will rise, in which case the difficulty we will have is not a shortage of milk but how to get it processed in the summertime.

As a businessman, Deputy Barry will understood that.  There will be incentives to produce milk in the shoulders of the year, which will get over - if it ever did become an issue - any shortage milk in the wintertime.  We supply the same amount of milk, summer and winter, 12 months of the year.  We are obliged to ensure the supplies are there.

The industry is too large to make that type of risk worthy it.

Any barrier to trade creates huge difficulties for everybody.  I am primarily a dairy farmer but I also have bull calves which I sell.  For the past three years a farmer in Donegal has come and bought every single bull calf born on my farm.  It was a great relationship.  I telephoned him in October when the cow started to calve to ask him how he was fixed.  He told me he had a difficulty in that, because the calves from my farm were now classed as nomads, there would be a problem with getting them slaughtered.  Farmers in the west of Ireland will be aware that the numbers of Northern buyers around the mart rings have gone way down because of this nomads issue.<\/p><p>  Farmers in the Republic are worried about milk from the North flooding the market in the South.  The reality, however, is that agricultural trade on this island does not pay any cognisance to the Border.  I have two Dairymaster milking parlours which are manufactured in Kerry.  I am on my fourth Keenan feeding wagon, also manufactured in the South.  Keenan does not have a difficulty with its feeding wagons being sold to buyers in the North.

The dairy product Bord Bia does not cover, unfortunately, is milk.  Bord Bia's ideas have been well thought through and very well implemented because there has been a consensus of opinion.  The Government and the committee have clearly been included in how it runs its affairs.  The NDC, on the other hand, does not come under those controls and as a result it is causing great difficulties in terms of the milk market.  It is running roughshod around the place and causing the difficulties we are experiencing now.  The committee might not want to take Ian Potter as a good example but what he has said are the kinds of things that have been written about Irish milk and Irish dairy products; this is creating confusion and it could be doing serious harm to the good work being done by Bord Bia.  If it brought milk in under the same banner perhaps it would solve the problem and the NDC would be able to go off and spend its money on something else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500012#M02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1383670800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Senator O'Neill asked about the margins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500012#M02300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383670800,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I will give a one word answer to that question, it is \"No\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500012#M02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1383670800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Mr. Cormac Cunningham will not give us the margins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500012#M02500","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383670800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Would the Senator expect me to do so?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500012#M02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1383670800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>We have asked everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500012#M02700","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383670800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>In the context of the \"white paper\" referred to in the committee, I can understand that it would do a lot of good.

It was Deputy Ferris who requested that we invite the witnesses to make a presentation before the committee.  Another member asked where are we going with this to which I replied that we are not quite sure until we start to delve into it, which is probably dangerous.  One of concerns following on from the report - or \"white paper\" as witnesses called it - we published was that there is so much unknown and so much that seems to be going on with regard to the milk market on the island.  First, there was a concern as to whether there would be an all year round supply of fresh milk.  That may have been an invalid argument or concern, but it was a concern.  The second concern related to the producers of winter milk where the price being paid for manufactured milk was equal.  Some farmers are set up for winter milk production and such production suits less grass intensive farmland and highland areas that have a colder climate.  Notwithstanding Deputy Deering's good farm in Carlow, the perception is that a significant number of fresh milk producers have that type of farm set up.  There was a concern about the dairy herd size in that the only way farmers have been able to compete has been to consolidate and have bigger operations to achieve efficiencies in production but that does not suit all farmers because of a milking platform and so on.  That is where we started off.<\/p><p>  The witnesses put up a robust case here today and I would say everybody would agree with it.  We will facilitate others, in the way we have facilitated the witnesses, to come before the committee, and the witnesses are welcome to attend the committee again as visitors or watch the proceedings on the lifestream or after the meeting.  There will be people who will have a counter argument.  The committee will then decide what we want to do in terms of our consideration of this issue but that will be a matter for another day rather than today.<\/p><p>  This has been a useful discussion.  It is only fair that this committee, as a forum for public discussion, would allow people to give their point of view and it is up to others to make a counter argument if they so wish.  I note Deputy Ferris wishes to make a brief comment before I conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500012#M03400","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1383670800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I would like to find out why the National Dairy Council refused to allow its logo be used on the witnesses' product given that it was farmed in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013110500012#M03500","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1383670800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>We will have that discussion internally in our time but the discussion today was more of an exploratory exercise on our own behalf and, in fairness, everybody is entitled to make their case.

I am not an expert in this area but it is fascinating to hear the different arguments.<\/p><p>  The term \"price war\" was mentioned.  Senator O'Neill, perhaps tongue in cheek, made a point about milk that is over quota.  If any of that is going on it is illegal and people should report it.  It is as simple as that.  There is a great deal of confusion.  We mentioned the report we published that we would favour the idea of a fair trade logo for everybody engaged in production in the food chain.  Some small processors and producers are being squeezed in other segments of agrifood production, although not necessarily in milk production because those processors are not generally that small.  We will see where we go from here.  I thank the members.  I am sure the witnesses will have found they were asked fair questions.  People are trying to get to the bottom of this.

It extends the obligations on directors in respect of their compliance statements to cover not only tax and company law, but also public interest considerations such as environmental, health and safety and employment law.  It is hoped that this will encourage a wider sense of corporate responsibility towards society and shared natural resources rather than just towards a company itself.<\/p><p>  In today's language, these amount to externalities and are not considered as being costs to the company.  Externalities are unintended side effects of the market economy and are the impact of commercial transactions that fall outside the two parties to that transaction.  For example, when a consumer buys gardening tools and materials, a positive externality is experienced by others in the community, as the consumer uses those materials to make an attractive garden from which everyone in the community can gain enjoyment and benefit.  On the other hand, if a consumer hires a contractor to cut down the trees on his or her property in order to park an extra car, the community experiences a negative externality, as the scenic beauty, shade, animal habitat and fresh air provided by the trees are lost.<\/p><p>  Externalities can be positive or negative.  For the companies that organise the production of goods and services in the professional economy, however, they are to be ignored.  Since externalities do not directly affect the responsible parties, profitability is not harmed by them.  This principle has led to significant economic impacts.  For example, the large-scale outsourcing of America's mass production has had considerable effect, including the decline of large urban regions due to depressed demand, resulting in increased rates of crime, family strain and domestic abuse.  These are external side effects of corporate investment strategies, as they do not directly hurt earnings.  Too often, capital is pushed forward despite these side effects.  The world would be a better place if companies had a responsibility to consider externalities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2013110500012#L00400","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1383650700,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the Deputy has been brushing up on his neo-Marxist economic theory - it sounds vaguely familiar from my college days - this question was dealt with comprehensively by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, in its 2005 report on directors' compliance statements.  If members will pardon my use of acronyms, the CLRG decided that such extra duties would do little to increase compliance and would merely result in an increase in red tape at significant cost to business.  The set-up cost for a business was an estimated &euro;90,000 and its ongoing annual cost was estimated at &euro;40,000.  A streamlined version of the director's compliance statement proposed by the CLRG, which is a statutory body, removed the requirement that the statement should include a declaration that the company had complied with all other enactments that could affect its financial performance.  This was found to be the most burdensome aspect of the statement and also the least relevant, as companies were already legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas.  Their inclusion in the compliance statement did not add substantive duties.<\/p><p>  More than 80% of the CLRG's members, including members representing the Financial Regulator and other public bodies, agreed to a more balanced version of the director's compliance statement.  There is a strong EU impetus towards less unnecessary regulation to make EU businesses more competitive.  This amendment would create unjustifiable and disproportionate costs on Irish businesses and disadvantage Ireland competitively, as we would have gone beyond other countries.  The current compliance statement has received support from industry and regulators alike.  For these reasons, it is intended to preserve it in the Bill.

In the past 20 years, companies have made many decisions that were not in their best long-term interests.  For example, some companies are making decisions based on three-month thinking because everything is driven by the markets and what they can sell.  The companies are not concerned about where they will be in five years' time.  There is nothing to stop them from making decisions that are not in the interests of their long-term health.

The answer to that is that corporate offences are by their nature difficult to investigate.  The fact that white collar criminals have gotten off lightly in the wake of the economic crisis should not lead to the conclusion that the law is flawed.  Corporate criminal investigations often require the gathering and examination of large volumes of complex documentation, which can be painstaking and time consuming and necessitates wide consultation with experts, including forensic accountants and lawyers.  Equally, people may be unwilling to give evidence voluntarily in circumstances where they have worked with or have close business ties to an alleged offender.  As a criminal must be proven guilty beyond all reasonable doubt, many plausible cases of wrongdoing will never be successfully prosecuted.

It deals with the declaration by the court restricting a director of an insolvent company in being appointed or acting as a director.  The court will make the declaration restricting the director upon application from the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the liquidator of an insolvent company or a receiver of any property of the company.  The restriction is for a period of five years and the restricted person may not be appointed to act in any way, directly or indirectly, as a director or secretary or to be involved in the formation or promotion of a company, unless that company meets the required capitalisation levels.<\/p><p>  It provides a defence for directors where they can show that they have acted honestly and responsibly in respect of the conduct of the affairs of the company, whether before or after it became insolvent, and where the court can see no other reason that it would be just and equitable that the director be restricted.  The subsection has been amended, and that is as compared with the Companies Act 1990, in so far as a new proviso has been inserted in line with a recommendation from the Company Law Review Group.  The additional requirement is that the person concerned \"...has when requested to do so by the liquidator... co-operated as far as could reasonably be expected in relation to the conduct of the winding up of the insolvent company\".  The reason for the insertion of this provision is to promote greater co-operation by the directors and other officers with the liquidator.  Subsection (3) sets out the capitalisation requirements for a company which has a restricted person acting as director or secretary or taking part in the formation or promotion of that company.<\/p><p>  Provision is made for restrictions involving a guarantee company to ensure that a company may not escape a capitalisation-type requirement by reason of not having a share capital.  The requirement here is that at least one of the members of the company must give a guarantee of not less than &euro;100,000, subject to the amendment's being agreed to.

Therefore, we are entitled, in the wider context of the debate on British nuclear policy, to express our concerns and fears, even though we are not in the same jurisdiction.  As we are near neighbours, there are many issues of concern to us.  Nuclear power is not our chosen route of energy generation.  Therefore, the majority of Irish people probably agree with our policy on nuclear energy.  The effects of accidents at nuclear power plants are strong in people's minds, particularly those who live on the east coast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110500003#D00500","speaker":"996","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383661800,"counter":1498,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for inviting us here today to address them on the implications for Ireland of existing and proposed nuclear plants in the UK.  We welcome the opportunity to inform the committee of the results of our assessments and to respond to its questions on particular issues of concern.  As members of the committee have already received a detailed paper from us, I propose to take them through a short presentation that is based on a number of Powerpoint slides.  I will then be in a position to respond to questions.<\/p><p>  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland's mission is to ensure people in Ireland are protected from the harmful effects of radiation.  We do this in a number of ways.  Radiation sources and X-ray equipment have many beneficial uses for society in areas like medicine, industry, education and research.  The institute regulates this use to ensure those directly using radiation sources, and the wider public, have an appropriate level of protection.  In addition to our laboratory facilities, we operate a network of monitoring stations around the country where we can measure radiation levels in a range of sample types.  We use the results of the monitoring and the measurements to assess the consequences of radiation levels for people living in Ireland.  The institute plays an important role in Ireland's national plan for responding to nuclear accidents abroad.  We also provide a range of services to licensees and businesses.  For example, we certify the levels of radioactivity in Irish food products that are being exported outside the EU.<\/p><p>  The committee has invited us to present our assessment of the implications for Ireland of the existing and proposed nuclear plants in the UK.  The slide I am showing the committee lists the existing plants there.  Members will see that there are seven nuclear power plants on the west coast of the UK, facing Ireland.  All of these plants are due to be shut down by 2023.  I also draw the attention of the committee to the Sellafield site, which was mentioned by the Chairman.  The facility at Sellafield is not a nuclear power plant - it is a nuclear fuel production and reprocessing plant.  The next slide shows where the proposed new power plants will be located.  As the UK needs to replace the energy produced by the older plants that are due to be shut down, it has identified eight sites as being suitable for the construction of new nuclear plants by 2025.  As the slide indicates, seven of the proposed sites already have nuclear power plants located on them.  Some of those power plants are still operating and some of them have already shut down.  The eighth proposed site is adjacent to the Sellafield site at Moorside.<\/p><p>  When we think of how Ireland might be affected by the radiation emitted from these plants, either during their day-to-day operations or as a result of an accident, we must consider the two primary ways in which radioactivity may reach Ireland - through the air or through the sea.  Radioactivity that enters into the air can expose us directly, or we can inhale the air and so be exposed.  If radioactivity gets into the food chain, we can be exposed to it by eating contaminated food.  Similarly, if radioactivity discharged into the sea gets into the food chain, people living in Ireland can be exposed to it.  The term \"radiation pathways\" is used to describe the way in which radiation from nuclear plants in the UK has an impact on Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland assesses the impact of routine discharges from existing nuclear plants in the UK by measuring radioactivity in the environment.  Those radioactivity measurements are considered alongside habit data, which can include data on the patterns of eating fish or shellfish from the Irish Sea or walking along beaches that might be contaminated.  In that way, we can work out how much exposure people in Ireland have to the radiation emitted from those plants.  Subsequently, we can estimate what the implications of the radiation dose they have received might be for their health.  We provide information to the public.  We produce monitoring reports every year to give people details of the impact of radioactive discharges from nuclear plants in the UK.<\/p><p>  The impact of the routine discharges from Sellafield and nuclear plants in the UK makes up a very small part of the Irish population's overall exposure to radiation.  The pie chart on the slide I am showing the committee gives a breakdown of the sources of the exposure to radiation of a notional average person living in Ireland.  As members can see, radon in our homes makes by far the biggest contribution to our radiation exposure.  The red segment of the pie chart shows that radiation from artificial sources, which includes the radiation dose from Sellafield and other nuclear facilities, the radiation that is in the environment as a result of weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s and the radiation resulting from past accidents such as the Chernobyl incident, accounts for less than 1% of exposure.  Therefore, the actual day-to-day impact of routine discharges from Sellafield and nuclear plants is negligible.  Sellafield makes by far the largest contribution to the small impact that radiation from nuclear plants is having on the overall level.<\/p><p>  The next slide gives details of our assessment of the potential implications for Ireland of the proposed nuclear power plants in the UK.  As I have mentioned, eight sites have been deemed to be suitable for the building of new nuclear power plants in that country.  We have studied the likely levels of day-to-day discharges into the air and into the sea.  We have also examined the implications for Ireland and the people of Ireland of the accidents that could potentially happen at any of those locations.  We have assessed five scenarios involving accidents that might release radioactivity into the air and three scenarios involving accidents that might release radioactivity into the Irish Sea.<\/p><p>  As the plants have not yet been built, we do not have accurate information about what the actual discharges will be.  Based on the information that is available about the types of reactors that may be built at each of the sites, we have developed a generic reactor model to use to estimate releases through day-to-day discharges or as a result of an accident.  After we had agreed on an estimate of the amount of radiation that might be released by either route, we studied how weather patterns would affect the transport of radioactivity to Ireland by air or by sea currents.  We modelled how that radioactivity would get into the food chain after it had reached Ireland.  We estimated what dose of radioactivity might be given to people living in Ireland in such circumstances.<\/p><p>  I am afraid the font used on the slide dealing with the accident scenarios we examined is quite small.  We assessed five scenarios in which radioactivity is released into the air.  I will not go through this slide in detail.  Each scenario was based on a different frequency, ranging from one in 50,000 per annum to one in 33 million per annum.  While such scenarios are quite rare, they would be quite impactful nonetheless, which is why we looked at them in detail.  We divided the impacts into two categories - the health impacts and the other impacts.  It is clear from the slide that in four of the five scenarios, the releases would result in no observable health effects in Ireland, even in the case of a severe accident.  In the case of the fourth scenario listed on the slide, it is predicted that the release of radioactivity could pose a long-term risk of an increase in cancer rates in Ireland if our national emergency plan for nuclear accidents, which is designed to reduce the impact of an incident of this kind, does not work effectively and certain controls are not put in place.<\/p><p>  As we saw in the cases of the incidents at Chernobyl and, more recently, Fukushima, an event of this nature can have a socioeconomic impact in addition to its direct health impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110500004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ann McGarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383662400,"counter":1500,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McGarry for her presentation and I thank the panel for attending.

He correctly pointed out that there are two different types of risks to consider here, one being the actual health risks to individuals living in Ireland and the second being the risk to the food industry.  In terms of the situation for people in this country arising from the ongoing day-to-day operations of either the existing nuclear plants or those which are planned for construction, according to our assessments, the amounts of radioactivity released into the environment are not sufficiently high to pose a health risk.  I am referring here to routine operations.  The situation in the case of an extremely severe accident is different.  As I mentioned earlier, in one of the accident scenarios we considered in our study we found, depending on the severity of the accident and whether the plan we have in place turns out on the day to be effective in mitigating the consequences of that accident, there could be an ensuing increase in cancer rates in Ireland.  In summary, our view is that there is not a health risk from day-to-day operations but, on the other hand, there would be an increase in cancer risks if things went very badly wrong.<\/p><p>  In terms of the risk to the food industry, again I would make the distinction between what happens on a day-to-day basis, either in regard to the existing plant or the proposed new locations, and the potential consequences in the case of a serious accident.  Our assessments show that routine operations do not result in measurable levels of radioactivity in food that would pose a risk to the food industry.  Again, however, for most of the accident scenarios we have considered, our assessment shows there could be - would be in some cases - a risk of food contamination.  In that situation, there would be a threat to the food industry.  Certainly, we are not saying otherwise.  In terms of the health implications for the population arising out of that, our strategy for managing food contamination would be to implement food controls.  However, it would undoubtedly be a serious issue for exporters.  There is no doubt about that.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned the report by the United Kingdom's National Audit Office which indicated that there is a risk to people and the environment in Britain arising from the older tanks at the Sellafield site.  In terms of the implications for Ireland, the key question to consider is how the very large amount of radioactivity at Sellafield might be released and make its way across the Irish Sea.  The Deputy will recall that in the case of the Chernobyl accident, it was an explosion that released the radioactivity up into the air, and it was carried by the weather across to Ireland.  In the case of the older tanks at Sellafield, it is our understanding that there is not that type of energy available to lift the radioactivity into the air and bring it across to us.  While we have concerns about many issues at the Sellafield site, our assessment is that the tanks do not have a particular potential impact for Ireland other than by some unusual route, where, for example, a meteorite were to hit a tank and release radioactivity into the environment.  In such a scenario, an impact for Ireland cannot be ruled out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110500006#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ann McGarry"},{"type":"speech","time":1383663000,"counter":1503,"content":"<p>The National Audit Office indicated that the tanks at Sellafield have deteriorated to such an extent that their contents pose a \"significant risk\" to people.

She asked about the difference in potential impact between a re-processing plant and a nuclear power plant.  The main difference is that a nuclear power plant is a real source of energy.  If there is an explosion at a nuclear power plant, there is the potential for radioactivity to be released up high into the environment and to be transported in the weather across to Ireland.  A re-processing plant does not have the same energy associated with it.  In order to introduce energy to the situation to get the radioactivity over to Ireland, the kind of events considered were a strike by a meteorite etc., a different type of event entirely.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about compensation and whether that was factored into the cost of building.  I am not entirely certain about that.  I will ask my colleagues in a moment.  There certainly are international conventions around nuclear liability so it is taken into account.  The Deputy also asked how we compare with people living immediately adjacent to the plant, such as people in the UK living close to either Wylfa or Trawsfynydd or whatever.  In terms of day-to-day operations, the radiation dose they receive is higher than that which we receive but it would be in the realm of no observable health effects.  In the UK it would not be permitted to operate a nuclear plant on a day-to-day basis which had observable health effects on people.  The radiation dose will be slightly higher the closer one is to a facility.  The dose to Ireland from Sellafield is extremely low but what dose there is comes through eating contaminated fish or shellfish, so the amounts are very small. <\/p><p>  I will ask my colleague, Ciara McMahon to talk about the various scenarios that we tested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110500007#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ann McGarry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383663600,"counter":1514,"content":"<p>We studied five scenarios for releases to air.

We did not study particularly what caused it to lose its power.  The scenarios were taken from a recent study by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission which had brought together information and data on ways in which accidents can occur at this type of nuclear power plants.

I will explain briefly the CPR and their legal status and deal with the issue of how they affect the standard of construction products on the market in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The main goal of the CPR is to reduce technical barriers to trade across Europe in construction products.  The regulations will do this by creating technical specifications or standards for individual construction products.  They are written at European level and use common technical language which harmonises test methods, the methods for declaring on performance and the methods used in third party assessment of construction products.  Therefore, when they are placed on the market, the characteristics of products should be the same across Europe, whether one is in Sweden, Germany or Ireland.<\/p><p>  The CPR make it mandatory, when a product is covered by these specifications or standards, for a declaration of performance to be made and a CE mark will be affixed to the product.  The manufacturer is responsible for these and the information contained in them.  Once one sees the CE mark on a construction product, one knows it has been through this process and that the information is in accordance with the CPR and any other Union harmonisation legislation applying to it.  The CPR envisage everybody across the construction sector using this common technical language.  As regulators of the building regulations, we use these standards and specifications.  Users will use them to choose between products, while manufacturers will provide the information which can be considered reliable.  That is the concept behind the regulations.<\/p><p>  In terms of legal status, the regulations were adopted in 2011 and came into effect in Ireland on 1 July this year.  They repealed the construction products directive, CPD.  They build on many of the instruments established under the CPD.  They are in the interests of simplifying and clarifying the use of the CE mark for construction products.<\/p><p>  We needed to bring forward national legislation to police the construction products regulations and provide for market surveillance.  We can go through these issues in more detail.  SI 225 designates local building control authorities as the market surveillance authorities and provides them with powers.  It requires them to authorise persons to carry out inspections and investigative work.  It also provides for the corrective actions to be taken, if a problem occurs or there is an offence.  Defences and penalties are also included.  There is market surveillance at a national level in accordance with national regulations.  There are also voluntary measures in which we are involved at European level.  Where a product is deemed to be high risk, it is dealt with through the provision of a RAPEX notice which is issued by various member states.  We can go into that matter in more detail, if the committee wishes.<\/p><p>  On the third topic, the impact on the quality of construction products in Ireland, the standards and specifications from the European Union are very different from what we have relied on in national standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110500009#K01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383665400,"counter":1541,"content":"<p>May I ask a question before I call Deputy Coffey?

Whatever the manufacturer writes in terms of the characteristics of the product in that DOP, he or she must stand over that.  If it is found that the product does not meet that performance, that is clearly a non-compliance with the construction products regulation.<\/p><p>  In terms of pyrite, that is an interesting one because hardcore will now be CE marked.  The NSAI has just concluded a public inquiry on what is known as standard recommendation 21, which provides that national guidance.  In terms of the harmonised standard dealing with aggregates like hardcore, there is now a harmonised standard that sets up the test methods, the assessment process and the third parties that must be involved before hardcore can be placed on the market.  The NSAI has produced guidance on the specification and the minimum standards for the characteristics of hardcore when it is placed on that market.  That provides clarity for the users and for the manufacturers.  The manufacturers must declare what those characteristics are and the users can check whether that is what they are getting on site.  There is a greater confidence in terms of what is being delivered.  The manufacturer is clearly responsible for what he or she says that product can do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110500010#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1383665400,"counter":1543,"content":"<p>I had a similar query to that asked by the Chairman.

My name is Paul Gregan and I work half-time as a consultant in palliative medicine and half-time as a general practitioner.  I chair the primary palliative care programme, which is a joint initiative set up in 2010 with the backing of the Irish Hospice Foundation, the HSE and the Irish College of General Practitioners, with the aim of identifying improvements and initiatives that would support the provision of palliative care in the community by the primary care team. I represent the Irish Palliative Medicine Consultants Association on that committee.<\/p><p>  The real reason we are all here today is to hear about the care of those living with life-limiting illnesses in the community, and about caring for them as they die.  Palliative care is very much about the living and how we manage their holistic care from a physical, psychological, social and spiritual perspective.  It is also about caring for people towards the end of their lives and it is about how they die.<\/p><p>  Care of the imminently dying is a smaller but extremely important part of what palliative care is about; much as care in pregnancy is not all about the birth, palliative care is not all about dying.  After-care, in the form of bereavement care, is the continuation of care past death for families and friends involved and forms part of the remit of palliative care services.<\/p><p>  We will all have a last year of our lives.  Therefore, we all have a real stake in the quality of care that is provided to those who are at the end of their lives now.  They are us tomorrow.  I have three points to make about their care.  The first is about prioritisation.  In my work as a general practitioner, palliative care patients stand out as generally among the sickest and most in need.  I suspect this is the same across everyone&rsquo;s practice, whether it is medical, nursing or anything else.  It stands to reason that they are therefore in a top-priority grouping for service provision and in many areas, although not in all, they are already categorised as such.  For example, accessing a priority discretionary medical card for a person with a palliative care need, with a turnaround time now from application to receipt of a few days, represents a good example of excellence in care.  However, not being able to access sufficient carer support when a person is deteriorating or dying, or the unavailability of equipment in the community for this priority grouping, arguably represents a fundamental breakdown in care provision.  I would urge all areas of the health service to examine where they can prioritise this care.  These patients should be category one in everyone&rsquo;s book.<\/p><p>  The second area is around equity.  Different areas of Ireland have different access to palliative care provision.  This is true in specialist palliative care; it is well documented that the provision of specialist palliative care beds is inequitable.  It is also true in community palliative care at specialist levels - for example, where we have funding for five-day-a-week services instead of seven - and it is also true at generalist levels.  For example, in one area there may be only five hours of carer time a week, while five miles up the road there is access to 21 hours of carer time.<\/p><p>  Similarly, access to services by palliative care patients under the age of 65, who amount to a quarter of the patients under specialist palliative care, needs to equate to that of those over the age of 65.  Arbitrary age cut-offs are not helpful in life-limiting illness.  Palliative care patients deserve priority access to a standard, minimum and equitable amount of care in the community.<\/p><p>  The third area I would like to cover is nursing.  When I ask my palliative care colleagues about palliative care that could be improved upon, they prioritise nursing.  The fundamental lack of provision for nursing support to patients and families ranks highest in their table of requirements.  We are fortunate that we still have, by and large, a society in which families will do all in their power and ability to help a relative in trouble, but we need to meet them halfway on that and at the moment we do not.  There is an urgent need to augment our nursing services for palliative care patients.  We need a dedicated budget for community nursing in palliative care.<\/p><p>  Dying is something that each one of us will do in our turn.  Only one in ten of us will die suddenly.  Therefore, we are in a position to adequately plan the individual care of nine out of every ten people, but we are also able to plan adequate care at population health level for those living months before dying and those imminently dying.  We need to plan the care of these people.  It is relatively inexpensive and it is entirely predictable.  We need to do the simple things and the important things well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Gregan"},{"type":"speech","time":1383671100,"counter":1558,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Gregan for his excellent presentation.

Nursing Homes Ireland has made a detailed submission already.  Therefore, today I will concentrate on the current challenges and possible solutions.<\/p><p>  There have been many positive developments in end-of-life care in Ireland, especially the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in 2009.  Nursing homes are probably the most regulated area of the health service, and now HIQA has established thematic inspections on end-of-life care.  The thematic inspections focus on end-of-life care and are geared at improving standards in nursing homes.  Other positive developments include the provision of end-of-life care education for staff working in residential care settings for older people; the establishment of the End of Life Forum; the commencement of the Changing Minds programme; the establishment of the All Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care; and the Health Service Executive National Clinical Programme for Palliative Care.  These are all very positive developments in end-of-life care in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Some 25% of all deaths in Ireland occur in residential care settings.  It has been recognised that a substantial proportion of patients who die in hospital could be cared for appropriately at home, in a hospice or in a nursing home.  It is for that reason that the end-of-life care in nursing homes is very important today.  It has been suggested that most people do not die at home because the majority of deaths follow a period of chronic illness.  This reflects the wider need for increased consultant-led chronic disease management in the nursing home and greater communication between regular and out-of-hours GP services.  It is widely recognised that there should be greater consultation with older people regarding end-of-life care and decisions regarding end of life should be made before the person enters a nursing home.<\/p><p>  The HSE Quality and Patient Safety Audit report identified that there is greater and more consistent access to primary care team services among public long-term care patients than among those in private nursing homes.  This supports the acknowledgement by HIQA that there is inadequate access to all care services, reflecting a wider funding issue in the sector.  The role of the allied health professional at the end of life is widely acknowledged.<\/p><p>  A survey of directors of nursing recently emphasised a high level of satisfaction with GP services in nursing homes.  However, it was also highlighted areas for improvement, which centred around three main themes: accessibility and quality of service, service delivery, and accountability and sector awareness.  It could be argued that the GP is the gatekeeper of care and is therefore in a prime position to commence discussions and plans about end-of-life care before admission to long-term care.  This ensures that end-of-life care meets the resident's needs and wishes and that these can be met by the nursing home staff. <\/p><p>  Issues have been highlighted by Nursing Homes Ireland members in regard to the provision of services by GPs.  They include the charging of an administrative fee by some providers for out-of-hours service - known as Caredoc in the South, but there are many other names for the service around Ireland - refusals to visit by some GPs, and triage by telephone.  Also, due to the rural location of some nursing homes in Ireland, it is difficult to get GPs in the out-of-hours service to visit.<\/p><p>  Symptom relief at the end of life is very important.  It is very important that people who are dying receive pain relief and the care they require.  Unfortunately, if a GP does not call this cannot be provided.  We recommend that the role of nurse prescribers be enhanced in nursing homes.  Unfortunately, nurse prescribers in nursing homes are not issued with a prescription pad for prescribing medication at present.  Therefore, their role cannot be enhanced.<\/p><p>  The report Creating Excellence in Dementia Care states that up 66% of residents in nursing homes have a dementia.  Due to the unpredictable illness trajectory and fluctuating capacity of residents with dementia, many clinical, ethical and legal challenges present, including recognition of the dying phase.  It can be very difficult for a GP or doctor to admit that somebody is in the dying phase.  This highlights the need for more specialist geriatrician input to assist and support nursing home staff in adequately addressing the needs of residents with dementia within the nursing home throughout their illness and especially at the end of life.<\/p><p>  The nurse-led hospice at home service is an invaluable support.  However, this service is predominantly during office hours and therefore out-of-hours supports are limited.  This view is supported by general practitioners, who highlighted the need for greater access to out-of-hours service, particularly access to consultant-led palliative care teams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383671700,"counter":1561,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Burke for her excellent presentation.

The ICHN is a professional and educational body established in 1985 to represent public health nurses and community registered general nurses working in primary care throughout Ireland.<\/p><p>  Research indicates that 90% of the last year of life is spent at home, that the expressed wish of 80% of people with end-stage illness in this country is to die at home, and that only 26% of the 29,000 people who die each year do so at home.  It is apparent there is a great need to improve home care services to fulfil this desired wish.<\/p><p>  The World Health Organization definition of palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, including physical, psycho-social and spiritual problems.  End-of-life care refers to the care offered to an individual when death is imminent and life expectancy is days or even hours.  End-of-life care is part of what palliative care is but by no means defines it.  Palliative care services may be structured in three levels of ascending specialisation according to the needs of the patient and family and the expertise of the staff providing it.  Level 1 is palliative care approach.  Palliative care principles should be appropriately applied by all health care professionals.  Level 2 is a generalist approach where at an intermediate level, a proportion of patients and families will benefit from the expertise of health professionals who, although not engaged in full-time palliative care, have had the additional training and experience in palliative care.  That would be typical of a public health nurse, community or GN and GP.  Level 3 would be the specialist palliative care services, which are limited in terms of their core activities to the provision of palliative care.<\/p><p>  For over a decade, it has been acknowledged that people with conditions other than cancer should have their palliative care needs met, and this principle has been adopted in Irish policy documents since 2001.  Services for people with life-limiting diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, heart failure, end-stage renal failure and chronic neurological disorders, are still underdeveloped and fragmented in Ireland.  A key finding of the children's palliative care needs assessment was that the preferred location of caring for a child with a life-limiting condition is the family home with parents receiving adequate professional support.<\/p><p>  Evidence shows that there are many factors that prevent patients from receiving adequate care in the community and which result in the admission of patients to hospitals, nursing homes or specialist palliative care units.   The difficulties experienced by carers and relatives were more often a cause for hospital admission than those of the patients.  Others found that support at home produced the strongest influence on place of death, with the need for around-the-clock, seven-day nursing care being foremost and access to specialist palliative care advice, specialist equipment, the medical card, social services and receipt of an attendance allowance all showing statistically significant effects.<\/p><p>  Of the people who die every year at home, the majority of their care is provided by members of the primary care team.  It must be acknowledged that without the input of relatives and lay carers, home death could not be achieved.  Due consideration needs to given to the support and resources required by lay and primary carers in the community.  Public health nurses and community registered nurses are responsible for a particular geographical area and are key members of the primary care team.  They assess the holistic palliative care and end-of-life nursing needs of all patients in the community.  They are responsible for co-ordinating and managing the nursing services delivered to the patient in the community, linking hospital, community and specialist service as appropriate.  Resources are limited to 9 to 5, Monday to Friday, however, with only planned essential calls at the weekend and public holidays.  In most areas, there is very little or possibly no service after 5 p.m and before 9 a.m.<\/p><p>  There is emerging evidence to suggest that where people die has an impact on how they die, and that those who die at home and in the place they prefer have a better quality of dying, so to speak, than those who do not.   A major inequity exists in the availability of palliative care and specialist palliative care throughout the country due to the way in which services have been developed.  The institutionalisation of care at the end of life and eventual place of death does not reflect the wishes of the majority of the population.  In the next decade, there will be significantly more people living with advancing life-limiting disease in the community and all of these people will require a palliative approach to their care.<\/p><p>  I will address the dignity care intervention.  The aim of this service development initiative is to implement and evaluate a dignity care intervention that will be delivered by all nurses to conserve the dignity of people at the end of life in community settings.  The ICHN endorsed the palliative care clinical programme which focuses on equity of access based on need of the individual and efficient use of resources.  The ICHN recommends that leadership is required from all the relevant stakeholders within service delivery, education, policy and academia; that choice of location for care at end of life should be fully supported and resourced adequately; that all patients who have a diagnosis of a life-limiting condition should have equal access to all levels of palliative care in the community; that due cognisance should be given to the roles and responsibilities of the public health nursing service-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Tan"},{"type":"speech","time":1383671700,"counter":1563,"content":"<p>Ms Tan has one minute left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500004#C00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383671700,"counter":1564,"content":"<p>-----the ICHN recommends that there should be increased resources for paediatric palliative nursing care in the community; that opportunities for education and training in palliative care be urgently provided for all levels of staff; that there be increased access to home support, packages of care, 24-7 nursing care and specialist palliative care on call support; that access to aids and appliances should be immediately available for palliative care patients; and that health care providers promote \"Think ahead &ndash; Speak for yourself\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Tan"},{"type":"speech","time":1383671700,"counter":1565,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Tan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500004#C00600","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383672300,"counter":1567,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to attend and to make a more detailed submission.  As I represent the Alzheimer society, I will concentrate on people with dementia in connection with end of life.  I will focus on four key points that summarise our submission.<\/p><p>  Our key recommendation to the committee is to have dementia recognised in the first instance as a life-limiting condition in order that specific palliative care can be provided as part of dementia care following diagnosis to the end of life.  Dementia is a life-limiting condition but often it is not recognised as such.  End-of-life care and palliative interventions currently tend to focus on malignant diseases but we need specifically to include dementia as a life-limiting disease.  End-of-life care for a person with dementia needs to be begin at the point of diagnosis.  The trajectory of dementia is not a straight line similar to other diagnoses.  It is complex and there is no cure for it.  The journey begins at diagnosis, it continues and transitions to community services, possibly including an acute hospital admission, before long-term care and the onset of comorbidity.  Too soon is never too soon in terms of planning for dementia and end of life.<\/p><p>  To enable palliative interventions during the journey, we need to build capacity within current health care teams working with people with dementia.  This would enable the 42,000 people in Ireland who currently live with dementia to live but also to die well.  The number is projected to increase in less than 25 years, a relatively short period, to 140,000.  We have the opportunity to prevent dementia and end-of-life care crises in Ireland.<\/p><p>  We are working on the development of a national dementia strategy, which will be an important point in public policy.  It is due for publication at the end of the year.  It is critical in the context of this discussion that full policy recognition of dementia palliative care is contained within the strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1383672300,"counter":1568,"content":"<p>I welcome our final witness, Dr. Declan Walsh, professor of palliative medicine, Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500005#D00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383672300,"counter":1569,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the committee.  I have spent almost all of my professional life working in the United States and the United Kingdom and, therefore, my remarks will address the international trends in the field.<\/p><p>  I refer to the field of palliative medicine, the physician specialty.  It is a new and evolving medical specialty and its final shape and form is in evolution in terms of where it works, how it works and the various interactions it has a specialty.  It is focused on people with serious or incurable diseases but its final shape and form is not decided as compared to a well-established specialty such as gastroenterology or cardiology.  A major way of thinking about the management of chronic illness is to think of it in two buckets.  One is the acute care system and the other is the post-acute care system of which hospice, rehabilitation and other forms of post-acute care are important components.  The interaction between those systems drives much of the expense and many of the challenges in the management of chronic illness.  The field of palliative medicine arose in part as a reaction to perceived deficiencies in modern medical care, for example, medical care being overly technical or impersonal in the hospital.  This is starting to change because palliative medicine is becoming more of a mainstream medical specialty and that is a significant change internationally.<\/p><p>  A patient who goes to see a palliative medicine specialist or someone who has had training in palliative medicine should expect superior skills and communication decision-making in the setting of a chronic complicated illness, excellent management of the complications of the disease and the symptoms such as pain, excellent care of the patient who is dying as well as psycho-social care of the patient and his or her family and co-ordination of the care to make sure the patient is in the right place at the right time for the right reasons.  That is a significant challenge because it means the provision of services in the hospital or the community on a 24-7 basis.  The current evolution of palliative medicine internationally is to go towards comprehensive integrated programmes that provide a menu of services in the hospital and in the community, which are linked, for example, by electronic medical records in order that there is excellent continuity of care between the acute care system and the post-acute care system and that the patient does not get lost in the medical care system.  That, unfortunately, is a frequent occurrence with people who have complex chronic illnesses.  Sometimes it emerges that nobody is in charge of the patient's care and that is one of the roles palliative medicine can fulfil.<\/p><p>  The other major development is the so-called upstreaming concept.  The idea behind this is that many people at the time they are diagnosed with an illness are diagnosed to be incurable at the day of diagnosis and, therefore, it makes sense to involve palliative medicine as a specialty early in the trajectory of the illness.  There is persuasive evidence that early involvement of the specialty can reduce the cost of care, improve the quality of care and reduce length of stay in hospitals.  People who have been referred to palliative medicine services early appear to live longer than those who are not referred until later in the trajectory of the illness.  There are many benefits in terms of the quality and continuity of care and major economic and operational benefits for hospitals to have integrated comprehensive palliative medicine programmes.<\/p><p>  In the context of the community, there is an inexorable shift away from the hospital into the community in medical care.  This is driven by the ageing population and the realisation that hospitals can be dangerous places to be at times and people should be better cared for very often in the community setting.  The explosion in modern information technology will allow us to look after people in a much more comprehensive and efficient manner in the community and we will be able to do things in the community that one could only do in the hospital until recently.  This has significant implications for training, manpower in the context of the provision of specialists and generalists in the area and for returning to some old fashioned values in medicine such as the ability of GPs or specialists to visit patients in the home and so on.  There are important services that need to be delivered on a 24-7 basis.  There needs to be specialist back up for the community services throughout the country.<\/p><p>  The international trends are earlier involvement of specialist palliative medicine closer to the time of diagnosis, the provision of integrated services between the acute care system and the post-acute care system to make the best use of the available medical resources in either setting and making sure the patient is in the right place at the right time.  Palliative medicine is emerging as a mainstream medical specialty, which will have significant implications for the development of the field both in Ireland and internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Declan Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1383672300,"counter":1570,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

Will he expand on the importance of that provision?  What problems has he encountered when such people need to renew their cards?<\/p><p>  I thank Ms Burke for her presentation.  I will cite the Minister for Health.  I am not a member of this committee, but I am interested in this subject and have been following it as a broadcaster, a writer and a Senator.  On 23 May, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, told the committee:<blockquote>My final point, which deserves to be made repeatedly, relates to the tendency in nursing homes in the past to refer patients who are dying to hospital emergency departments ... The tendency to transfer gravely ill residents to emergency departments seems to arise out of concerns and perhaps a lack of confidence in dealing with the terminally ill patient.  It is a dreadful tragedy and affliction for such people that the last hours of their life are spent in unfamiliar surroundings.  It is utterly inappropriate.  To address that issue, the Health Service Executive has begun, through its clinical programmes, sending specialist gerontologists out to nursing homes to support them in dealing with these situations, which are emotionally difficult for all concerned.  It is not in the interest of patients who are coming to the end of their days ... They should be allowed to see out their time [that is an interesting term] in the facilities that have become their homes while receiving all the proper care and attention they require.<\/blockquote>Are people inappropriately transferred from their homes in long-stay nursing homes to accident and emergency departments?  If so, what could be done to help staff to prevent this practice in addition to the clinical programme mentioned by the Minister?  When a resident dies in a nursing home, how does it cope with supporting other residents and staff?<\/p><p>  I thank Ms Tan of the Institute of Community Health Nursing, ICHN.  She stated that due cognisance should be given to the role of the public health nursing service across the disease trajectory, including end of life, alongside the specialist palliative care service.  Will she expand on this point and what further supports would be required from her colleagues who provide specialist palliative care to have the central role of the public health nurse in end of life care recognised?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500007#F00200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1383673500,"counter":1578,"content":"<p>I wish to ask Professor Walsh about his experience abroad and how society is changing as regards the sensitive matters of euthanasia and assisted suicide.

We can hide from it for as long as we want, but it must be faced, as it has been in other countries.

Deputy Kelleher's comments on out-of-hours services were well made.  We have a large problem in how those services manage palliative care patients.  They do their best under stringent, difficult circumstances.  If one is in a house in the Kerry mountains at 2 a.m. trying to make a decision about a critically ill person who is not well enough to go anywhere, it is a difficult situation to manage.<\/p><p>  The programme with which we are involved has examined this matter.  We have considered two ways to help.  First, services can be provided with information prior to attending a patient by means of an electronic palliative care summary e-mailed to them via a secure health link.  Second, services can have access to a specialist palliative care physician via telephone, effectively providing a second pair of eyes to assist in making a decision.  Of further help would be education programmes for GPs who work in out-of-hours services.  Often, they are young and foreign.  The programmes would update them on local skills and requirements.<\/p><p>  Deputy McLellan asked about the Prague Charter.  It has not been assumed into World Health Organization, WHO, or UN charters.  It considers policy, the provision of essential medicines, training and the integration of the palliative care system.  Internationally, there has been a major push to have the charter adopted by the WHO.  However, it is still new and has not gained traction yet.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about a stand-alone entity to consider the provision of palliative care in the community.  This would be a good development.  It would need to involve the interested parties, for example, the Irish Association of Palliative Care, IAPC, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, and the Irish Hospice Foundation, IHF.  Developing a group to act in an advisory capacity would be a good idea.<\/p><p>  Senator Healy Eames asked about assisted dying.  That is the polar opposite of what we in palliative medicine do.  Palliative medicine is about assisted living and managing one's ability to remain alive.<\/p><p>  The Senator also asked about informing the families of people undergoing palliative care.  Routinely, that information comes from the individual patient.  Most will be in a position to tell a palliative care physician whether they want their families to be informed.  In the absence of a person being able to give consent, a GP or consultant must make the decision <i>in loco parentis<\/i>.  However, it is good practice to keep a family up to speed with what is happening inasmuch as possible unless there is a specific direction from the patient prior to becoming ill not to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500007#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Gregan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383674100,"counter":1582,"content":"<p>Has Dr. Gregan made his views known to the HSE?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500008#G00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383674100,"counter":1583,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Gregan"},{"type":"speech","time":1383674100,"counter":1584,"content":"<p>Has he received a response from the HSE on the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500008#G00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383674100,"counter":1585,"content":"<p>No, not yet.

As stated by Dr. Gregan it is difficult to make a decision in the middle of the night about somebody who is dying.  Unfortunately, in some rural parts of Ireland it can take up to 40 minutes or one hour for a Caredoc to get to a facility, during which time the patient is in pain.  There is a need to ensure improved access to out-of-hours services and that people at end-of-life stage are treated by GPs with relevant experience in that area.  It might be useful to, as suggested by Dr. Gregan, develop a database in this regard.<\/p><p>  On the Deputy's question of whether there are sufficient trained prescribers, the answer is there are.  There are more than 700 nurse prescribers in Ireland, of which, unfortunately, only 440 are currently practising owing to difficulties in obtaining support in their hospitals.  There are only three nurse prescribers in private nursing homes in Ireland, of which I am one.  We can prescribe medication but we cannot have it reimbursed under the GMS system.

It would assist in terms of greater communication with families.  Unfortunately, some GPs visit Monday to Friday and do not get to meet with or have discussions with families regarding end of life.  Communication and decision-making is the key to good end-of-life care.  Palliative care consultants are the speciality in this regard.<\/p><p>  Deputy McLellan asked me to outline the shortfalls in geriatricians.  Unfortunately, I do not have the statistics in that regard.  I do not know them.  Connolly Hospital in Dublin operates an excellent system whereby consulting geriatricians visit all the nursing homes attached to it, which prevents re-admission to the acute hospital.  The consultants hold regular team meetings and family meetings.  They also liaise with the palliative care teams to ensure multidisciplinary team decisions around care.  This service is not available in most other parts of the country.  It is a service that should be rolled out.  It would definitely prevent re-admission to acute hospitals.<\/p><p>  Senator Colm Burke also asked about nurse prescribers.  I have already answered that question.  On individual nursing homes and our arrangements with GPs, each resident is entitled to be treated by the GP he or she was attending prior to admission to the nursing home.  Some nursing homes have GPs attached, to whom they pay an annual fee.  In other cases, the GPs own the nursing homes so they get a very good service.  The nursing home in which I work is serviced by 14 different GPs.  It is difficult to have an equitable service of GPs for residents.  Some GPs are excellent and attend every three weeks.  Others attend only every three months.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, recommends that all residents are visited at least every three months.  There needs to be more equity in the GP service.  The Irish College of General Practitioners is working on this.  The chairperson of the committee looking into this is Dr. Tony Lee.  He is working on the development of a document which lists the various things which a GP must do during a visit.  This should help.<\/p><p>  On additional beds and whether the patients concerned could be cared for at home, unfortunately the dependency level of residents now being admitted to nursing homes is much greater than pre-fair deal.  Under the fair deal scheme patients must be assessed as requiring long-term care.  Therefore, the consultant geriatrician will not sign them off for long-term care if they can be cared for at home.  There is definitely a deficit in the beds available.  Nursing homes all over the country have waiting lists.  As I said earlier, some of the people on these waiting lists are in receipt of palliative care and, often, some die before a bed becomes available.  A big issue that has arisen in the context of the establishment of more nursing home beds is what the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, pays under the fair deal scheme to nursing homes.  There is no encouragement for new providers to set up nursing homes because they will not get the rate of pay that is required for the provision of care, in particular at end of life.  HIQA standards recommend the provision of additional care at end of life.  Where a resident in a nursing home is dying this may require an additional nurse at night to care for that resident, which requires additional funding.  This is not catered for in the fair deal amount provided.  The shortfall between what the NTPF pays for the cost of care and the standard and quality of care which nursing homes want to provide needs to be looked at.  Nursing Home Ireland has a number of times recommended the development of a forum with the key stakeholders, including HIQA, the HSE, Nursing Home Ireland, to work on the key issues.  We want to provide an excellent standard of care but are unfortunately prevented from doing so because of financial constraints.<\/p><p>  I thank Senator Healy Eames for her questions.  On the issue of there being no advanced care directive legislation in Ireland, currently we have the \"Let me Decide\" and \"Thinking Ahead\" forms, which allow people when unwell to make decisions in regard to what care they want to receive.  Unfortunately, these are not covered by legislation.  As such, how legally binding such documents would be at end of life is uncertain.  There is a need for legislation in this regard.  Another issue that arises in the context of advanced care directives is that what a person wants now in terms of end of life care could differ from what he or she would require in 20 years.  This means these documents will need to be updated and reviewed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500008#G01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383674700,"counter":1599,"content":"<p>Ms Burke's comments have confused me a little.

That was the point made by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked what type of training should be provided to public health nurses working in the community.  Two types of nurse work in the community: the community registered general nurse and the public health nurse.  One could say there are three types if one includes the specialist palliative care nurse.<\/p><p>  There are many different education programmes available.  I feel that a multidisciplinary approach to education is greatly needed.  It is something we are considering as time moves on.<\/p><p>  Earlier we talked about decision-making in palliative care.  A multidisciplinary approach is required, but it can only be done through people knowing and understanding how to do the work.  They need to know how to make such decisions and to communicate in a multidisciplinary fashion.<\/p><p>  There is a need for carers at all levels to have a better understanding of palliative care and how to communicate within the sector.  They need to know how to communicate with patients and convey their needs and wishes to others on the palliative team.  There is a higher award in palliative care but there are many different higher education courses available, both formal and informal.  Specialist services also play a role in providing education for the general services, either by the community nurse or on a one-to-one basis in a practical situation during a public heath nurse visit.  Centres of nursing education also provide educational training.  The important thing is that we operate in a multidisciplinary fashion. <\/p><p>  Senator O'Donnell mentioned that due cognisance must be taken of the role played by the public health nurse.  She also asked what help and support is provided by my colleagues who work in specialist palliative care.  For many years the specialist palliative care services developed in an <i>ad hoc<\/i> manner.  The roles of most of the community specialist palliative care nurses developed, in years gone by, through the hospice home care services.  Now, more nurses with a background in either oncology nursing or hospice units are joining the service.  They have a different approach and a different take on how to provide support to people in the community.  The specialist palliative care nurses should act as our role model and bring their knowledge and expertise to us.  They can help and guide us.  That would give us the confidence to be competent in what we do.  That can be achieved by providing support and education on a one-to-one basis in a practical situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500009#H01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Tan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383674700,"counter":1616,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McLellan for her kind comments, which will be sincerely appreciated by all of my colleagues. She also mentioned end-of-life-proof homes, but I am not 100% familiar with the concept.<\/p><p>  Today I shall reflect the views of people with dementia and their carers.  More than a year ago the Alzheimer Society of Ireland set up a working group of people with dementia who meet on a regular basis to influence our services and policies.  It is the clear desire of people with dementia and their carers to be supported and allowed to remain at home for as long as possible, up to and including the end of life.  That is their expressed wish.  In the context of dementia, the home setting is always the best setting.  I do not underestimate the intervention and support that carers need to achieve that goal.  It must be right along the trajectory, from diagnosis onwards, rather than in the form of intervention at a crisis moment.  It is a clear desire of people with dementia to remain at home until the end of their lives, if possible.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher touched on resources.  He also touched on the importance of better planning of resources, which can produce better results.  A lot of resources are being spent in the area, but I shall concentrate on dementia.  In the society's budget submission, for example, we estimated that 15,000 people with dementia live in residential settings at present.  We could reduce that number with better early interventions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500009#H01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383675300,"counter":1618,"content":"<p>Is there agreement to engage on that issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500010#J00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383675300,"counter":1619,"content":"<p>My point is that the only way we can achieve systemic change, in terms of moving resources from one end of the system to the other, is by pursuing a national dementia strategy with a clear implementation plan.

In the case of a person who has been diagnosed with a chronic incurable illness, it comes back to the concept of having a defined plan of care agreed with the patient and the family.  The plan of care should reflect the patient's wishes.  The patient's care should be co-ordinated between the acute system and the community or post-acute system.  In many cases, when somebody goes into hospital for a few days before going out into the community, these are random events, with no continuity of care and a lack of good communication between locations.  The current evidence from the United States suggests earlier involvement of palliative care services reduces the average length of hospital stay and the likelihood of readmission to hospital.  It is at the interface with community nursing homes that we can make sure the patient stays where he or she is best cared for.  If he or she really needs to be in hospital, well and good.  It is important that he or she should not have to go there because of some unanticipated crisis.<\/p><p>  There is a continuing debate about the resources issue.  If one has &euro;100 to spend in a hospital, should one spend it on palliative care or intensive care beds, for example?  We are not going to resolve that issue today.  There is good evidence to support the general understanding that better resource allocation in hospitals will feed into the achievement of a better plan of care, thereby leading to earlier discharge from hospital and freeing up hospital beds for those who really need to be in hospital.  This, in turn, will reduce the cost of care which is extremely expensive, as members will be aware.<\/p><p>  The move towards seeing palliative care as a universal right has been addressed.  The European Association for Palliative Care has issued its Prague declaration.  All the signs are that this will move ahead through the World Health Organization, which we would all welcome.<\/p><p>  I was also asked about the relationship with assisted dying.  This is a very complicated issue and I suppose the short answer is to say the focus in palliative care and medicine is on the relief of symptoms.  There is a minority of people who have intractable symptoms.  In some of these cases, the people in question need to be sedated.  This means that they are given drugs, or doses of medication, that render them unconscious.  The objective is not to kill the person but to give him or her whatever medication he or she needs to relieve his or her distress.  There is an important distinction.  While it could be the case that these doses of medication might cause a person to die, the focus is on the therapy aimed at relieving whatever distress he or she is suffering.  There is no question of somebody who is not suffering to any great degree being approached by a person with a dose of medication saying, \"Now we are going to end your life.\"  That is the distinction.<\/p><p>  Most people who have worked in this field feel very uncomfortable about the manner in which the assisted dying debate is presented.  The short way of putting it is that hard cases can make bad law.  I have been working in the field for 30 years and the biggest issue I have had to deal with in that time is not that people want to die.  People want to continue to live; that has been the overwhelming desire of nearly everybody I have seen in my professional career.  One sometimes tries to persuade them to receive less medical care and fewer medical services.  People will hold on to life with a grim determination.  These issues need to be presented in a balanced way.<\/p><p>  I am in favour of the Liverpool care pathway.  I like pathways.  I think it comes back to the issue of continuity of care.  There should be a plan of care for each person.  The Liverpool care pathway has run into problems because there has been a somewhat over-zealous application of some aspects of it.  In addition, there have been some issues with the training of the staff expected to implement it.  The devil is in the detail, as it is in many aspects of life.  One might know what something looks like, but when one goes to put it down on paper, it becomes very black and white and may be open to misinterpretation.  There is certainly an issue in that regard.<\/p><p>  Advance directives are now mandatory in the United States.  Every patient who comes into a hospital must have an advance directive.  As a matter of routine, every patient must be asked about his or her wishes in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500010#J00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Declan Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1383675300,"counter":1623,"content":"<p>I would like clarification in one respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500010#J00800","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1383675300,"counter":1624,"content":"<p>Very briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500010#J00900","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1383675300,"counter":1625,"content":"<p>One of the criticisms of the Liverpool care pathway-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500010#J01000","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1383675300,"counter":1626,"content":"<p>A vote has been called in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500010#J01100","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1383675300,"counter":1627,"content":"<p>Yes.

What does he recommend?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500010#J02200","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1383675300,"counter":1638,"content":"<p>The delegates can work their way through the various questions, starting with Professor Walsh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500010#J02300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383675300,"counter":1639,"content":"<p>Deputy Dan Neville asked about assisted suicide.  It is inevitable that the public debate on this subject will increase.  The rapid ageing of the population in many countries is forcing the debate.  As I said, most of the people who work in this field have concerns about the way the debate is presented.  They are concerned about how it is playing out.  When vulnerable elderly people are going into hospital, they might believe someone is going to kill them.  There are serious concerns in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500010#J02400","nonspeaker":"Professor Declan Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383675900,"counter":1641,"content":"<p>I had better not answer that or comment because I am not a clinician.  However, it is certainly true that some of the interventions can be pharmacological.  Some medicines can help and have been shown to help and, if not to cure, then at least to slow down the prognosis of the disease.  Equally, some interventions on a more social basis have also been shown to have a major impact on delaying the progression of disease, for example, keeping people engaged and exercised, etc., not least supporting their own carers.  There can be a mix and certainly there is no up-to-date advance in terms of medication but I would not rule out the importance of people having it included in terms of a timely diagnosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110500011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Martin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383675900,"counter":1642,"content":"<p>Part of the question related to how far the public health nurse can go to get further time from a carer for a patient.  It is very difficult in many cases.  We have to wait until someone else dies and their hours become available.  However, we continue to lobby our line manager until those hours become available to us and then we transfer them over to our patient.  That is the only way we can do it.
