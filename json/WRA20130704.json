All young people who have had a care history with the HSE, be it foster care, residential care or high support, are entitled to an aftercare service based on their assessed needs.

The inspection of preschools and the enforcement of the Regulations are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE). <\/p><p>  At present childminders taking care of more than three preschool children from different families, and after-school care for children, are not subject to the Child Care Regulations.  These are issues which I am reviewing and will consider further in the coming months in the context of both the Early Years Strategy, which is being developed by my Department, and other amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 which are being considered.<\/p><p>  Childminders who are not subject to the Childcare Regulations are encouraged to voluntarily notify their service to their local City or County Childcare Committee.  Both notified and voluntarily notified childminders can avail of the Childminders Tax Exemption which exempts child minding earnings of up to &euro;15,000 from income tax. While my Department continues to actively promote the notification of child minding services and the participation of childminders in quality and training programmes, it is not in a position to prevent parents from entering into informal arrangements with childminders who are outside the scope of the Regulations. <\/p><p>  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of Ireland's first ever Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to 6 years, is the future role and regulation of the child minding sector.  I expect work on the Strategy to be completed later this year and I will review the future regulation of childminders in that context.<\/p><p>  My Department is currently piloting a new School Age Childcare scheme in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection.  When fully operational, the scheme will provide 6,000 subsidised, after-school places for primary school children, to assist qualifying parents to avail of employment opportunities.  Eligibility for the scheme will be determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Parents qualifying under the scheme will be able to access after school childcare at a weekly cost of &euro;20.  My Department will subsidise each of these places with weekly payments of &euro;35 during term time and &euro;100 in school holidays.  Pending any change to the Child Care Act 1991 to extend regulatory control to after-school childcare, all services participating in the scheme will be subject to strict contractual requirements drawn up by my Department and monitored by Pobal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400041#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":18,"content":"<p>Question No. 14 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adoption Records Provision","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400041#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[32355\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400041#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the resources that are available to the Health Service Executive in managing and sorting the adoption files which are being stored in Glanmire, County Cork; and whom persons can contact if they need to access information from within.","asker":"1015","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>Approximately 25,000 files have been transferred to the HSE Regional Adoption Service in Cork, from the Sacred Heart Adoption Society, which had responsibility for Bessboro, Co Cork, Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, Co Tipperary and Castlepollard, Co Westmeath.

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.<\/p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school in order to support parents to take up employment.  This funding has been made possible through savings from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection. <\/p><p>  Eligibility for the new After-school Childcare programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.   The pilot phase of the programme has commenced and this will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme.  Up to 500 childcare places are available with  Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The full roll-out of the programme will commence in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.   <\/p><p>  The programme will provide &euro;35 per week per child enrolled in a participating service for after school services and this payment will rise to &euro;100 per week during holiday periods when parents will be availing of full day care.  A further &euro;20 per week will be paid by the parent to the provider in both instances.<\/p><p>  The new After-school Childcare programme will further augment my Department's programme of childcare supports for low income families. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programmes, both of which provide subsidised childcare for low income parents, including qualifying parents who are on approved VEC and F&Aacute;S education and training courses.  The CCS programme provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to provide a range of supports including funding towards the provision of after-school services.<\/p><p>  In 2013, my Department expects to spend in the region of &euro;70 million on the CCS and CETS programmes, supporting over 30,000 childcare places.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400041#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aftercare Services","counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400041#WRB02125"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[32587\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400041#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of young persons who have left care during each of the past eight years.","asker":"1102","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[32588\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400041#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of young persons who were in receipt of an aftercare service during each of the past eight years.","asker":"1083","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[32589\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400041#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of young persons who received an aftercare service while in full-time education during each of the past eight years.","asker":"1047","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[32586\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400041#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children during each month of 2012 and 2013 between the ages of 18 and 21 years who were in receipt of aftercare services broken down by gender; the number of young persons broken down by gender during each of those same months who were receiving a service and details of what receiving a service means, including any provision of financial support, education supports, accommodation, or emotional supports.","asker":"981","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":30,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 22, 34 and 49 together.<\/p><p>I am advised by the HSE that data for discharges from care is not available prior to 2012.

Given the particular difficulties for some young people leaving care in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension.

A second set of Conclusions, also adopted, highlight the importance of quality youth work as a tool for engagement with, and development of, young people.<\/p><p>  These conclusions include a concrete set of measures aimed at raising the profile of youth work at EU level and mainstreaming youth work into broader EU policy responses to youth employment and social inclusions. These include establishing a new EU expert group on quality youth work; strengthening the working relationship between the Council of Ministers and other Council of Minister configurations; mainstreaming youth policy input into the European Semester reporting process; recognition of centrality of youth work in contributing to the Europe 2020 growth and jobs agenda; recognition of the role of youth work in implementing the Youth Guarantee; greater coordination between EU youth policy and education, training and employment policies.<\/p><p>  As a follow-up to these Conclusions, I hosted a two day informal expert roundtable on 20 and 21 June which considered the contribution of youth work to youth employment.  The outcome of the meeting, the Dublin Declaration, recognises the challenges facing young people in Europe as a result of the lack of jobs and work experience, as well as the challenges posed by the widening gap between skills being sought by certain employers and those held by many prospective employees. It also recognises that youth work can play a highly-relevant role in developing young people's skill-sets, in particular with respect to &lsquo;soft&rsquo; skills such as learning to learn, social and civic competence, leadership, communication, teamwork, and entrepreneurship &ndash; all of which are highly-valued and sought-after by employers.

Almost 250 people from across the EU attended the Conference, including 109 young people and youth representatives and 65 Ministry officials participating in workshops. The Conference was organised by my Department in partnership with the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI).  It was a major opportunity to showcase the talent and innovation of Ireland&rsquo;s young people and the youth sector. Almost 100 young people were involved in supporting the Conference.  They acted as volunteers and took on roles as guest MCs and speakers, and provided inputs through Arts and Drama presentations.  Over the three days, some 25 information stands showcased the work underway in youth programmes in communities throughout the country.<\/p><p>  The conclusions from this Conference informed Youth Ministers&rsquo; deliberations on quality youth work and will inform the structured dialogue consultations with young people during the Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies. The meeting of the Directors General for Youth hosted by my Department alongside the Conference explored the personal, social and economic impact of youth work.<\/p><p>  The work undertaken under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency including the conclusions of the Ministers and the outcome of the expert group meeting provide the basis for an ambitious agenda which offers the potential to greatly enrich the European Union&rsquo;s policy responses in the area supporting youth employment, in particular with respect to the potential of non-formal learning to reach out to those young people not in education, training and employment. My Department will continue to work with the Departments of Education, Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to identify, in what ways, the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to address youth employment and with European colleagues to progress this important agenda for Europe&rsquo;s young people. <\/p><p>  Also, as an associated Presidency event, I was pleased to support a conference on LGBT Youth and Social Inclusion which held in Croke Park on 17 June 2013.  This event which was organised by BeLonG To brought together the main EU institutions and LGBT groups from Europe to discuss the areas of LGBT youth and education, employment, participation and rights and youth services.  The conference was developed following findings from a Europe-wide consultation under the Irish Presidency which identified LGBT youth as one of the most socially excluded groups in Europe. <\/p><p>In the context of Ireland's Presidency, I should also note that I addressed the Confederation of Family Organisations of the European Union (COFACE) at their European Conference held in Dublin Castle in February to mark Ireland's EU Presidency.  The Conference was brought to Dublin by the Irish Countrywomen's Association who are members of COFACE and was supported by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The conference theme was &quot;Vulnerable Families _ What can Europe Do?&quot;.   <\/p><p>As part of my Department's EU Presidency programme I also launched the UNICEF Report Card in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, Dublin in April.

It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education. The Strategy will further recognise the economic imperative and benefits accruing from targeted investment in early years interventions.<\/p><p>  Key issues to be addressed in the Strategy include the further development of early childhood care and education programmes; the need to enhance quality provision, curricular support; and workforce capacity in early years services; support and regulation of the childminding sector; and the future development of early intervention, therapeutic and family support services to support young children and their parents.<\/p><p>  The Strategy will bring together and consider a significant amount of international and domestic research on the importance of early years for child development, including findings from the &quot;Growing Up in Ireland&quot; study.

My Department works closely with the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and others as part of a cross departmental effort  to realise these Government objectives.<\/p><p>  Youth unemployment is a particular concern because of the prospects it holds for young people themselves, their personal development and for social inclusion. The Government has a range of measures in place to tackle youth unemployment and these include programmes and initiatives in education, training, job search assistance\/ work experience and to encourage job creation.<\/p><p>  Through the Action Plan for Jobs, my Department is progressing work  in relation to actions outlined for my Department and is firmly committed to maximising the role the youth sector can play in this area. There is growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the potential of youth work services to enhance employability of young people.  In particular, recent European policy developments suggest that youth work has the potential to do more and has a special relevance for those young people who are marginalised from traditional systems of education, employment and training. <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s EU Youth Presidency Programme sought to maximise the potential of youth policy in addressing the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy and aimed to highlight how youth policy, as expressed through quality youth work and youth activities, can do more to enhance a range of life skills including employability. Council Conclusions, adopted by the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council at their meeting on 16 May 2013, which I chaired, propose actions to maximise the potential of youth policy in addressing the goals of Europe 2020, in particular youth employment.  A second set of Conclusions, also adopted, highlight the importance of quality youth work as a tool for engagement with, and development of, young people. EU Youth Ministers further reaffirmed the relevance of quality youth work in contributing to measures to enhance the employability of young people, in particular those not engaged in education, employment or training.<\/p><p>  As a follow-up to these Conclusions, I hosted a two day informal expert roundtable on the 20 and 21   June which considered the contribution of youth work to youth employment.  The outcome of the meeting, the Dublin Declaration, recognises the challenges facing young people in Europe as a result of the lack of jobs and work experience, as well as the challenges posed by the widening gap between skills being sought by certain employers and those held by many prospective employees. It recognises that youth work offers a significant infrastructure, reach and capacity, outside of formal education and training; and therefore can play a highly-relevant role in developing young people's skill-sets, in particular with respect to &lsquo;soft&rsquo; skills such as learning to learn, social and civic competence, leadership, communication, teamwork, and entrepreneurship &ndash; all of which are highly-valued and sought-after by employers. The Declaration notes the centrality of the role of quality youth work in the implementation of the Youth Guarantee by Member States. <\/p><p>  The Conclusions of the Ministers and the outcome of the expert group meeting provide the basis for an ambitious agenda which can greatly enrich the national and European Union&rsquo;s policy responses to youth employment. My Department is working closely with the Departments of Education, Social Protection and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to identify, in what ways, the youth sector can contribute to these shared policy objectives, in particular with respect to the potential of non-formal learning to reach out to those young people not in education, training and employment and to measures to implement the Youth Guarantee. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, whose members include representatives of voluntary youth work organisations, is also considering issues to do with progressing this important agenda for our  young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400042#WRC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Reports","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400042#WRC02150"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[32580\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400042#WRC02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the measures she will introduce to bring current child care regulations into line with the standards that all service-user parents, and Irish society generally, expect; the staffing levels, training and oversight requirements she proposes to apply; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Preschool inspections, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE), are necessary to ensure compliance with the Regulations and the delivery of quality childcare services.<\/p><p>  In relation to the publication of preschool service inspection reports, the HSE Preschool Inspectorate is working to put these online.  In the first instance the reports will be available from the Pobal website via a direct link on the HSE website.    A commitment has been given to place new reports, once completed, online from 1 July 2013.  I understand that the first of these will be placed online in the coming days.  Work is ongoing to have reports on all services online by the end of the year and my Department is supporting the HSE and Pobal in this work. <\/p><p>  I have identified a number of key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency.  These include introducing a registration system for all school services; taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust; publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible; ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance; increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance.<\/p><p>   My Department is also undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care Regulations.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.<\/p><p>  It is important to realise, however, that inspections alone are not the answer to improving and maintaining quality. What is required is a multifaceted approach.   The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme introduced the first-ever requirement for minimum qualifications for staff working in the childcare sector.  At present, this requirement is limited to the preschool leader delivering the preschool year and the level of qualification is minimum Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ). I believe it is important to introduce qualification requirements for all staff working in preschool services.  For this reason, I have indicated my intention to increase the minimum requirement of Level 5 for preschool leaders delivering the preschool year will be increased to Level 6 and to require all preschool assistants and all other staff caring for children in a preschool service to hold a minimum qualification of Level 5.  These new requirements will apply from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. <\/p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  I believe we can achieve this objective by taking a number of steps including working with the Department of Education and Skills to develop a more comprehensive and broadly-based inspection regime for preschools.  <\/p><p>  I am also looking at ways to further support the implementation of the Siolta and Aistear frameworks in preschool services. The successful implementation of the Frameworks on a  nation-wide level will require all childcare practitioners to have a thorough  understanding of quality early years provision and I welcome the fact that the Department of Education and Skills is looking at developing a more accessible practice manual to assist preschool services in implementing Siolta and Aistear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400042#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Missing Persons Hotline","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400043#WRD00125"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[32591\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400043#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide a detailed update on the roll out of the 116000 missing children hotline; the publicity strategy in place to publicise this facility; if she will give a commitment to future funding; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1037","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>The 116000 Missing Children Hotline is an EU-wide initiative designed to provide a single point of contact across the European Union for missing children and their families.

In Ireland, the service is operated by the ISPCC and is overseen by a cross-sectoral project team, chaired by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.

Posters, flyers and business cards have been distributed to all Garda stations from Garda headquarters and promotional material has been distributed to a variety of community based projects in various locations throughout the country.  The ISPCC has made extensive use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter to advertise this service on an ongoing basis.  The official launch of the service on 5 June 2013 also provided the opportunity to further promote the scope of the service.

In less than a month since its launch, the website has received approximately 2,000 hits.  To date, some &euro;35,000 has been spent on awareness measures.  This amount will be doubled for further awareness measures in the rest of 2013.  It is important to note the 116000 number is not an emergency number.  Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999\/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated.  The establishment of the 116000 line will be of valuable support and assistance to the families of missing children and to missing children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400043#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Funding","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400043#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[32598\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400043#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the efforts she is making to protect front-line youth services in view of funding cuts in the sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

My view is that people affected by adoption should be given a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible constitutional boundaries.  The constitutional and legal context within which the development of legislative proposals must be undertaken is complex.  This has influenced the existing approach to access to information which, while subject to significant development in recent years, has heretofore operated based upon the consent of all the parties.  The proposed legislation is intended to provide for a structured and regulated approach for applicants seeking access to adoption information and is also intended to facilitate contact between parties affected by adoption, including in circumstances where an adoption order was not effected.  Complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen during the course of the preparation of the heads of Bill, including the setting of criteria for balancing an adopted person's right to information about his or her identity with a birth parent's right to privacy.  This is a particular challenge in considering the impact on individuals in respect of adoptions which took place in the past where the concept of confidentiality and privacy were very central in the adoption process.  These issues are receiving careful examination.  Detailed consideration on the part of my Department and the Office of the Attorney General is under way.  I am anxious to bring the heads of Bill before the Government at the earliest possible date.  Again, my view is that people affected by adoption should be given a statutory right to as much information as permissible within constitutional boundaries.

The principle of inclusion is at the core of the Strategy and, accordingly, the focus of both current and future provision is on the development of a more inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation.

My Department also implements a number of other areas of programme spend, including funding for youth services and funding for services in the early childhood care and education sector.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, along with all other Government Departments, my Department undertook a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in November 2011.  This has required savings to be found across almost all areas of expenditure in my Department's Vote.

Under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, funding for the Family Resource Centres has been reduced in 2012-2013 by 5% per annum which amounts to some &euro;1.6m in total.  The merger of the functions of the Family Support Agency with the new Child and Family Agency in the coming months should provide opportunities for some administrative savings and cost efficiencies. <\/p><p>  The School Completion Programme (SCP) is one of three educational welfare strands under the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) for which my Department has responsibility.  The SCP is also a key part of the Department of Education and Skills DEIS programme.  The SCP supports 124 projects and related initiatives which operate in 470 primary schools and 224 post-primary schools across the country to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.  As a result of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, the SCP was subject to a funding reduction of 6.5% per annum in 2012-2013 amounting to some &euro;3.8m.  An operational review of the SCP will be undertaken in the coming academic year to enable my Department to target support to the pupils most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. <\/p><p>  Funding for youth services and organisations which is provided by my Department to support youth services and projects in the Dublin City area, and which is administered by the City of Dublin Youth Service Board, amounts to almost  &euro;12m this year.  Since 2012, this funding has been reduced by &euro;2.895m.  This is in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure which required funding reductions for youth services of, on average, 5% in 2012 and 10% in 2013.  To minimise the impact of the savings required, my Department is undertaking a comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding to  inform the future provision of youth programmes and services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400044#WRE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Regulation","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400044#WRE01250"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[32349\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400044#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when she plans to introduce regulations for childminders in the home.","asker":"1012","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[32581\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400044#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the penalties she believes must apply where breaches of childcare regulations are detected; when she expects that said penalties will be introduced; if legislation is required; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[32348\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400044#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when she plans to introduce regulations for childminders including childminders in the home; if they will be included in the Children First legislation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[32344\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400044#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the action she has taken on cr&egrave;ches that are currently in breach of regulations in 2013; if they are to receive continued funding in 2013 if the breaches in regulations persist; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

These are issues which I am reviewing and will consider further in the coming months in the context of both the Early Years Strategy, which is being developed by my Department, and other amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 which are being considered.<\/p><p>  Childminders who are not subject to the Childcare Regulations are encouraged to voluntarily notify their service to their local City or County Childcare Committee.  Both notified and voluntarily notified childminders can avail of the Childminders Tax Exemption which exempts childminding earnings of up to &euro;15,000 from income tax. <\/p><p>  My Department is currently piloting a new School Age Childcare scheme in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection.  When fully operational, the scheme will provide 6,000 subsidised, after-school places for primary school children, to assist qualifying parents to avail of employment opportunities.  Eligibility for the scheme will be determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Parents qualifying under the scheme will be able to access after school childcare at a weekly cost of &euro;20.  My Department will subsidise each of these places with weekly payments of &euro;35 during term time and &euro;100 in school holidays.  Pending any change to the Child Care Act 1991 to extend regulatory control to after-school childcare, all services participating in the scheme will be subject to strict contractual requirements drawn up by my Department.<\/p><p>  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of Ireland's first ever Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to 6 years, is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector.  I expect work on the Strategy to be completed later this year and I will review the future regulation of childminders in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400044#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection Services","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400044#WRE01750"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[32356\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400044#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the horrific occurrence of child abuse catalogued by Women's Aid; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"954","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[32357\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400044#WRE01900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extra funding she will make available to women and children refuges and advocate groups on behalf of abused children.","asker":"954","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 53 together.<\/p><p>  The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which I published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect. It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. All child protection concerns should be reported in the appropriate manner, including those identified  where a child has been in a home where there was domestic abuse. <\/p><p>  Statutory responsibility for the delivery of child welfare and protection services rests with the HSE, which is the appropriate body to receive all reports of concerns relating to all forms of child abuse. Under Section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991, the Health Service Executive has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection. <\/p><p><b><i>Child Welfare and Protection Referrals and Assessment<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Once a referral has been made to the HSE Children and Family Services all cases are managed through a standardised business process. All reports of concern for the safety or well-being of a child are handled initially by the Duty\/Intake team for the purposes of assessment. All staff receiving such a referral are trained in the duty system and are obliged to treat seriously all child welfare and protection concerns whatever their source. Once a report has been made the screening stage deals with the information reported and preliminary enquiries are concerned with formulating an appropriate response. <\/p><p><b><i>Children First Legislation<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware the  Government is committed to putting aspects of Children First on a statutory basis. In this regard,  I published the Draft Heads and General Scheme for the Children First Bill 2012 in April last year and immediately referred the Heads of Bill to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for consideration and advice. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published their report in July 2012.<\/p><p>  As part of the Joint Committee's consultation process a number of submissions were received. Overall there was a welcome for the fact that the legislation would increase the focus on child protection.  The contributions in the main came from organisations already implementing Children First. The historic nature of the proposals and their implications for those providing services to children were acknowledged, as was the importance of the precise nature of the duties, responsibilities and sanctions contained in the legislation for successful implementation.<\/p><p>  Submissions were not all in agreement and many points emerging needed to be considered and reconciled.  This involves consideration of policy and operational issues, as well as the best legal approach to achieving Children First objectives. In this regard, officials within my Department have consulted with a number of organisations and individuals and I have met with a number of key stakeholders to discuss the complex issues that have arisen. I have also taken the opportunity to consult with a number of experts in relation to the development of the policy in this area. In addition, my Department commissioned a detailed academic study on key aspects of the relevant mandatory legislation in place in this area internationally. All of these factors are informing the preparation of enhanced policy proposals that is currently underway.  <\/p><p>  The framework is now focussed on the safety and protection of children generally; the provision of safe services for children; cooperation amongst professionals and organisations where children are at risk of neglect and abuse and finally mandating key individuals to report child abuse known to them. The latter objective is aimed at removing ambivalence, reluctance or refusal by people and organisations in positions of trust and authority to report child abuse and cooperate with the relevant authorities.<\/p><p>  I note that the vast majority of reports of abuse against children, reported in the Women's Aid Annual Report were in respect of emotional abuse. This is an issue that I take seriously and it is my intention that it is dealt with in the context of this legislation. It is my intention to submit further proposals in the form of a revised general scheme and Heads of Bill to Government as soon as possible with a view to the drafting of the Children First Bill as a priority.<\/p><p><b><i>New Child and Family Support Agency<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  The establishment of  the Child and Family Agency is central to the Government's reform programme in respect of child and family services.  In order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency will have a broader focus than child protection. Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic &amp;amp; care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.<\/p><p>  It is my intention that the new Agency will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many of the children and families with the most complex needs. At the same time, the Agency will have a role in supporting families - providing less complex, less intrusive and less expensive responses which have a preventive function. <\/p><p>  My Department does not provide funding  for women's refuges. However, from its establishment the child and family-related services for which the HSE currently has responsibility including pre-school inspections and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will transfer to the agency. <\/p><p>  The establishment of a single agency incorporating key children's services will provide a focus for the major reforms already underway within Children and Family Services.  The new Child and Family Support Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents one of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector of reform embarked upon by this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400044#WRE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":104,"content":"<p>Question No. 42 answered with Question No. 40.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[32584\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400044#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if the new national co-ordinator for the Children's Services Committees has taken up office as anticipated before the end of last month; if she will provide an up-to-date report on the development of the 16 CSCs already established; her plans to continue to establish CSCs where they are not currently in place; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

A Special Care Unit provides secure residential service to children and young people who are in need of specialised targeted intervention. Children are detained in special care if their behaviour is deemed to pose a risk to themselves. The detention, by order of the High Court of a child in a Special Care Unit is considered as a last resort, for as short a time as possible, and when other forms of residential or community care are considered to be unsuitable.

","asker":"1177","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication, by the HSE, of the 'A Review of Practice and Audit of the Management of Cases of Neglect'. The report was received by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in May 2013 and it was published on the HSE website two weeks ago.<\/p><p>  This report follows the publication, in October 2010, of the report of the Roscommon Child Care Inquiry, which catalogued a number of concerns arising from the examination of the management of systematic and problematic neglect in a family known to the HSE Child Protection Services.  The findings of the Inquiry raised concern that this might not have been an isolated case and that there might be more widespread practice and governance issues in the management of cases of neglect, both in Roscommon and throughout the country. <\/p><p>  This lead to work on a National Audit of neglect cases. From the outset, it was the intention of the HSE that the neglect audit would comprise a number of phases.  Therefore the audit was not simply a once off exercise but constitutes one element of a wider process to improve practice in relation to such cases across the country.<\/p><p>  For phase 1, the HSE commissioned the services of Ms Lynne Peyton, an Independent Consultant in Child Protection, to complete an initial pilot audit of the Roscommon cases.   This pilot was extended to two other local health areas, Waterford and Dublin South East.   This pilot phase [Phase 1] was conducted in early 2012 and this was worked on subsequent to completion.  The composite report, published two weeks, therefore represents the findings of the pilot phase; and is designed to inform a more significant National Audit of Neglect Cases.<\/p><p>  Since its completion this document has acted as an important working document informing preparations for Phases 2 and 3 of the process, namely, the workshops for staff and the National Audit of neglect files.  Last August, the attention of HSE social work staff was drawn to the on-going and systemic impact of neglect as identified in the three audits.<\/p><p>  However the report in itself does provide some key learning with respect to service improvements and in this regard the HSE, has developed an implementation plan to address the recommendations of the report. This has now happened, and the HSE have already demonstrated progress in relation to very many of those actions.<\/p><p>  In Roscommon: there have developments with respect to implementation of monthly child care meeting chaired by the General Manager; restructuring of Social Work Teams and the streamlining of Family Support Services to include a single point of entry for referrals. In addition, more than fifty staff in all relevant disciplines have participated in training on the Identification of Neglect.<\/p><p>  In Dublin South East the Social Work Department has been restructured and the new arrangements are working more effectively. There has been a blitz on the waiting list and unallocated cases have been significantly reduced and are constantly reviewed. New standard business processes including in relation initial assessments have been implemented and mew collaborative arrangements and joint training has been progressed between social work and a range of other disciplines including: child and adolescent mental health, speech &amp;amp; language therapy, psychology, etc.<\/p><p>  In Waterford, the pilot phase of audit has led to a substantive structural alteration of the deployment and governance of child protection services in Waterford. In addition new internal quality assurance arrangements have been introduced, including an increase in the frequency of staff supervision. <\/p><p>With respect to the general findings, I believe this audit contributes to greater awareness of neglect, highlighting the &quot;harsh reality of neglect&quot;.   <\/p><p>  The Audit found that parental alcohol misuse was a factor in 62% of families in the overall sample; and states that &quot;family dysfunction was often associated to chronic alcohol and drug misuse&quot;.<\/p><p>  The Audit further found that<\/p><p>- domestic violence was a reported feature in almost two thirds of the sample cases;<\/p><p>- parental mental health issues also featured in approximately 2 thirds of the Dublin;<\/p><p>- standards of hygiene and physical conditions were unacceptable in more than half of the cases; and<\/p><p>- non-attendance at medical and other specialist appointments with speech and language therapists, psychology and CAMHs was a feature.<\/p><p>  The audit highlights how referrals of neglect cases in Roscommon &amp;amp; Waterford have tripled in the period 2005-2009. On a positive note, the audit found that &quot;emphasis on providing Children First training ... was paying off in terms of appropriate referrals&quot;.<\/p><p>  However the Audit did find that there was too much variation and inconsistency across local areas. I believe that establishment of the dedicated new Child &amp;amp; Family Agency represents an essential response to this. At heart of new Agency will be a new Quality Framework, led by a newly-appointed Head of Quality.<\/p><p>  In relation to the specific issue of responses to referrals relating to neglect, a very significant body of work has been underway, in tandem with establishment of the Child &amp;amp; Family Agency to develop new standardised models for referral and assessment.<\/p><p>  Instead of prioritising abuse cases to the detriment of neglect cases, the new models, which have been subject to a number of pilot projects throughout the country, seek to differentiate of child protection and child welfare cases with a view to ensuring timely and proportionate responses to each.<\/p><p>  A new model for family-based, multi-agency assessment and early intervention known as 'Meitheal' has already been trialled in two regions (Sligo\/Leitrim and Donegal and in Limerick) and is being mainstreamed as part of the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency.<\/p><p>  In addition, under the agency&rsquo;s new Service Delivery Framework, work is at an advanced stage on the development of what are to be known as Local Area Pathways, which are with be local networks of statutory and NGO providers, which will be in position to respond immediately to child welfare referrals, including cases of neglect; by providing a range of services to multi-disciplinary services, including family support.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, I look forward to the conduct of the national audit and the ongoing work on establishment of the new Agency and accompanying reforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400045#WRF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[32347\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400045#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the progress to date on implementing the recommendations in the report on the Roscommon child care case; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

I also put in place the required funding package for the major capital development of the Oberstown facilities. My officials have, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, completed the design process and secured planning permission for the capital development.  The tender process is ongoing at present and this is being overseen by a steering group of officials from my Department and the Office of Public Works.  A further announcement on the outcome of the tendering process will be made shortly.  The introduction of expanded detention facilities in Oberstown will also be accompanied by a proportionate increase in staffing resources.  While the full extent of these additional resources has yet to be finalised pending the award of the Oberstown project, the aim is to begin the recruitment process in 2013 with a view for staff to be on campus in 2014 and ready to open the first of the new units by mid 2014.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that staff working in this area must have the necessary training and supports in order to fully implement the child care model of detention.

There is significant international evidence of the benefits for children's outcomes of the provision of quality education and childcare in the earliest years.  Investment in early childhood care and education benefits not only the individual child but also the future development of the wider economy.  I am also aware of the important economic contribution that childcare services provide through direct employment of staff in service delivery and through support for labour participation on the part of working parents. <\/p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which is currently being developed by my Department, will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years.  It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, including physical and mental development, vaccination programmes and population health issues such as nutrition and exercise, as well as parenting and  family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education.  The Strategy will further recognise the economic imperative and benefits accruing from targeted investment in early years interventions.<\/p><p>  I was successful in securing &euro;2.75m in capital funding in Budget 2013 to support the ongoing improvement of the childcare sector via the 2013 Childcare Capital Programme.  This programme is being implemented by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  Both community not-for-profit childcare facilities and private childcare facilities currently participating in one of the three childcare programmes implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs were eligible to apply for a grant under the Programme.  The application process for funding under the programme has now been concluded and applicants will be advised of the outcome in the very near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400045#WRF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Budgets","counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400045#WRF01250"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[32599\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400045#WRF01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her priorities for Budget 2014; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":130,"content":"<p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs was set up to drive the delivery of key commitments in relation to children and young people.

At this time, custodial accommodation for those under 18 years is provided on the Oberstown campus, Lusk, Co Dublin and in St Patrick's Institution, Dublin 7.  The Oberstown campus accommodates boys aged up to 17 years old and girls up to 18 years of age.  Accommodation is currently provided for 17 year old boys in St Patrick's Institution, Dublin 7 which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>  The legal detention capacity of the Oberstown campus comprises 24 male bed spaces in Trinity House School, 8 female bed spaces in Oberstown Girls School, and 20 male bed spaces in Oberstown Boys School.

The Irish Youth Justice Service, which is based in my Department, is currently in discussions with management and staff on the Oberstown campus on an initiative to reorganise the detention capacity for males and female bed places, in order to meet the increased demand for male bed places from the courts.  This is being progressed so as to achieve its earliest possible commencement.  <\/p><p>  With regard to future accommodation, on 2 April 2012 I announced a capital investment package for the National Children Detention Facility project in Oberstown.

I have outlined my commitment to this project on many different occasions and it remains at the top of my agenda.

The tender process is ongoing at present and this is being overseen by a steering group of officials from my Department and the Office of Public Works.  A further announcement on the outcome of the tendering process will be made shortly.  The new facilities will increase the capacity on the campus available to the courts from the current maximum capacity of 52 places to 90 places.

A number of serious concerns were raised throughout the report and in its conclusions.  The HSE was given an opportunity to respond to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report, and those responses are reflected throughout, including in the recommendations section.  The HSE indicated they were firmly of the view that at no time either previously or currently has there been Immediate or Priority 1 cases left unattended to, and that at all times these cases are receiving a service and depending on their ranking will either receive a service within 24 hours or within 7 days.  In relation to Priority 2 cases, HSE South advised that the necessary network checks are completed when there is capacity within the team to deal with same. At no time are these cases left unscreened as review has taken place by the Team Leader.  In relation to screening of duty referrals the HSE advised the Ombudsman that all referrals received are recorded by a Social Worker, the intake record is completed and more clarifying information is sought if possible from the Gardai, other HSE personnel\/agencies or the referrer.  Any case that warrants immediate attention is discussed immediately with the Team Leader or any on site manager.  Overall, HSE National concluded that the area was aware and taking steps to address the issues raised.  A decision was made to keep the area under review which occurs at senior management meetings with the National Director and Regional Managers.  It should be noted that the level of social work service required will vary greatly, depending on the circumstances of each case, and this can put a high degree of pressure on the overall social work resource.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman made recommendations in respect of external audit, monitoring of referrals and review of unallocated cases, HSE procedure for management and assurance of child protection cases by file audit, clarification of child protection procedures, social work caseload, public accountability and recording of professional activity.  HSE responses to these recommendations include:<\/p><p>- During the course of the Ombudsman investigation, the HIQA commenced its inspection of child protection services. The North Lee area fully co-operated with a targeted HIQA inspection, and a report of this inspection is awaited;<\/p><p>- A review of cases in North Lee is under way as recommended by the Ombudsman;<\/p><p>- Referral levels and resource capacity are to be reviewed on a monthly basis;<\/p><p>- A national audit of cases in social work services has commenced;<\/p><p>- Practice guidance has been clarified in the HSE&rsquo;s Child Welfare and Protection Practice Handbook;<\/p><p>- The HSE is actively monitoring areas where there are growing caseloads and waiting lists in order that these areas can be supported;<\/p><p>- Progress continues to be made in respect of the National Childcare Information System going live next year.<\/p><p>  More generally, reform of the social work service is an ongoing priority process within HSE Children and Families, and this will continue when the new Child and Family Agency is established.  Work is under way to ensure that all areas work to a national policy on review of cases awaiting allocation.  Where immediate actions are needed to safeguard a child the duty social work team provide the service.  For instance where a child needs to come into care, or where an assessment is deemed a priority or a case conference is required, the duty social work team undertake this work.  The HSE has rolled out the Standardised Business Process and is bedding it down across the 17 areas to make sure services are provided on the basis of a consistent assessment and categorisation of risk.  The recently commenced inspection of child protection services by HIQA will assist in the identification of areas where improvement is required and in time will support safer systems for children at risk.  It is important to note, as has been highlighted in other reports, the number of referrals in respect of welfare has increased substantially in recent years.  What has also been highlighted is the challenge of understanding fully and responding to welfare concerns underneath which may lie more serious neglect issues.  What is critical is the support of those reporting concerns to give as much information as is possible to ensure a 'complete' picture and to ensure that the persistence and ongoing nature of concerns is clear to the HSE.  If this is highlighted quickly where necessary the child's case can be escalated to the appropriate level of priority.  The new prioritisation system provides not only assignment to a priority category on intake of a referral, but a review of individual prioritisation by Principal Social Workers on an ongoing basis, as well as an overall assessment of numbers and levels of prioritisation across the area and across the country to ensure consistency of approach and to identify areas of high pressure.  The Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report is important, and once again a range of service delivery issues have been highlighted. Improvements to the social work services, and integration of these services with a range of other child and family services, continue to be a high priority for the CEO designate of the Child and Family Agency, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, and his senior management team.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400046#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400046#WRG00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation Issues","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400046#WRG00450"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[32630\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400046#WRG00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will outline the status of Military Attach&eacute;s to foreign embassies and Governments here, either on a resident or non-resident basis; if he will outline in tabular form the current list of nations that have Military Attach&eacute;s here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>Members of diplomatic missions to Ireland are appointed in accordance with the terms of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961, as given effect in Irish law by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967, as amended.

The provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, separated out these distinct functions to constitute the two separate formations of the Council which exist today &ndash; the Foreign Affairs Council and the General Affairs Council.  The Treaty on European Union (Article 16) confers on the GAC two primary functions: first, to \"ensure consistency in the work of the different Council configurations\"; and to &ldquo;prepare and ensure the follow-up to meetings of the European Council&rdquo;.  The GAC thus has a cross-cutting coordination role among the various formations of the Council and it endeavours to do this, most evidently, through its role in preparing for and ensuring the follow-up to meetings of the European Council.  The GAC is chaired by the rotating Presidency, which over the last six months, has been undertaken by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Article 16 in the Treaty on European Union separately confers on the FAC two primary functions: first, to \"elaborate the Union&rsquo;s external action on the basis of strategic guidelines laid down by the European Council\"; and to \"ensure that the Union&rsquo;s action is consistent\".<\/p><p>  The FAC deals with the EU's external action, including common foreign and security policy, development cooperation and trade.

The FAC, along with its chair the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, is also tasked under the Treaties with ensuring the unity, consistency and effectiveness of action by the Union.  The FAC and GAC formations of the Council each undertake substantive and distinct bodies of work.  The only overlap of note that occurs between the two relates primarily to the GAC&rsquo;s role in preparing the work of the European Council, which by definition draws upon and engages with the work of many other Council formations, including that of the FAC.

It applies to a residential property which is not used as the owner&rsquo;s sole or main residence, with limited exemptions.

The Government did not accept this recommendation.  The NPPR Charge will be collected in 2013, when a half-year LPT applies, but will be discontinued thereafter.

Coverage levels and the scope of Deposit Guarantee Schemes have been harmonised across the EU since 2009.<\/p><p>  In the event of a credit institution being unable to repay deposits, the Central Bank is currently authorized to make compensation payments to eligible depositors to a maximum of &euro;100,000 per person per institution. <\/p><p>  The Deposit Guarantee Scheme is funded by a charge on the credit institutions participating in the scheme. The cost of compensation payments is met from the balances in the Deposit Protection Account. In the event of the Deposit Protection Account being insufficient to fund a compensation event, any difference is made up using advances from the Central Bank or the State; the remaining participating institutions are then responsible for the repayment of these advances.<\/p><p>  The Deposit Guarantee Scheme initially covered deposits up to &euro;20,000. The coverage level of &euro;20,000 was revised, initially by a statement by the Minister for Finance on 20 September 2008 and subsequently under the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009, to increase the coverage to &euro;100,000 per person per institution.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland advises me that it does not have data on the potential exposure as at 2008. While it had figures on the total deposits held by financial institutions in 2008, it did not have the technical capacity or powers to provide the information in this way. This matter has since been addressed in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011. <\/p><p>  As no compensation events occurred in 2008, it was not necessary to draw down from the Deposit Guarantee Scheme in 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400049#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Guarantee Scheme Liabilities","counter":248,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400049#WRK01050"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[32737\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400049#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated potential exposure to the State in 2008 broken down between deposits, tier-one bonds and subordinated bonds arising from the blanket guarantee given at the end of September 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down's syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability\/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down's syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability.  Pupils with Down's syndrome who have care needs may also receive access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support.  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupil's disability categorisation. <\/p><p>  I wish to explain to the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down's syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools.  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.  The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down's syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. <\/p><p>  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down's syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process.  In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.<\/p><p>  In the course of my recent meeting with Down Syndrome Ireland a number of issues were raised which I consider merit further examination.

It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.

It sets the overall capital investment framework and the basic principles to be observed for the appraisal, assessment, procurement and evaluation of projects. It does not have a direct role in delivering individual projects (either PPP or traditional Exchequer capital projects). This is primarily the responsibility of the Sponsoring Department\/Agency.   All spending Departments must comply with the new Public Spending Code which draws together all of the standard guidance for assessing, reviewing and appraising public expenditure programmes &ndash; current as well as capital &ndash; in the public service. The Code highlights the need to revise appraisals if there are time lapses, changes in circumstances or significant additional costs involved in projects. In particular, Cost Benefit Analyses (CBAs) for capital projects should be reviewed at key stages to make sure the project is still justified. The Code also states, in relation to CBAs, that a final reassessment of demand and costs should be undertaken if there is a significant time lag between the appraisal and commissioning of the project.<\/p><p>  Additionally, a full suite of guidance material has been published to facilitate the PPP process.   This guidance dovetails with the Public Spending Code but also includes specific technical tools to evaluate PPP proposals and tenders.  The key aspects of the guidance relate to the assessment of projects for procurement as PPP, the compilation of the public sector benchmark and ensuring value for money through the PPP process. There are a number of specific tests throughout the procurement and tender negotiation processes to ensure that best value is derived for the State.  Details of the timing and content of these value for money tests are set out in the various PPP guidance issued by my Department which are available at www.ppp.gov.ie. <\/p><p>  In accordance with the guidance issued by my Department, the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) has the role of providing an opinion to the Sponsoring Agency in relation to the value for money testing on a PPP project.

NDFA later wrote to Dublin City Council in March 2012 to clarify that the previously issued NDFA value for money opinion of June 2007 was no longer valid as this opinion was based on the original contractual arrangements which had since changed. The NDFA has been requested by Dublin City Council to provide an opinion on an updated value for money test and this will be undertaken once the Public Sector Benchmark and all of the supporting documentation is completed, finalised and submitted to the NDFA for consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400053#WRO00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Bodies Membership","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400053#WRO00350"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[32815\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400053#WRO00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will outline each international organisation, international agency or international body that Ireland is a member of that his Department or a State body or agency under the aegis of his Department is responsible for or co-responsible for; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":360,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question the following is a list of each international organisation, international agency or international body that Ireland is a member of that my Department or agencies under my remit is responsible or co-responsible for:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Department \/ Office<\/th><th>Name<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Public  Expenditure  and  Reform<\/td><td>European  Institute of Public  Administration (EIPA) based in Maastricht<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400053#WRO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400053#WRO00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bullying in the Workplace","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400053#WRO00550"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[32616\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400053#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the provisions in the Health, Safety and Work Act, and associated legislative instruments, relating to risk analyses are robust enough to protect employees from cyber bullying; if the changes in the legislation are required to reflect developments in the area of access to social media and information technology in the workplace; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 every employer has a duty, to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare of their employees and to manage and conduct work activities in such a way so as to prevent, as far as is reasonably practicable, any improper conduct or behaviour likely to put the safety, health or welfare of their employees at work at risk. The provisions in this Act do not specifically identify all possible workplace hazards as to do so would be impractical. However, the Act requires employers, where they know of, or can reasonably be expected to know of, a workplace hazard that is impacting on the safety, health or welfare of an employee or group of employees, to act reasonably in terms of assessing the risk, and putting in place control measures. <\/p><p>  Under section 19 of the Act an employer is required to carry out and maintain a written risk assessment to identify all potential hazards that may occur in a workplace under their control. Under section 20 the employer is required to ensure that all identified potential hazards and all protective and preventative measures taken are recorded in their safety statement. This statement also identifies the duties of employees in respect to the safety, health and welfare of all persons within the workplace.<\/p><p>  Similarly, the 2005 Act also places obligations on employees in relation to their duties not to engage in improper conduct or behaviour likely to endanger their own safety, health and welfare at work or that of any other person. <\/p><p>  Under the 2005 Act, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has published a Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work, and this is aimed at preventing and dealing with all bullying where it happens in Irish workplaces. <\/p><p>  The Code of Practice defines bullying as repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the place of work and\/or in the course of employment, which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual's right to dignity at work. <\/p><p>  The Code also reflects the legal requirement that employers carry out a risk assessment, and where bullying is identified as a hazard, they ensure that it is included in the safety statement.  The Code gives guidance on how to identify and assess if bullying is a hazard at work as well as on how to prepare a Bullying Prevention Policy. <\/p><p>  The purpose of an effective policy is not simply to prevent improper conduct and behaviour but also to encourage best practice and a safe and harmonious workplace where such behaviour is unlikely to occur. Employers should therefore adopt, implement and monitor a comprehensive, effective and accessible policy on bullying, at work.  This would include cyber-bullying.<\/p><p>  The Code of Practice also states that the scope of an employer's Bullying Prevention Policy should state that the protection of the policy should extend beyond the place of work to off-site work activities and to work-related social events.<\/p><p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work state the clear requirements for all employers to have a stated, clear and enforceable policy and procedures which they consistently apply, regarding the access to, use of, and penalties for miss-use of, company property including computers and the software systems used whilst employees are working or in the course of employment. All employees should be made aware of these requirements, and sign off on the duties which they must uphold.<\/p><p>  The role of the HSA under the Code is to monitor if employers and employees are meeting their obligations and duty of care under the 2005 Act. The Code of Practice is available for free download at . <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 in addition to the Health and Safety Authority's Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work provide a robust regime to protect employees from bullying, including cyber bullying, in the workplace. Consequently I have no plans for legislative change in this area at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400053#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Ireland Funding","counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400053#WRO00750"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[32629\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400053#WRO00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will outline specific grants that are available to businesses wishing to expand; if there are particular sections within Enterprise Ireland that a business could contact; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":366,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland offers a range of financial and non-financial supports to assist clients through all stages of the business development cycle.

When the Treaty comes into effect, it will harmonize limitations and exceptions that apply in the contracting states so that these organizations can operate across borders.  This sharing of works in accessible formats should increase the overall number of works available to persons in need of the works in accessible formats.  For instance, instead of five countries producing accessible versions of the same work, it would be possible for the five countries to instead produce an accessible version of a different work, which could then be shared with each of the other countries.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The treaty is also designed to provide assurances to authors and publishers that the system will not expose their published works to misuse or distribution to anyone other than the intended beneficiaries. It therefore reiterates the requirement that the cross-border sharing of works created, based on limitations and exceptions, must be limited to certain special cases which do not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonable prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  <\/font>The Treaty will be open for signature at the headquarters of WIPO by any eligible party for one year after its adoption.  It will <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">enter into force after it has been ratified by twenty WIPO contracting States.

Contrary to the view put forward in the correspondence referred to in the question, the new arrangements will not have a detrimental effect on local development services. Rather the establishment of Socio-Economic Committees in each local authority area will facilitate a more strategic, joined-up approach to local and community development locally. Socio-Economic Committees will bring key local and community development actors together in partnership, with a focus on outcomes rather than organisational boundaries , thus enabling collaborative leadership at local level and, ultimately, improving services for citizens and communities.<\/p><p>  The implementation of the alignment recommendations is being brought forward in a spirit of partnership and co-operation. An Alignment Working Group is advising and assisting my Department on the practical arrangements necessary to give effect to the new Socio-Economic Committees.  It comprises representatives from both the local government and local development sectors and is making good progress.<\/p><p><i>Putting People First<\/i> envisages an enhanced role for local government in local and community development. There is, however, no intention to undermine the expertise and staffing of local development companies. The aim is to facilitate a joint consideration locally as to how available resources might be deployed through more collaborative and co-ordinated approaches, supported by a reformed and enhanced local government sector.  As key partners on the Socio-Economic Committees, local development companies will continue to have an important role in the delivery of programmes for which they are contracted by my Department and others. Independent of alignment reforms, however, the level of funding for local development programmes is a key issue for implementing bodies, and this remains to be decided as part of the Government's estimates process and in the context of EU budgets.<\/p><p>  Our local development system delivers a broad range of local services for citizens and communities. Within the context of increasing pressure on available resources, we need to focus on maintaining these services at the frontline while ensuring that the system continues to be sustainable. The 2010 European Court of Auditors Report on LEADER, while acknowledging good practices in Ireland's management of the 2000-06 LEADER programme for example, highlighted the significant additional administration funding provided by the Irish Exchequer to LEADER companies mid-programme to ensure continued delivery of the programme. This was accompanied by a significant amount of 'interim funding' that was also provided by the Irish Exchequer to ensure the continued operation of LEADER companies in the period between the last two programming rounds.<\/p><p>  We are operating in a much changed economic context. The level of LEADER administration funding available under the next Rural Development Programme may be much reduced; and we can no longer afford the additional administration resources that may have been provided previously. More effective, efficient and joined-up approaches to service delivery are needed if we are to ensure the sustain ability of our local development system. I am confident that the reforms we are bringing forward can do this and that, as a result, we will be able to continue deliver high quality services for our citizens and communities into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400056#WRR02300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hedge and Tree Height Restrictions","counter":458,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400056#WRR02350"},{"type":"question","counter":459,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[32609\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400056#WRR02500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if there are plans to introduce height restrictions on hedges and trees in private dwellings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":460,"content":"<p>There is no legislation in Ireland regulating the height of trees and hedges.

Every housing authority has a statutory duty to adopt and review an anti-social behaviour strategy for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in its housing stock, which must provide for co-operation with other relevant bodies, notably the Garda&iacute; .

The 2004 Act also empowers a third party adversely affected by anti-social behaviour to   make a complaint to the PRTB against a landlord who has failed to enforce tenant obligations.   The Act allows the Board to furnish the name and address of the landlord concerned to a person who proposes to make such a complaint.

This shows a year on year increase of 4% in the number of victims helped. <\/p><p>  However, I am informed that in 2012 approximately &euro;16.1m in funding of NGOs working to provide services to women and children experiencing domestic violence was provided by the HSE (Children and Families Service), working under the aegis of the Department of Health. This work is expected to be transferred to the Child and Family Support Agency on its establishment. I understand that the new agency will report directly to my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400059#WRU02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting Applications","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400059#WRU02500"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[32671\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400059#WRU02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when Garda clearance will be issued to three persons to work for an organisation (details supplied) in County Offaly who are waiting one month for Garda clearance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":558,"content":"<p>I am awaiting the information sought from the Garda authorities and will communicate with the Deputy as soon as the information is to hand.<b><font color=\"#000080\">   <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400059#WRU02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[32672\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400059#WRU02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when Garda clearance will be issued to three persons to work for an organisation (details supplied) in County Offaly who are waiting five months for Garda clearance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p> I am awaiting the information sought from the Garda authorities and will communicate with the Deputy as soon as the information is to hand.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400059#WRU03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[32675\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400060#WRV00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when a decision will be made on an application for Garda vetting in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1067","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a vetting application on behalf of the individual referred to by the Deputy was received by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) on 27 June 2013.

By this definition, the vast majority of Travellers\/Roma in the Irish State are indigenous Irish Travellers. <\/p><p>  Ireland's National Traveller\/Roma Strategy was developed following a  communication from the EU Commission entitled &ldquo;An EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies&quot; (April 2011) which requested that member states would, in proportion to the size of the Roma population living in their territories and taking into account their different starting points, adopt or develop further a comprehensive approach to Roma integration.This document thus includes relevant strategies that already exist in the four crucial areas  of education, employment, healthcare and housing.  It also mentions initiatives in place in the same areas to assist the Roma community who are citizens of the European Economic Area and are legally resident in the country.  It should be noted that Traveller representatives are active participants on National Committees dealing with policy in all four areas mentioned by the Deputy and, in this way, were involved in the development of these policies.

At this time, custodial accommodation for under 18 year olds is provided on the Oberstown campus, Lusk, Co Dublin and in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, Dublin 7.  The Oberstown campus accommodates boys aged up to 17 years old and girls up to 18 years of age.  Accommodation is currently provided for 17 year old boys in St Patrick's Institution, Dublin 7 which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In light of the independent inspections by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and the continuing work of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) and the Oberstown Board of Management, I am confident that the children detention schools do provide safe and reliable accommodation for the detention of young people. <\/p><p>  The legal detention capacity of the Oberstown campus comprises 24 male bed spaces in Trinity House School, 8 female bed spaces in Oberstown Girls School, and 20 male bed spaces in Oberstown Boys School. However, only 16 of the certified 24 male bed spaces in Trinity House School are currently available for use due to staffing shortages.  The Irish Youth Justice Service, which is based in my Department, is currently in discussions with management and staff on the Oberstown campus on an initiative to reorganise the detention capacity for males and female bed places, in order to meet the increased demand for male bed places from the courts.  This is being progressed so as to achieve its earliest possible commencement.<\/p><p>  With regard to future accommodation needs, on 2 April 2012 I announced a capital investment package for the National Children Detention Facility project in Oberstown.  This project is required in order to give effect to the Programme for Government commitment to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.  I have outlined my commitment to this project on many different occasions and it remains at the top of my agenda. My officials have, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, completed the design process and secured planning permission for the capital development.  The tender process is ongoing at present and this is being overseen by a steering group of officials from my Department and the Office of Public Works.  A further announcement on the outcome of the tendering process will be made shortly.  The new facilities will increase the capacity on the campus available to the courts from the current maximum capacity of 52 places to 90 places.  I am advised that based on recent trends, this should be sufficient to meet the requirements of the courts for children detention places.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400063#WRY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Support Services","counter":676,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400063#WRY01450"},{"type":"question","counter":677,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[32830\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400063#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she is satisfied regarding the availability of adequate resources to meet all aspects of children&rsquo;s support services deemed to be the responsibility of her Department, the degree to which she has identified any areas most sensitively in need of enhanced service at this time; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The training is based on the resource Mindout which was developed by Health Promotion HSE West and NUI Galway. MindOut is a twelve session mental health programme which takes a positive approach to the promotion of emotional and mental health among young people, looking at the ways they cope ranging from personal coping skills to informal networks of support to professional or voluntary support services.

The development of the Children and Young People's Policy Framework as the overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State, is an important initiative for cross departmental collaboration to secure this objective.  Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are priorities to enhance children's opportunities for social and educational development and to support parents undertaking training and participating in employment. The network of 107 family resource centres that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department have an important role in this regard. <\/p><p>  Tackling child poverty is a priority for Government and a goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007- 2016, coordinated by the Department of Social Protection. Children are more likely to be poor if they are living in lone parent households with low labour market participation and dependant on income support. The Departments of Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills, are working to deliver a range of measures aimed at getting people back to work. My Department is supporting labour activation measures through initiatives such as the School Age Childcare scheme which will provide 6,000 subsidised, after-school places to primary school children of qualifying parents entering employment.<\/p><p>  My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection in a 'whole of Government approach' to tackling poverty in the population and is represented on the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare which is examining issues to do with the interactions of the tax and welfare systems so that they provide good incentives for parents to take up and remain in work and thereby contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty, in particular. Following a review of the national social target for poverty reduction, which provides a key reference point for Government policies and offers a tangible benchmark against which to measure social and economic progress, the Government agreed to set a new sub-target for the reduction of child poverty.  This is in recognition of the life-long consequences of child poverty and the damaging effects of inter-generational poverty.  The sub-target will take account of the importance of income supports, services and parental access to employment.  The overriding objective for the Government is to increase employment, promote activation, skills training and education.  This will ultimately help to build real and sustainable economic growth and to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society. <\/p><p>The Minister for Housing &amp;amp; Planning, Jan O Sullivan TD recently published a <i>Homelessness Policy Statement<\/i> which outlines the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016. The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness. The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness. When publishing the statement Minister O'Sullivan announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed. These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.    With regard to my own responsibility, my priority, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Agency.  <\/p><p>  In addition, my Department has been given lead responsibility for implementing a new Area-Based Approach to Child Poverty programme during 2013-2016.

","asker":"1104","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":705,"content":"<p>Since the broadcast of the Prime Time programme, my Department has received a large volume of correspondence in relation to the events outlined in the programme.  I recently announced a number of measures as part of my response to the distressing events highlighted in the programme.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  It is my intention to introduce new qualification requirements for the sector starting in September 2014.  This will be an important new development as, at present, staff working in childcare services other than under the ECCE programme, are not subject to any requirement in respect of qualifications.<\/p><p>  The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme introduced the first-ever requirement for minimum qualifications for staff working in the childcare sector.  The current requirement under the programme is that the pre-school leader delivering the pre-school provision must hold a qualification in childcare\/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ), or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare\/early education field.  A higher capitation rate is payable to services where all of the pre-school leaders hold a bachelor degree in childhood\/early education (minimum of Level 7 on the NFQ) and have three years experience working in the sector, and where all of the pre-school assistants hold a relevant major award in childcare\/early education at Level 5 on the NFQ.<\/p><p>  I have indicated my intention to increase the qualification requirements for all staff working in pre-school services.  The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. <\/p><p>  Pre-school services are governed by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006 as provided in the Child Care Act 1991. Under the Regulations the Health Service Executive has responsibility for the inspection of services and the enforcement of the regulations. Inspection is carried out to monitor compliance with the Regulations thereby ensuring the health, safety and welfare of children and the promotion of their development.   <\/p><p>As I have outlined in recent weeks, a number of steps are being taken to improve the current inspection system.  These include the introduction of National Quality Standards for pre-school services later this year as part of the inspection process.  In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance vis a vis minor breaches and full compliance.    My Department is also undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (Pre-school) Regulations, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  <\/p><p>  My Department is currently developing a new Children and Young People's Policy Framework which will set out high level goals for both my own and other Departments for the next five years. The Policy Framework is expected to be published later this year and will build on Our Children - Their Lives, Ireland's first Children's Strategy which was published in 2000. This is relevant to the Early Years Strategy as the Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework.<\/p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is under development. It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education. The Strategy will further recognise the economic imperative and benefits accruing from targeted investment in early years interventions.  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector.<\/p><p>  The results of a public consultation, undertaken as part of the development of the Children and Young People Policy Framework, is currently being analysed and will inform both the Framework and the Early Years Strategy.   I expect the Early Years Strategy to be published before the end of the year. <\/p><p>  Officials in my Department are continuing to examine the many proposals and suggestions submitted by those concerned by the revelations in the Prime Time broadcast.  These contributions will be considered as part of a comprehensive response to the events highlighted in the programme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400064#WRZ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":707,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400064#WRZ01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Blind Welfare Allowance","counter":706,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400064#WRZ01250"},{"type":"question","counter":707,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[32709\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400064#WRZ01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding arrears of blind welfare allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; when payment will be granted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":708,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400064#WRZ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":709,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400064#WRZ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":710,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[32622\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400064#WRZ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a medical card will be awarded under EU regulations to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1015","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":755,"content":"<p>Data from the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service Statistical Report for 2011 indicates that statins cost approximately &euro;104 million (excluding dispensing fees and mark-up) across the Community Drugs Schemes (GMS, DPS and LTI) in 2011. This represents a 40% reduction from the corresponding figure of approximately &euro;146 million in 2008 and reflects the ongoing impact of cost containment measures implemented in recent years.<\/p><p>  Preliminary figures indicate a further reduction, of approximately 3%, in expenditure on statins for 2012.  Further reductions are anticipated for 2013 due to all statins now being off patent and the impact of additional price reductions associated with agreements reached with the pharmaceutical industry in late 2012. <\/p><p>While the recently published ESRI report <i>Pharmaceutical Prices, Prescribing Practices and Usage of Generics in a Comparative Context,<\/i> finds that prices for originator in-patent and generic medicines are higher in Ireland compared to other EU Member States, the ongoing programme of reforms introduced by the State to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure will have a significant impact on the cost of medicines in this country.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013 and the average cost per reimbursed item is now running at 2001\/2002 levels.<\/p><p>  The HSE's Medicines Management Programme has recently, for the first time, identified 'preferred drugs' for prescribers when prescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or statin medication for patients. The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin. The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15 million for the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, will further promote price competition, a greater use of generics and deliver lower medicine prices for the taxpayer and for patient.  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. My Department requested the IMB to prioritise the assessment of medicines which are of the greatest cost and a list of 20 such medicines has been prepared. Atorvastatin products are the first on the list for assessment and it is anticipated that the first   List of Interchangeable Medicines containing groups of atorvastatin products will be published in mid-August. At that stage prices of atorvastatin products will fall by 20% as provided for under the current agreement with generic manufacturers. The HSE will then set a reference price for each group of products resulting in further price reductions for atorvastatin products. It is anticipated that the first reference price will be implemented by November 2013. <\/p><p>  I am confident that these reforms will result in generic prices in Ireland moving towards European norms over the next year.<\/p><p>  Statins are one of the most cost-effective drug therapies available and the value for money associated with these drugs will be even greater due to the ongoing price reductions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400066#WRBB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"question","counter":757,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[32796\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070400066#WRBB00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to rank by price the amount the State spends, or subsidises by tax relief on prescribed medication and or prescription refunds, on the top ten prescribed drugs.
