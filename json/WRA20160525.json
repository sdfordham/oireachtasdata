Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 18.0% in April 2016 (as estimated by CSO), compared to 21.0% in April 2015 and a peak of over 31% in 2012.  The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 4.7% in Q4 2015.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 54.5% of all those unemployed, down from almost 61% in early 2012.  Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate the young unemployed and long-term unemployed back into work.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014). <\/p><p>As under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes, and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee as envisaged in the relevant EU Recommendation, the main approach in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed.  The objective is to ensure that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU council recommendation. <\/p><p>The key objective is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs. In this regard there is monthly engagement with young people by case officers to assist young people to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  As part of this process additional supports may be provided, both through existing schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015. <\/p><p><i>Pathways to Work <\/i>2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and additionally commits to: increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.<\/p><p>A range of measures were introduced under previous <i>Pathways to Work <\/i>strategies for the long-term unemployed.  This included a structured process of engagement with long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact); wage subsidies in JobsPlus; the roll-out of a payment-by-results contracted employment services in JobPath, to provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers; and reserved places for the long-term unemployed on a range of Further Education and Training (FET) and public employment programmes.<i><\/i>A core focus of <i>Pathways to Work <\/i>2016-2020 is on consolidating and improving the quality and consistency of reforms undertaken in previous strategies, with continued prioritisation of those long-term unemployed.  I am satisfied these measures will help to address youth and long-term unemployment.<\/p><p>Finally, a rolling programme of evaluations has been implemented under <i>Pathways to Work 2015 <\/i>together with regular jobseeker customer satisfaction surveys<i>.  <\/i>Evaluations of JobBridge, of Intreo process reforms and of BTWEA are currently being conducted.  Other programmes and processes will be evaluated throughout the period of the current <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>.  Any changes to schemes will be considered in the light of the findings of these evaluations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500064#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":44,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 48 and 49 answered with Question No. 46.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500065#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[11710\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500065#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his plans to revise and increase rent supplement, given the huge increase in family homelessness since the beginning of 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[11643\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500065#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to make the rent allowance scheme available to low-paid workers in order to ensure tenancy sustainment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[11647\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500065#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when he will increase the limits under the rent supplement scheme by 15%; his research on ascertaining the level of top-ups being paid by tenants to landlords charging in excess of the limits under the scheme; the consequences for such landlords; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 53 and 60 together.<\/p><p>Supports in relation to housing and the provision of financial supports, such as the rent supplement scheme currently supporting some 56,800 recipients at a cost of &euro;267 million in 2016, are a priority for Government and are being considered by the Cabinet Committee on Housing in the context of the Programme for Government housing commitments.

As part of this strategy, the Department is engaged in the delivery of integrated Intreo centres, which provide a full range of services, including the CWS, generally available in one location. Where the CWS has been restructured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.

Significant improvements in claim processing, through the development of an integrated decisions model has considerably reduced dependence on supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) by people awaiting decisions on their primary social welfare claims.

Access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education and employment support services is essential to facilitate lone parents to progress into sustainable employment and financial independence.   <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2016 contained a number of measures to support lone parents, including working lone parents.

Decision-making responsibility remains with the person.  A person can also appoint a trusted family member or friend as a co-decision-maker to make decisions jointly with him or her under a co-decision-making agreement.  Decision-making responsibility is shared jointly between the person and the co-decision-maker.  For the small minority of people who are not able to make decisions even with help, the Act provides for the Circuit Court to appoint a decision-making representative.  A decision-making representative will make decisions on behalf of the person but must abide by the guiding principles and must reflect the person&rsquo;s will and preferences where possible.  The Act also provides for forward planning with enduring powers of attorney and advance healthcare directives that allow someone with capacity to plan ahead for circumstances in which they may not have capacity in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) which was published in conjunction with the Bill in 2013 indicated that the cost of implementation of the Act would be approximately &euro;1.13 million per annum.

A commitment was given in the Oireachtas that the issue of extending the legally binding advance healthcare directives provisions to all individuals with mental illness, including those whose treatment is regulated under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act (2001), would be dealt with in the context of the revision of the Mental Health Act.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act the Minister for Health will convene a multidisciplinary expert group to assist with the development of a Code of Practice to provide advice and guidance on how the advance healthcare directive provisions will operate on a day-to-day basis \"on the ground\", including providing examples of best practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500066#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Paternity Leave","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500066#WRD01750"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[12143\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500066#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she will bring forward legislation to introduce statutory paternity leave; the date from which he expects the leave to be available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The aim of the Diversion Programme, through the network of Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLOs), is to deal with young people who offend by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the young offender away from the Courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.  The Programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and, at all times, pays the highest regard to the needs of victims.  The Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting children and young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to them and their families.  This is evident from the continuing fall in the number of children and young people referred to the Programme in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the JLOs is supported by my Department through the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) which funds and oversees over 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) across the country.  In this regard the Programme for Government includes a commitment to extend the network of GYDPs for young people promoting restorative justice approaches.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to invest heavily in GYDPs through the work of the IYJS.  &euro;11.4 million has been allocated to administer the GYDPs in 2016.  The funding to support the GYDPs  is part supported by the Government and the European Social Fund (ESF) as part of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020.  In addition, my Department has been allocated funding of almost &euro;2.8m this year from the Dormant Accounts Fund to support a number of initiatives including the establishment of 10 new GYDPs and to fund additional youth justice workers in existing projects.  Three of these additional GYDPs commenced operations last year with an additional seven due to come into full operation very shortly.  Six of the GYDPs currently funded by my Department also incorporate Local Drugs Task Force (LDTF) projects and additional funding of over &euro;294,000 is being made available to support them in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to estimating the projected costs for 2017 the Deputy might wish to know that my Department is working with the 110 GYDPs in preparing their estimated funding requirements as part of a structured annual business planning process.  Funding of the GYDPs year on year is subject to approval by the IYJS in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Garda Youth Diversion Office.  The management function of each GYDP is carried out by a Community Based Organisation (CBO).  The local Garda Superintendent (District Officer) has an oversight role in the operation and direction of the Garda youth diversion service and each GYDP has a Project Committee which is chaired by the local Superintendent or a nominated Garda Inspector.  Each Project Committee is responsible for monitoring, advising, approving and evaluating the GYDPs strategy . As part of the annual business planning process each GYDP is required to prepare and submit an Annual Plan outlining its proposed strategy and the projected associated cost to implement the Plan.  Each Plan is specific to the catchment area of the GYDP and the Garda representatives support the Project Committees in the development and implementation of the Annual Plan including the provision of up to date crime statistical data for the area.  The development of each Plan is informed by local  statistical youth crime evidence provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the needs of local Garda&iacute; and in partnership with the local CBO(s).  The availability of detailed youth crime statistics contribute to the future planning, and  resource allocation, on a local and national basis and assist my Department to target youth crime prevention initiatives in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500067#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Equipment","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500067#WRE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[12137\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500067#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her policy on the installation of defibrillators in all Garda stations; if there are proposals due to be implemented by her Department that will ensure that this lifesaving device is available in all Garda stations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":128,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the provision of equipment for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.<\/p><p>I have asked the Garda authorities for the information requested by the Deputy and will revert to him in writing as soon as I have this information to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500067#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500067#WRE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[12217\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500067#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; stationed in the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, west division over the past eight years on an annual basis in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

DEIS schools will also further benefit from the 0.3 improvement to the staffing schedule which will give them an enhanced allocation on the basis of 17.95:1 in respect of the 2016\/17 school year.<\/p>  <p>  The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school.  The circular issued earlier this year by my Department outlining the allocation of teaching resources clearly stated that this additional resource is to complement existing resources in order to best meet the guidance needs of the school in line with the school's guidance plan.<\/p>  <p>  In the next Budget I will consider the best approach to further meeting commitments in the Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500068#WRF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Momentum Programme","counter":178,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500068#WRF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[12145\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500068#WRF03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of places on the Momentum scheme for jobseekers with a disability; the annual cost associated with same; the estimated annual cost of providing 500 extra places on the Momentum scheme for jobseekers with a disability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1269","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":180,"content":"<p>The Momentum programme is open to all long-term unemployed jobseekers, including those with a disability.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, over the course of recent economic difficulties, has not only maintained psychologists staffing levels within NEPS, but has increased them by some 10% since late 2008, to 165 whole time equivalent psychologists currently employed.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits that we will invest additional resources in the National Educational Psychological Service to ensure earlier intervention and access for young children and teenagers and to offer immediate support to schools in cases of critical incidents. The Programme commits to bring the total number of NEPS psychologists to 238 from the current sanctioned limit of 173.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

This facilitates access to individualised education programmes which can be supported by Special Needs Assistants and fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) as well as the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils. <\/p>  <p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues.

As the Deputy will be aware, the needs of children and young people occur along a continuum ranging from mild to severe and from transient to enduring.  <\/p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to match the level of support provided with the level of need presenting, so that pupils and young people with greatest need access greatest support.  Early intervention and prevention approaches are also encouraged.<\/p>  <p>  The service that NEPS provides to schools is one that supports schools to meet this continuum of need. <\/p>  <p>  At one level, NEPS psychologists seeks to build the capacity of schools (at a systemic level) to support all pupils on this continuum of need, by promoting the use of universal preventative and early intervention approaches.  They do this through the provision of training and professional development.<\/p>  <p>  At another level NEPS psychologists consult with teachers to build their capacity to identify the emerging need of some pupils and put in place appropriate, workable interventions to address those needs. They do this through Teacher Consultation &ndash; either with individual teachers or with groups of teachers. <\/p>  <p>  At a final level, NEPS psychologists work directly with pupils with greater need, and through assessment, consultation and review inform individualised interventions and support plans to address those needs.  So the focus of NEPS assessment work is not on diagnosis per se, but on engaging with the child\/young person, and with the teacher(s) and parents to identify and support need and delivery workable and appropriate interventions.  This approach is in line with best international practice for an educational psychology service. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE has statutory responsibility for the allocation of 'low incident' resources. Low-incident diagnoses are largely made by HSE multi-disciplinary teams. NEPS has a role in relation to some low-incident diagnoses.  The NCSE sets a deadline each year for receipt of applications for low-incident resource hours by school and NEPS participates in this process.<\/p>  <p>  The overall needs-led process operated by NEPS, however, does not lend itself to the context in which the question is posed (i.e. a solely diagnosis-driven model) and the effect of engaging additional psychologists would be that of affording more time to individual schools to further support the full range of needs of the children and young people in the school.  <\/p>  <p>  For information NEPS psychologist numbers currently stand at 165 w.t.e, within a limit of 173 w.t.e. and the unit cost of a full-time psychologist is in the region of &euro;70,000 per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500071#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capitation Grants","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500071#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[12173\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500071#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of increasing capitation rates for primary schools to the rate for post-primary schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":272,"content":"<p>The capitation grant at primary level is &euro;170 per pupil.

This improvement takes effect from next September. It brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016\/17 school year. This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota. DEIS schools will also further benefit from the 0.3 improvement to the staffing schedule which will give them an enhanced allocation on the basis of 17.95:1 in respect of the 2016\/17 school year.<\/p>  <p>  The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school. The circular issued earlier this year by my Department outlining the allocation of teaching resources clearly stated that this additional resource is to complement existing resources in order to best meet the guidance needs of the school in line with the school's guidance plan.<\/p>  <p>  Restoring the guidance counselling allocation to 100% will require an additional 300 teaching posts at an estimated cost of &euro;19m per annum.<\/p>  <p>  Guidance is a whole school activity where each school develops collaboratively a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. It is important that all groups that contribute to school life fully recognise and ensure that guidance permeates every aspect of school life. Guidance plans should outline the schools approach to guidance generally and how students can be supported and assisted in making choices and successful transitions in the personal, social, educational and career areas. The guidance plan should also distinguish between the competencies available within the school to support a student and situations where referral to the Health services or advising parents on the need to consider individual referral to a medical professional is warranted.<\/p>  <p>  Any argument that a separate scheme is necessary, is implicitly saying that school principals and Boards of Management should not be entrusted to use the flexibility appropriately based on all of the school's needs. Furthermore a separate allocation creates a false demarcation and creates an impression that supporting students through guidance and counselling is dependent exclusively on the contribution of the guidance counsellor, as opposed to recognising it as a whole school activity.<\/p>  <p>  In the next Budget I will consider the best approach to further meeting commitments in the Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500071#WRJ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500072#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[12181\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500072#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of removing apprenticeship college fees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":293,"content":"<p>The annual Student Contribution is levied on apprentices and students attending Institutes of Technology.<\/p>  <p>  This contribution has been levied by Institutes of Technology in respect of apprentices since 2004, with F&Aacute;S\/SOLAS paying 70% of the contribution and apprentices themselves paying the remainder.

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented in line with Government policy. The introduction of pay by weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.  In terms of the per kilogramme and service fees which will be charged under pay by weight, the Government has set a minimum mandatory fee per kilogramme for the different types of household waste: 11 cent for black bin (residual waste), 6 cent for brown bin ( food\/ organic waste ) and I have decided that a zero cent minimum fee per kilogramme   should be set for green bins (recyclate).  The collector may also charge a service fee, which will typically cover staff, collection, administrative and back office, capital and overhead costs. It is a matter for the collector to set charges at the level they consider to be competitive , in compliance with the requirements of the legislation. Householders will be able to compare the charges more easily under the new system and choose   the option that suits them best or is most cost effective.   <\/p>  <p>  During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria. <\/p>  <p>  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for a limited time. The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired. In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline further over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price. However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions toward the cost of     the collection of waste from certain households.  Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area. Such expenditure means that these local authorities divert funding from other areas to support these waiver provisions.<\/p>  <p>  With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste and the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between service provider and customer and the services offered vary across the country. In that regard, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.<\/p>  <p>  However, under pay-by-weight charging for household waste collection, there is an opportunity for all customers to have more control over their waste charges and to minimise their waste costs by preventing waste and segregating waste through using the food waste and recyclable waste bins properly. In this regard , a pay-by-weight awareness campaign, launched on 18 May 2016, will be rolled out at national, regional and local levels in the coming weeks and will give invaluable advice to householders on minimising their waste management costs under pay-by-weight charging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500073#WRL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[11923\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500074#WRM00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans for pay by weight bin charges for those who have to dispose of incontinent or household medical waste; if progress has been made since the last parliamentary question (details supplied) tabled on this issue; and if this will be resolved before 1 July 2016.

It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.  Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours.

In carrying out this function, the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035 (the &ldquo;Transport Strategy&rdquo;) was prepared by the NTA in accordance with the relevant legislative provisions, primarily Section 12 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.<\/p>  <p>  I am also determined that the GDA Transport Strategy be taken into account in preparing a new National Planning Framework (NPF) to succeed the National Spatial Strategy and subsidiary Regional Planning Guidelines which in turn will be succeeded by three new Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) for the new Regional Assembly areas.<\/p>  <p>  This is fully recognised in the Transport Strategy, which also states (page 6) that the &ldquo;role of the Strategy is to establish the framework for transport provision necessary to achieve the land use vision set out in the Regional Planning Guidelines&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  In preparing its Transport Strategy the NTA is required to have regard to a number of matters, including the National Spatial Strategy, local authority development plans, and the regional planning guidelines for the region (prior to their replacement with a regional spatial and economic strategy).<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the 2008 legislation requires the NTA to ensure that the Transport Strategy is consistent with the Regional Planning Guidelines (and subsequently with their replacement - the regional spatial and economic strategy).  In keeping with this, the Eastern and Midland Assembly provided confirmation that the draft Transport Strategy was consistent with the Regional Planning Guidelines for the Greater Dublin Area.<\/p>  <p>  I think we can all agree that many of the existing planning and transport problems across the Greater Dublin, which have resulted in unsustainable patterns of commuting and increasing congestion, stem from a lack of integration between planning and land use.  It is important that a much more integrated approach is developed between these two areas, both now and into the future.  Existing legislation seeks to achieve this by requiring, on a statutory basis, consistency between strategic transport planning, in the form of the Transport Strategy, and regional level land use planning.  It is through this interaction that the necessary integration between land use planning and transport provision can be achieved, which will provide a more co-ordinated and sustainable region.  I am confident that the approach being taken will ensure that the relevant bodies and agencies will work together, with the strategies in fact complementing each other.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined earlier, the Transport Strategy is legislatively required to be consistent with the Regional Planning Guidelines for the Greater Dublin Area 2010-2022.  Similarly, the same Regional Planning Guidelines have guided the preparation and adoption of the Development Plans of the Local Authorities in the Greater Dublin Area.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, it is considered that the Development Plans across the Greater Dublin Area and the Transport Strategy are inherently consistent with each other, and the NTA has confirmed their view of that consistency.  As such, there is no requirement for the amendment of the Core Strategies in the various Development Plans as a result of the adoption of the Transport Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the land use proposals intended to be prepared by the NTA for consideration by the Regional Assembly, the NTA is legislatively required, under Section 31F of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 (as amended), to &ldquo;assist and co-operate with the regional assemblies in respect of the GDA in making arrangements for the preparation of a regional spatial and economic strategy and in carrying out the preparation of the strategy&rdquo;.  In carrying out this role, the NTA is required, under the same legislative provision, to prepare a report for the Regional Assembly on the issues which should be considered by the Assembly, including, inter alia,&ldquo;recommendations regarding the optimal use, location, pattern and density of new development taking account of its transport strategy&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The statement in the Transport Strategy regarding the submission of land use proposals to the Regional Assembly for its consideration, reflects correctly the legislative role of the NTA, as set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000, in respect of the preparation of the regional spatial and economic strategy.  Such a submission does not affect, or alter in any way, the statutory role of the members of the Regional Assembly as the decision making body in the making of the regional spatial and economic strategy.  The Regional Assembly remains fully responsible for spatial planning of the overall region, in accordance with national planning policy.<\/p>  <p>  The Transport Strategy supports the development of the overall Greater Dublin Area, both the Metropolitan area and the Hinterland, in accordance with the Regional Planning Guidelines.  The NTA has confirmed that both population growth and employment growth has been anticipated and taken into account in relation to all six of the listed locations in County Wicklow.  They have noted that if the pace of growth of population and employment is faster than anticipated, the Transport Strategy can adapt to that acceleration through the provision of additional transport services or the earlier development of the infrastructure provisions.  In addition, the Strategy is subject to reviews and updates every six years and at each review point, adjustments can be made to reflect the relevant circumstances at that time.  Accordingly, the Transport Strategy underpins and supports the objective to allow the listed settlements to grow significantly and fulfil their roles in accordance with the Regional Planning Guidelines and the Core Strategy of the Wicklow County Development Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500075#WRN02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500075#WRN02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to Education Allowance","counter":405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500075#WRN02100"},{"type":"question","counter":406,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[12170\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500075#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of making the back to education allowance available to postgraduate students; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":407,"content":"<p>The focus of back to education allowance (BTEA) is on providing income support to jobseekers in improving their education qualifications to access the labour market, meeting emerging skill needs and supporting those who have poor levels of educational attainment.<\/p>  <p>  Postgraduate courses that lead to a higher diploma in any discipline or the Professional Masters in Education (PME) are eligible courses supported under the BTEA.

This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan (YGIP).<\/p>  <p>  Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  In 2015 monthly engagement by case officers with all young unemployed people was implemented.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. <\/p>  <p>  Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020 sets specific targets in relation addressing youth unemployment by continuing to implement the actions set out in the Youth Guarantee implementation plan.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  <\/p><p>One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.<\/p><p>There are others who, while satisfying the minimum requirements for a State pension contributory, do not qualify for the full rate, and as a result claim an alternative support to which they have a higher entitlement.<\/p><p>Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.<\/p><p>The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied. <\/p><p>Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p><p>There are a number of reasons why someone might not have sufficient contributions paid to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  Some would have been employed in the public service for a significant period, others would have worked abroad during their working life and qualified for a foreign pension based on foreign contributions, and some would have spent significant periods out of the labour force altogether for a number of reasons, e.g., caring for children or elderly relatives, prolonged periods of unemployment or incapacity and other circumstances.  If such people do not claim a State pension (contributory), their circumstances are not part of the statistics generated by management of that scheme.  Of those who did make such a claim, it is not possible to determine contribution history patterns of those claimants who were disallowed entitlement to State pension (contributory) without examination of their individual social insurance records.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding; by Q1 2016 the level of employment is up by 159,000 from the lowest level reached in 2012.<\/p>  <p>  Youth unemployment is estimated at 15.3% (28,300 persons) in April 2016 and has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in July 2012. <\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan (YGIP).<\/p>  <p>  Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  In 2015 monthly engagement by case officers with all young unemployed was implemented.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan (YGIP) details how the Youth Guarantee is to be funded through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and European Social Fund (ESF).  The YEI is being delivered in Ireland as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Operational Programme for Education, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020, for which the Irish Managing Authority is the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that the total amount allocated to YEI under PEIL is &euro;204,436,257.  This allocation is comprised of &euro;68,145,419 of specific EU funding for YEI, with matching amounts from Ireland&rsquo;s ESF allocation and from Exchequer funding.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended to claim funding in respect of expenditure on certain programmes which make up Ireland&rsquo;s response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee, including Youthreach, the JobsPlus Incentive Scheme and Momentum.

Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness, disability and caring schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  Delays can also arise when the application form is not competed fully or supporting documentation is not provided at claim stage; if information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  <\/p>  <p>  For example, pension claims on hand for more than three months typically occur in the case of EU\/bilateral pensions where information from other jurisdictions is awaited or, in the case of self-employed, there may be outstanding PRSI liabilities.  These delays impact on the award of household benefits in many cases as these secondary payments are linked to the award of the primary benefit. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Intreo service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalised service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Intreo centres also include a single integrated decision-making team that integrate and streamline the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into my Department.  Already clients are seeing the benefits of the integrated decisions process in the form of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary welfare payments.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no backlog in family income supplement (FIS), new claims are processed promptly within 2\/3 weeks and renewals are processed in advance of the previous claim period ending. <\/p>  <p>  Treatment benefit is also processed without delay, usually within 1 to 1.5 weeks of receipt. <\/p>  <p>  Both carer&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance, which are means-tested schemes, are experiencing some delays presently.  Delays are also occurring in domiciliary care allowance.  This primarily is due to an ongoing increase in new claim intake over the past few years to all three of these schemes and the complexity attached to processing of these applications.  In addition, there is sometimes a reluctance on the part of applicants to give full information at application stage thereby slowing down the processing of their application and in some cases necessitating a visit by an departmental investigative officer.  <\/p>  <p>  Reducing these waiting times is a priority for my Department.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by my Department in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, staffing needs are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500076#WRO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to Work Allowance Data","counter":451,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500077#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":452,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[12048\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500077#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which back to work applications have been approved in each of the past four years to date; the extent to which those previously self-employed and PAYE workers continue to benefit from the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":453,"content":"<p>Schemes such as the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) and the Short Term Enterprise Allowance (STEA) assist those on certain social welfare payments who wish to become self-employed.<\/p><p>The BTWEA is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are dependent on certain social welfare payments to develop a business, while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years (100% in year one and 75% in year two).

One of the first schemes selected for evaluation was JobBridge.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of the scheme in terms of its key objective of improving employment outcomes for unemployed jobseekers.  The evaluation involves a number of elements including: <\/p>  <p>  1.  Surveys of host organisation and participants to capture their perspective on, and experience of, JobBridge.<\/p>  <p>  2.  An assessment of whether or not JobBridge may be displacing paid employment in the economy.<\/p>  <p>  3.  A comparison of employment outcomes of JobBridge participants to matched non-participants. <\/p>  <p>  The research is currently well advanced and I expect to receive an interim progress report towards the end of June and the final report in September.   <\/p>  <p>  The JobBridge scheme has been an effective labour market intervention to date.  Some 15,000 interns went directly into paid employment immediately following a JobBridge internship.  Independent research indicates that this rose to 29,000 interns, or 61% of all participants after five months, compared to an average of 34% for comparable programmes in other European countries.<\/p>  <p>  I know people who took part in JobBridge and have benefitted from it.  But it was very much a scheme for its time, and I&rsquo;m planning to replace it with a more appropriate scheme. JobBridge was launched at a time of massive economic uncertainty and widespread unemployment.  Companies were simply not hiring because they couldn&rsquo;t afford to recruit, and in many cases insisted on a minimum level of experience.  But large numbers of recent graduates and people who lost their jobs in the recession couldn&rsquo;t get the relevant workplace experience they needed to get a first or a new job.<\/p>  <p>  That crisis is now over, the economy is growing and employers are hiring again.  The labour market has changed and new graduates are once again finding work.<\/p>  <p>  Job creation was at the heart of the last Government with more than 125,000 jobs created, and we have a new target to create a further 200,000.  Unemployment has fallen below 8% for the first time since the crash.  Although the evidence is largely anecdotal, I am concerned at reports that some employers might be using JobBridge as an alternative to hiring new employees.  On the other hand, I am very conscious that there are still many people who lost their jobs in the depth of the recession who are struggling to break back into the labour market and schemes like JobBridge can provide a valuable pathway to such citizens, in particular in instances where it is associated with a training programme.  The Indecon review in September will provide an evidential basis upon which to consider what changes should be made to improve outcomes for Jobseekers and value for money for the State.<\/p>  <p>  In order that the design of a new scheme be informed by the best evidence possible, I am awaiting the results of a second large scale evaluation of JobBridge.  This evaluation is currently well advanced; an interim progress report is expected towards the end of June and the final report in September.<\/p>  <p>  Any costs related to the replacement of the JobBridge scheme will be dependent on the nature of the scheme that is implemented in its place.  Such costs are not known at this time.<\/p>  <p>  Gateway is an employment scheme operated in association with the County and City Councils. It provides short-term work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than 24 months. <\/p>  <p>  Participants benefit by being involved in work, by maintaining and improving their work readiness and gaining new skills.  The scheme is intended to assist the personal and social development of participants with the objective of bridging the gap between unemployment and re-entering the workforce.  Participants are encouraged to engage in work search whilst engaged on the initiatives and will be supported to leave to pursue a full time job option.  <\/p>  <p>  I have no plans, at present, to modify or replace the Gateway scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500077#WRP03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Schemes","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500077#WRP03600"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[12105\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500077#WRP03700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which overpayments, culminating in a recovery, may exist in respect of cases whereby the recipient of the alleged overpayment may have a prior entitlement which would reduce the extent of liability to repay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":487,"content":"<p>The Department of Social Protection administers some 70 schemes.

This package involves a range of tort reforms and patient safety initiatives.  These add to the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 which provides for pre-action protocols, which will shorten the time that it takes for claims to be processed through the courts. <\/p>  <p>  The Civil Liability(Amendment) Bill, currently being drafted, will give the legislative base to introduce Periodic Payment Orders, which provide for index-linked annual payments to cover future care costs of catastrophically injured persons.  This Bill is under the aegis of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The previous Government gave its approval on 3rd November, 2015 to the drafting of provisions to support open disclosure of patient safety incidents, for inclusion in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill.  The provisions to support open disclosure are also currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. <\/p>  <p>  Open disclosure is about communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event. <\/p>  <p>  Under the proposed legislation open disclosure will have certain specified legal protections on the civil side, when made in line with national standards.  This approach is intended to promote and support a culture of open disclosure.  This legislation builds on the joint development by the HSE and State Claims Agency of the National Policy on Open Disclosure  (2013).  The HSE is progressing the implementation of the Policy across all health and social care services.  We all know that when error or harm is experienced by a patient, the trust and confidence of that patient and their family are compromised.  That is why honest, open disclosure and communication, which demonstrate empathy and sensitivity, are so essential. <\/p>  <p>  I am proposing separate legislation to provide for the mandatory external reporting of Serious Reportable Events,  that is, the most serious incidents that cause harm or could have caused harm to patients.  This requirement for health service providers to report these events to the State Claims Agency, HIQA and the Mental Health Commission will be included in the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500082#WRU01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":643,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500082#WRU01700"},{"type":"question","counter":644,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[12012\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500082#WRU01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will confirm that the oversight of the maternity claims process, including costs incurred, comes within the remit of his Department.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":645,"content":"<p>The management of clinical negligence claims, including maternity claims, arising from the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients in public healthcare enterprises is delegated to the State Claims Agency.

It should be noted, however, that the response to mental health issues is not the sole remit of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), and may for example, be more appropriately addressed in other care areas, such as Primary Care, Disability Services, or linkages to other sectors such as Education.<\/p>  <p>  Counselling is provided across the health service, by both the HSE and the voluntary sector including primary care, social care and within mental health.  This type of service can be provided by a range of trained health professionals and delivered to meet a clinical need at either primary or secondary care level.  <\/p>  <p>  While a broad range of services support the mental health of children and adolescents, the term &lsquo;CAMHS&rsquo; is usually applied very specifically to services that provide specialist mental health treatment and care to young people up to 18 years of age, through a multidisciplinary team.  In 2016, the HSE National Service Plan objective for improved performance for the year is for 78% or greater of accepted referrals to Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams to be seen within three months.  A targeted approach to addressing the needs of those waiting over 12 months, combined with maintaining targets for first appointments and seeing individuals within three months, is a priority for this year.  In addition, the Executive last year launched a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)  for both in-patient and community based CAMHS provision, the purpose of which is to ensure that the delivery of services is carried out in a consistent and transparent manner and that the care and treatment offered reflects the identified clinical needs of the child - with a consistent level of clinical care across all regions. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is progressing various new service priorities from additional funding including the continued development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care.  This involves, for example, three new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin city centre and Limerick; the continued expansion of Community Mental Health teams; improved 24\/7 response and Liaison Services; better Psychiatry-of-Later Life mental health care; improved Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health Clinical Programmes, specifically relating ADHD in Adults and Children, and Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.

Progress in this area has been significant, as evidenced by the fact that the number of such admissions to adult units in 2008 was 247, and that the number of such admissions declined to 89 at the end of 2014.  The trend was reversed slightly with a slight increase of 6 at the end of 2015.  In March 2016, 98.7% of bed days used were in Child and Adolescent Acute Inpatient Units, an improvement on the 97.2% in February. Performance continues to be above the target of 95%, indicating that where a child has been admitted to an adult acute inpatient unit, the length of stay has been kept to a minimum. <\/p>  <p>  Figures for 2015 indicate that there were 95 admissions of children to adult psychiatric units.  It is important to note that the number of admissions does not necessarily equate to the number of children admitted, as a child may be admitted on one or more occasions in any given year.  In 2015, there was a total of 356 CAMHS admissions, of which 261 (73%) were to age-appropriate units and 95 (27%) to Adult Units.  In the National Service Plan 2016 the HSE have set a target of 95% of admissions of admission of children and adolescents to adult in-patients units, while allowing for some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units.  The HSE continues to monitor all CAMHS admissions to adult units. <\/p>  <p>  The issue raised by the Deputy is a action for improvement in the HSE Service Plan for 2016, in line with available resources.  The objective of further reducing the number of admissions to adult units involves continued improvements to CAMHS service provision, including additional CAMHS acute bed capacity, enhanced community based supports, and ongoing roll out of the Standard Operational Procedures for CAMHS nationally, introduced by the HSE last year.  This issue is being addressed in the current year in the context of the additional funding being provided to develop Mental Health services in 2016, including a more integrated approach to CAMHS provision overall with other care programmes such as Disabilities or Primary Care.

At the request of Ireland and some other member states the EU Commission introduced a provision last year permitting payment of the levy in three annual instalments, without interest, on the understanding that the full amount of the levy was paid to the Commission by the Member State in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme required applicants to pay at least one third of their levy by October 2015 with the balance to be paid in 2016 and 2017.  The scheme design was agreed in advance with the co-ops and farm organisations.  The person named by the Deputy is an applicant under this Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016.  However the European Commission advised that the legal basis for the Regulations under-pinning the scheme are no longer in existence and therefore further amendments were not possible.  While Ireland suggested a possible alternative legal approach, it was clear that the proposal enjoyed very little support from other Member States and was therefore unlikely to succeed. <\/p>  <p>  On that basis the focus turned to other measures in the package which can be of assistance to Irish dairy farmers to help them through current difficulties, including the doubling of intervention fixed price buying-in thresholds.  I did however raise the matter with Commissioner Phil Hogan, in our recent bilateral meeting, as well as at last week&rsquo;s Council of Ministers meeting and encouraged him to reflect again on whether a legal basis could be found to facilitate a further deferral in superlevy repayments for farmers. <\/p>  <p>  This Scheme was followed by a dairy support package, worth &euro;26.4m in total to the Irish dairy sector, where a flat rate payment of &euro;1,395 was paid to all 2015 milk producers.  Eligible applicants under the Young Farmer Scheme received an additional &euro;1,000.  The person named by the Deputy was also a beneficiary of the flat rate payment under this Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the pressures on dairy farmers right now and I am committed to working with all players in the sector to address the issues facing us as we strive to ensure that we continue to have a sustainable dairy industry.  As one of the proposers of the Dairy Forum my goal is to ensure that it continues to provide constructively in terms of relevant issues of concern to farmers and others in the sector.  The Forum has already come forward with some good initiatives for farmers, including an initiative on improving\u00a0cashflow planning at farm level, which\u00a0will be rolled out shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Dealing with price volatility is a major challenge for the sector.  The Single Farm Payment provides some measure of income stability, and EU market support measures will have a role to play.  These measures are not enough on their own, however.  The sector needs to look at measures to reduce costs on farms, and at the development of new tools, including fixed price contracts, futures markets and more flexible financing arrangements for farmers.  I expect all of the stakeholders in the sector, including processors and banks, to play an active role in the development of such instruments. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of input costs at farm level, Ireland has called on the Commission to consider temporarily suspending EU import tariffs on fertilisers and I also welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Member States to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool.   <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that we need to deal urgently and effectively with this temporary problem of low prices.  We must ensure that dairy farmers are protected from the worst impacts of low commodity prices in an appropriate way, but remain well placed to avail of emerging opportunities when markets recover.  Ireland is strongly positioned as a competitive producer of dairy, and while conditions are extremely difficult at present, Irish dairy farmers will be well placed to avail of the opportunity presented by market recovery in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500086#WRY02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":811,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500087#WRZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":812,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[12003\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500087#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to strengthen the laws around animal cruelty, including the provision of greater deterrents for those guilty of an offence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":813,"content":"<p>Incidents of animal cruelty are totally unacceptable and my Department devotes considerable resources to protecting animal welfare and dealing with breaches of animal welfare legislation.

These rules provide that a person having an animal in his or her possession or control must safeguard and not threaten the health and welfare of the animal.  In addition, it is an offence for a person to cause unnecessary suffering, endanger, neglect or be reckless regarding the health or welfare of any animal. The Act also provides for increased levels of penalties for offences committed under the Act. For major cases taken on indictment, the maximum penalty has been increased from &euro;100,000 to &euro;250,000, with a maximum custodial sentence of five years imprisonment. Section 58 of the Act also provides that a person convicted of an offence under the Act may be disqualified from keeping, owning or working with an animal.

Prior to the last CAP reform negotiations, my predecessor met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar\/bioethanol processing facility in the country.  The figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, indicated that the overall capital costs involved could range from &euro;250million to &euro;400million, depending on what type of facility would be constructed.<\/p><p>Both groups were informed at the time that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility in Ireland, would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a business case which is sufficiently robust to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required.  An agreement was reached as part of the overall CAP reform package, negotiated during the Irish Presidency in June 2013, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current EU quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States, wishing to re-establish a sugar beet processing industry.  At the time, this agreement was welcomed by those parties who are interested in seeking to re-establish a sugar industry here.

The Department of Agriculture introduced an Animal Welfare Recording and Breeding Scheme for suckler cows for the period from 2008 &ndash; 2012 based on a premium rate initially of &euro;80 per suckler cow which was reduced to &euro;40 per cow for 2009 and subsequent years due to the increased pressure on the national finances.

The statutory objective of the Strategy is to provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the integrated development of transport infrastructure and services in the GDA.<\/p>  <p>  The preparation and development of the Strategy is guided by section 12 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008. That section requires the NTA when preparing the Strategy to have regard to a wide range of relevant policies, including &ndash;<\/p>  <p>  - The National Spatial Strategy;<\/p>  <p>  - The GDA regional spatial and economic strategy;<\/p>  <p>  - Development plans in the GDA;<\/p>  <p>  - Any transport related capital investment framework.<\/p>  <p>  The Act also specifically requires the NTA to ensure that the Strategy is consistent with the GDA's regional spatial and economic strategy.<\/p>  <p>  As well as those legal requirements, the Act then requires that the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly formally consider the draft Strategy and confirm to the Minister whether it is consistent with the regional spatial and economic strategy, including any Regional Planning Guidelines. I can inform the Deputy that the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly did indeed confirm that the Strategy is consistent with the Regional Planning Guidelines for the GDA.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy states its purpose as establishing 'the framework for transport provision necessary to achieve the land use vision set out in the Regional Planning Guidelines', but that land use vision is the statutory responsibility of relevant local authorities, regional assemblies and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government at a national policy level.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Wicklow, the Strategy first proposes that the Luas Green Line is upgraded to Metro standard from the city centre, where it will link with New Metro North, as far as its current terminus at Bride's Glen. A new Luas line is proposed from this point to Bray, which will provide a new north-south inland rail axis from Swords to Bray. These projects will be considered in the context of future capital plans subject to business case approval and availability of funding.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is likely aware that under the current capital plan, 'Building on Recovery - Infrastructure and Capital Investment (2016-2021)', my Department provides funding to the NTA for a programme of sustainable transport measures for local authorities in the GDA. This programme funds investment in QBCs, safety and traffic management projects and various cycling\/walking schemes and improvements throughout the region, including Wicklow.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the Strategy, the NTA must now prepare an implementation plan to set out exactly how it hopes to achieve the Strategy's ambition over the next 6 years. The Act requires that development of this implementation plan must be informed by further consultation with relevant local authorities, including Wicklow County Council, as well as the general public. I look forward to receiving this implementation plan for my approval in due course and I also look forward to working with the NTA, and all interested stakeholders, in delivering upon the ambition contained within this Strategy\u200b.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500089#WRBB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport Provision","counter":918,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500090#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":919,"qnumday":351,"qnumall":"[12158\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500090#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the estimated cost of making all public transport wheelchair accessible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1269","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":920,"content":"<p>Accessibility is built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage and new systems such as the Luas are fully accessible.

An EU-US agreement would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal, and a successful conclusion is expected to benefit Ireland more than any other EU Member State.  As Ireland continues to rely on external demand and international markets for sustainable growth and market access, regulatory cooperation and reduced tariffs are essential to grow our exports.  Ireland strongly supports these negotiations and is working to ensure that our interests are fully reflected in the texts of the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  One of the objectives in the EU&ndash;US Trade Agreement is greater regulatory coherence to ease red tape for firms.  This will not be at the expense of consumers or lowering standards.  There will be no dilution of labour or environment standards, no change to GMO regulation, no affect on the Government&rsquo;s right to regulate and no interference in Public Service provision.  This has been reinforced by a joint declaration from EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m and the US Trade Representative Mike Froman who confirmed that U.S. and EU trade agreements do not prevent governments, at any level, from providing or supporting services in areas such as water, education, health, and social services.<\/p>  <p>  Although regulatory compatibility is a key goal EU-US free trade agreement, it is not an objective of the negotiations to achieve mutual recognition and harmonisation of food standards between the EU and the US.  Nor is there any intention on the part of the EU to abandon the precautionary principle or the EU&rsquo;s system of controls along the food chain.  These are deeply embedded in EU legislative policy.  Indeed the &ldquo;precautionary principle&rdquo; is the policy driver of European policy on food safety.  The Commission have also made it very clear that the EU will not change our food safety legislation under an EU-US Trade Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of Hormone Treated Beef, meat from the United States would be marketable in Europe only if it is hormone free.  If it has been treated with hormones, it would be prohibited for sale in the EU.  This is the current position and will continue to be the case after any agreement.  The Commission has made it clear that it will not countenance the importation of hormone treated meat into the EU and this is well understood by the US side.  Legislation in force regarding the prohibition of hormonally active substances in livestock farming will in no way be put in question.<\/p>  <p>  Owing to our position as a small open economy, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  An independent study commissioned by this Department, carried out by Copenhagen Economics, estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  The study estimates that the benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  It suggests a boost to GDP of 1.1%, growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5%, and an increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.  The findings are backed up in a report by Ecorys Consultancy, published on 13th May 2016, which estimates that an EU-US free trade agreement would boost Irish GDP by 1.4 per cent.<\/p>  <p>  The opportunities will be especially valuable for SMEs, given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms, which have fewer resources to overcome them than larger firms.  In fact, the study reported that a trans-Atlantic agreement would have a more significant positive impact on SMEs than on other types of business.  The final agreement will have an entire chapter exclusively dedicated to SMEs aimed at addressing those specific constraints that might otherwise limit SMEs taking full advantage of the improved EU-US trade agreement market access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500090#WRCC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Expenditure","counter":927,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500090#WRCC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":928,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[11979\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052500090#WRCC01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the grants paid to a company (details supplied); when they were paid; if they have been refunded; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":929,"content":"<p>In 2010 IDA Ireland approved a training grant for the company in question.
