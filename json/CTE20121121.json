For this reason, members need not have any concern in regard to policy issues.  The Ceann Comhairle was willing to allow the amendments to proceed to comply with the rules of notice.  <\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 and 9 rearrange various definitions into alphabetical order.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 10 correct a printing order.  Amendment No. 7 deletes reference to the definition of a savings protection scheme, which is being replaced by the statutory stability support scheme.  Amendment No. 3 refers to financial services legislation in section 6 and is to be grouped with several other amendments.<\/p><p>  As I stated on Second Stage, the perception that this definition turns on a range of new legal provisions to credit unions from the wider financial sector is mistaken.  This definition does not apply financial services provisions to credit unions anew, nor could it be used for that purpose.  The definition of financial services legislation is a technical interpretation provision which is needed for references throughout the Bill to requirements that are already imposed on credit union under various items of financial services legislation.  One reason for this is that the credit unions have secured authorisation outside of the credit union sector and, therefore, fall under wider financial services legislation, such as the European Communities (Insurance Mediation) Regulations 2005, Investment Intermediaries Act 1995 and European Community (Payment Services) Regulations 2009.  The deposit guarantee scheme which protects members' savings also applies by virtue of wider financial services legislation such as the Financial Services Deposit Guarantee Scheme Act 2009.  <\/p><p>  It is important to understand that the agreed Commission report cannot be implemented if the Central Bank Acts are not applied to the credit unions.  The provision for credit unions to appeal to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal is provided for in Part VIIB of the Central Bank Act 1942. <\/p> <p>The facility for credit union members and credit unions to continue to seek redress through the Financial Services Ombudsman, relies on Part VIIB of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The application of the administrative sanction regime to credit unions relies upon Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The application of fitness and probity to the credit unions relies on Part 3 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  The resolution powers which the Commission recommends to be applied to credit unions where appropriate are set out in the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011.<\/p><p> The Central Bank Acts already have wide application to credit unions.  For example, the office of registrar is provided for in the Central Bank Act 1942.  I do not consider that excising all references to financial services legislation or the Central Bank Acts is a workable solution if it fundamentally compromises what the Bill and the Commission report is trying to achieve.  I am, however sensitive to the concerns on this point and will consider further, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, whether it is possible to address the concerns being raised.  I inform the committee of this because there appears to be a misunderstanding on the part of the league of credit unions about this issue.  I want this information on the record for the committee.  However, if sections of the Acts are being applied unnecessarily and if members indicate that to me here, I am prepared to take their concerns on board and see what we can do on Report Stage to meet their concerns and those of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  My perception is there is a misunderstanding of how various other pieces of financial legislation interact with the new Bill and this is giving rise to unnecessary concerns.  We will tease our way through the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100003#B00600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353505500,"counter":12,"content":"<p>If we can deal with that issue, it will help to smooth our proceedings because many of the subsequent amendments relate to the issue of the application of the full suite of financial services legislation to credit unions.  The Minister has addressed this directly in his remarks and I welcome that.  I also welcome his openness towards looking at the detail of this and his commitment to consult the Attorney General to examine whether the concerns of the movement can be taken into account without compromising the effect of the legislation.  I accept the Minister's undertaking in the spirit offered.<\/p><p>  As the Minister is aware, the league has given us a different interpretation.  It has written directly to the Minister also.  Its concern is that the structure and regulatory architecture that has been designed and developed for banking regulation and which does not distinguish between the different functions, roles and objectives that credit unions serve will now be applied to the credit unions.  There is a concern that applying the full suite of Acts, from 1942 to 2011, will result in additional requirements with which credit unions must comply on the regulatory side and that these requirements do not take into account the distinctive nature of the movement and how it operates on the ground.  That is the key concern.  If the Minister is saying we will go through these issues and that he is open to considering them, I accept that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100004#C00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1353505500,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The Irish League of Credit Unions and its representatives, including its manager, has had ongoing contact with the officials charged with developing this Bill and considering amendments.  I am of the view the league is more satisfied with the position now than it was when the initial correspondence was entered into with Deputies from all sides.  The league still has some concerns and I hope we can deal with those concerns as we go through the Bill.<\/p><p>  For example, some people have suggested we delete the definition.  I can give two examples of what the effect would be if we deleted the definition.  First, section 18 inserts a new section, 55(A)(<i>f<\/i>) into the Credit Union Act 1997.  This requires the Chairman to conduct a performance evaluation of all directors regarding their compliance with obligations under financial services legislation.  Many credit unions are authorised under the European Communities payment services regulations 2009.  A director of a credit union who fraudulently misappropriates users' funds under these regulations commits an offence.  However, if these references were deleted in the Bill, that offence could not form part of that director's performance evaluation.  <br \/> Second, section 15 of this Bill substitutes a new section 53(7) in the Credit Union Act 1997.  Deleting this reference would mean the Bill would allow a retiring director to be eligible for re-election, even where to do this would result in a breach of another legal provision which already applies to the credit unions.  For example, there are requirements on directors regarding fitness and competence under the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995, under which many credit unions hold an authorisation.  The failure of a credit union director to meet these requirements would be grounds for an application to the High Court to remove the credit union's authorisation as an investment intermediary.  Including the reference to an applicable requirement under financial services legislation means that credit union members can have confidence that the directors coming before them for re-election are not doing so in a way which would breach a legal requirement to which the credit union is already subject.  <\/p><p>  Some people have suggested we should include the phrase &quot;where relevant or applicable&quot; to provide for how these would apply.  The approach used in the Bill has been subject to careful consideration and scrutiny by legal advisers of the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The wording has been chosen carefully to ensure that it serves its purpose as an interpretation provision, but no more than an interpretation provision.  My officials have explored with the Office of the Attorney General where some additional wording might be used to clarify that these provisions are only to be interpreted where applicable or relevant.  The change suggested would not alter the meaning or interpretation of these provisions.  Furthermore, the use of the term financial services legislation throughout the Bill must be read in the context where it is already accompanied by a reference to applicable requirements.  It is important that in adding any words for clarification purposes, the intent and meaning and purpose of the provision is not inadvertently compromised.<\/p><p>  Another question which might arise might suggest we should just list the legislation that does apply.  The Department has explored this option with the Office of the Attorney General and the assessment is that this approach would introduce unnecessary risks to the robustness of the provision and could result in a more limited application of the Bill than intended.  The interconnectedness of financial services legislation is such that any inadvertent omission or misapplication of a particular provision could impede or prevent key sections of the Bill from applying in their intended form.  Furthermore, this approach would not address the situation whereby credit unions operate in areas of business beyond the current statutory provisions that apply.  Credit unions already typically hold authorisations under three or four regimes and any further authorised activity would fall outside of the definitions.  Such avoidable risks need to be reviewed against the fact that no amendment to the meaning of the provisions is being sought.<\/p><p>  I could provide more information on specific issues that have been raised, but committee members probably want to participate.  I will come back in on this again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100004#C00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1353505500,"counter":14,"content":"<p>T&uacute;s maith, leath na hoibre.  I welcome the Minister's opening comments on this section of the Bill.  My concerns relate more to the next group of amendments we will deal with, submitted by opposition groups, and amendment No. 3 is fundamental in that regard.<\/p><p>  I listened to what the Minister had to say on this grouping.  When his officials briefed my office on this grouping they explained the consequence of the Bill was to apply the existing legislation applicable to credit unions to the credit unions generally.  I understand the enormous wealth of legislation that is in place since 1942.  However, there is grave concern that this could be interpreted to include other legislation.<\/p> <p>There would be unintended consequences if this were to be interpreted in a broader fashion.  There is also the issue that future legislation could be interpreted to apply to the credit unions which may not be the intended cause.  I welcome the Minister's comments that he is examining the issue and I understand he asked the Attorney General to examine wording to that effect.  It is an issue about which the credit unions are passionate and is fundamental to the Bill.  If it were to be interpreted in the broader fashion and yet was not discussed at the Commission on Credit Unions that is also relevant.  On the basis that the Minister is examining wording for a possible Report Stage amendment I am satisfied, but I am laying down a marker that this needs to be amended.

That is vitally important for reasons on which we all agree.  The credit unions were at pains to stress that they should not suffer the backlash as a result of the failures of other sectors of the financial services industry, the banking sector and so on, as we move to correctly regulate the banks and the financial services sector, whose reckless activities helped crash the economy, given that the sector has no responsibility for that crisis.  The danger is that if the legislation is applied to them, they could be regulated in an inappropriate way that could undermine their fundamental ethos and character.  It is vitally important that does not happen.  As has been mentioned, they were alarmed that it was proposed that legislation that applies to the rest of the banking sector was to apply to credit unions given that it had not been discussed at the Commission on Credit Unions.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will examine the issue.  To allay concerns is it his intention to seek to amend the wording in conjunction with the Irish League of Credit Unions and on the basis of agreement with it.  That is what should be done as it knows the sector best.

It is important legislation.  Even though we have all been very complimentary about the credit union movement it is also true that it did not escape unscathed from the collapse in the financial services industry consequent on the collapse of the construction and building industry.  Some credit unions had moved away from their traditional areas of activity and some of the bigger credit unions were heavily involved in funding construction and development in a way that was unexpected.  Deputies are aware of examples of that.  There is quite a degree of impairment in the credit union movement.  If the more than 400 credit unions were all branches of the same organisation there would be certain difficulties in them and one would have to distinguish one from the other.  Members will be aware from the reports already published that there is a significant number of credit unions whose reserves are quite low and the Government has pledged to repair that situation through a variety of means.  One of the reasons the Bill is proceeding as a matter of urgency is that the Government has committed to putting &euro;250 million into an account to be used for the credit union movement and we need to get it in this calendar year, because it is in this year's accounts which is why we need to move it forward.  There is pace attached to the way we are dealing with it.  I do not know what the full impairment was, but the first shot was somewhere between &euro;0.5 billion and &euro;1 billion and I do not know whether it will reach that amount.  That will not be known until people go into the credit unions and examine the situation.  We have had only one example of that in Newbridge.  Certainly that was a revealing exercise when the special manager went in there.<\/p><p>  We want to treat the credit union movement fairly.  We want to provide the capital that is required to repair the damaged credit unions and to provide a framework to enable ReBo, the new group, to do what is necessary to repair any damage the credit union movement has suffered in the course of the crisis.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure the credit union movement will be strong and the threats to its vitality and ongoing success will be removed and that there will be a framework in accordance with law within which it will operate.  <\/p><p>  I believe there is a misunderstanding.  Given the ongoing contact between the credit union movement and my officials the ground has narrowed from the original communications.  I would like to provide similar information in order that we can confine it to where there is a real difficulty rather than chasing hares that are not relevant.   I will read another note which is in reply to the key question of how financial services legislation will apply to credit unions.<\/p> <p> A key question is how financial services legislation will apply to credit unions.  The Central Bank Acts have limited application to credit unions.  My officials carried out a review of the Central Bank Acts and the Building Societies Act in assessing section 184 of the Credit Union Act of 1997.  They found that only certain provisions would apply to credit unions.  These include the following: the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal, in Part VIIA of the Central Bank Act 1942; the Financial Services Ombudsman, in Part VIIB of the 1942 Act; and the administrative sanctions procedures, in Part IIIC of the 1942 Act.  <\/p><p> Although currently applicable to credit unions in practice, the following provisions may also be caught by section 184 disapplication provision.  In other words, the following are provisions that no longer apply: provisions relating to collection of regulatory levies in respect of which specific provision is made for credit unions, in Part IIIA of the 1942 Act; powers of the Registrar of Credit Unions for the purposes of supervising or regulating credit unions, in Part IIIA of the 1942 Act; and provisions empowering the bank to carry out studies, surveys and analysis with respect to the provision of financial services to consumers, including the power to compel the production of information for these purposes and to publish its findings in respect of same, insection 5(<i>c<\/i>), Part II of the 1942 Act.  <\/p><p> The Department of Finance has identified a number of provisions in the Central Bank Acts and the Building Societies Act which directly apply to credit unions, in apparent conflict with section 184 of the Credit Union Act 1997 - for example, section 134 of the Central Bank Act 1989, which contains a direction-making power which permits the Minister, in consultation with the bank, to suspend certain business in the national interest.  This direction-making power extends to licence holders and persons exempt from holding a licence under section 7(4) of the Central Bank Act, 1971, which includes credit unions.  The Central Bank Act of 1971 mainly applies to licence holders, which does not include credit unions.  Section 14(1) of the 1971 Act specifically refers to credit unions:  Section 14 (1) specifically refers to credit unions and states they cannot use the word &quot;bank&quot; in their names.  Therefore, the disapplication clause of the Central Bank Act 1971 causes an uncertainty as to whether this prohibition is enforceable against credit unions.  Section 27 provides that persons shall not advertise for deposits or other repayable funds but there is an explicit exception provided for<i>inter alia<\/i>credit unions, which will be unaffected by the repeal of section 184.  <\/p><p> Deputies can see that the detail is rather complex.  We can supply the briefing notes on this if Deputies require them in advance of Report Stage.  I would like to give Deputies as much information as possible to reduce the areas of misunderstanding so that we can concentrate on what, in the opinion of Deputies, might need to be amended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100005#D00700","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353506700,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I will summarise where we are as of now because this is a very substantive section, particularly as we go on to amendment No. 3.

While shared services are being provided for at the level of the credit union, the position of the Irish League of Credit Unions and individual credit unions which have approached me is that the Bill should enable shared services at the level of the individual member of the credit union.  The key words in the amendment refer only to where it is prescribed by the Central Bank.  Therefore, a control mechanism would be in place.  It is not that a credit union can roll out services to be shared by members according their free will.  It should be prescribed by the Central Bank.  My understanding is that the 1997 Act does not allow members to access services.  The issue is if credit unions are being allowed to share services, are we moving to a position whereby someone can avail of credit union services in one credit union while being a member of another credit union?  <\/p><p>  In respect of amendment No. 12, a credit union service organisation is an entity that facilitates the sharing of services.  There are credit unions throughout the country doing this already.  For example, there is a model in west Cork whereby a group of credit unions work together and share services.  The amendment proposes that recognition should be given to a credit union services organisation as a mechanism for delivering the sharing of services.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 13 would give credit unions the power to lend to State-guaranteed projects.  The purpose is to allow credit unions to fulfil the potential that we all agree they have to invest in projects with a social value, whether in the areas of health, education or employment.  As proposed, the projects would be State-guaranteed and therefore a credit union would not be taking on any additional risk, an understandable concern for the regulator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100007#F02600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1353507300,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Amendments in my name in this section include amendments Nos. 13 and 15.  Amendment No. 13 is also in the name of Deputy Michael McGrath and it deals with State-guaranteed projects.  This was one of the issues the Irish League of Credit Unions presented to the committee when a deputation appeared at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  It makes absolute sense.  We are aware the Irish League of Credit Unions and credit unions throughout the State invest in projects and, like banks and financial institutions, they must invest in projects.  They want to invest in State-guaranteed projects which would benefit the local community.<\/p> <p>The ethos of credit unions is one of sharing profits with their members and developing local communities.  Why can we not have an extension of that ethos to allow credit unions to invest in State guaranteed projects?<\/p><p> Last night I re-read a reply to a parliamentary question I asked about the public private partnership in eight schools, one of which is Col&aacute;iste Ailigh in Letterkenny.  This is being bankrolled by Bank of Ireland.  The bank, in which the State is a minority shareholder, will get a benefit from that.  Why should a credit union not be allowed to invest in a State guaranteed project that would be of benefit to the local community? <\/p><p> Amendment No. 15 is similar to amendments submitted by other Deputies.  The Bill needs to do more than deal with the regulation of credit union, although it is important that we have proper and robust regulation of them.  It also needs to deal with the future development of the sector and with the movement's role in five, ten, 15 or 20 years time.  Credit unions need to be able to share services at the member level.  The report of the Commission on Credit Unions noted that international experience shows there is scope for improved collaboration and efficiency through shared services arrangements.  The commission recommended that these should be facilitated in legislation for Irish credit unions. <\/p><p> This amendment, while not ruling out other shared services, lists a number of services in which credit unions should be able to participate.  They include electronic transfer, automatic teller machines, debit card services and electronic fund services.  <\/p><p> It is important that there be a clear pathway for the future development of the sector.  When departmental officials briefed the committee on this issue they stated that nothing in the legislation prevented the provision of shared services.  When we teased out the matter, however, it became clear that the type of shared services envisaged were back-end services such as administration and human resources.  There is a clear distinction between back-end services and services at member level, such as electronic funds transfer.  I need to be able to access my  funds in Gweedore Credit Union whether I am in Gweedore or in Dublin.  Banks are changing the way they deal with their members.  We need to ensure that credit unions can keep up with them.  If the Minister supports the idea of sharing member level services why can we not explicitly reference some of those services to ensure that nothing in other legislation can prevent this taking place? <\/p><p> Has there been any contact with the Irish Banking Federation regarding this section?

These are among the most important amendments being proposed by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  When I discussed the proposals with representatives of the league they put it to me that we have had a catastrophic failure of the for-profit banking model.  The credit unions are asking that the Bill, as recommended in the commission's report, should facilitate the promotion and expansion of an alternative financial services model that is not for profit and remove any impediment to the promotion and expansion of that alternative model.  The case for doing that is overwhelming, given the failure of the for-profit model.<\/p><p>  Here is a model that does not carry the guilt of crashing our economy and provides an alternative way of doing financial services that is democratic and socially focused.  We should do everything in our power, given the current circumstances, to expand, develop and promote that model and remove any obstacle or impediment to its expansion.  That is the essence of the amendments.  Part of doing this is to allow credit unions to expand the range of financial services they make available to their members so that those services can be accessed everywhere in the country and the full range of services can be offered by credit unions to provide an alternative and a choice for people. <\/p><p>  The fact that many for-profit banks are closing branches, particularly in small towns and rural areas, often means that a credit union is the only financial services outlet in an area.  In that context, it is even more important that they be able to offer the full range of services to their members throughout the country and not be limited or impeded from doing that in any other way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100008#G01400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1353507900,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Deputy, I need to move you towards the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100008#G01500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1353507900,"counter":76,"content":"<p>The amendment is exactly about shared services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100008#G01600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1353507900,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Please speak directly to the amendment if you can, Deputy.

They want to be allowed to do this.  However, because of certain restrictions on them they are having to send money abroad when what they would prefer to do is to invest money in this country for the promotion of employment and enterprise.  They would prefer to be assisting the Government in its financial difficulties in trying to improve the economic lot of the country.

Shared service arrangements are already in operation in the credit union area.  For example, the credit union services co-operative limited or Irish League of Credit Unions own payments service, CUSO.  The commission recommends that the establishment of such shared services arrangements should be facilitated by legislation where necessary.  The Government agrees that the sharing of services offers credit unions an opportunity to benefit from economies of scale and allows them access to expertise which credit unions may not normally have the resources to engage.  This may become increasingly important in the future, given the increased complexity and running costs which would be expected from a modernised regulatory framework and enhanced service offering.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has accepted that there is no obstacle to establishing shared services arrangements at a credit union level.  That is the first position.  <\/p><p>  I do not propose to accept the amendments on CUSOs as there is no need to provide for them in legislation.  CUSOs are not regulated financial services providers and they do not require to be regulated as such by the Central Bank.  The Bill already sets out provisions for outsourcing which will ensure that services can be shared safely.  As Deputy Doherty said, that is the back-office range of services.  They are enabled in law as it stands to do so and I would encourage them - as would the Central Bank - to do so.<\/p><p>  It is not so much a case of shared services - known as shared branching.  Shared services involve establishing an entity, usually a company or a co-operative, to provide certain back-office services to credit unions on a shared basis.  This can reduce costs, enhance expertise and improve efficiency.  I have outlined the commission's recommendations.  There is no problem in doing this under the law as it stands.  Deputy McGrath in the first instance and Deputy Boyd Barrett moved to deal with what is not shared services but rather is shared branching.  Shared branching is a different concept; it involves credit unions providing front-of-house services, not back-shop services, to each other's members.  This activity operates primarily in the US credit union system.  Shared branching was not considered by the commission on credit unions and does not form part of its final report.  In the public consultation process, shared branching was not a key issue in the submissions received from credit unions or other stakeholders, nor did it emerge from survey returns from credit unions.<\/p><p>  In simple terms, shared branching would allow a credit union member to use the services of other credit unions as a customer - as do the banks.  For this to work securely, a number of important provisions must be put in place.  First, a settlement system would be needed and this is not in place at present.  Otherwise, a person could withdraw his or her savings several times over from different credit unions without any safeguards to provide against this.  Second, an underwriting process is needed to establish proper assessment of ability to repay a credit union issuing a loan on behalf of the member's home credit union.  It will also need to be clear who would be responsible if the loan were to run into arrears; whether it would be the member's own credit union or the credit union which issued the loan.  Third, an accompanying prudential framework would be needed to ensure, for example, that proper liquidity management practices are in place to guard against large unpredictable withdrawals at small credit unions that are connected to larger credit unions.  Furthermore, shared branching raises fundamental questions about the common bond, notwithstanding the commission recommendation that the common bond remains unchanged.<\/p><p>  However, the fact that shared branching operates apparently successfully in other jurisdictions indicates that this is worth exploring.  It is not a decision to be made quickly as it would need an underpinning framework to be in place before we move in that direction.  If it is the practice in America and if that is the direction in which the international credit union movement is moving then it should be explored but not in this legislation.  <\/p><p>  Perhaps the best way to provide what shared branching seeks to achieve - members being able to access their money - is with the use of debit cards, as Deputy Heather Humphreys suggested.  The changes in the Bill to the additional services provisions on the attached savings will further support credit union debit cards.<\/p><p>  I consider that it would be premature to enshrine shared branching in legislation in the absence of the supporting infrastructure and prudential framework, developed in consultation with all the relevant credit union stakeholders and the Central Bank.  For that reason, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 7.  However, there is merit in the debate.  It is a space into which the credit unions may go in future but in the absence of the architecture to support this initiative and which I have described, it is premature to go there.<\/p><p>  If Deputies wish to press the matter, I am happy to request the credit union advisory committee to examine and report on this issue, in consultation with stakeholders.  If there is an appetite for it which did not come across in the submissions made to the commission, and if it can be done safely, I would be open to looking at it again.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty spoke about the credit union moving into the space where investment in desirable community projects - especially those funded by the State or by local authorities - would be open to credit union investment.  The commission report recommends that a formal process of engagement be established between the credit union representative bodies and the Government, to determine safe ways to invest collective credit union funds into community projects, employment initiatives and small co-operatives.  I remain open to proposals from the credit union movement on this front.  My Department is available to engage with credit union groups and other relevant players to explore what can be done in this area.  There is nothing in law to prevent it.  Primary legislation is not required in order to facilitate this.  It is wise not to limit the scope for projects in this space by confining it to lending projects only.  <\/p><p>  I would like to hear more from the credit unions about the type of projects they have in mind and how they see this working, whether in the form of PPPs, as suggested by the Deputy, or otherwise.  I emphasise that any such project would have to accord with the investment requirements of the Bill.  Legislation is not required to enable them to move into the space as suggested by Deputy Doherty but in the working through of the projects, they would be required to comply with the investment requirements of the Bill.<\/p> <p>The investments would not involve undue risk to members' savings.  It is important to remember that the billions in cash held by credit unions belong to those who save with them.  That money is callable on demand by savers; it is not spare money and cannot be used for double purposes.  It cannot be callable on demand and invested in a PPP at the same time.<\/p><p> The second point is that the potential impact on credit unions, including on liquidity, must be assessed beforehand, as must their financial position.  The third aspect is that the funds to be invested are those which are surplus to need and not immediately required.  Deputies will accept that investment criteria are important.  If a credit union approaches the Department or the Central Bank with an investment project, we will be open to considering it.<\/p><p> It is worth noting that section 44 of the Credit Union Act 1997 provides for a credit union to establish a dedicated fund for social and cultural purposes.  Many credit unions use such funds to support local projects in their areas.  Again, legislation is not required.  However, there are so many credit unions that some of them are not aware of how they are already empowered to do certain things.  I know members are in contact with their local credit unions and perhaps they might highlight this fact to them.  Some credit unions are using the power available to them to establish dedicated funds for social and cultural purposes but others are not. <\/p><p> Given that no change in primary legislation is required to support this initiative, I do not propose to accept the relevant amendments.  However, I invite credit unions to bring forward proposals they have in respect of this matter.  I assure them that they will be assessed with an open mind.<\/p><p> Deputies Heather Humphreys and Billy Timmins referred to debit cards.  I will be in a position to provide a comprehensive response to their concerns in this regard in the context of the next group of amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100009#H00200","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353509100,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The Minister described the proposal contained in amendment No. 11 as relating to shared branching.

I accept what he said, but when representatives from the Irish League of Credit Unions came before us, they requested that the suggested amendment be made.  I am sure Deputy Michael McGrath also received a copy of the amendment from the league.  I understand some credit unions would not be aware of the existence of various funds and possibilities.  I am of the impression, however, that the Irish League of Credit Unions is aware of their existence.  The league has, for some reason, asked that this be explicitly mentioned in the legislation.  I am sure it has been in contact with the officials and may even have been in direct contact with the Minister.  If it is simply the case that there is no requirement for legislation and that provision is already made, that is fine and I will accept it at face value.  I presume the Minister has an understanding of why the league requested that this change be made.  Perhaps he might indicate whether he possesses such an understanding.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 15 is similar to amendments Nos. 12 and 17 and relates to shared services for members.  I welcome the Minister's comments to the effect that this issue will be referred to the Credit Union Advisory Group for consideration.  I regret that this has not happened up to now.  The matter should have been dealt with in the context of the Bill.  I am not sure what will be the interpretation of the credit union sector when we examine what the report has to say about shared services.  Did it simply refer to back-end services?  It must be noted that there may be a different interpretation of the latter.  The Minister's stated intention is that we should seek advice on this matter.  This should be done without delay and we should specify a timeframe for the delivery of such advice.  If the advisory group's response is positive, the Minister should give a commitment to legislate in this matter.<\/p><p>  I am concerned that a clear pathway is not being provided for the credit union movement.  We met senior bank officials in recent times and are aware of the technological advancements being made within the banking system.  All we are referring to in the context of amendment No. 15 is debit cards for credit union members.  The reality is that in the light of the advancements to which I refer, people will not be using debit cards in the future, rather they will use their mobile phones to make financial transactions.  Amendment No. 15 seeks to allow credit unions to establish shared services in respect of something which is probably going to be outdated in a number of years.<\/p><p>  I impress on the Minister the urgency of what we are suggesting.  I would have liked him to have accepted the amendment, with the proviso that the new section could not be commenced without a ministerial order.  The latter would send a positive signal to the effect that this matter was under consideration and had been referred to the advisory group in order to discover how we might ensure the relevant protections, etc., would be put in place.  As stated on Second Stage, we do not oppose the Bill, rather we want to strengthen it.  However, there is concern, scepticism or whatever one wants to call it about the fact that the Bill veers very much to the side of regulation.  That is important because we want robust regulation, but we also want a clear pathway for the credit union movement.  Perhaps the Minister might consider this in tandem with referring the matter to the advisory group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100010#J00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1353509100,"counter":90,"content":"<p>My amendments are similar to the others in the group.

I do not want to question anyone's bona fides in this regard, but will the Minister explain why the credit unions believe there is an impediment to having shared back office services?  Is it simply the case that they do not understand that there is no such impediment?

The Minister said a settlement system between different credit unions was needed, that an underwriting service was required and that there were issues relating to loans being taken out and who was responsible for them.  Those are all reasonable concerns.  The infrastructure and safeguards for credit union members will need to be in place.  However, the important point is that this Bill indicates that the Minister is in favour of facilitating the expansion of these services.  He could easily insert wording into the Bill to indicate that - namely, that we want to move in that direction and to remove any impediment to doing so but that all of those safeguards would have to be put in place first.  The relevant legislation that would govern the provision of such sharing of services in the for-profit banking sector would have to apply where appropriate and so on.  It seems the credit unions are right to want to move in this direction and are disappointed the Bill has failed to do that.  Perhaps it is difficult and complex to put that infrastructure in place.  I do not know that and perhaps the Minister could enlighten me on whether it is very difficult to do so.  I will be keen to hear what the credit unions have to say, but they have expressed disappointment in that regard.  What they are asking for makes sense from the point of view of credit union members and with the aim of providing members of the public with a choice in terms of a different type of financial services.<\/p><p>  On the issue of credit unions' ability to invest in socially beneficial projects that could help create employment and so on, the Minister said he was open to such suggestions.  I am sure that is welcome, but he also seemed to sound a note of caution by saying that credit unions could not put funds in a place where the members would not be able to call their money back on demand.  That is a reasonable point, but what the credit unions have said to me - and I have certainly heard this suggested - is that they would lend the money to the Government at a reasonably low interest rate and the State would guarantee a return on the money.  They would rather lend money to the Government for projects that would stimulate employment and help the domestic economy than have to invest it outside the country, as is currently the case.  I would be interested in the Minister's response to this.  Sallynoggin Credit Union has written to me to say it is now restricted to having 25% of the total value of its investment portfolio deposited with any single institution.  With fewer banks here now, that means it has to put its money in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, and when it has reached the limit of the amount it is allowed put into any one institution, it is left with the rest of the money.  There is nowhere to put it and it must invest it outside the country.  It does not want to do that; it wants to invest the money here.  The credit unions might be able to lend money to the Government at a reasonable interest rate with a guaranteed return, which means such an investment would pose no danger for their members in that they would know their money was safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100011#K00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1353509700,"counter":94,"content":"<p>While I am anxious to have an inclusive debate, the Deputy has made the same point about investments three times in his contribution.

The financial services industry in Ireland has come through a major crisis and every institution involved has been damaged, including the credit union movement.  The Government wants to ensure that the credit union movement is restored in health and reputation and that it carries out the functions it originally carried out.  We are prepared to have a legislative framework within which credit unions operate and we are prepared to use a great deal of taxpayers' money in ensuring they are properly provisioned and, in particular, that those credit unions whose reserves are depleted are restored to good financial health.  Then we want to position them in order that when they are restored to health they can expand their services in the future, but we do not want to push it too far in the first instance.  I have outlined the reason it would be difficult currently for credit unions to provide the kind of front-of-house services that Deputies have suggested: the underlying architecture is not there to do that with safety.  Our first principle must be to protect the savings of the people who put their money into the credit unions.  If we go into shared services at front-of-house there is a risk.  There is no inhibition in law - the credit union movement knows this - to sharing back-office operations.  It is fully aware of that and we will encourage it to do so.  When it comes to discussing whether credit unions should come together, we will certainly encourage the use of shared services and back-office operations.  As to whether I would be prepared to move forward in this regard,  I would like to see this bedded down first and if the credit union movement, or the stronger credit unions out of the totality of credit unions, brought forward a scheme to provide front-of-house operations, we would look at that on its merits, but at present I am not going to give a commitment to that for reasons of prudence but also because, as finance Minister, I am not the only entity involved in this.  The Central Bank has a serious role in the how the credit unions operate.<\/p><p>  This brings me back to Deputy Doherty's question on what might be the basis of a misunderstanding with regard to the difference between what I am saying and how the credit unions briefed him.<\/p> <p>It possibly arises from section 12(3) where it states: &quot;For the purposes of subsection (2)(<i>a<\/i>) the Bank may prescribe investments in which a credit union may invest its funds.  In prescribing matters for the purposes of subsection (2), the Bank may also prescribe other matters in relation to prescribed investments, including any of the following:&quot;.  The concern is with the first clause, (<i>a<\/i>), of subsection (2), which specifies the classes of investments the credit union may invest in.  What the credit unions want is a specific inclusion there that they can invest in State projects, local government projects or PPPs.  The Bill is vesting that decision in the Central Bank.  I do not know what the Central Bank's intention might be but it is its function under the Act to decide on the classes of investment.<\/p><p> The section continues to outline the other measures.  The Deputy can read it himself.  The bank cannot act unilaterally or in an arbitrary way.  Under law it has to consult the credit unions before they prescribe the classes.  It is up to the credit unions to make the case.  If one large credit union wants to be involved in a PPP and it has the resources to do it, and it is not money on-call - it is surplus money - I do not see why the Central Bank would not allow it to do that.  The Central Bank will be the actor, but not arbitrarily.  It will have to consult with the credit union movement before the bank outlines a schedule of classes of investment that would be appropriate for the credit union movement.  That is the basis for the misunderstanding.  That is the space we are in.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, the primary purpose is to protect the investor.  We must protect the savings of the 2 million plus people who claim to be members of the credit union movement.  That is the primary purpose of everything we are doing, while at the same time freeing up the credit union movement to carry out additional services, but those which would not put the savings of their members at risk.  The Deputy referred to the for-profit sections and the banks but the credit unions do pay a dividend and their members are shareholders.  They do not operate on the basis that they want to lose money.  They work on the basis of profit as well and they distribute their profits to their shareholders.  We should not forget that.  That is the model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100011#K02000","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353510300,"counter":112,"content":"<p>In terms of the services to members, I take it the Minister will not accept the amendment but he has gone some way towards it in terms of the advisory group.

I do not wish to name credit unions but the Deputy will be aware of the ones I am talking about.  We must ensure that there is an authorisation process.  The public investments are safer than some of the private investments.  Therefore, on prudential grounds I do not see a reason to prevent such investments.

Therefore, the balance sheets must be firmed up such that the credit unions can compete in a very competitive market and start to pay dividends.

Credit unions already offer ATM cards, and there are a number of changes in the Bill that will make debit cards more available.<\/p><p>  The debit card is a new service.  For credit unions to offer the service, they must apply to the Central Bank.  The current difficulty is that some shareholders in the credit unions have their shares attached to loans.

There are also provisions that simplify the manner in which credit unions will apply for new services.

From my own experience with voluntary organisations, it can be incredibly difficult to find suitable people for these jobs.

Section 15 implements a number of the recommendations set out in chapter 11 of the commission's report, while also retaining certain measures provided for in section 53 of the Credit Union Act 1997.  This section substitutes a new section 53 of the 1997 Act which provides that credit unions should have boards of directors with responsibility for the general control and management of the credit union.  It also sets out the composition of the board of directors, the method of election of members of the board, their term of office and the re-election of retiring directors.  Subsection (3) implements recommendation 11.3.12 of the commission's report, namely, that the board of a credit union shall comprise an odd number of directors, with a minimum of seven and a maximum of 11.  This reduces the current maximum number of directors from 15 to 11.  However, as each director will be required to have the knowledge skill and qualifications necessary to carry out the duties of a director, concerns regarding the number of qualified board members available need to be balanced against the reduction in the number of members required to sit on the board.<\/p><p>  Subsection (7) sets out the term of office of a director.  Subsection (7)(<i>a<\/i>) sets out when the term will begin and subsection (7)(<i>b<\/i>) ensures that the term will not extend beyond the third subsequent AGM. <\/p> <p>These provisions are not new.  They are part of the 1997 Act.  Section 53(7)(<i>c<\/i>) has been amended from that contained in the 1997 Act to include applicable requirements of financial service legislation in line with new fitness and probity measures.  The directors of a credit union are required under this section to have sufficient time to devote to their role and responsibilities associated with their role.  This section prohibits a number of persons from acting as directors, including bodies corporate, persons not of full age, employees, voluntary assistances or members of the board of a credit union committee.  Directors are required under this section to possess the necessary expertise, experience and probity and section 53(13)(<i>b<\/i>) provides that directors may be required to undertake training and development to ensure they have a minimum competence in specific relevant areas.<\/p><p> Although the new section 53(14) of the principal Act is faithful to the report recommendation 11.3.53, it has sparked a great deal of discussion.  The report recommends that board members shall not serve on the board for more than nine years in aggregate in any 15-year period.  For existing board members, the commission recommends that the nine-year period should commence from the date on which the requirement is introduced.  The new section 53(15) ensures existing board members will be able to remain in the position for a further nine years following the enactment of the legislation.  To avoid mass retirement after a nine-year term of office and to ensure experience is retained on boards, the number of directors retiring should, as far as possible, be the same at each AGM.  This section also requires the secretary of a credit union to notify the Central Bank and the board oversight committee when the secretary becomes aware that all the credit union board members intend to resign on the same date.<\/p><p> I do not see a necessity to amend the restrictions to terms of service under the 1997 Act, which have worked well, and Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment is such a case because the restriction proposed is in place.  With regard to the new restrictions, I would like to establish the principle of rotation and I am prepared to listen to the advice of Deputies on how long that should be, but they should bear in mind that the amendment has been presented as if all the directors would have to go when the Bill is enacted and we would have to get new directors in everywhere who could only serve for nine years.  The existing directors can serve another nine years under the section following the enactment of the legislation, and then the rotation will begin.  The existing position prevails and the principle of rotation is the rock I will stand on regarding the new restrictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100017#R01400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353513600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Time served prior to the legislation is not included in the rotation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100018#S00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1353513600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>No, it goes forward.

This is the red line issue for many people.  It affects smaller credit unions because of the small pool from which they have to draw to attain volunteers who meet all the standards laid down in the legislation and previous regulations and the need to ensure the credit union movement survives and thrives in the future.<\/p> <p>These amendments deal with the contentious exclusions from and the limits to credit union boards.  Yesterday in response to a parliamentary question the Minister stated he was not aware of similar exclusions in banking or credit union legislation in other OECD countries.  I believe the reason he is not aware of such legislation is because it does not exist.  Ireland will be unique if we proceed with this section of the Bill and lay down these exclusions.  I understand such exclusions do not operate in Irish banks but I am open to correction on this.<\/p><p> The parliamentary question also dealt with the fact that the Bill is based on the Commission on Credit Unions recommendation and I take this to be a statement of fact.  However, it is important to state the recommendation on the exclusions did not have the support of the credit union movement because the restrictions will particularly hit smaller credit unions and, as has been stated previously when dealing with other amendments, it is very difficult to get volunteers in Irish society.  A huge amount of volunteers do untold excellent work and make a contribution to Irish society, but the credit union competes for volunteers with other sections of society such as the GAA, committees in local communities and political parties.  Many organisations and interests press on people's time.  I understand the intention behind this section but we need to be concerned about its impact.  From the Minister's point of view the intention of the restrictions to be imposed is not to put smaller credit unions out of business but there is no doubt people believe this is the desired intention.  I do not state I share this view.<\/p><p> There is also an issue with regard to the democratic nature of the credit union movement.  Members of a credit union elect people and term limits will limit democracy in the credit union movement.  There would be an outcry, particularly from people here longer than I have been, if we were to introduce legislation that introduced term limits for us.  I will have been here for two years next Monday, but others have been here for much longer.  If somebody wisely suggested we introduce term limits for Oireachtas Members there would be an outcry because we value the fact it is up to the people to decide who to elect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100018#S01800","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353514200,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Term limits are quite common in the United States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100019#T00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1353514200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>That is true.

If he, his advisers or the Central Bank do not feel this is the best set of proposals to reach the desired outcome I would be open to examining proposals made by the Minister.  As Deputy McGrath stated, the Bill proposes restrictions on those who work voluntarily in the credit union.  It also proposes restrictions on people working voluntarily for another organisation serviced by a credit union.  Amendment No. 32 stipulates individuals in arrears for more than 90 consecutive days are not eligible to become directors.  We do not state volunteers should not comply with any of the other regulations laid down or with the test to ensure they are fit and proper to hold responsibility, but there is a failure to recognise, quantify or imagine the problem this could cause to voluntary organisations in small and rural communities which find it extremely difficult because the number of those passionate about credit unions is small.

The Long Title of the Bill states in summary the purpose of the legislation.  It includes the fact that the objective is to change the governance requirements for credit unions by removing certain management functions from the boards of directors of credit unions, providing for a separate management structure and improving the oversight and the general policy functions of boards.  I do not think anyone would disagree with this objective.  It is something that is required to reposition credit unions and ensure they are run, managed and overseen properly.  Most of what is proposed runs directly from the Commission on Credit Unions.<\/p> <p>The groups that had proportionately the most members on that commission were the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, and the other credit union group.  The commission examined this issue in detail.  The exclusions from board membership are specifically recommended in its report, which was co-authored and agreed by the ILCU.  I am not slagging anyone.  I am just setting out the facts of the situation.<\/p><p> Deputy Collins asked why we would make these exclusions.  They are designed to ensure that people are not overseeing their own work or answerable to themselves.  In any kind of management system in a financial institution, people do the work and people oversee it.  In this light and on the specific recommendation of the commission, employees and volunteers of credit unions cannot also be directors.<\/p><p> Regarding the issue of employees and volunteers at other credit unions, members need to have confidence that board members are free from conflicts of duty and loyalty.  A director who is making decisions about business strategy or a possible amalgamation might find it difficult to maintain sufficient objectivity where the decision might also affect the neighbouring credit union where he or she works.  There would be the potential for conflicts of interest.<\/p><p> If the committee believes that this provision goes too far, there is one matter in respect of which I can provide some satisfaction.  There is a provision whereby, if one is a voluntary assistant in one credit union, one cannot be a director of another.  Arguably, this is harsh, as there is no direct conflict.  I could make the argument about voluntary assistants in another credit union, but the risks are much lower, as the assistant has no financial or employment interest at stake.  If the committee believed it appropriate, I could remove voluntary assistants at other credit unions from the list of exclusions.<\/p><p> The effect of amendment No. 29 would be to allow a person to sit on the board of one credit union while being responsible for overseeing the board of another, possibly neighbouring credit union.  In such a case, the person on one board would have full access to the records and documents of a neighbouring credit union and would be able to attend its board meetings.  There is scope for divided loyalties.  This is best avoided if we want to engender confidence in the objectivity of those on board oversight committees.  I note that the National Supervisors Forum, NSF, which represents those who sit on board oversight committees, have not sought this amendment in its submission.<\/p><p> I accept that there are safeguards in the Bill against conflicts of interest and that a member of a board oversight committee at one credit union could bring many skills to the board of another.  I will reflect further on this case.  However, my main priority is to avoid any conflict that might compromise the best interests of credit union members.<\/p><p> If accepted, amendment No. 30 would allow employees of representative groups to sit on credit union groups even where to do so would expose them to potential conflicts of interest.  This exclusion was agreed by the Commission on Credit Unions, including the three credit union groups present that would be affected by it.  On these grounds, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  I note that the ILCU made it expressly clear when it appeared before the committee in September that it had no difficulty with this particular exclusion.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 32 would allow a person who is in arrears for more than 90 consecutive days under a debt obligation to that credit union to sit on its board.  Credit unions are primarily about savings and loans.  A core focus at board level is on lending, provisioning and credit control.  Allowing those with a manifest arrears problem to remain on the board and make key decisions about lending in arrears in the wider credit union creates potential conflicts of interest.  I do not know how someone who is known to be in arrears and is a director of the board can insist on a profile of on-the-nail repayments for other people in arrears.  The Deputy can see the possible conflict.  It may sound harsh in the individual case but, in the general interests of the particular credit union, it is appropriate that this provision should be made.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 33 would allow family members of a voluntary assistant to sit on the board.  This exclusion was specifically recommended by the commission to avoid conflicts of interest where the board member must undertake effective oversight of volunteers, including his or her own family member.  If a young, bright son was an accountant, his mother was on the board and he was overseeing her, there would be a potential conflict.  However, it is not as great a conflict as others.  I will reflect on whether family members of volunteers ought to be removed from this provision, given the fact that the Bill also provides against conflicts of interest and that it will be important to retain scope to draw from a sufficiently wide pool of volunteers.  I may be able to remove the exclusion if I believe that the conflict of interest provisions elsewhere in the Bill are strong enough to afford protection.  If they are not in the first instance, I will examine them to determine whether they need to be strengthened.  I can give ground on this issue.<\/p><p> I have tabled a number of amendments, but we have not reached them yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100019#T00600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353514800,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I might interject.  I have worked in a voluntary capacity for 20 years and have managed voluntary organisations.  Each such organisation has a different context.  We are dealing with financial institutions, which have a determined context.<\/p><p>  Regarding the issue of voluntary assistants, Mr. Charles Handy - an Irishman who is one of the major international authorities on establishing and managing voluntary organisations - would assert that there are different tiers of volunteerism within organisations, be they the credit union movement, the Simon Communities or local GAA clubs.  One can bring kids to a match, be a manager, be on the board, etc.  The essence of what Mr. Handy describes as a psychological contract, that which engages people to do voluntary work, is the reward that they get for their voluntary engagement and the need they meet by engaging.  If this triangulation works, it leads to greater voluntary participation with the organisation.<\/p><p>  I have managed voluntary organisations comprising 100 or 120 people, some of whom were bank managers, some of whom were on the dole.  They did their voluntary work because it gave them a type of reward that they did not get in their day-to-day employment, their retirement, their unemployment, etc.  It gave them a sense of having done something worthwhile.  As laid out, the difficulty with the voluntary assistant provision is that it does not recognise that someone can engage in a credit union in various ways that are not in conflict with one another.  If someone enjoys his or her voluntary work with the credit union, he or she will want to volunteer further.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister re-examine the provision before Report Stage?  Financial conflicts of interest can arise, but the purpose of voluntary engagement, if it works, is to engender further engagement.  What the Minister is proposing tends to run contrary to what was laid out in the voluntary White Paper of approximately ten years ago and to the general voluntary ethos of voluntary organisations across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100020#U00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1353514800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that the Minister will revisit the issue of the prohibition of family members of volunteers from sitting on boards.

I will bank that and move on.<\/p><p>  There are still some matters on which the Minister has not provided me with any comfort.  One is the issue of voluntary assistants in credit unions.  The Minister talked about the possibility of excluding voluntary assistants of other credit unions from the provision, because there would not be a conflict of interest.  He mentioned in particular that there would not be any financial or employment benefit for them, because they are in another credit union.  However, this is too rigid.  There is no definition of a voluntary assistant in the legislation.  I assume a voluntary assistant in a credit union means somebody who helps out in that credit union.  That could extend to somebody who has painted the local credit union because he believes in the credit union.  A parent of his might have worked there or he might have been a young saver in the credit union.  If he decides to help out by painting the building or by coming in and cleaning it at the weekend, he is now not eligible to be a member of the board of directors.  That individual, because he or she assists voluntarily, gets no financial or employment benefit.  The provision is very rigid.  We would like to include voluntary assistants of the credit union.<\/p><p>  The board of directors would more than likely come from the local area, and the majority would be volunteers.  The pool available consists of the people who are volunteering.  The people who are giving of their free time and energy are more likely to do the required training and comply with the different regulations and tests that are laid down.  It is not the person who sits at home and receives their statement every year stating what dividend they will receive and the current position of their loan and savings; it is more likely to be the person who is hands-on and providing his or her time for free because he or she believes in the credit union.  I realise I am preaching to the converted and that the Minister understands volunteerism.  I also understand the conflicts we must prevent.  That is why exclusion is perhaps not the best way, if another amendment is tabled.  The provision is far too harsh in excluding volunteers in credit unions across the board.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this to see if there is another way to deal with it.  Certain rules must be laid down on conflicts of interest.  That could be strengthened to deal with the volunteers as well.  I do not have a solution for the Minister aside from what is here, but I would be open to supporting something else.  For many people it is a red-line issue in the legislation.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Minister's commitment in other areas.  I am not belittling it and I appreciate his genuine approach in expressing his intention to examine the issues.  The other matter he said he would not consider was that referred to in amendment No. 32 - that is, individuals who are in arrears for 90 days consecutively.  I understand the Minister's point about deciding on rates for people who are in arrears and what structures should be put in place.  If somebody is a saver in a credit union, the directors would also have a benefit there.  This refers to subsection (11).  We are dealing with subsection (10), which gives the list of exclusions.  However, it does not stop there, because subsection (11) provides that a person who would not be fit to be appointed as a director to the credit union must resign.  Subsection (10) outlines the people who are not fit to be appointed as directors.<\/p><p>  I understand the validity of the Minister's argument about somebody who is in arrears and so forth, but consider an instance in which I, for example, am an existing director of the credit union and I work as a Deputy.  Let us say I have a loan from the credit union and I lose my job.  My financial situation has become dire and I am in arrears for three months.  I am still making payments to pay off the loan, but I am still in arrears because I cannot make the full payment.  It means I must resign as a director of that credit union.  Consequences flow from the exclusions set down here.  Again, I believe it is a little too regimental.  I do not believe somebody who might have provided eight or nine years of service as a director, who has gone through all the training and skills improvement and who might be the key person there - sometimes there are a number of key persons within the credit union - should have to resign because of something that happens externally and causes a financial imposition.  It might not even be the loss of a job; it could be due to a child getting sick or some other situation.  The provision is too rigid in stating that after 90 days one must resign one's seat on the board.  Perhaps the Minister would examine that again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100021#V00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1353515400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>To refer back to the issue of directors and voluntary assistants, there must be a clear line between the board of directors and the people who work in the credit union.

As Deputy Doherty said, that means that if one painted the place or the like, one cannot serve on the board.  It appears to be a huge missed opportunity.  The Minister could consider tightening the definition to something approximating being a substantive volunteer or volunteering on a weekly basis.  I cannot suggest an exact wording but it should make it clear that if one painted the place in June or got involved in some activity for the credit union, it does not preclude one from being a member of the board.  On the other hand, section 11 suggests that the directors on the board cannot volunteer even in an <i>ad hoc<\/i> way, or they must resign.

The opening position is that we want to strengthen the credit union movement.  One of the weaknesses identified was governance.  As members know from their experience, governance varied from very good to not so good.  Volunteers are absolutely vital but there are only 18 credit unions out of over 400 that are totally operated by volunteers.  It is not as big a volunteer organisation as frequently presented.  There are many employees on good salaries working in the credit union movement.  Some of the individual credit unions have become quite large.  The principle of strengthening governance was put to the commission, which made a series of recommendations.  The central principle of the new governance position is that people cannot be answerable to themselves.  I understand Deputy Heather Humphreys was a manager of a credit union.  She said that one must separate the board of directors from the people working in credit unions.  As long as we maintain the principle, I am flexible on the categories.  Perhaps we can examine the definition of voluntary assistant on page 9.  Deputy Pearse Doherty gave us a prose version of it, which is close to what is in the Bill: \"&lsquo;voluntary assistant&rsquo; in relation to a credit union, means a member of the credit union who, although not a remunerated employee of the credit union, is engaged in any way in the operation of the credit union.\"  That excludes the painter because the painter is not engaged in the operation of the credit union.  The final clause is very confining.  The exclusion in the Act is that someone cannot be a director and a volunteer at the same time.  The person can move seamlessly from one to the other but cannot hold the two roles simultaneously.  That is helpful to the debate.<\/p><p>  I can see a lot of embarrassment for someone who had served for a long time and then inadvertently fell into arrears, especially in a small community.  I will examine an alternative way around it.  If we allowed credit unions, within their rules, to make provision for the exclusion of persons in arrears from the board of directors or from other functions in the operation of the credit union, it would be a more discreet way of doing it.  I am not making a commitment at this stage because I will have to run it by the Attorney General but I am committing to examine that line of approach rather than the direct exclusion in the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100022#W00400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1353516000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>If people were in some resolution process or in negotiation about putting a resolution process in place, perhaps they could be allowed to see out directorships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100022#W00500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1353516000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I am inclined to leave that matter to the rules of the credit union.

With regard to the practicalities, this legislation will be passed before Christmas and will be signed by the President.

Existing directors can then go forward every three years for re-election and can continue to serve until 2023.

If we change it to four years, we will not implement the commission recommendation, although as legislators we are entitled to do so.

When he changed the party's constitutional rules, we had chairmen of branches who had been in place since the party was founded or even ten years prior to that, dating back to 1922.  We were told then the sky would fall in if we implemented the new rules as small branches would not find volunteers to serve.  Once we renewed the rules, we had a rush of volunteers, including many young people.

I am pleased the Minister has agreed to change the position in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100024#Y00200","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1353517200,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's commitment to extend the number of years a director may serve in a 15-year period.  On subsections (15) and (16), I agree that renewal is good.  Nobody in the credit union movement wants the same people to remain in place permanently.  The problem, however, is that this sometimes becomes the reality because the pool of people available to serve as directors is small.  All genuine members of credit unions would like to have a rush of people seeking to become members and directors.<\/p><p>  Why could the Minister or I not table an amendment on Report Stage to write into the legislation a provision that subsections (15) and (16) will be complied with in full, except in circumstances where the approval of the Central Bank is obtained?  This would allow limited flexibility on the three-year and nine-year limits on terms of office, which the Minister has agreed to change to four and 12 years, respectively.  I propose that where it is not possible to comply with the limits laid down in the Bill, the Central Bank would have the final say.  Such a measure would allow for a set of circumstances that may never arise but would put the minds of members of credit unions at ease as it would allow them to make a case to the Central Bank when unforeseen circumstances arise.  If, for example, asking an officer to step down at the end of a four-year term could have a detrimental impact on the credit union in question because there are no other candidates available for the position, the credit union could make a case to the Central Bank.  Allowing such flexibility would not open the floodgates and the principle of renewal would be maintained.  It would give small credit unions the safety net of being able to make a case and have the Central Bank make a judgment call.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100024#Y00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1353517200,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Speaking extemporarily, if the Deputy were to draft an amendment for Report Stage, confine its import to tier one credit unions and refer to the Registrar of Credit Unions rather than the Central Bank, I would consider it on its merits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012112100024#Y00400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1353517200,"counter":299,"content":"<p>The Minister is taking a reasonable approach to many of the issues raised and the proposed amendments.

The proposal to impose limits on periods of service has provoked a major reaction from the credit unions.  The Irish League of Credit Unions, the representative body of credit unions, has acknowledged that it did not expect this response from member credit unions when it participated in discussions of the issue at the Commission on Credit Unions.  The publication of the draft legislation provoked a major reaction, which may have been partly because the credit unions believed the proposal undermined the democratic principle that members should make decisions of this nature.  Why should these limits apply to credit unions when they do not apply to banks?  Why is it necessary to make a special provision and apply term limits which restrict the right of members to make decisions about who they want on boards and as principal officers?  I apologise to the Minister if he has answered my questions.

There could be a role for such a person, perhaps on a finance committee of the board that would examine the figures being presented to the board by the manager.

The position in the Democratic Republic of  the Congo is one of the most extreme examples of such stories.  Its colonial history is appalling and it has had a history of corrupt dictator governments.  The instability of the Great Lakes region of Africa of which it is a part and competition for control of its rich natural resources have all combined to put it in the last place on the 2011 human development index.  That shows how volatile and serious is the situation there.  The figures are shocking.  Some 5 million people have died as a direct result of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of  the Congo since 1998.  Around 500,000 people continue to die there each year mostly from preventable and curable diseases and 50% of recorded deaths are of children who make up 19% of the population.  The incidence of rape, especially of women and girls, is not quantified but is enormous and 1.8 million people are displaced within the country, 655,000 in the past seven months alone.  The Democratic Republic of  the Congo has one of the most serious humanitarian crises in the world and needs a level of public and political awareness and commitment that has been lacking to date in many institutions.  I hope that through today's meeting we can contribute to the awareness of the country which, under the right conditions, could be an enormous powerhouse and a regional and global force for peace and stability.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to note the European Union Foreign Affairs committee discussed the Democratic Republic of  the Congo, among other things, at its meeting two days ago in Brussels, and has invited the High Representative of the Commission to bring forward proposals for a strategic EU approach to the multifaceted security and development challenges facing the eastern Democratic Republic of  the Congo.  The committee will have an opportunity at 5 p.m. to discuss the Council's conclusions with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I am sure the Democratic Republic of  the Congo and the Gaza are the two main issues to be discussed.  I am pleased we have the opportunity to discuss the Democratic Republic of  the Congo following the television production because it has focused in on the matter of human rights and people are interested in this type of documentary.  <\/p><p>  Before I invite Mr. Peadar King to make his presentation I advise that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at the committee.

There is very little democracy and whether it is a republic begs the question.  I went to the Congo for the first time in March 2012.  I was looking forward to going there because the Congo has a real resonance for Irish people not least because in November 1960 the first Irish peacekeepers lost their lives there.  While there I met some of the MONUSCO forces and told them the first casualties that Ireland experienced were in the Congo.  I was also speaking with a general within the force who is from India and he said that the first casualties that India encountered were also in the Congo, in the same month and in the same region as the Irish forces lost their lives.<\/p><p>  Another reason the Congo has a resonance for me is that I used to teach English.  One of the novels on the course was<i> Heart of Darkness<\/i> by Joseph Conrad, which has become a metaphor for the whole of the country.  Students found it trying.  It is a compelling novel, dense and difficult, but the core the seemingly intractable problem at the heart of Africa was accessible to students.  A whole range of other books have come on stream recently which give good insights into Africa.  The reality from my experience in March is that nothing prepares one for what one encounters in the Congo.  As the Chairman has said, we have filmed in more than 30 countries in the six series of  &quot;What in the World&quot;.  It is not that there is some kind of macabre competition between countries for the worst atrocities that is not what it is but equally it is the case that what we experienced and encountered in the Congo was dispiriting and it gripped us in terms of what appeared to be the hopelessness of the situation.  When I returned I was determined not just to make the film and to get it on air, in collaboration with RTE, but to try to engage with the public in raising issues.<\/p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, I spoke to a number of Senators and Deputies at an informal gathering in Leinster House.  Some of the members present at this meeting attended our launch in the Irish Aid centre.<\/p><p> I am not trying to set up one country against another.  In other countries we have visited, we have heard terrible stories.  Two in particular stand out.  I interviewed a woman in Burma.  We had entered the country illegally.  She described with extraordinary grief the death of her children during her flight from the Burmese military.  She was forced to bury them in the forest of the Burmese highlands, then abandon them.  One could not but be moved by that.  In the recent documentary on Timor-Leste, Mr. Nelson Belo discussed the torture that he experienced at the hands of the Indonesians during the almost 25-year occupation of that country.<\/p><p> Throughout our time making this, we have heard horrific and gripping testimonies of the kinds of inhumanity to which people are subjected.  However, the Congo touched me and others working with me in a way that made us determined to try to raise it as an issue.  We are grateful, therefore, to have this opportunity to discuss the experience of the Congolese with the committee.  It has been some experience.<\/p><p> Some of the critical issues have been highlighted.  In one decade, 5.4 million people - this extraordinary figure bears repeating - have been killed in a country that has not seemed to feature in broader international discourse, at least until recently.  In July 2011, I watched the news and read the newspapers.  At the meeting at which I spoke a number of weeks ago, I referred to an air crash in the Congo in which 45 people were killed in July 2011.  The story was covered by all Western media.  I do not want to understate the sadness and trauma suffered by the families of those 45 people, but neither should we underestimate the sadness and trauma suffered by the families of the 5.4 million people whose lives have been lost.  I was trying to make sense out of why 45 people's lives were spoken about and recorded across the Western media while 5.4 million other people's lives were not.  I reached a speculative conclusion - namely, that people who travel in aeroplanes are people like us.  We can identify with them.  It is difficult for us to identify with people who are killed in the bush and rural areas - the poor, the dispossessed and the disfavoured - and, therefore, we do not respond to their deaths.  I do not want to get involved in self-congratulations, but RTE is prepared to find a space within its broadcasting schedule to make available programmes such as ours.<\/p><p> In addition to highlighting the scale of the killings in the Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC, and the humanitarian crisis, I want to put the situation in context.  The Congo is unique in Africa in that it was once the personal fiefdom of King Leopold II.  Oireachtas Members are used to travelling back and forth to Brussels for their work.  The reality is that the splendour of the administrative capital of the EU is built on the exploitation of the Congo.  There is another reality, in that one of the justifications for the First World War was the defence of small nations, yet that small nation was plundering and pillaging a large nation in central Africa.  This reality seemingly never registered at the time.<\/p><p> We are discussing a legacy issue from the colonial period and it is important to see the conflict in this light.  The conflict in the Congo has been ongoing since the 1870s.  It is not a conflict that arose following independence or the recent upsurge in violence.<\/p><p> The crisis has deepened in recent weeks.  When we made the film, we based ourselves in Goma.  On Tuesday, the M23 militia, which is really an offshoot of the National Congress for the Defence of the People, CNDP, walked into Goma - abandoned by the army and overseen by the UN forces there - and took it over.  It is extraordinary that, in the 21st century, a militia can simply walk into a city of 1 million people in the presence of UN peacekeepers with little international outcry against it.  There has been some outcry, and I do not want to underestimate what occurred at the European Council of Ministers on Monday.  The T&aacute;naiste will attend this committee to discuss that meeting.  However, the Chairman alluded to the reality, namely, 50,000 people have fled Goma in recent days in search of personal security.<\/p><p> Sometimes, the numbers can be so great that they lose their impact in terms of what a situation means for individual families, neighbourhoods and so on.  Since I circulated the paper to members, the number of people displaced in the Congo has been increasing daily from 2.2 million.  This has triggered a blame game about who is responsible.  The geopolitical issues are complicated, but there is no doubt about the pivotal role played by Rwanda in the upending and disruption of the Congo.  This can go without challenge.  Actually, that is probably not true, as every statement is subject to challenge, but Rwanda's role is beyond contestation, in my opinion at least.  We must understand this involvement in the context of the Rwandan genocide of 1994.  The conflict in the eastern part of the Congo is a direct result of that.<\/p><p> It is a question of legacy issues.  There is a reluctance to consider them.  There is also a sense that, once a political agreement has been made, the problems are sorted as if the people involved in a conflict situation can automatically transform themselves and rebuild their lives without attending to the terrible traumas that they suffered.  Rwanda and, in particular, its President, Paul Kagame, and Government need to be held accountable by the international community for their involvement in the disruption and fragmentation of society in the eastern Congo.  Nor is Uganda blameless.  It must also be held accountable.<\/p><p> I will move away from the questions of who is responsible and who are the main players and revert briefly to two issues.  I hope I am not going over my time.<\/p> <p> There were two issues in particular that really struck a chord with us.  One of these is the use of rape as a weapon of war.  It is quite extraordinary.  Ms Margot Elisabeth Wallstr&ouml;m, the former United Nations special representative on sexual violence, has called eastern Congo the rape capital of the world.  Before we came before the committee, Mr. Clarken and I were discussing a centre in Bukavo which Ms Hillary Clinton visited in 2009 and to which the US gave $17 million.  It has treated 30,000 women.  We had planned to go there but for security reasons we could not travel.  We were really hemmed in at Goma, although those who saw the film know we got to Katanga and Sake.  Interestingly, Sake fell to the militia last evening.<\/p><p> The director of the rape centre in Bukavo, who has been nominated for a Nobel peace prize, was subject to an assassination attempt in the past three weeks.  The possibilities of who was responsible for the assassination attempt are endless; it could have been the Congolese Government, which does not want the issue highlighted, or the Rwandan militia, etc.  It is difficult for a man to discuss rape and its impact, although all rape is brutal.  What the women and girls - and to a lesser extent, men and boys - are subjected to was described in the film as being treated \"like wood\".  It was an extraordinary analogy from a worker at Heal Africa.<\/p><p> There is the scale and intensity of rape, as well as its appalling brutality and the normalisation of the act.  A study by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative has described a 17-fold increase in rape in the past five years.  It is argued that because it has become so normalised, it has spilled into the civilian population, and the dramatic increase in the incidence of rape is a by-product of the kind of lawlessness and chaos that characterises life in eastern Congo.<\/p><p> I will touch on a second area that we will return to, the use of child soldiers.  Child soldiers are recruited across the board by the Congolese army and the various militia, and it is impossible to put numbers on them.  There are approximately 30,000 children who are caught up in the conflict in eastern Congo, some as young as seven or eight.  They are recruited and fed alcohol and drugs.  We interviewed two such child soldiers, and it is interesting that they were brought back to the communities from where they came, and this is where they killed and committed all kinds of atrocities.  This was not just in other communities but their own communities.  It is known who is responsible for these actions, and they should be brought before the International Criminal Court.  There is a big onus on the court to act on the matter.<\/p><p> I am sorry if I have exceeded my time.  In making this presentation, there are three real outcomes that I personally would like to see resulting from the meeting.  As the Chairman indicated, there is a meeting in March of the chairmen of all the foreign affairs committees which Baroness Catherine Ashton, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, will attend.  It is critical that at the meeting, the conflict and humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo be on the agenda.  That platform or vehicle should be used to highlight the appalling atrocities happening in Congo.<\/p><p> My colleagues also have preferred outcomes, including humanitarian relief, and we can come to those later.  A second outcome should arise from Ireland's election to the UN Human Rights Council.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade describes the country's objectives in this regard, with three countries mentioned specifically.  I would like to see Congo included.  I know the position of women is mentioned specifically as an Irish objective, and under that heading the position of women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo can be addressed.  As this is such a serious issue, there is a case for the Democratic Republic of the Congo to be included.<\/p><p> Once every ten years there is an opportunity in chairing the European Union - as will happen in the first six months of 2013 - and I would like to see the Congo on the agenda of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and discussed by Heads of State when they meet in Dublin Castle next year.  I urge the committee, through its offices and debates in both Houses, as well as representations to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to see that the issue be attended to as a matter of priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100003#B01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peadar King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353511200,"counter":612,"content":"<p>A small delegation of this committee will travel to Geneva next month to the UN Human Rights Council and I am sure the issue will be raised.

If they had interfered, it would probably have caused more bloodshed in the region and they want to avoid that.

I have seen the film.  We must go further than showing what is going on, although I know some steps have already been outlined.  I have some comments relating not just to Congo but other countries in Africa as well, and this comes from me chairing the Irish section of the Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa, AWEPA.<\/p><p>  There is a real irony that resource-rich countries perform more poorly than resource-poor countries; this is the \"paradox of plenty\".  I read recently that a company in Congo, Sodimico, sold 30% of its mining stakes via direct negotiation at &euro;30 million.  London securities firms valued this at &euro;1.6 billion.  There is no doubt that Congo is resource-rich but, as with other African countries, those resources are not being returned to the people.  The EU accounting and transparency directives for extractive industries are key and I hope the Irish Government will strongly support them.  There should be a strong binding of the directives.<\/p> <p>We know that Africa could solve all our problems if its mineral resources were handled in an ethical and efficient way.  Allied with that there must be country-by-country and project-by-project reporting and if that does not happen we can whistle \"Dixie\" and there will be no change in Africa.<\/p><p> We met a delegation of ministers from the Congo recently and I came out of that meeting feeling positive.  I heard from them what was happening in the country.  They acknowledged the difficulties but there was a belief that things were moving yet now we come here and there is again this disconnect that bears no reality to what is happening on the ground.  There is no question, as I said that day, that the Congo shows one of the worst excesses of imperialism.  It is just the carving up of Africa for the benefit of Europeans.  My point is about the resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100005#D00300","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353511800,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. King or any of the other witnesses to answer that question.

The UN peacekeeping forces are largely made up of members of armies from countries such as India and Bangladesh and other countries which do not have the resources to create these elite armed forces that are often what is needed to be able to pursue the kind of rebel armies we see here.  Part of the problem is that it is very difficult to tackle rebel armies when they are dispersed and they use guerilla tactics.  One of the aspects affecting Munesco in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC, is that its mandate directs it to accompany the Congolese army and the Congolese army by its nature is extremely weak and fragmented.  The Congolese army received, through a demobilisation and reintegration programme, 220,000 former ex-combatants from different rebel groups and that creates a command and control problem within the army itself.  It is important to bear in mind also that the average soldier in the DRC army is paid $30 a month, when actually paid.  There are major issues, therefore, around discipline and professionalism within the army and Munesco's role is to accompany that army and not go beyond it.<\/p><p>  We believe that Munesco must clearly focus on its role of protecting civilians and that must be constantly emphasised.  In the current context in Goma, with 1 million inhabitants, although 50,000 have left, how will those civilians be protected because they do not have any protection?  We believe that a reinforcement of Munesco's mandate focusing on civilian protection but also on reinforcing and rebuilding the reform of the security sector is something that is key and the international community, including the European Union, must re-emphasise that work through technical assistance, funding and political support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caoimhe de Barra"},{"type":"speech","time":1353511800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  The biggest problem in discussing a major issue such as this one is that people despair about it.  The point was made that we had a situation where there was political agreement or that peace had broken out but we know from other areas throughout the world that peace is a process and is not something that happens overnight.  That reinforces the view that it must be supported and worked upon.  The last time I spoke to the witnesses many positive things were happening in the country.  The takeover lately by the M23 rebel group is a major negative but positive things were happening within the country.  Large areas of the country had some stability but it has moved on from that.<\/p><p>  This issue must come down to the UN.  There is a huge UN force in the country but its mandate does not cover this issue.  I asked about the rapes on the previous occasion.  Rape was taking place approximately 20 km from the UN force but the victims must go through the police first and the police have to ask them questions.  By the time they get to the UN force, even if they go in, the awful atrocities have already happened in that area.  I agree we must change the mandate but the worst thing that can happen is that we despair.  Many positive things can be done.<\/p><p>  In terms of all the players, the Chinese and the Americans are in the country.  All the imperialists are there and they all have their fingers in different pies.  They are all looking after their own resources in regard to this and the only stake we appear to have is that we want to help the people and ensure they are not exploited.  That is the positive role we can play.  There must be a role we can play whether it is in Europe, the UN or wherever but the mandate must change.  We have seen the atrocities that happened in other regions in the past but I cannot get my head around the numbers involved here, namely, 5.4 million killed, 2.2 million displaced and the number of rapes.  The numbers are too great.  All the different aid organisations are working in that atmosphere and there is a responsibility on all of us not to despair and to realise there are solutions.  The racists would say there is a role for the white man to move into the country and sort it out but we know from its history about the role of the white man, including King Leopold and the Belgians, in creating much of this conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100006#E00400","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1353511800,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Oxfam is working in the DRC and therefore Mr. Clarken might want to comment on that aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100006#E00500","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353511800,"counter":619,"content":"<p>We cannot afford to despair.

It is the biggest conflict in the world since the Second World War and it is not reported in any newspaper or any news programme with the exception of great pieces of work being done on it elsewhere.  It should be an issue we are dealing with and speaking about all the time.<\/p><p>  To update the committee on the current position, as of this morning the town of Sake has also fallen.  This particular militant group is now moving further and it is a real concern.  Approximately 120,000 additional people are displaced.  To be technical about it, they are being pushed out of internally displaced camps; they are internally displaced within the Congo.  They now have nowhere to go.  They are moving across the border into Rwanda and other places.  This is a crisis that is getting worse but it has been at that shocking level for many years.  Occasionally, it raises its head and then dips again and collectively internationally we forget about it.  That is not acceptable.  <\/p><p>  We must put pressure on here at home for it to be raised.  To be fair, the Government, Irish Aid and others have been very supportive, and members of this committee are very interested in the issue.  Holding the EU Presidency and within the Council we will have an amazing opportunity to do more and to raise it in a number of other fora but we must put extreme pressure now on the parties to the conflict to ensure there is humanitarian access.  We must be able to save lives today and tomorrow.  We were speaking with staff on the ground this morning who are in a precarious position.

It is important such matters are spoken about bluntly in order to get to the nub of the problem.  We all have constituents from the Congolese community and they tell us about these matters.  Sometimes we do not believe them and we think they are exaggerating but they are not.  The film \"Black Hawk Down\" gives an indication of what happens when law and order break down completely, as has happened.  Deputy Sean Crowe referred to the mining companies and the American and Chinese interests in the country.  They have been there for many years and the existence of resources is a problem.  The international community must find means to put responsibility on outside interests, which are profiting by their presence there, to ensure some semblance of law and order is restored for the benefit of people living there.<\/p><p>  I am loth to criticise the UN but it has failed to deal with this kind of situation.  Some years ago in Srebrenica, when safe havens were being defended, the UN stood down.  It was suggested the UN did not have the heavy armaments required so NATO came in to do the job.  This situation is slightly different.  The international community is loth to get involved militarily in the same way because of the experience in Rwanda.  The UN has the same problem.  Some means must be found to put as much pressure as possible on international companies working and making profits there.  They are from all over the world, not just China, the United States and Belgium.

We should use whatever influence we can.  The T&aacute;naiste will speak to the commitee later.  The mining companies are very wealthy.  In an adjoining country, we saw resources are readily available to the international community in the mining business but resources are not available to the same extent to facilitate people in towns where there are no roads, no footpaths, no public lighting and no sanitation services.  In that climate, it is not possible to have a semblance of order.  It does not work.

It has been stated time and again when we are discussing international conflicts that we as westerners and Europeans cannot impose a solution on a situation such as this.  Deputy Crowe referred to the fact previously.  We can use our influence and we have a considerable moral responsibility in the European Union in particular given the colonial past.  Who is shouting \"Stop\"?  We have a country that is mineral-rich that has an enormous amount of resources at its disposal.

We have talked about the dehumanisation of women by rape and now we are talking about young girls being dehumanised and exposed to all of the excesses of conflict.  If we are to have any confidence in the future of the Congo, while it might sound like a clich&eacute;, it will involve the young people and empowering women.

There is a European dimension through King Leopold and the appalling things that happened in that regard.<\/p> <p>It is because it is so rich that this has happened to it.  <\/p><p> I accept what Jos&eacute; Ramos-Horta said.  This does not happen just because of the existence of this wealth.  One must also consider the evil of people.  One has to deal with the people.  The mineral wealth is not responsible; the greed of people is.  One has to change and challenge that psychology.  <\/p><p> In King Leopold's day it was rubber.  Now it is coltan and molybdenum.  It was copper in Katanga.  Can we have a list of the companies involved so that we can help to persuade some groups, and even states, to disinvest?  It is helpful to have those facts.  We will all do as much as we can in fighting the evil in the Congo.  <\/p><p> Mr. King mentioned Joseph Conrad, but he had a colleague, Roger Casement.  As Irish people, we can urge our Government to follow the individual lead of Casement.  It was he who highlighted the horror on the international stage and, despite the objections and reservations of the European establishment, forced it into the public consciousness.  Once it was forced there it was eventually addressed. <\/p><p> My first question is about the UN mandate.  Does it need to be rectified?  I think that, obviously, it does.  Will that make any great difference?  With regard to rape, I was glad Mr. King mentioned men and boys as well.  I heard on a radio broadcast a young man speaking about the experience of being raped.  The experience is significantly psychologically different, although parallel, from that of women because of the status of men in society.  There is unbearable shame and agony even in trying to talk about it because it is seen as such a disgrace and horror.  Of course it is so for women as well, but there is a difference.  <\/p><p> I have a motion in the Seanad about sexual violence in conflict.  I would be grateful for any facts Mr. King can give Senators, through me.  I will give them to my colleagues.  Mr. King mentioned the 30,000 women who have been treated in the centre in Bukavo.  Again, it is interesting that there was no mention of men.  He also referred to a Harvard study.  If we could have some reference for that it would be helpful.  <\/p><p> Mr. King mentioned Mr. Paul Kagame and the involvement of Rwanda.  How can we get him to the International Criminal Court?  I do not think the court itself has a mechanism to arraign people and summon them to appear.  I think cases have to be reported.  How can we, as a small country - perhaps using our EU Presidency - have an impact in bringing him before the court, or at least in indicting him and showing some degree of condemnation?  It is astonishing that the people of what is probably the richest country in the world, in natural resources, are the poorest in the world. <\/p><p> The dynamics are similar to what is happening in the Middle East, where there is also European involvement.  We solved our problem at the expense of the Palestinians.  There is similar dehumanising and neglect unless there is a flare-up of violence.  I stand with Tr&oacute;caire on the question of goods from the illegal settlements being imported into this country.  I am in possession of opinion from senior counsel in Ireland and counsel in Britain to indicate there is no impediment in this country to declaring an embargo on those goods.  It is not illegal.  I hope to be back at this meeting in time to ask the T&aacute;naiste about this and present that legal opinion to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100007#F00600","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353513000,"counter":629,"content":"<p>That is a separate issue, Senator Norris, but I will let you away with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100008#G00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1353513000,"counter":630,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.

As a journalist, he poses the question whether the Democratic Republic of the Congo is democratic or a republic.  As parliamentarians we must recognise that this is an emerging democracy.  Joseph Kabila has been elected in two consecutive elections and the people, therefore, have spoken.<\/p><p>  I start on that point because we must treat the Government in Kinshasa seriously as a player in the ultimate solution to the problem.  As a media person, Mr. King will know the world does not focus on the Congo to the extent it should.  If a settler's child is killed in Israel and a thousand Palestinian children are killed in the occupied territories, how will the western media balance those two events?  Hurricanes may be killing thousands of people in places like Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica but the media will run with news of the few boats that have been wrecked on the coast of the United States.  Journalists might ask themselves why this is so.  <\/p><p>  I have a vested interest in the Congo.  I lived there on two occasions, in 1970 and 1974, and I travelled extensively throughout the Congo.  The film brought back the beauty of the Congo for me.  There are key players in this.  The Congo is a vast country of about 71 million people.  The region where the conflict exists is a tiny proportion of a very underdeveloped country.  Infrastructure in the Congo is practically non-existent outside certain areas.  The concentration is in the Guma and Kiva areas because of the mineral resources.  It is not only because of the mineral resources, but also because of the adjoining neighbours.  The key players on this occasion are Rwanda and Uganda.<\/p><p>  Rwanda has had a man from its government elected to the UN Security Council for 12 months.  Mr. King mentioned that the Security Council has taken a position.  Rwanda is playing a very important, dangerous and destructive role there.  To state the problem simplistically, concluding the geopolitical issues requires the governments of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.  The Ugandans are still chasing Joseph Kony in the Gulu district of northern Uganda and Zaire.  We can reassure ourselves with the fact that Charles Taylor has been found guilty in Liberia and sentenced to 50 years' imprisonment.  He was also found guilty of offences related to two issues that have been raised today, which are the kidnapping of soldier brides and the recruitment of child soldiers.  There is already international recognition that it is a crime to kidnap women to turn them into brides of soldiers.  I thank Mr. King for bringing these issues to our attention again.  We had known about them but it is helpful to be focused on these issues occasionally.  <\/p><p>  At its November meeting, the Foreign Affairs Council seems to have adopted progressive positions and to understand the role Europe must play in providing assistance..  Whom did the Council assist?  We sit here and talk about the white man and the United Nations and so on.  Of course they have roles to play.  As the world's political dynamic unravels it is important to recognise the responsibility of Arab countries for policing, monitoring and engaging in human rights in the Arab countries, and they are doing so very successfully.  We must also recognise the role of the African Union.  All of Africa is not in turmoil as this region is.  The African Union has a key and, I hope, a leadership role to play in bringing the key players of the Congo and Rwanda, Uganda and the international agencies of the United Nations together.<\/p><p>  I thank Mr. Peadar King and Ms Mair&eacute;ad N&iacute; Nuadh&aacute;in for their thought-provoking film.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100008#G00400","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1353513000,"counter":632,"content":"<p>Mr. King and Ms N&iacute; Nuadh&aacute;in, what co-operation did you get in making the programmes from government, local government and non-governmental agencies working in the Congo?

RTE is very proud of this series and of all the series we have done to date with Peadar King.  Not to take the limelight off Peader, but we have done other series.  We collaborated with Irish Aid on a number of series a couple of years ago called \"Far Away Up Close\".  There were different presenters for the series.  To echo what Deputy Eric Byrne said, some of those series focused on some very positive stories out of Africa.  It is not all war and turmoil.  There are some very good business stories, for example, emanating from certain parts of Africa.  We also did \"What in the World?\".  We have done several programmes under the multicultural banner, such as \"Welcome to my World\".  There was also the radio series that preceded this one by many years which was presented by Rodney Rice.  It was transmitted by RTE but I think it was completely funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  There have been some great collaborations over the years.  I pay tribute to the other agencies, charities and NGOs that co-fund this series with RTE and Irish Aid.  It is a good collaboration.<\/p><p>  Peadar has gone on record as saying that he has started the seventh series, so it appears we have commissioned it.  In advance, I thank everybody who has promised money.  Perhaps I should put the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the spot and also thank it.  We would be happy to do another series.  When we get figures for a television audience we can say that those people watched that programme.  If one can reach 70,000 to 90,000 people with a programme such as this, it is a tremendous number of people to engage in that story and one can be sure they are watching it with interest.

I had a meeting with officials of the Irish Aid section in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade this morning to discuss funding for the next series.  I hope we get it, but that remains to be seen.  I also acknowledge the contribution the non-governmental organisations make to the funding of this series.  Finally, we also get cross-denominational support from religious congregations, mainly Catholic but also Methodist, Church of Ireland, the Baha'i and the Presbyterian churches, to whom I spoke a few days ago.  They are considering getting involved as a funder.  What is really interesting is that the trade unions are now coming on board as funders.  The Public Service Executive Union, PSEU, contributes to it and the Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union, SIPTU, has committed to making a financial contribution to the next series.

Deputy Eric Byrne spoke about the elections.  Of course, elections have taken place, most recently last November.  There are questions about the veracity of the elections.  Various international bodies question the legitimacy of the elections and the process under which they take place.  The difficulty is that if one challenges the legitimacy of the elections, whoever is elected does not have the legitimacy of the people's vote.  There is that mismatch between the governing parties, the elected President and the people.  It is a form of democracy.  It is a limited and, in my view, flawed form that is operating.  It was in that context I made the comments about the democratic republic.<\/p><p>  To refer to Deputy Crowe's opening comments about positive things, I take the point he made.  Clearly, in every situation there are developments that must be acknowledged.  Equally, however, unless we recognise the misery and harshness of life for the civilian population as our starting point and unless we confront that in all its awfulness, we will not work towards building the type of positive outcomes to which the Deputy aspires.  The statement that I made today, and perhaps even the statement I was making in the film, reflects that desire to draw public attention to the bleakness of the current situation with a view to garnering public attention and some type of determination to try to build and move away from that bleak situation.<\/p><p>  Senator Norris has left but his comments about Roger Casement were well made.  There is a reference to Roger Casement in the film.  Casement's report from the Congo prior to 1902 is regarded as the first human rights report ever written.  Irish people should be proud that one of the great iconic figures from Irish history was the author of one of the first human rights reports.  His report is available online if anybody wishes to see it.<\/p><p>  Members made a number of other comments, but I do not have the time to address them.  I hope that is sufficient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100009#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peadar King"},{"type":"speech","time":1353513600,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Clarken and Ms de Barra to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100009#H00800","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353513600,"counter":641,"content":"<p>We might have started something today, as well as continuing things we have been talking about for some time.  It is really important that Peadar and RTE are raising awareness of this outside of our sector, as it were, in addition to ourselves as agencies involved on the ground.  Now, there is an opportunity for the committee, as public representatives, to raise the ante both at home and at European level.  To respond to Deputy Eric Byrne's comments, there are processes in place.  There is an international conference on the Great Lakes region.  It needs greater focus and far greater African Union engagement is required.  It is not just about the UN or the EU but also about the African Union, supported by external support where possible.  Perhaps it could be a special envoy or other such focuses.  If we raise this to a level on the international agenda that is sufficient to garner that type of interest and commitment, we can make a great deal of progress.  However, there must be a concerted effort to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100009#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Clarken"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353513600,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I will try not to repeat what my colleagues said.  In response to Deputy Nash's point, there is a bigger picture and we have heard a little about the regional dynamics today.  It is important to recognise that this is a complex and protracted conflict and that the issues in the conflict are at local, national and international levels.<\/p> <p>The causes of the complex emergencies and conflict must be understood in their totality because they have to do with the distribution of power and resources within the country and beyond its boundaries.  Therefore, any international approach must be comprehensive.  In the past billions of dollars have been spent on the Democratic Republic of Congo trying to achieve a technical solution to what is a complex political problem.  I agree with my colleagues that it is important the UN's mandate is revised and strengthened but that will be extremely difficult because of the political issues at the heart of the UN system.  As we are aware, the UN Security Council finds it difficult to take hard decisions and there is also the allocation of resources from the most wealthy countries.  It is difficult for those countries to send military resources into places where they will be in danger and which might not be popular among their own populations.  The UN mandate, if strengthened, will make a difference but not the total difference.  It needs to be supported.  The role of the African Union is incredibly important because it can have credibility where external forces lack such credibility.<\/p><p> We have talked about the Government and the Government as a player.  It is true that the Government is Kinshasa-centred and does not have credibility.  It barely has control or reach beyond Kinshasa but, nonetheless, the Government was elected.  The elections did not have great credibility but this is the Government that is in place.  We have to look at some of the positive elements of what is happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo and put some credence and energy into trying to help those move forward.  There will be elections at Senate level and, I hope, at provincial and district levels in the next two years.  Some of the key issues that need to happen to help the elections would be a review of the national electoral commission to ensure the fundamental structures are in place to enable future elections to be held on a fair basis.  <\/p><p> There are issues around the immediate humanitarian needs.  Before the crisis erupted in the past week it was estimated that $721 million was needed in response to existing humanitarian needs.  That amount will have multiplied within the past five to seven days.  What is harder to generate is funding for recovery after the first phase of response.  In terms of messages, it is important to bear in mind that while there is a need to step up political engagement through the avenues open to Ireland, we can step up the resources that Ireland can leverage from other multilateral sources where it has a stake, not only for the immediate response but the long-term recovery.  <\/p><p> My final comment is on the role of women.  I agree with all the statements on the importance of women's voices and women's power; and empowering women is fundamental to recovery in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  When I was in the Democratic Republic of Congo a week and a half ago I engaged with women and men who were encouraging women to see themselves as other than second class citizens, as people who have a right to make a decision within the home and within the community and who also have a right to contribute to decision-making at a local and national level.  It is interesting to note that the Democratic Republic of Congo has just passed a gender parity law which is now on its Statute Book and which technically places the Democratic Republic of Congo ahead of many countries in the more developed world.  However, its implementation is critical.  This is an issue I wish to put on the table for future consideration.  How can Ireland support women and gender equality in the Democratic Republic of Congo in a way which will transform politics in that country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100009#H01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Caoimhe de Barra","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353514200,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I thank Ms de Barra.

He referred to his country's role and trying to attract international trade.

There are dozens of Government ministries.  It is difficult to co-ordinate in a context where the ministries can barely function and support their own needs.  For example, when Tr&oacute;caire and local NGO partners went to discuss the gender parity law, the ministry for gender was so short of resources that it was barely able to do work it is mandated to do.  That is common across many of the ministries.  However, it is important to recognise that no government is homogenous, there is a will to reform and make progress among elements of government.  Much of the political analysis is about identifying the arms of government with which we can work.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Sullivan opened up the discussion by talking about mining companies and mineral resources.  She mentioned initiatives such as the European initiative, which it is important for Ireland to support.  There are other initiatives such as the listing of companies on the New York stock exchange.  To be listed one needs to be transparent in respect of the payments one makes.  Sometimes it is difficult to identify the companies that work in context such as the Democratic Republic of Congo.  For example, a contract was recently taken over by a company which appears to be based out of South Africa for all exploration in Lake Albert and nobody can get access to the MOU between the Government and that company.  We work with local communities who are monitoring the impact on their environment of that company's work but it is incredibly difficult to have accountability without access to information.

More recently, we have had involved discussions on the escalating violence in Gaza.  On the Middle East peace process, we have noted with concern the absence of any progress on the resumption of direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.  Questions are being raised increasingly about the viability of a two-state solution in light of the steady expansion of Israeli settlements within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  I propose to address these issues first, and then to update the committee briefly on the other main topics which have featured in our discussions at recent meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council or which we expect to address at our next meeting in December.<\/p><p>  I will start with the situation in Gaza and the Middle East peace process.  The escalating violence and conflict in Gaza and southern Israel was the major issue on our agenda at this week's Council meeting.  More than 100 people in Gaza, many of them women and children, have been killed since the eruption of the crisis.  Five Israelis have also been killed as a result of rocket fire from Gaza during the same period.  Urgent international efforts are under way to bring the hostilities to an end and to implement an immediate ceasefire.  The Egyptian Government has been chairing important mediation talks in Cairo.<\/p><p>  The Council agreed this week that the absolute priority is to secure an end to the violence and the suffering being caused to innocent civilians.  I fully support the international mediation efforts which are under way and I commend Egypt and other regional players such as Turkey and Qatar on their efforts.  The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, is currently visiting the region and hopefully can lend his considerable experience and stature to the search for a full cessation of hostilities.<\/p><p>  However bad the current situation in Gaza is, it would be made infinitely worse if Israel were to proceed to launch a ground offensive.  Such a step would be disastrous, not just for the people of Gaza but for the entire region.  This latest bloody and tragic escalation of conflict only serves to highlight how little progress there has been in addressing the real problems in Gaza since the end of Operation Cast Lead almost four years ago.  The international community must renew its efforts to persuade Israel to end its unjust and counterproductive blockade of Gaza.<\/p><p>  However, just as Palestinians in Gaza are entitled to live in peace and security, so too are the people of Israel.  There must, therefore, be a complete end to the utterly unacceptable rocket attacks which have been launched from Gaza against southern Israel and now, indeed, the entire country.  All sides to this conflict, as was emphasised in this week's Council conclusions, must fully respect international humanitarian law.<\/p><p>  Ultimately, the problems afflicting Gaza will only really be resolved in the context of progress towards a resumption of peace negotiations and the achievement of a comprehensive two-state solution.  Our conclusions this week clearly recognised this and the importance of sustained EU engagement in the search for peace.<\/p><p>  In this regard, the Council considered this week, as it did also at its meeting last month, the resolution seeking observer state status at the UN which the Palestinians plan to table later this month.  A draft resolution to this effect has been circulated in New York.  I have indicated, including in my address to the UN General Assembly last September, that Ireland would be willing to support a resolution which was reasonable and balanced and which recognised clearly the need to restart political negotiations aimed at a final and comprehensive peace agreement.  I reiterated this position in my consultations with EU colleagues this week.  Given the EU's long-standing support for Palestinian statehood, I do not believe that it would be credible to attempt to persuade the Palestinians to delay action, as some have been suggesting, on the very modest step forward which they are seeking at the UN.<\/p><p>  Consultations will continue among member states over the coming days to see whether it is possible for the EU to reach a common position on this issue.  Realistically, however, there is little prospect of all 27 agreeing to vote in favour of the resolution.  A common position of abstention would, in my view and in that of several other member states, raise serious issues of credibility and relevance for the EU and would be very damaging to the Union's reputation both in the region and further afield.<\/p><p>  We devoted much time this week, and also at earlier meetings, to the steadily worsening conflict in Syria.  Hundreds of people continue to be killed in Syria every week, and a major humanitarian emergency is looming there with the onset of winter.  In the words of Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN and Arab League's joint special representative for this conflict, Syria now faces a stark choice: either there is a political settlement of some sort or it risks becoming a failed state.  While the chances of early political progress remain slim, the special representative is pursuing all options, including that of building on elements of the agreement reached in Geneva last June.<\/p><p>  There has, however, been one positive development.  Agreement was reached in Doha earlier this month on the creation of a new umbrella opposition grouping called the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces.  The establishment of a unified, democratic opposition, comprising both internal and external opponents of the regime, has long been sought by the international community.  It is to be hoped that this new group will succeed in bringing together all strands of opposition opinion.  A number of EU partners have moved to recognise it as the sole legitimate representatives of the Syrian people.  However, Ireland and most other EU member states believe more time is needed before according formal recognition to a body which has only just been established and about which relatively little is known as yet.<\/p><p>  Concerns over Iran's nuclear programme also continue to feature heavily on the Council's agenda.  Last month we adopted a further package of sanctions, mostly centred on the financial sector and aimed at persuading Iran to engage seriously in the process of negotiations with the E3+3.  Now that the US election is out of the way, High Representative Ashton will endeavour, on behalf of the E3+3, to organise a new round of negotiations with Iran.  There is, in my view, no alternative to diplomatic means for resolving this issue.<\/p><p>  Africa is a high priority for Ireland and I welcome the attention that African issues are receiving at present in the Foreign Affairs Council.  At both the October and November Councils, we discussed the crisis in the Sahel region of north-western Africa and in particular the crisis in Mali.  The EU has an important contribution to make to the resolution of this crisis, which poses major threats and risks for the region as a whole and, indeed, for Europe.  We are pressing the Malian parties to agree a political roadmap which would facilitate a return to constitutional governance.  When that roadmap is in place, the EU will resume bilateral development co-operation funding to support Mali's economy.<\/p> <p>Plans are being made for a military force with ECOWAS and African Union involvement which would help the Malian authorities to re-establish law and order throughout the country.  The High Representative and the External Action Service are also planning for a possible EU CSDP mission to train the Malian army.<\/p><p> As regards next steps, ECOWAS has agreed a concept of operations for military deployment and this has been approved by the African Union.  This will now be considered by the UN Security Council with a view to the passing of a resolution in the coming weeks.  Such a resolution is essential before any deployment can take place and it should also provide a framework for the proposed EU CSDP mission.  The European Union will also continue to play a central role in responding to the humanitarian needs of civilians and displaced people in Mali and neighbouring countries.<\/p><p> As the Chairman stated, the committee discussed the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo earlier this afternoon.  The crisis in the eastern region of that country was discussed by Ministers at the Council's meeting this week.  We issued comprehensive conclusions in which we condemned the activities of the so-called M23 group which is responsible for the latest upsurge in violence.  We are calling for an end to all violence, including rape and sexual violence, human rights abuses and the use of child soldiers by all armed groups.  The European Union is supporting the efforts of the DRC Government to reform the armed forces and to achieve peace and stability throughout the entire country.  I placed particular emphasis on the need for all sides to fulfil their obligations under international humanitarian law in terms of protecting the civilian population and allowing unhindered access for humanitarian agencies and aid workers.<\/p><p> The Foreign Affairs Council has also continued to focus on the countries in the European Union's eastern neighbourhood.  The October Council considered the recent parliamentary elections in Belarus and Georgia.  We welcomed the peaceful transfer of power in Georgia and the statement by prime minister designate, Mr. Ivanishvili, that Georgia will continue on the path of European integration.  On Belarus, we regretted that the parliamentary elections had not been conducted in line with international standards.  I should say that, as chair of the OSCE, Ireland has sought to maintain a critical dialogue with Belarus with the eventual aim of re-establishing an OSCE presence in the country.<\/p><p> This week we had a strategic discussion of the situation in Ukraine ahead of an anticipated further discussion next month.  The key issue for the Union is how to assess the recent parliamentary elections in Ukraine.  The free and fair conduct of elections is one of the three conditions that the European Union elaborated earlier this year for movement towards signature, and then ratification, of the association agreement with Ukraine.  The other two conditions are addressing the selective application of justice and advancing the reform agenda.  While the parliamentary elections can be assessed positively in a number of respects, there have also been a range of concerns, as the OSCE-ODIHR preliminary report brought out.  It is important that these issues are addressed credibly and quickly by the Ukrainian authorities.  However, I would stress that Ireland remains committed to achieving the association agreement.  We have always wanted to see the European Union and Ukraine build closer ties, but the speed with which this can happen depends in large part on Ukraine.<\/p><p> Of course, developments in the eastern neighbourhood are heavily influenced by Russia.  The European Union strategic partnership with Russia remains critical for the Union as it seeks to improve the conditions for mutual trade and investment and to advance political co-operation and, in so doing, to work towards the so-called new agreement with Russia.  The European Union, for its part, must also work to ensure its political and human rights dialogues continue to address areas where our perspectives with Russia differ.  European Union-Russia relations will be discussed at the December Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, in preparation for the European Union-Russia summit in Brussels in December 2012.  Although there are differences between the Union and Russia over certain international issues, most notably Syria, and recent internal developments in Russia have also given grounds for concern, the scope for co-operation between the Union and Russia on the partnership and modernisation agenda remains significant.  In this regard, I would like to see the discussion in the December FAC focus on practical areas where the summit can give a positive impetus.<\/p><p> The October Foreign Affairs Council held an exchange of views on the European Union's relations with its strategic partners, including a discussion on China in advance of a discussion at the October European Council.  The outcome of the European Union-China summit meeting on 20 September formed the backdrop to the discussions.  The summit, which was Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's last before he steps down as premier, reflected on the significant progress in European Union-China relations that has been achieved in the past ten years, especially in the area of trade.  The European Union's main strategic objectives remain clear: first, to promote further economic ties and exchanges; and second, to encourage China to further open up its society, to be a responsible global player and to be a more responsible actor in its region.  During the discussion at the recent European Council, the Taoiseach indicated Ireland's desire to develop further the European Union-China relationship during our EU Presidency.  In this regard, conclusion of a European Union-China trade and investment agreement, currently under negotiation, would be significant.  Since the European Council, the 18th party Congress has taken place in China.  Mr. Xi Jinping, who visited Ireland in February, has been appointed General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and will take over as president in March 2013.<\/p><p> Over lunch at this week's Council, Foreign and Defence Ministers held a useful orientation debate on defence policy in advance of the anticipated discussions in this area at the European Council in December 2013.  While we are at an early stage in this process, there is general agreement that there is a need to ensure the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy can be maintained and enhanced so that the EU can respond effectively to crises.<\/p><p> This week's Council also considered how best to take forward the European Union's relations with Cuba against the backdrop of recent developments there.  We agreed that, while the EU's Common Position on Cuba remains the basis of our approach to relations with that country, work can begin on drafting a mandate for negotiations on a possible bilateral agreement.  Ireland supports closer engagement with Cuba, while stressing the importance of Cuba's adherence to human rights.  I am pleased with the outcome of the Council in this regard.<\/p><p> Next month's Foreign Affairs Council will see consideration of the Commission's annual enlargement strategy.  As is normal practice, the General Affairs Council will adopt conclusions on European Union enlargement but the Foreign Affairs Council will have an opportunity to discuss these in advance, in so far as they relate to the Western Balkans.  The adopted conclusions will shape the agenda in this area for the six months of Ireland's EU Presidency.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, Ireland has just been elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council for a three-year term which begins on 1 January 2013, the same day as we assume the Presidency of the European Union.  I thank the Chairman and all the members of the committee for the support they gave to Ireland's campaign for Human Rights Council membership.  The committee's support was important.  In situations such as these, Government needs to work with the support of Parliament and civil society.  It was tremendously encouraging to know that our candidature was firmly supported by committee and also by civil society in Ireland.  This made a difference in terms of helping to consolidate our national reputation as a strong supporter of human rights globally.  In electing Ireland, the membership of the United Nations General Assembly has recognised the strength of our attachment to the United Nations, our efforts to improve global human rights and our commitment to overseas development assistance through Irish Aid.  Our election is something of which we can all be proud, and I thank the committee again for its support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100012#O00200","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353515700,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore.  We congratulated him personally at last week's meeting and we have written to him in that regard as well.  We also congratulate our diplomats abroad, particularly in Geneva and in the United Nations, for their work.  At every opportunity here when we met diplomats, we highlighted Ireland's candidature for the Human Rights Council.<\/p><p>  Before I hand over to Deputy Smith, I have one question on the situation in Gaza.  With the major players in the Middle East today, both the US Secretary of State, Mrs. Hillary Clinton, and the United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in Egypt and Jerusalem, respectively, and news emerging that there will be a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas within hours, what will be the effect of the bus explosion in Tel Aviv on any imminent ceasefire?  The T&aacute;naiste might answer that when he is answering questions from Deputy Smith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100013#P00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1353515700,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade for his comprehensive report on the Council meetings.<\/p><p>  On the situation in Gaza, he correctly stated that it was the major issue, along with other important issues, before the Council and we hope that a ceasefire can be secured.  I presume the Council sent a full message of support to the Egyptian President and others who have been working to achieve a ceasefire.<\/p> <p>It is also necessary to make very clear to the Israeli Prime Minister, the Egyptian President, the Arab League and the UN Secretary General that a complete halt to rocket attacks and the cessation of all military strikes is absolutely essential.  Was a commitment given by the Council to provide humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip to assist civilians who have unfortunately been badly injured?  We are also conscious of the significant loss of life.  I understand there is a problem with medical supplies and understandably hospitals are overstretched due to the serious violence which has erupted.<\/p><p> The Council welcomed the formation of a new unified front of the Syrian opposition.  Previously in correspondence the T&aacute;naiste called for a comprehensive arms embargo.  France indicated through media reports that it had called for defensive arms to be allowed to the Syrian opposition.  The terminology used in some of the French media, according to correspondence I received from particular interest groups, referred to the French Government asking that defensive weapons be excluded from the arms embargo to help rebels fight President Assad's regime.  There was commentary in the British media that Mr. Hague has also made comments to this effect.  If the Council welcomed the formation of the new unified front, did discussions take place on what practical support would be given to such an opposition group?  Did the Council address reports of a growing radical Islamic militant element in the opposition?  Has this impacted on the stance taken today by the Council?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100013#P00300","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353516300,"counter":658,"content":"<p>The Chairman and Deputy Smith asked about the bomb explosion in Tel Aviv today.  What appears to have been a bomb exploded on a local bus in Tel Aviv, and the attack was very close to our embassy there.  It is reported that approximately 18 people were injured, most of them lightly, and thankfully no fatalities have been reported.  However, some of the injured may be more critical.  This attack is a new and unwelcome development which has unfortunately raised tensions at a sensitive time when ceasefire negotiations seem to be coming to a successful conclusion.  While the timing seems likely to have been inspired by events in Gaza, it is possible there may be no direct link.  Physically, it seems more likely the bomb may have come from a source in the West Bank.  Already, as is common in these cases, more than one group has claimed responsibility including the Popular Resistance Committees, a Gaza based group which murdered eight Israeli civilians near the Sinai border last year.  This attack may complicate, and may have been intended to complicate, the finalising of a ceasefire agreement and to increase the possibility of the Israeli Government seeming to show more security results.  If this was the intention of the bombers, I hope it will not succeed.  Attacks of this nature in Tel Aviv have been very rare in recent years largely due to the comprehensive security co-operation of the Palestinian Authority security forces in the West Bank.<\/p><p>  With regard to the issues raised by Deputy Smith, we had a discussion about Gaza at the Foreign Affairs Council.  We agreed the efforts of the Egyptian Government and other players to broker a ceasefire agreement provided the best chance of bringing the exchange of attacks to an end and we expressed full support for these efforts.  The Council reiterated the need for an immediate ceasefire and noted this outbreak of violence underlined the urgent need for progress to achieve a wider political settlement to the Israel Palestine conflict.  The Department has been in contact with Egyptian officials to express our support and encouragement for their efforts.<\/p><p>  The formation of a more unified coalition of opposition groupings in Syria is a significant development in so far as all strands of the opposition have now been apparently united under a single structure which will give them greater credibility and legitimacy when speaking on behalf of the Syrian people, and is a major progress towards an all-Syrian political dialogue.  The issue of recognition was extensively discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday.  France in particular has decided to press ahead and recognise the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representative of all Syrians and sought to persuade other EU partners to follow track.  However, most partners, including Ireland, have adopted a more cautious approach on this subject and believe it would be premature to recognise the Syrian National Coalition at this stage when the new body has only just been established.  Ireland has also been influenced by the private views conveyed to our delegation by Joint Special Representative Brahimi at the recent EU Arab League ministerial meeting in Cairo, where he similarly urged caution on the issue of recognition.  We believe there is much work to be done by the new coalition to ensure it fully reflects the wider sensibilities of the Syrian population, and in particular includes a fair representation of women and the ethnic and religious groups which form the fabric of Syrian society.  The forthcoming appointment of its leadership council will be particularly important in determining how inclusive and reflective of all strands of Syrian society the new structure is.  With regard to the issue of arming opposition groups, the October Foreign Affairs Council clearly warned against the dangers of further militarisation of the conflict and therefore I remain opposed to any suggestions we should now consider relaxing the EU arms embargo in light of developments in Doha.<\/p><p>  An issue also raised was the infiltration by non-Syrian jihadists, mercenaries and extremists into the ranks of the Syrian armed opposition.  This is also a cause of great concern.  It is a grave development which will only further complicate the search for a political solution in Syria, and it increases the risk of the conflict being extended to the wider region.  No call was made in the EU conclusions for the provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza.  However, nationally, I am considering providing additional funding to UNRWA to assist it in its work in Gaza.  The director general of UNRWA came before the committee recently and briefed it on the great work it is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100014#Q00200","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1353516300,"counter":659,"content":"<p>As eight more committee members wish to speak, I ask people to confine their contributions to questions rather than speeches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100014#Q00300","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1353516300,"counter":660,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and his colleagues.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about the situation in Gaza and mentioned that more than 100 people have been killed.  The figure from Gaza is 140 Palestinians.  It is important to get an accurate figure.  Perhaps the document provided by the T&aacute;naiste is dated.  Many people were upset by a recent statement made by him on the escalation of violence in Gaza.  He stated it was triggered by sustained rocket attacks on towns in Israel.<\/p> <p>People, locally, would have a different view on that.  They would argue there was a two-week lull in violence at the end of October and beginning of November and that Israeli soldiers invaded Gaza on 8 November, which led to people being killed.  It is important to set out the context and sequence of events because the message has been put out that it is because of the Palestinians that this response has been evoked.<\/p><p> One of the people who, I believe, is head of health services there is an Irish passport holder.  I talked to a person who has just come back from Gaza and he spoke about some of the incidents that have occurred.  He saw with his own eyes two young lads shot when they were up a height trying to fix a water tower.  He visited a football pitch which was one of the areas destroyed.  That pitch where children played football was supposed to have been one of the military targets.  He spoke of the problem experienced by dialysis patients when the electricity is cut off and they are not able to have their treatment.  He spoke about the difficulties experienced in the natal clinic with regard to premature babies in incubators when the electricity is cut off.  He also spoke about the difficulties of having nowhere to store blood supplies, of the shortage of blood and of trying to cope with the large number of people seeking medical care.  It would be useful if we were to talk to that Irish passport holder, who trained in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and worked in Dublin.  The person I spoke to said that increasingly patients from some of the areas bordering Gaza are presenting with unusual symptoms.  They believe they have been poisoned. They do not know if it is from chemical weapons or uranium shells.  They have called for an international investigation into what is going on.  Will the T&aacute;naiste support that request as, increasingly, more people in that area are experiencing health problems?<\/p><p> We received a note on public policy in regard to the banning of settlement goods.  Could the T&aacute;naiste clarify on what case law his legal advisers are relying to assert that the public policy exception is narrowly construed in this regard?<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste spoke about the situation in Syria.  We know very little about the opposition group there.  Does France know much about it?  Did that arise in the discussions on this area?  A question was asked in the German Parliament about the Syrian opposition group and the military intelligence there said that a large proportion of its members were made up of foreign volunteers but that there was also a big al-Qaeda element in its make-up.  The EU's position regarding the non-formal recognition of that body is a positive step because we do not know from where this group has come.<\/p><p> On the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we just listened to a report on the number of people who have been killed there over a nine-year period.  Some 5.4 million people have been killed and 2.2 million people have been displaced.  Is there anything the EU can do, particularly in terms of the UN changing its mandate in regard to this area?  We need to propose positive solutions to try to resolve conflicts in this region.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about proposals in respect of Mali.  Will he raise similar proposals at the next Council meeting to address conflict in that region?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100014#Q00400","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353516900,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I support what Deputy Crowe said about the question of imports from settlements in the West Bank.  This may not be the best time to raise it because very sensitive negotiations are taking place.  I am not expecting the T&aacute;naiste to raise this issue immediately.  There is a very important legal aspect to this.  I have an opinion from a learned counsel, of which perhaps the T&aacute;naiste is aware, which indicates that the State is under a duty not to give preferential treatment to these goods, that it is under an obligation to take this seriously and that it would be permissible for the State to take a unilateral step.  It does not have to wait for the rest of Europe.  Various case laws have cited the case of Brita, a fruit juice company, versus the Hauptzollamt Hamburg-Hafen, the customs authorities in Hamburg, which went to the European Court of Justice, and the decision on it was a very useful one.  I will not go into because it is far too technical.  The clear indications are that products originating in the West Bank do not fall within the territorial scope of the EC-Israel agreement, the Euromed agreement, and therefore they can be subject to this measure, in addition to which, the Israeli settlements in Palestine have been held by the International Court of Justice to be illegal.  There is a mass of law in this respect.  On the question of the European Court of Justice holding that public policy exception could be construed narrowly in respect of the free movement of goods within the Union, it emerges that such a restrictive interpretation would not apply to goods which were banned from Ireland.  I have further legal opinion on this.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste might give a general response on this matter and I could pass on to him the various legal opinions.  It would be very helpful if we knew, as Deputy Crowe said, the basis in case law on which this decision was made.  The very moment might not be the best time but we have to be involved in the process.  I join those who have condemned the bombing in Tel Aviv and also the brutal execution of seven people in Palestine, in Gaza, suspected of being informants.  One principle to which I hold is the right to a trial and the right to due process.  We do not have that even with our American friends when they use their drones.

I certainly hope it would.  The T&aacute;naiste said it would be damaging for the reputation of Europe and for the whole situation if we had a Common Position of abstention.  I would hope that in the absence of that, there would be a free vote.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#222222\">  I support what was said about the Democratic Republic of Congo.  What can be done?  Can the International Criminal Court be involved, particularly with regard to the involvement of states and named members of their governments in Rwanda and Uganda?<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#222222\">  On Syria, the T&aacute;naiste, interestingly, said that it is a welcome development that a loose coalition was developing among opponents of the Assad regime but indicated that since it was only just established, we did not know enough about its complexion to give it formal recognition.  What can we do short of that?  I note the T&aacute;naiste's principled objection to intruding further into the situation.

We would certainly be interested to hear that and we will listen to it.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of settlement products, this has arisen from the conclusions which were reached at the Foreign Affairs Council in May when a strong statement was made by the European Union in respect of the settlements and the degree to which the continuation of settlements will render a two-state solution impossible.  During that discussion I raised the possibility of a ban being put at EU level on products from the settlements, as a way for the EU to enforce the position it has taken on the issue of settlements.  I have asked for an update to be done at the Foreign Affairs Council on the May conclusions.  That will then give us an opportunity to examine what steps can be taken at EU level to apply some pressure.  Of course, events, particularly in relation to Gaza, have overtaken it in the meantime.<\/p><p>  The other issue I referred to was the question that has been raised both by Senator Norris and Deputy Crowe.  It is about the vote at the UN.  Members of the committee will recall that last year there was a lot of discussion prior to the General Assembly in 2011 of Palestine seeking full membership of the United Nations and applying to the Security Council for that.  In the event, what was advanced was the idea of observer status.  It is similar to the status of the Holy See at the UN.  We support the Palestinian application for observer status.  Obviously, I will have to see the final text of whatever resolution is actually voted upon, but I have already indicated that we are favourably disposed to voting in favour of that resolution. <\/p><p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, there was a discussion by some members states who had previously been opposed to the resolution.  They indicated that they would be willing to agree a common EU position of abstaining on it - in other words, that they would move from voting \"No\" to abstaining, provided there was a common EU agreement on such a position.  I indicated that we were not disposed towards that.  Ireland's position, as already indicated, was that we were favourably disposed to the motion and to voting in favour of it.  I am certainly not convinced of the value of a common position which would simply be a common position to abstain.  There are issues around the EU's credibility which arise in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100016#S00300","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1353517500,"counter":668,"content":"<p>May I ask the T&aacute;naiste a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100016#S00400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1353517500,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100016#S00500","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1353517500,"counter":670,"content":"<p>He indicated that we took a unilateral position with regard to the representation of Palestine at the UN in the same manner as the Holy See.

We have discussed the Gaza issue on many occasions in the past.  My own belief is that this was bound to happen.  There was no peace process or structure in place for the last couple of years.  It was a period waiting for something to happen, as has occurred now.  In the aftermath of the US presidential election, might it be feasible for the EU to co-operate with the US, in a major way that has not happened heretofore, with a view to setting up some kind of a permanent ongoing structure?  It could be used as a place to air grievances instead of responding to grievances with military force, by either side.  In other words, it would be a permanent peace process whereby the opposing combatants can attend, and be encouraged to attend as opposed to waiting for something else to happen.  I am not suggesting that the witnesses present are waiting for something to happen, but it is just a fact of life and has been the pattern since I have been involved in politics.<\/p><p>  I shall now turn to the DRC and similar situations worldwide.<\/p> <p>I refer to the access and resort to the international war crimes tribunal and the need to take action that is specific, definite and clearly in the vision of those who are perpetrating appalling crimes throughout Africa and elsewhere.  This already has been demonstrated in respect of Mr. Taylor, who at present is serving his sentence in the Netherlands, instead of in more convivial surroundings from which he might perhaps have escaped.  Members previously have discussed the apparent ineffectiveness of the United Nations in such conflict situations but is it possible to put in place a sequence of events that would automatically kick in to address the kind of issues that now are evident in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC?  It is neither today nor yesterday since such events started.  While the international community is looking on, apparently helpless, many international and multinational corporations work and operate within the area.  They have in place their own independent security systems, which operate independently to the exclusion of the national population as though they have been superimposed on the local community from the sky.  This also has been evident elsewhere recently.  Is it possible, again in co-operation with the United Nations, to try to focus on the number of multinational corporations operating in areas that are resource-rich and from whence they draw considerable profits and in which investment takes place in a manner that meets the requirements of the international investors but not those of the local population?  I will conclude by stating that on foot of what members saw in recent weeks in that general region, I do not believe it to be possible for nothing to happen when one has total and absolute poverty and no services whatsoever while having, at the same time, the extraction of rich mineral resources, apparently with international approval.  All that can follow from that is deep unrest and eventual upheaval.  I acknowledge this issue has been tossed around for a long time and that the T&aacute;naiste is both aware of it and has raised it previously but the time has come for a new impetus and emphasis on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100016#S01600","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353518100,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Two good things happened in recent weeks.  The American President has secured another four years in office, while the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, probably has got a further ten years in which to rule China.  This means the two most important presidents or chairmen, who have a key role to play in international affairs, now are in place.  If one takes note of the reports in this regard, it is to be hoped that America may look afresh at its embargo on Cuba.  Moreover, I welcome the debate that has taken place at European Council level on looking afresh on Cuba, while noting the Cubans must abide by the human rights clauses.<\/p><p>  I wish to discuss three individual countries and will start with Palestine.  Our position on Palestine is quite clear and I fully support both the T&aacute;naiste's position on Palestine and his work at European level in gaining observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.  I wish to ask two specific questions of the T&aacute;naiste.  The Palestinians are a complicated group of people and do themselves no good by dragging the bodies of so-called collaborators behind motorbikes, as the television footage in this regard was quite revolting.  Hamas must be told there are standards by which we wish to abide, that this is not the way and that such people also have human rights.  I may not have been in Ireland when the T&aacute;naiste responded, if at all, to the horrendous attack by Palestinians who slaughtered Egyptian troops in Sinai.  Such behaviour is unacceptable.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste has issued statements and perhaps he is familiar with the case of the slaughter of the aforementioned border guards by Palestinians entering from Sinai.  My concluding reference to Palestine is to a plan that probably already is under way to exhume the body of Yasser Arafat, who may well have been poisoned.  Is the T&aacute;naiste up to date with regard to developments in that respect?<\/p><p>  I will turn briefly to the Congo, on which members have had a lengthy debate and note that with 5 million dead and with it being the rape region of the world, we must get our heads together collectively and do something more seriously than is the case at present.  I understand that Goma has been taken over by some of the forces that probably have emanated from Rwanda.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste to consider seriously the need for the governments of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda to be collectively pressurised into working towards the achievement of peace in that immediate area.  It is members' understanding that the reason this particular part of the Congo is attracting so much violence is based clearly on the mineral resources therein.  Moreover, it appears that to date, Rwanda in particular, with the possible involvement of Uganda, has been fomenting dissent in the Congo to access the very rich diamond and other natural resources that exist there.  I will conclude my remarks on the Congo by reminding the T&aacute;naiste that in Sierra Leone, they brought Charles Taylor to court and he was found guilty.  I believe he may have received a 50-year sentence but he was found guilty on a number of other issues, which included recruiting, training and using child soldiers and second, creating soldier brides, which essentially involved kidnapping women and making them sexual subjects for soldiers.  He was found guilty in respect of such practices, which are widespread in eastern Congo.  The T&aacute;naiste might use his good offices and services to bring that region more into focus.<\/p><p>  I will conclude by referring to my pet subject, namely, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and election monitoring.  What I find about the Ukraine and other countries in which I have been engaged in monitoring is very interesting.  It is that the OSCE sends in a core team for perhaps two or three months before the actual election date, which then issues an interim report.  I plead with the T&aacute;naiste that such interim reports should not be published while well-intentioned and tremendously hard-working election workers are still working under ferocious conditions.  Such workers, who may be operating in primitive conditions involving queueing and who may not have slept for 36 hours because they have been bringing ballot papers to the counting areas, then hear, having gone through an entire democratic process of voting, consolidating the votes and transporting them to the current centre, the preliminary reports from the OSCE, which invariably are relatively negative.  This is because over the previous three months, the OSCE team will have examined the imbalance in media coverage and the abuse of administrative resources, usually by the incumbent government, as well as the political financing of candidates and parties.  It is demoralising for those democrats when they hear that although the election and the counts have not yet been completed, the OSCE finds negatively.  I have seen this happen in a number of countries and I plead that the T&aacute;naiste use his good offices to suggest to the OSCE that it wait for at least a day or two while the polling material and boxes are returned and their contents counted, because such declarations demoralise those people who have been working so hard on the electoral front.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100017#T00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1353518100,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Four other members have indicated that they wish to contribute.

He explained that there were resource issues in October.  Clearly, those resource issues are much more acute now.  Could the T&aacute;naiste provide us with some information in terms of the quantum of resources we will be making available to UNRWA in light of the escalation?<\/p><p> In regard to the Congo, Margot Wallstr&ouml;m is reported as having said that the Congo is the rape capital of the world.  The Harvard humanitarian index highlighted a 17-fold increase in incidences of rape in the Congo.  That was reported to us in our earlier session this afternoon and some very compelling cases were recounted to us by those who were in the DRC.  Given that the UN mandate involves protecting civilians and providing them with security, is the T&aacute;naiste of the view that the UN mandate needs to be reviewed or remodelled and enhanced to take account of those sorts of circumstances which are completely intolerable and entirely unacceptable?

I encourage him to continue his efforts to try to get Europe to come to a cohesive view on it.  I am thinking back to the initiatives Jimmy Carter took back in the 1970s.  Great efforts were made at that time with the Egyptians.  Something like that needs to be done and I am inclined to agree with Deputy Durkan that it should be done on the basis of a permanent structure that would continue to try to find agreement there.<\/p><p>  I have been critical of the settlements, as have other members, simply because it is almost getting to the stage where a two-state solution is becoming impossible, and that is unacceptable.  Pressure needs to be brought to bear on Israel to accept that and to discontinue settlements.  We also need to say in a balanced way that Israel is entitled to ensure its borders are safe and secure and that its citizens are not subject to attack going forward.  <\/p><p>  Is there anything we can do, particularly given that our EU Presidency is coming up next year, to build a coalition with the Americans?  It is timely because the Obama Administration will continue for the next four years.  Hilary Clinton may be leaving office, but perhaps she would be a very suitable person, and the EU could become involved.  We could build a consensus which could work hard to put pressure on both sides to come to an agreement and which could use the force of moral pressure internationally.  However, we need cohesion to provide a basis for the ending of the settlements and to lay the foundations and to move forward to try build the confidence and trust needed because this keeps happening.<\/p><p>  I was in Rwanda two or three years ago and I was near the Congolese border where they had what I would describe as decontamination centres for Hutus who had gone across the border after the genocide and had fought in the forests in the Congo as paramilitaries.  As has been said, the situation there is horrific.  They were bringing these people back and keeping them for three months in this centre before trying to integrate them back into their local communities.  They would then face the Gacaca courts or whatever else to try to deal with the legacy issue in Rwanda.  <\/p><p>  There has been some criticism of Rwanda but I was very impressed by what I saw the Rwandan Government doing.

There has been a long-established OSCE practice in regard to election monitoring.  One of the difficulties is that there is an expectation and an clamour immediately following elections for the report on what the election monitors concluded.  The election takes place and the world's press is always looking for the outcome of the monitoring and whether the elections are free, fair and so on.  That demand for a response is why the interim report is made.  I have heard what the Deputy said about the impact on people who are on the ground doing the monitoring and who have to complete their work.  We will have that suggestion looked at.<\/p><p>  In regard to Gaza, the Palestinian-Israeli situation and the Middle East peace process, Deputy Durkan and Senator Walsh rightly raised the window of opportunity there is now following the United States presidential election and the situation where the European Union agreed in May to a common position on settlements.  We need to be open to what could happen if the European Union and the United States - of course, we have the quartet structure in place and it does not require setting in place any new structure - could co-operate and get real movement in getting a long-term permanent settlement of the conflict in the Middle East.  That is something we all must be open to.  A real prospect of that would change things very significantly.  <\/p><p>  On Deputy Nash's question about UNRWA, I indicated I was looking at the provision of additional resources for UNRWA but I am not in a position today to make an announcement on that.  I will communicate the announcement to the committee Chairman and the Deputy when it is made.  <\/p><p>  On the killing of the Egyptian soldiers raised by Deputy Byrne, that incident took place a number of months ago and was most likely carried out by one of the Jihadist or Salafist groups based in Gaza.  I condemn such violence.  It does not serve the Palestinian cause or the people of Gaza in any way.  Unfortunately, such extremism poses a very real threat to the efforts being made to advance Palestinian reconciliation.  <\/p><p>  In regard to the situation in the DRC, this country has had a very troubled history.  It has had long periods of authoritarian dictatorships and vicious civil war for most of its post-colonial existence.  The elections held in 2006, with UN organisational assistance and significant EU financial support, were the first democratic elections to happen in the DRC for almost half a century and signified a major step on the road towards genuine democratic reform in that country.  The process was by no means perfect and many problems were identified but it allowed for the establishment of an elected legitimate government.<\/p><p>  Further presidential and legislative elections were organised in November 2011.  The fact that these were arranged largely without external support represents another step forward on the path to democracy.  The European Union sent an observer mission and Irish observers were part of that.  We were not satisfied with some aspects of the preparation of the electoral process and we were very concerned about the violence that happened before, during and after polling.<\/p> <p> With regard to UN involvement in the DRC, following the signing of the Lusaka ceasefire agreement in July 1999 between the DRC and five regional states, the Security Council established the United Nations Organisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo - MONUC - through Resolution 1279.  Initially it was to plan for the observation of the ceasefire and the disengagement of forces and to maintain liaison with all parties up to the ceasefire agreement.  Later, in a series of resolutions, the Council expanded the mandate of MONUC to the supervision of the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and assigned multiple related tasks to it.  The United Nations has also been to the fore in the efforts to restore democracy and improve governance.<\/p><p> The various human rights abuses in the DRC are well documented and they are deeply disturbing.  Ireland is in touch with other Governments and donors, particularly on the issue of violence against women.  This is a priority for us; it is one of the issues we flagged during our candidacy for the Human Rights Council and the committee can be assured that we will raise this at the HRC in Geneva.<\/p><p> The European Union is playing an active role in supporting efforts to bring about an end to the conflicts in the DRC and to support progress towards peace, stability and economic and social development.  The Commission's DRC country strategy paper for the period 2008-13 currently amounts to &euro;584 million under the tenth European Development Fund.  Within this framework, the Commission's objective is to support the reconstruction of the DRC while pursuing stabilisation efforts in some regions of the country.<\/p><p> At a bilateral level, we avail of every opportunity to make our views known directly to DRC representatives.  Earlier this week, for example, the DRC Minister for the Environment was in Dublin for talks with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were involved in that visit and had the opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest with the DRC officials, including the political, security and humanitarian situation in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100018#U00300","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353519300,"counter":689,"content":"<p>Deputy Eric Byrne asked a question about Cuba.

I cannot think of anything that devalues the status and importance of women more than gendercide.<\/p><p>  My final question is nearer to home.  We all saw and regretted what happened in the North of Ireland.  Enormous efforts were made to put the peace process in place so I am concerned about the situation with Marian Price.  I have raised this with the Secretary of State at the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body.  There is also the issue of Gerry McGeough and the prisoners in Maghaberry being on dirty protest.  I am concerned this could fester and lead to more people being attracted to the sort of campaigns we saw in the last 30 years.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to play whatever role we can in getting the British to deal with those issues.  I understand Gerry McGeough will be released in January but should anything happen to Marian Price, who is very ill, while she is in captivity, it will be used emotively to attract people into activities we should be trying to avoid.<\/p> <p>We should seek to avoid opening up any such avenues. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100019#V00500","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353519900,"counter":694,"content":"<p>That concludes questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100020#W00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1353519900,"counter":695,"content":"<p>Senator Walsh referred to the position regarding Syria.  I have outlined the approach we are taking with regard to the recognition of the coalition in Syria.  Our view, which is shared by other member states, is that we do not want to rush into recognition and we should monitor how the position evolves and who exactly is involved.  That the opposition groups have come together is a good development and one which we have sought.  Formal recognition is another matter entirely, however.<\/p><p>  I propose to comment on the issues raised by a number of contributors about the European Union's future relationship with Cuba.  The Foreign Affairs Council has discussed the structure of the EU's future relationship with Cuba.  The Council has agreed that the High Representative should begin the process of elaborating negotiating directives for a bilateral agreement with Cuba within the framework of the European Union's Common Position.  As I noted in my discussions with the High Representative, I expect to take a direct role in this matter during the Irish Presidency.  Ireland supports a policy of closer engagement with Cuba, while stressing the importance of Cuba's adherence to human rights and other international criteria.<\/p><p>  The European Union has clearly expressed the opposition of its member states to all unilateral measures against Cuba which are contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade.  In common with our partners in the European Union, Ireland is of the view that the United States economic embargo on Cuba seriously hampers the economic development of the country and negatively affects its people.  Accordingly, Ireland and other EU member states support an annual draft resolution at the United Nations General Assembly on the necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba.  This resolution, which was adopted most recently on 13 November 2012, is introduced by Cuba and rejects the extraterritorial effects of the US embargo.  Ireland and our EU partners are not persuaded that the continued embargo on Cuba is contributing in a positive manner to the democratic transition on the island.  Our position on the issue is clear. <\/p><p>  With regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina, an issue raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and Senator Jim Walsh, Bosnia-Herzegovina receives the most negative assessment of the Balkan countries in the reports presented on enlargement.  The European Commission has stated that limited progress has been made towards meeting the political criteria.  Municipal elections which took place on 7 October meant a couple of months were lost in campaigning.  The stabilisation and association agreement has yet to be ratified, pending compliance with the Sejdi&amp;#263; and Finci judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.  The roadmap, which was agreed between Bosnian leaders in June when the Commission hosted a high level dialogue, is slipping.  In particular, a commitment to present the Parliament with a proposal to amend the constitution to make it compliant with the ECHR ruling by 31 August was not fulfilled.<\/p><p>  While Ireland is supportive of Bosnia-Herzegovina's EU perspective, the country's Government and political leaders must make real and sustained progress to realise this objective.  The lack of progress on reforms in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a significant concern.  I hope the second meeting of the high level dialogue, which is due to take place in Sarajevo on 22 November, will encourage further movement on reforms.  We will encourage Bosnian leaders to continue their efforts to find a solution.  However, it is a matter for them to find an agreement as we cannot impose one on them. <\/p><p>  I will examine the suggestion Senator Jim Walsh has made in respect of gendercide.  With regard to Marian Price and the issue of prisoners in Maghaberry Prison, I have discussed this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions and it is very much on our common agenda. <b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100020#W00300","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1353519900,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I referred to extractive industries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012112100020#W00400","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1353519900,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I will revert to the Deputy directly on that issue.

I had the phone in silent mode and I will switch it off.  I begin by thanking the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to address them on such important issues as organised crime, station closures and community policing.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to proactively targeting groups and individuals engaged in criminal activity, including organised criminal activities and white collar crime.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to utilise all available legislation in targeting, disrupting and bringing to justice those responsible.<\/p><p>  The fluidity of the membership, together with the incarceration of members and the <i>ad hoc<\/i> nature of the criminal enterprises at any given time challenges the calculation of numbers engaged in organised crime groups.  That said, there are approximately 25 organised crime groups operating throughout the State.  Whereas most organised crime groups are domestically orientated, there are a number that would have a significant international dimension, and such organised crime groups are reported to be involved in drugs, firearms, trafficking and other dimensions of the criminal code.  We contribute to the Europol Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment, SOCTA, every year, working with international partners in providing information on all these groupings to that forum.<\/p><p>  Whereas organised crime groups are present in each Garda region, the majority of them are centred in large urban areas such as Limerick, Cork, Galway, Sligo and Dublin.  There is a high amount of interaction between the various organised crime groups throughout the country who regularly pursue joint enterprises, particularly drug imports.  The vast majority of organised crime groups are drug trafficking groups who are prepared to use violence and intimidation to further their aims.  Each of these organised crime groups is structured hierarchically and would typically consist of a leadership, a number of middle-managers and low level criminals who could carry out day-to-day running of these organised crime groups.<\/p><p>  Organised crime groups in this jurisdiction continue to work closely with criminals in Northern Ireland for the purpose of drugs and weapon procurement and supply, as well as a route to transport stolen goods.  Organised crime groups with connections on both sides of the Border are utilising both Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction as transit routes, which is a legacy of the dark and distant past and some subversive groups.  Links between dissident republicans and organised crime groups here continue to cause serious concern.  A relationship of friction and facilitation appears to exist between organised crime groups in this jurisdiction and some dissident elements.  Taxing and extortion of drug dealers by dissident republicans have occurred in recent years.<\/p><p>  Irish organised crime groups continue to forge and develop links to international criminal networks.  Holland, Spain and the UK remain the key locations for foreign liaisons, mainly due to the established drug transportation routes.  Associations between Irish and Russian organised crime groups have also been observed and they work together on drug and cigarette ventures.  The presence of Russian organised crime groups operating in Spain is also influencing the activities of Irish criminals there.<\/p><p>  Garda executive action directed against organised crime groups consists of targeted intelligence-led operations utilising the resources of the national support services and crime and security branch in partnership with divisional and regional resources with a view to disrupting and dismantling these networks.  There are a number of organised crime groups which travel between the regions engaging in residential and commercial burglaries, robberies and distraction theft.  These groups are targeted under a number of regional operations and nationally under Operation Fiacla.<\/p><p>  Since the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 on 23 July 2009, to 30 September this year the legislation has been used on 179 occasions where arrests have been made relating to organised crime.  To 30 September 2012, eight individuals have been charged under the legislation, with six under section 72 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, participating or contribution to certain activities; and two under Section 71A of the Act, directing the activities of a criminal organisation.  However, arising from the arrests of 179 persons since the commencement of this legislation, other charges have been preferred for firearms offences, sale and supply of drugs and drug trafficking, violent disorder, obtaining money with menaces, threats to kill, theft and ATM robberies, aggravated burglary with firearms, immigration offences and offences related to the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 etc.<\/p><p>  In the context of station closures-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012112100004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Callinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1353490500,"counter":710,"content":"<p>We might pause there and take station closures in a separate tranche of questioning.

There is an armed element to the importation of drugs and we are, unfortunately, familiar with the scourge of drugs.  The other elements, highlighted by Retail Ireland, are the black market and the counterfeiting activities in which these organisations are involved.  I refer in particular to the illegal tobacco trade, fuel laundering, counterfeiting of goods, digital piracy and counterfeiting of medicine.  There is a huge cost to the economy, which can be estimated at between &euro;500 million and &euro;816 million per year.  I refer also to the report on transnational crime presented to the US Congress.  The Real IRA came in for specific mention with regard to the illegal tobacco trade: \"The production, smuggling, and sale of tobacco products, including genuine and counterfeit cigarettes, is a lucrative form of financing for organized crime as well as terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Kurdistan Worker&rsquo;s Party (PKK), and the Real Irish Republican Army (RIRA).\"  The Commissioner alluded to the international dimension of this.

It has been the source of their income for many years.  It drives almost all serious crime, which is no different from our nearest neighbours in the UK, in central Europe and beyond.

Certain assurances were given to us in the context of the arrangements with the funeral and that is what we hope to achieve through that form of engagement.  I will try to deal with the Deputy's question but I must be careful.  We have arrested 21 people and a number of people are before the courts in the context of the case so I must be careful.  In general terms, the organisation and I, as Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are firmly focused on the activities of so-called dissident groupings and individuals within these groups.  We worked tirelessly with our colleagues on the northern side to ensure we bring about the type of intervention and dismantling of these groups that is required to keep people in communities on both sides safe.<\/p> <p>We have a strong Garda presence on the Border.  We target particular individuals within these groupings and we share our intelligence with our colleagues in the PSNI and the British security services, with whom we interact.

We will continue to make further arrests and bring people before the courts in regard to that.  I have already publicly declared my support for the senior officer who was in charge on that day.  It would have been wrong, and his professional judgment was correct in this regard, to have used force to intercede, which is what we would have been required to do on the occasion.  There were many onlookers at the funeral procession, including women, children, men, neighbours and friends.  It would have been inappropriate to intervene.  I have said that previously.  The professional judgment made by the senior commanding officer on the day was the right decision.  <\/p><p> Will we take the foot off the pedal in future engagements with these people?  That is not likely.  It is a policing priority.  The first of our strategic goals is national and international security.  That is at the heart of what we are discussing.

When the Garda is successful in convicting some of these individuals they go to prison, where they can often be as great a threat as they were on the outside because their networks and systems of communication are still in place.

It also involves educating our younger people and getting dialogue going with the other agencies of the State and with everyone involved in the criminal justice system.  The prisons and the probation service have been mentioned.  Dialogue and discussion with them is ongoing.

Certainly, in my younger days in my policing career we did not appear to have those problems and we dealt with cheque fraud, forgeries and so forth.  We targeted those and got quite good results.  It is still the case that we are well ahead of the curve as a policing service, in the context of other policing agencies, in respect of detections.  Convictions are something else.  Once we satisfy the threshold for the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, or there is sufficient evidence to charge somebody, it is then a matter for the courts.  It is a tricky dynamic, and it is tricky to try to discuss convictions at length.  However, I can assure the Deputy that white collar crime is very high on our agenda.

The funeral of Alan Ryan was already mentioned and Donaghmede is in my constituency.  The people in Donaghmede were appalled at what happened at that funeral.  Large numbers of people came from outside the area and the area appeared to have been taken over.  There was paramilitary style marching, wearing of masks, firing of weapons and black flags on lampposts - things we had not seen for ten years or more.  People were just looking on and it appeared that nobody was in charge which appalled many people.  Some of the shops were closed and bus services were suspended for half a day - the area was in lockdown.  Perhaps the Garda was not prepared for this because it had not happened for so long.  It certainly appalled the local people.<\/p><p>  Since then, the recent murder of a prison officer in the North seems to be linked to this kind of gangland paramilitary-style war that is going on and there may be a North-South link with this kind of activity.  In view of the upsurge in such activity, does the Garda Commissioner have the resources and personnel required to deal with that level of crime?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012112100009#K01100","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353493800,"counter":769,"content":"<p>First, I will deal with the issue of the Ryan funeral.  I want to assure Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny and everybody present that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was very much prepared to deal with any eventuality that came our way on that occasion.  Professional judgments were made on the day to avoid further injury and perhaps offer to the particular groupings of which the Deputy spoke the high moral ground with a victory based on Garda intervention, that is, use of force.  We are very well equipped and we are conscious of the potential for these flash points, and I would dispel any notion to the contrary in case that is what is out there.<\/p><p>  On the wider issue, I mentioned already to the committee the level of commitment from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards tackling, dismantling and disrupting elements within the dissident groupings.  In September alone, we managed to tackle and arrest groupings in the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA - persons were designed on bringing firearms from this jurisdiction into the North for whatever reason, most likely an execution.  Those issues have been in the media and I am at liberty to speak about them.  What one does not hear about is the amount of unheralded work being done on a 24\/7 basis between ourselves, the PSNI and the security service on the far side in terms of the dismantling activities of which I speak, and we have clearly been responsible for saving many lives.  It is an absolute priority of ours dealing with these groupings.<\/p><p>  As to whether we will ever be on top of them, let us hope we are but we do not always.  We have seen that horrible death.  Only a couple of weeks ago, I was before the Committee of Public Accounts expressing my condolences to the Black family, in the context of what happened the prison officer.  We are working hand in glove with our colleagues in the PSNI.  We have made considerable progress in that investigation and we have shared a great deal of information with our colleagues in the PSNI.  I would be confident in the coming weeks that we will see further advancement in terms of that investigation.

There was a fear at the time that the south west coast was a gateway for the trafficking of such large amounts of drugs.  Is the Commissioner satisfied that the level of co-operation with Interpol, the CIA or FBI and other international agencies is sufficient to monitor and prevent such importation of large amounts of drugs, which were frightening episodes for those living in the constituency I represent?

It is certainly the case that in the past number of years we have met with increasing levels of grow houses and that continues to be a worry for us.  I mentioned in my opening remarks the nexus between some of our ex-patriots in countries such as Spain and The Netherlands teaming up with some organised criminal groups in those countries and providing opportunities for the east-west transiting of drugs and firearms, and that is naturally of particular concern to us.  We work hard in getting the type of intelligence that it is required to take these persons to task and bring them to justice.<\/p><p>  On the trends within the drugs world, a grow house is a facility that provides a quick turnaround.  If one can manage to secure safe lodgings to grow one's plants, within eight weeks one is able to harvest and these plants begin their reproductive cycle.<\/p> <p>Unless we catch up with these locations, there is a conveyor belt of money available to organised crime groups.  Quite a number of eastern European people are engaged in this activity but it is certainly the case that some  indigenous organised crime groups and individuals within them are very much involved also.  It is that nexus between these groups that we are examining very closely.  <\/p><p> We have seen throughout the harsh economic downturn that the use of cocaine and heroin do not appear to have diminished.  Like all facets of crime and illegal activity, one will see dips, hollows and peaks but heroin and cocaine are still a problem for us and we are working to tackle that.  <\/p><p> In terms of our success and the success of our international partners, the drugs world, and illicit drug trafficking in particular, is so lucrative that it will remain with us.  I do not believe anyone is naive enough to suggest it will go away.  It is incumbent on all of us, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our partners, to work hard to try to dismantle the operations of the type of people who are involved in this trade.  The volume of the seizure of drugs since September of this year have exceeded that for the whole of last year.

In regard to further proposed Garda station closures, I wish to reiterate that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to providing the best possible policing service to the people within the resources available.  The national economic climate requires the best possible use of all organisational resources within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in line with this we regularly access the organisation's capabilities and the deployment of those resources to provide a policing service.  The needs of the community and the ability of the organisation to contribute to public safety, public service and community protection remains the foremost consideration for me as Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  Local Garda management closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a district, divisional and regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible service is provided to the public.  Senior Garda management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service continues to be delivered and that current structures in place meet the requirement to deliver an effective and efficient policing service to the community.  That situation will be kept under constant review.<\/p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continuing to conduct analysis of the Garda station network in 2012 to ensure that it achieves efficiencies in the delivery of the policing service to our communities while maintaining operational resilience.  Each regional officer at assistant commissioner level is tasked with conducting an impact assessment on the demands placed on each Garda district and station within their region with a view to recommending future efficiencies while maintaining operational resilience.  The analysis of the finding is ongoing.  The commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to maintain operational effectiveness and resilience but in order to achieve this work must be prioritised and hard decisions must be made in that context.<\/p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can never over-emphasise the importance of the partnership between us and the community in preventing and detecting crime and maintaining a safe environment for everyone and the pledge of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to continue to invest time and energy in those partnerships and relationships to the benefit of all.

It is probably convenient to deal with the two topics.  I will move on to speak briefly about effective community policing.  When the national model of community policing was launched on 26 January 2009 it was rolled out nationwide.  This involved introducing community policing into every Garda district where it did not exist in the first place and to support districts where community policing was already in place.<\/p><p>  As no two districts in Ireland are the same, many community policing teams are faced with many challenges.  Their aim is to build a support network that covers all aspects of the community, from business to residential.  The national model focuses on the development of good practice and case studies of areas which have a firmly established tradition of community policing.<\/p><p>  One of the primary tasks of the National Community Policing Office is to ensure that good practice is established, supported and passed on to other Garda community policing units.  This is spread through various means such as newsletters, the Garda website, information seminars and meetings.  One such initiative of the Garda community policing office has been the production of a quarterly community policing newsletter called <i>Community Times<\/i>.  It is produced in electronic format, is placed on the Garda website and is distributed via Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert representatives.  The newsletter provides a platform for the sharing of good practice and initiatives between community policing teams and allows members of the public to view the initiatives of community policing from around the country and keeps them up to date with current issues on crime prevention, joint policing committees, diversity, Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.<\/p><p>  Community policing training is currently being delivered by the Garda in-service section of the Garda College on a nationwide basis.  This will upskill community garda&iacute; to maximise their efficiency in their day to day duties.  The National Community Policing Office keeps community policing resourced through its communications toolkit which is situated on the Garda portal.  Through this toolkit community policing can view, download and use practical material such as read-to-go presentations on various community topics, booklets, how-to guides, etc.<\/p><p>  During each year the National Community Policing Office supports two Garda Community Safety weeks, otherwise known as Supporting Safer Communities Campaigns, by producing material, guides and briefing material for the weeks set by me to assist community policing during them.  These weeks focus on community policing and crime prevention in the community.<\/p><p>  The national model of community policing identifies ten key pillars which encompass a shared vision and responsibility to ensure a safer community and a higher quality of life for all.  Those ten key pillars are empowerment, Garda-community partnerships, problem solving, crime prevention and reduction, enforcement, accessibility, collaborative engagement, visibility, improved response and accountability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012112100011#M01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Callinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1353494400,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

We have had over 700 Garda stations nationally.  All of us in the room are familiar with some of those Garda stations and what they represent to communities on the one hand and, thereafter, how effective these buildings would be.  The whole idea behind some of these closures is not a cost-saving exercise.  Having said that, however, there is no doubt that there will be savings.  I have mentioned here previously, and to the Committee of Public Accounts in the past, that the figures seem to run somewhere between &euro;2,500 and &euro;4,000 per annum to maintain these buildings.  Quite a number of them are in a poor state of repair.<\/p><p>  In setting about doing our work, we examine the demographic and the area that has to be policed.  We look at the footfall to the station, the level of crimes committed in the area and what is reported.  Generally speaking, assistant commissioners, through their teams in these areas, provide a critical analysis of those stations and what they represent within communities.<\/p><p>  When a situation arose that we would have less money and resources, it was clear to me that we had to provide a policing plan and model that would suit our circumstances.  In particular, the new roster is an example of how clustering arrangements need to be brought into being.  We are faced with perhaps one or two people working certain hours in a particular Garda station, or bringing them into a centre where they could team up with colleagues and provide a much more mobile and flexible policing service.  Therefore the idea behind the new arrangements, in cases where we are closing stations, will be to provide a service that was in place heretofore.  Beyond that, we will provide the type of efficiency that we have been speaking about.<\/p><p>  It is clearly the case that there are groups of criminals travelling the length and breadth of this country, usually late at night and early in the morning, carrying out all sorts of crimes - particularly burglary and aggravated burglary, both residential and commercial.  One will not solve those crimes or dismantle those groups within the bricks and mortar of a building.  Active policemen and women are needed out there, working with their colleagues and being effective.  They work through intelligence and crime trends to tackle these problems.  That is why the recommendations I will be making to the Minister very shortly, in the context of future station closures, will incorporate all of these aspects.<\/p><p>  We have not gone out to the community because, I dare say, no community in Ireland would agree to a station closing in its locality.  I am providing for the Minister the collateral, reasoning and logic behind decisions that formed the recommendations to close these stations.  I am indicating the type of effectiveness that can flow from reducing some of these stations and redeploying some of the personnel - not in all cases but in some - and at the same time providing the public in these areas with the reassurance that we are actually providing a policing service.  We have not pulled down the shutters on that building and walked away from those communities.  I know there is a big debate out there.  There are major concerns and rightly so.  If I was in those communities I have no doubt I would be banging on public representatives' doors to ask what they are doing to stop this.  However, this is the reality of life that we are faced with.  We have a very large number of Garda stations.  We do not see a number of them being critical to our requirements with the new policing model that we are putting in place.  That is the reasoning behind recommendations to close some of these stations.<\/p><p>  There will certainly be dialogue and discussion at joint policing committees in areas where stations have closed.

The effect on the ground is that these are part-time stations open for a limited number of hours per week.  It is important to impress upon the Commissioner that this impacts on many communities, particularly on rural communities by virtue of the dispersal of population across the country.  The comparisons to Scotland cited are not valid because of the demographic spread but a point I must air is that people believe there is a withdrawal of services from rural communities.  People appreciate that a garda sitting behind a desk may be better deployed out on the beat, and that is accepted by all of us, but unfortunately we have seen in other areas of the public service, not just in this area, a withdrawal of services into larger towns and villages and that is a serious concern to rural Ireland.  The Commissioner put his finger on it in terms of the cost because the buildings are owned by the Office of Public Works and effectively what he is left with is a day-to-day running cost which does not register on the financial scale in terms of the issues being discussed in this committee regarding the wider economy.  We want to impress upon the Commissioner that it is a policy which the public does not like or agree with and it is my job to bring that to his attention.  Many of the members of the Commissioner's force do not agree with it either.  I referred earlier to consultation with communities but some of the members of the force believe they have not been consulted.  That was brought to my attention and I was asked to bring it to the Commissioner's attention which I am doing now.  In that regard, consultation is key to this process.<\/p><p>  We had a discussion recently at our joint policing committee, JPC, on the potential redrawing of the districts within the Limerick division, which I am just using as an example, which concerns people.  There is talk in Limerick of the Askeaton division, for example, being subsumed into the neighbouring divisions and I am sure that is being examined in other areas of the country.  Issues such as those must be aired at JPC level in each authority in a manner which will help inform public representatives and communities as to the rationale.  Most of us live in the real world in terms of the way the Commissioner must make ends meet, and we appreciate the constraints he is under, but in terms of the part-time stations that is having an impact on communities.  The mere presence of a garda in the station gives people a sense of security and comfort in terms of the threats posed to those communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012112100013#O00100","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353495600,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

It is those lists and the collateral that I explained already for forming those recommendations that came back to me and the central committee examining that matter.  <\/p><p>  I have heard previously about people not being informed internally.  As far as I am concerned, I can only send the word down the line and I expect that that dialogue and discussion went on.  I know for a fact that in some cases but not in all - I cannot be everywhere but I have made it my business to inquire - some of the representatives on associations locally were consulted as part of the process bringing that back up to me.  It would be folly in the extreme for me as Commissioner to sit down and look at the list of about 700 Garda stations, tick off areas and say that this can go or that can go.  One cannot do that.  One must have a rationale for making the type of decisions we have made and as far as I am concerned, that is what has been happening.  We are very close to finalising those recommendations and they will be with the Minister shortly.  <\/p><p>  I have heard the stories the Deputy has heard but I want to assure him that no one will be blind-sided on any of this but there is a difference between making hard, cold decisions given the harsh economic realities facing us and having the type of discussion that has been spoken about.  Where this whole process will be critical is when the decision is made to sit down with the communities and the JPCs and to provide the level of reassurance I spoke about earlier.  However, I assure the Deputy that where stations have been opened for an hour or two on whatever day and whatever the services provided, that will continue in some form.  The station may not be there but we intend to go back to the community, whether it is the post office, a community hall or wherever, and provide that type of service for that period of time on those designated days and beyond that providing the type of visibility I have espoused earlier to be effective and to try to police those areas.

It is indispensable to the service we provide.  We are of the community and with the community and that will always be the case.<\/p> <p>The Deputy is referring to garda&iacute; operating locally and hearing things.  I hope the type of interaction we have had with the public continues.

We need to address people travelling around the country committing crimes.  We need to tackle these people and provide a safer community by doing that.  It is not always possible in the context of the current system we are operating.  Smarter policing includes intelligence-led operations and pin-mapping where crimes occur.  There must be resources available to deal with the situation.  We will not always have a garda or two in a particular station at particular times.  Criminals have become more mobile and I and others have referred to increased efficiency with transport and communications.  The criminal fraternity is adept at taking full advantage.  This is about providing an effective policing service.  We are at one with the Deputy in respect of the matters he raised as a public representative.

I am sure the Commissioner has heard the stories and we have heard the evidence of it across counties.

To respond to crime and crime levels, we must have a very effective regime in place, and I and my command see the need to put certain initiatives in place.  What we are seeing, in the context of more station closures, seeks to address the issue.  In short, I would recommend the closure of stations and a different policing model because we must move on.  The Deputy's comments are correct in respect of the local garda listening and hearing things.  What about the high end of the business and obtaining high-grade intelligence to help to identify the people from Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway who are coming into local areas and frightening people in their beds at night and creating mayhem in the commercial world by carrying out burglaries and robberies?

To illustrate the concern communities feel, four members of the public are in the Gallery.  They will not speak or contribute but they will listen to what is being said.  One of them got up at 2.30 this morning in Goleen to travel to Cork to get an early train to Dublin.  They are community activists in places such as Kealkill, Goleen and Kilbrittain, and their concern illustrates what is going on in rural communities.<\/p><p>  The Commissioner said his foremost thrust is to reduce crime and, if possible, eliminate it.  That may be utopian and is perhaps not achievable.  I refer to the closure of Garda stations on the Mizen Peninsula and the closure of banks.  Although the latter is not an issue for the Commissioner, when banks are closed, old people are inclined to keep money in houses and criminals are aware of it.  I am not being parochial but five or six rural courthouses have been closed in west Cork.  Garda&iacute; in Castletownbere station must go to Bandon or Cork city to deal with a criminal charge.  People are being dragged out of the community.  Was a cost benefit analysis done on the value of closing rural stations?  The evidence of closing rural stations in England and Wales is well documented and shows that crime doubles.  It may not involve gangland crime, which we are talking about, but my concern is that the saving of &euro;3,000 per year in keeping a small station open, such as Goleen or Kilbrittain, is small change with regard to having a community that is concerned and alarmed, according to the impression I get.  This will not go away because there is a belief in rural Ireland that the small hospital, the Garda station and the local bank being closed will attract criminals to an area where policing is less visible.<\/p><p>  I am very concerned about developments in the past 20 years with regard to garda&iacute; embedded in communities.  Having emigrated in my younger days, I returned to west Cork in 1981.  I knew every garda in the town and they all lived in the town.  I am concerned that garda&iacute; come to a village or town but no longer live in the community.  Dunmanway, with six or seven garda&iacute; and one or two sergeants, is an example where none of them lives in the town.<\/p> <p>It is reassuring to a local community if the local garda plays a bit of football or hurling and is seen walking the streets and people know where he lives and where to contact him.  I know that it may not be directly related but it is a concern.  There are approximately 30 garda&iacute; in my home town of Bantry.  Probably 20 of them arrive in the morning but go home at night to Kerry or another part of Cork.  That is not a good development.  I appreciate people have links to other towns.  As far as possible, if a garda is assigned to a district, he or she should live in, and be active in, that community.  That is real community policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012112100014#P00400","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353496800,"counter":802,"content":"<p>I agree with a considerable portion of what Senator O'Donovan said.

The people watching out will contact their local garda and state their suspicions.  By removing the garda from the station, is this not a kick in the teeth for the community because the message from the senior garda is that they do not think the station is important or that link with the community is important, so we will close down the station.  It is very interesting that the Commissioner stated three times that this is not about saving money but about better policing and a presence.  Is the garda in the station not a presence in the community?  What sort of message is being sent out to the criminals around the country by closing down the stations, if it is not saving money?  The Commissioner mentioned his budget.  We all appreciate that he is working under a constrained budget, but if he were to tell the committee that closing down 19 stations would save some millions of euros, that would be a point.

It works slightly differently from us, although we provide the figures.  In the area of property crime, there are burglaries, robberies, aggravated burglaries and thefts generally.  They are the crime disciplines we deal with that are grouped together under property crime.  This year, so far, we have managed to halt the graph which has been steadily rising since 2007, and we are 0.4% down on last year.

The issue of the personnel resource available to the Commissioner directly affects community policing.  Some time ago Garda strength was approximately 14,500, but as of June 2012 the latest official figure was 13,500.  Allied to that is the embargo on recruitment into and training in the force.  What is the optimum number for the force and can the Commissioner give the committee an insight on the impact of the embargo on recruitment?  To provide some context, there was much public disquiet at a recent recruitment campaign for the Defence Forces.  People asked how there can be a recruitment campaign for the Defence Forces and not for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  That is a legitimate question.  Perhaps the Commissioner can give an overview on that issue.<\/p><p>  On the issue of community policing, the Commissioner mentioned burglaries, which have increased by more than 10% in the past 12 months.  The statistic for thefts against the person was quite staggering, being in the order of 43%.  I hate to describe this as low level crime but it involves both the theft of handbags and mobile telephones and muggings.  An increase of 43% is extraordinary.  That feeds into the impact on the community and links back to the number of personnel on the street.<\/p><p>  The thefts from shops prevention and reduction strategy was launched in 2011.  It is a good strategy.  It focuses on retailers who are the victims of thefts from shops and which thefts have a huge impact on business.  Perhaps the Commissioner would comment on the roll-out of the strategy and give his assessment of it as I am sure it is monitored on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012112100017#S01700","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353498000,"counter":845,"content":"<p>To deal with the impact of the embargo on recruitment, obviously we would like if that was changed, given the lead-in time of two years in terms of bringing a person in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the point where he or she can serve on probation.  There is a lead-in time before people are effective and on the street.<\/p> <p>When one takes that in the context of a reducing attrition rate at the other end, it puts a strain on numbers.  So far, we have been managing to provide a service that we have always been providing.  That said, I would not like to see levels drop much beyond the 13,000 mark, which is what the Government has asked us to achieve.  I say that because with the type of demands that are now placed on us to be in compliance with the new Working Time Directive, which was the catalyst for the new rostering arrangement and the clustering of resources, there is a requirement to have a cadre of personnel who are available to work longer hours, and more efficiency and, as we have been speaking about, more effectiveness.<\/p><p> There is no scientific model that ordains a certain number of officers need to be available to service a certain cadre of the community.  It is very much unscientific.  It is about having the facility to move one's resources in a effective manner to deal with whatever issues are facing you at any given time and that is what we are trying to do.  That is why we have the type of flexibility within the new rostering arrangements where we can have up to 25% more personnel available on the street to do the type of work that they are required to do at the times required.  That has been a strong aspect of the Croke Park arrangement to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has contributed.  For over 40 years we have been grasping with this matter in terms of providing sufficient levels to service the community and we think we have now found a model that is suitable and will achieve that purpose, and we have been speaking about all of the issues that surrounding it.  We will work hard to ensure that it works, in conjunction with the staffing associations.  A couple of weeks ago, when I was here at the Committee  of Public Accounts, I praised the associations for the level of commitment to the negotiations and putting in place that type of rostering regime that will help us in achieving the efficiencies that we are setting out to achieve with reduced numbers.

Looking forward, it has always been the case that, between the years of service and the age dynamic, and the gap between the opportunity to retire at 50 plus with 30 years service and the compulsory retirement age at 60, there is a cadre of garda&iacute; within that bracket.  That is something that is optional.  It is a dynamic about which one is not entirely clear.  There are approximately 1,200 in that category who could go but it is unlikely that they will.  It is something which we are keeping an eye on.  I made the comment that I would like to see us not go below 13,000, and that is as much as I can say.<\/p><p>  On the other issue Deputy Niall Collins raised of the strategy with the businesses, we are trying hard with the business community, particularly in the large urban areas, at working at a solution to reduce theft from shops.  As the Deputy will be aware, we have a strong working relationship with the business communities here in the city of Dublin.  That is replicated in Cork, Galway and other large urban centres.  The Deputy will have seen the advent of the Segways sponsored by the business community as an example of the type of relationship and appreciation evident on both sides.  It is about being professional.  Repeat offenders are an issue and it is about how one deals with them.  It is about providing the necessary security and taking steps - crime prevention measures - to ensure that one stops the type of repeat offending.

The purpose of the meeting is to consider new EU legislative proposals on a variety of matters that have been referred to the joint committee for its consideration.  We have had a discussion on the various intricacies of these proposals in private session and I now propose to deal with them.<\/p><p>  COM (2012) 363 is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the fight against fraud to the EU's financial interest by means of criminal law.  It is proposed that this proposal warrants further scrutiny.  It is proposed that the committee will write to the Department of Justice and Equality asking it to keep the committee informed regarding developments with regard to this proposal and in particular to keep it informed on any development regarding the legal basis for the proposal and the setting of minimum penalties, sanctions for offences and statutory limitations.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  COM (2011) 873 is a proposal in respect of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European border surveillance system, EUROSUR.  It is proposed that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  COM (2012) 81 is a proposal in respect of a Council regulation on migration from the Schengen information system, SIS 1+ to the second generation Schengen information system, SIS II, recast.  As it is decided to implement the provisions of Schengen under a new SIS II system, this proposal has no direct impact for Ireland.  It is proposed that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  COM (2012) 239 and COM (2012) 240 are proposals for Council decisions concerning the conclusion of the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Turkey on the re-admission of persons residing without authorisation.  It is proposed that these proposals do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  COM (2012) 254 is an amended proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of EURODAC for the comparison of fingerprints and to request comparison with EURODAC data by member states' law enforcement authorities and Europol for law enforcement purposes and amending Regulation (EU) No. 1077\/2011 establishing a European agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice.  It is proposed to write to the Department of Justice and Equality seeking additional information on the proposal.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  COM (2012) 265, COM (2012) 266, COM (2012) 267 and COM (2012) 268 are proposals for Council decisions on the signature and conclusions of agreements between the UK and Ukraine and Moldova, respectively, amending the existing agreements between the EU and these two countries on the facilitation of the issuance of visas.  These proposals form part of the Schengen <i>acquis<\/i> in which Ireland does not take part.  It is proposed that these proposals warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  COM (2012) 526 is a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the existing decision with a view to increasing the co-financing rate of the European rescue fund, the European return fund and the European fund for the integration of third country nationals as regards certain provisions related to financial management or where certain member states are experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability. <\/p><p>  Members may wish to note that we understand the motion seeking to opt into this proposal will be reflected in the committee next week.  It is proposed that this proposal therefore does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  Green Paper COM (2011) 735 is the Green Paper on the right to family reunification of third country nationals living in the European Union (203\/86 EC).  It is proposed that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.

It is important at this stage to point out that we have received 44 petitions since this process was initially established.  That demonstrates the level of demand among the public for a committee of this nature.  The petitions are being examined so we can decide how best to progress them and establish if they are admissible to the committee currently.  All members have been circulated with a note on the committee and it is important that we now adjudicate on those petitions.<\/p><p>  The first petition we will look at is P00027\/12 from Mr. John O'Sullivan on issues arising from his experience with the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  As members will be aware, Mr. O'Sullivan's petition looks at the length of time it takes to process claims with the EAT, the need to employ a legal team, the fact the tribunal currently has no powers to enforce rules, the need for employers to lodge a security bond with the tribunal in advance of hearings and qualifications of appointed liquidators and the fact they are not currently affiliated to a regulator body.  Does anyone have anything they would like to add on this petition?<\/p><p>  It is an important petition that addresses the experiences of many workers.  The petition has been relayed to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, who has come back to us with a detailed letter.  He has been dealing with this issue himself with the petitioner.  The Minister is seeking to put together legislation on workplace relations and has given a commitment to deal with the issues detailed in the petition.  The proposal is that we allow the Minister to deal with the elements in the petition, we will leave the petition open and keep an eye out to ensure its objectives are being dealt with and we will revisit it in six months to see where we are.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  The next petition for consideration is P00028\/12  from Mr. Michael O'Flanagan of the Kilmainham and Inchicore Heritage Group, concerning the preservation of Kilmainham mill.

Members were circulated with details of the petitions, which address an important issue for elected representatives and the growing diaspora.  Last year, 87,000 people, including 40,000 Irish citizens, emigrated, the highest figure since the 1800s.  It is important that we find a means of allowing these individuals to engage with the discourse of society.  The experience of those who emigrated in the 1950s and 1980s was that they no longer had any interaction with the State, except where they returned to Ireland, and were forgotten in this country.  The infrastructure for political discourse did not draw them in.  There is merit in many elements of the petitions.  The inaugural meeting of the convention on the constitution will be held on 1 December and a functioning meeting will take place in January 2013.  As a preliminary step, it is recommended that the petitions be referred to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for consideration as the two issues in question fall directly within his remit.

Members have been circulated with the petitions.  There is nothing in legislation which vindicates the right of a family not to have an imposition placed on them as a result of a tall tree or hedge.  I refer, for example, to problems with light.  It can cost up to &euro;20,000 to have a dispute about the height of trees resolved.  The issue comes under the remit of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act in England and Wales and the High Hedges (Northern Ireland) Act in the North.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is considering legislation which would entitle homeowners to adequate light.  He also proposes to introduce a mediation Bill to promote the use of mediation to resolve issues of this nature.  In our view, the issue of trees falls within the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.

It is a pleasure for us to have the opportunity to discuss them with committee members.  We did submit a written paper and I will give the highlights of it rather than read through every detail.  We will happily discuss any related issue members wish to raise.<\/p><p>  I will start with the policy position on renewable energy from the Government strategy for renewable energy 2012 to 2020 which was released earlier this year.  A short quote from it states:<blockquote>The development of renewable energy is central to overall energy policy in Ireland.  Renewable energy reduces dependence on fossil fuels, improves security of supply, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions creating environmental benefits while delivering green jobs to the economy, thus contributing to national competitiveness and the jobs and growth agenda.<\/blockquote>  This country has sustainable energy targets focusing on 2020, covering reductions in greenhouse gases, improvements in energy efficiency and the development of a renewable energy sector.  Our paper highlights those targets in detail, noting that in particular the renewable energy targets are split between targets for renewable electricity, renewable heat and renewable transport.  We also note our progress towards targets in recent years, in particular our progress towards renewable electricity.  It is important to note as well that the use of renewable energy avoided the emission of approximately 3.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2011.  Equally, the use of wind energy in 2011 is estimated to have reduced fuel imports by approximately &euro;300 million due to the use of indigenous renewable resources instead of imported fossil fuels.<\/p><p>  Sustainable energy starts with energy efficiency in terms of reducing the amount of energy we use in all sectors, and thereby lowering people's bills, reducing imports and reducing the environmental impact of energy use.  Energy efficiency action also has the benefit of directly supporting jobs, reducing fuel poverty and improving competitiveness of businesses in terms of their energy costs.  Members will be aware that in recent years energy efficiency activity in this country has increased considerably with many homes and businesses taking action to improve their energy performance and hence lower their bills.  That has been driven by Government-funded supports that we in SEAI administer.  Last year alone Government finance into energy efficiency stimulated a total spend in the economy of more than &euro;250 million in all sectors.  It is important to that such action has reduced energy bills in homes and businesses and directly supporting employment in the construction sector and making businesses more competitive and thereby protecting jobs in all sectors.<\/p><p>  I will turn now to renewable energy and say a few words about the three strands of energy; electricity, heat and transport.  First, growth in renewable electricity has been particularly strong in this country, driven by a deployment of wind especially in recent years.  Last year, approximately 18% of all our electricity usage came from renewable sources, in particular wind.  On the island of Ireland we have approximately a 2,000 MW capacity of wind turbines installed.  That is in a context of peak demand of approximately 5,000 MW.  It is estimated that we need to install approximately 300 MW a year every year between now and 2020 to meet our renewable electricity target in that timeframe.  We believe that is achievable.  There are many projects in the pipeline but there are challenges in terms of planning permission, the build-out of grid and other associated issues of which the committee is aware.<\/p><p>  Renewable heat is a more complex sector related to the use of biomass in homes and buildings to convert wood chip or wood pellet into heat.  It is about the use of waste to make bio-gas and many different sources from energy crops to waste materials, to forestry and turning lots of different technologies into heat that people use in homes and businesses.  The important growth sectors in terms of meeting our targets are first, energy efficiency, because the less heat we use the easier it is to meet our renewable targets as well as all the other benefits.  There will be growth in the use of renewable heat in the business sector in particular, especially in some of the larger users such as the food and drink sector, hotels and others that use large amounts of heat and are therefore more interested in deploying renewables in the short term.<\/p><p>  We have a 10% target for renewable transport by 2020 and most of that is likely to come from the blending of bio-fuels into conventional liquid fuels that are used in transport, namely petrol and diesel.  Already, all of the petrol and diesel one buys for vehicles currently has a small percentage of bio-fuels mixed into it.  That will continue to grow in the future.<\/p><p>  I wish to turn to the specific question the committee asked us to address on the cost of renewable energy, in particular its effect on electricity prices.  I mentioned some of the benefits of renewable electricity in terms of reduction of imports of fossil fuels and also reductions in carbon emissions.  The cost of that is a source of much debate and analysis.  I wish to refer to a few of the studies and research that tell us about the issue currently.  First, by way of background, as members are probably aware, wind energy in this country is supported in the electricity system by a mechanism known as the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff or REFIT for short.  In effect, it is similar to mechanisms used in other countries.  It sets a minimum floor price that renewable generators get.  If the price falls below that they still get the price which is to help to lower the risk of the investment for wind energy in particular.  The reason for that is that the financial model for a wind farm is quite different from the financial model for a gas-fired station, as I am sure members appreciate.  Whereas with a wind farm it is all about the cost of building it and then the running costs are very nearly zero, but with a fossil fuel-fired plant there is a certain cost to build it but also there is a significant ongoing cost of the fuel.  Therefore the financial models are the same even though over their lifetime the cost per unit of electricity generated is similar, they are remunerated in different ways in the system.<\/p> <p>A couple of quantitative studies provide indications of the impact of this on the price for consumers.  A recent European Commission study carried out by the Fraunhofer Institute compared the mechanisms in all EU countries for supporting renewable electricity and noted that the Irish refit mechanism is one of the most cost effective systems in Europe.  We remunerate renewable generators at one of the lowest levels in the EU.  The reason for that is largely because the wind regime is very good here.  Wind energy is more economically viable in Ireland than in other countries simply because the wind blows more often.<\/p><p> SEAI conducted a study with Eirgrid to analyse the impact of wind on prices and costs for every half hour over the course of 2011.  In any given period, wind electricity can be put into the system at low cost if the wind is blowing, with the result that we do not have to use the more expensive generating plant.  Plants that are less efficient and, therefore, cost more in terms of fossil fuel input can be powered down or turned off.  Wind energy lowers the wholesale price of electricity, although it adds to retail prices due to market payments to reward wind generators.  The balance between lowered wholesale prices and increased retail prices will ultimately determine the effect on the cost of electricity to the consumer.  In the context of a total wholesale electricity market of &euro;2 billion our analysis indicates that wind energy lowered the wholesale price across 2011 by approximately &euro;70 million, which turns out to be almost exactly the same amount as the increase in the retail price.  The net effect was, therefore, almost precisely zero.  Wind energy did not add to the cost of electricity for consumers in 2011.<\/p><p> A recent study by Ernst and Young compared a number of European countries in regard to the contribution to local economies of wind and gas generation.  Much of the value created in gas generation leaves Ireland to pay for gas imported from other countries, whereas with wind more money stays in Ireland because it is associated with maintenance jobs and other local inputs.  The contribution by wind generation to GDP and job creation is higher than that of gas.<\/p><p> Further analysis will be published in the new year because we are carrying out a more detailed analysis in conjunction with our parent Department, the regulator and Eirgrid, focusing in particular on the impact of wind energy on consumer electricity prices in 2020.  As I am sure members can imagine, the study suggests that the answer depends the cost of alternatives, namely, gas prices.  When gas prices are high wind lowers the price of electricity.  The exact outcome for 2020 depends on one's view of gas prices at that time.  In that context, new data published last week by the International Energy Agency predict that gas prices will continue to increase at the rate of the last several years and will be higher by approximately 30% over the next decade.<\/p><p> I will now speak briefly about the enterprise opportunities associated with sustainable energy in Ireland.  The global movement towards renewable energy and energy efficiency, including related technologies and services, suits Ireland very well for a number of reasons.  First, we have a rich renewable energy resource both onshore and, over the longer term, offshore in terms of wind and wave energy from the seas around Ireland.  That resource is becoming more valuable internationally as countries move towards renewable and low carbon energy.  Second, the sustainable energy transition requires developments in information technology, remote communications and software.  As these sectors and skills are strongly represented in Ireland there is an opportunity for Irish entrepreneurs to develop new technologies and services in sustainable energy, dealing with everything from control of energy in the home to management of wind and the grid.  I refer in our paper to two areas that offer particularly strong enterprise opportunities for Ireland.  The first is the concept of the smart grid.  In the electricity system, the operator is always trying to balance supply and demand.  This becomes a more complex task when there is a lot of wind in the system or when some turbines are turning while others are not, and a more technologically advanced electricity supply system is needed.  Ireland's success in bringing renewable electricity into the system despite our relative lack of interconnection compared to other countries comes from developing technological solutions that are more advanced than the other countries which intend to expand renewable energy generation over the coming decades.  This offers Irish companies opportunities to export the technologies and experience they are currently developing.<\/p><p> Energy export is a subject with which members may have become familiar.  Ireland's rich renewable energy resources are considerably more economically viable than those of other countries.  The prospect arises not only to meet our own needs from indigenous renewable resources but also to export clean renewable energy.  The Government is currently negotiating a framework with the UK with a view to setting up mechanisms to allow Irish wind generators to sell electricity into the UK between now and 2020 in order to help it meet its renewable energy targets.  This presents a tremendous opportunity for Ireland to create wealth and employment in this sector.  Our indigenous natural energy resources could become a major export opportunity in the coming decades.<\/p><p> I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  The topic of renewable energy is discussed extensively in society.  We hope to contribute our knowledge and data to help inform that debate in the context of a sector which offers significant opportunities for Ireland.  Given our comparative advantage in renewable energy the sector has potential for becoming a significant employment generator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Motherway","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353490800,"counter":891,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Motherway for his presentation, which gave us a lot of food for thought.

Issues also arise in regard to inspections.  People who previously worked in other construction sectors have experience of interacting with other bodies.

We acknowledge that with such a large scheme, there will always be cases where people believe the rules are unclear or cause difficulties for either contractors or homeowners.<\/p><p>  With regard to contractors, in disbursing public funds the scheme gives rise to a number of issues around the governance of funding, financial management and quality of work which attach a level of bureaucracy to the scheme.  We try to minimise this to make the process an easy experience for both the contractor and the homeowner.  However, we focus on the quality of work done and the financial probity of the contractors.  Where there are specific issues, we always try to deal with them to make the scheme accessible to small companies, as well as larger ones, as far as we can.  Sometimes larger companies find it easier to meet our requirements in terms of financial management simply because they are larger.

As the Deputy may be aware, it is Government policy to move away from making up-front grants towards what is called a pay-as-you-save scheme, under which financial support will not be based on a grant but more on a loan model.  Homeowners will pay for the work over a long period from the savings they accrue.  Therefore, we are in the process of making changes to the scheme.<\/p><p>  For the most part, we try to treat all installers in the same manner.  If they have the wherewithal to manage our systems, we try to give them as much responsibility as possible.  We try to deal with them on an individual basis.  If the Deputy is aware of specific companies with issues, we would be happy to speak to them to discuss these issues or if they consider they are not being fairly treated and would like to do things differently.  <\/p><p>  Deputy John O'Mahony asked about homeowners.  Ours is a large-scale system and we use online processing as much as possible.  We have a quick approval process because it means most people can get on with the work involved.  We also have postal channels and hotlines which people can call.  We put a significant onus on contractors.  The contractors who are registered with us and have signed up to the code of practice know the levels of installation required and the work they need to do for grants to be applied.  We expect them to deal fairly with the homeowner in terms of what they propose to do in a home.  If that does not happen, we try to resolve the issues involved.<\/p> <p>We always try to deal with specific cases on a case-by-case basis.  We decided last year to establish a special fast-track channel to allow Members of the Oireachtas to contact us to make us aware of particular cases that were proving to be difficult.  We did this because we were receiving representations from Members of the Oireachtas.  We deal with queries we receive at the special e-mail address, <i>oireachtas@seai.ie<\/i>, if it is possible to do so.  I can circulate details of the system to members of the committee who may have queries.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael Moynihan asked about the warmer homes scheme, whereby the State takes on the full cost of upgrading from an energy perspective the homes of those in what is loosely known as the fuel poverty sector.  We have upgraded approximately 90,000 homes in that way in the past few years.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, as part of a pilot scheme we are working in partnership with local authorities and other bodies to target whole communities, as well as individuals.  We welcome the suggestion we should focus on particular sectors such as rural cottages.  We hope to expand the pilot scheme next year in the context of the Government's new energy affordability strategy which was launched earlier this year.  As well as dealing with individual queries and requests, the strategy places a focus on the area-based approach to which I have referred.  We hope to continue to operate in this way in the coming years.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael Moynihan also referred to some of the concerns of local communities about wind energy developments.  We are aware that in some areas wind energy projects are becoming more controversial and raising more concerns.  It is very important that local concerns are listened to and addressed.  The sector is getting better at consulting local communities and taking their concerns on board.  We actively encourage wind energy project developers to place a significant focus on local consultation, involvement, benefits and participation in projects.  That will help the sector to continue to grow.<\/p><p> Deputy John O'Mahony asked about the 2020 targets.  We are confident that the targets can be met.  The most significant progress in recent years has been made in the area of renewable electricity.  This has been driven by a healthy wind energy sector which, in turn, has been driven by a healthy wind resource in Ireland which we hope will continue.  The heat and transport sectors are probably more challenging because the technologies are not as mature or cost-effective as they are in the wind energy sector.  We will continue to work on this issue.<\/p><p> I was asked about micro generation by farmers and others in local communities.  We take the point that it is very important for local people to be able to supplement their income in this way, while also feeling the benefits of renewable energy production.  From the perspective of the farmer, the challenge in the case of wind energy is that it is one of those technologies where the bigger it is, the more economically viable it tends to be for various reasons.  Smaller devices tend not to be as quick at repaying one's investment.  Nevertheless, we are seeing a healthy interest from the farming community and other rural sectors.  They are interested not just from an economic point of view but also from an environmental stewardship point of view.  We will continue to work with such individuals.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to examine how the micro generation sector can be supported into the future.<\/p><p> The SEAI is very positive about the future of wave and tidal energy technologies for Ireland.  The renewable energy resource available off Ireland's shores is truly massive.  It could generate a great deal of clean electricity for Ireland and other countries.  However, the technology is still immature.  The technology associated with tidal power is technically easier.  It involves locating a conventional-type turbine at a location where water flows in and out.  A company in County Louth is exporting technologies to several countries.  That is quickly becoming cost-comparative, but wave energy technology will take longer to develop.  A number of Irish companies are developing devices, but none of them is yet fully mature.  It is a new technological area which is still under development.  The technology is still relatively expensive, but we are optimistic about where it can go in the future.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael Colreavy asked about the ambition for the sector.  We certainly share the sentiment that this is a great opportunity for Ireland and more can be done.  The targets may seem low, but they are challenging for the birth of a new sector.  With the exception of wind energy which I have mentioned on a few occasions, the technologies we are discussing are still more expensive than conventional technologies, even though prices are coming down rapidly.  The cost of solar power, for example, has reduced globally by over one half in the past five years, which has suddenly made it a much more viable technology.  We hope to see prices continue to fall.  However, there is a cost question in the short term, as some renewable technologies remain more expensive than conventional technologies, which is limiting their uptake from the State's point of view and also from the point of view of the consumer.  I accept the point that renewable energy production brings stability to prices as it grows.  The biggest cause of instability in electricity prices is the volatility of global commodity prices such as of gas and oil.  We remain vulnerable as a small price-taker in these global markets.  The more we can deploy our indigenous sustainable and predictable resources, the better the scenario for Ireland from an economic and environmental perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100005#F00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Motherway","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353492000,"counter":903,"content":"<p>I would like to follow up on that aspect briefly.

Deputy Ann Phelan inquired about hydroelectricity and Spirit of Ireland.  As far as I am aware, the latter is still developing.  There are a number of similar concepts but, as far as I understand it, the Spirit of Ireland version involves building a number of wind turbines on artificial lakes and pumping energy uphill when the wind is blowing and then generating electricity by allowing it to flow back down again.  Spirit of Ireland is considering this matter not only in the context of meeting Ireland's energy needs but also with regard to exporting to the UK market.  There have been other developments in this space as well.  A number of private companies are working on the idea of harvesting renewable energy in Ireland, not just to meet our needs but also in the context of exporting it to Britain.<\/p><p>  This matter is also germane to the Deputy's question on the interconnector.  She is entirely correct in referring to the need to have routes along which to export.  In addition to the interconnector that was recently brought on line, we are probably going to need others to the UK and also to France.  Some of these interconnectors might be developed by private operators, while others might be developed by the State.  The future of electricity in Europe lies much more towards integration, both in terms of the market and also in the context of physical connection.  This will suit Ireland because, ultimately, we will have a significant comparative advantage over most countries in Europe because it is less costly to generate renewable energy here.  This is a result of the fact that Ireland is windier than most of its neighbours in Europe.  We will, therefore, have an opportunity to sell power not just to the UK but also, in the longer term, to the remainder of Europe.<\/p><p>  Quite a number of developments have taken place in respect of district heating in recent years, particularly at the tail end of the building boom.  This involves the idea of putting in place a central large boiler which would pipe hot water and heat to a number of homes, businesses or offices.  District heating usually makes the most economic sense when there is a mixture of domestic and commercial uses at play and, in particular, if a school, a swimming pool or whatever, can be included.  There have been a number of developments along these lines.  It also tends to be deployed quite a lot in apartment blocks, where the costs involved tend to be lower.  For obvious reasons it has been employed much less in recent years.  This is because district heating systems are much easier to fit into new builds than they are to retrofit because the latter involves digging up streets, etc.  However, there continues to be activity in the sector.<\/p><p>  We are of the view that Ireland could be a leading global player in the marine energy sector, particularly as it has a ready-made resource off its shores.  Scotland and France are among our competitors in this area but we also work with them.  Some of the technologies being deployed off France are made in County Louth by a company called OpenHydro.  This company recently won a contract to deploy its devices off the coast of Northern Ireland, which speaks to the all-island question.  While very much in its infancy - this is because the technologies involved are quite new - we are of the view that this sector has significant long-term potential, particularly in the context of the development of technologies, expertise and services here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100007#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Motherway"},{"type":"speech","time":1353492600,"counter":911,"content":"<p>What is the name of the company to which Dr. Motherway referred?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100007#H00300","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353492600,"counter":912,"content":"<p>It is called OpenHydro.

The waste of energy is very close to the hearts of those who work for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  We have worked on energy efficiency and energy wastage for many years.  Even as a seasoned actor in the sector, I continue to be shocked by the amount of energy we all waste in our homes and businesses.  Our statistics suggest that we could easily reduce our total energy demand through simple actions such as buying better quality light bulbs, better boilers and by turning off appliances.  Some of the grant schemes we have run in respect of the retrofitting of insulation and boilers into people's homes have had a significant impact nationally in the context of saving energy.  However, there is a great deal more to do.  The business sector is taking strong action because those in it realise they can reduce their cost base by upgrading their energy efficiency and thereby reducing their bills.  We have been approached by many companies in this regard.  We offer grants to companies but we also offer free advice.  If any business of any size wishes to approach us, we will give it free advice on how to save energy and hence reduce its costs.<\/p><p>  There is a great deal of information in respect of this matter on our website and people can download mobile phone applications to obtain free information.  We also engage in a great deal of activities in schools.  For obvious reasons, the school audience is ripe in the context of educating people not just about the green dimension but also in respect of cost.  We benefit from a nice, healthy information flow in this regard.  I hear a great deal of anecdotal evidence from people about their children coming home from school and telling them what they should be doing to save energy in their homes.  There is a great deal more awareness of sustainable energy than was the case even five years ago.  We want to build on that awareness, and the interest which accompanies it, to develop further the various dimensions of our policies, for both economic and environmental reasons.<\/p><p>  I was asked about the all-island nature of our network.  We have an all-island electricity market but the Commission for Energy Regulation would be better placed to discuss this matter in detail.  If it is acceptable, I will leave it to the commission's representatives to answer the question posed in this regard.  I believe I have covered all of the matters raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100007#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Motherway"},{"type":"speech","time":1353492600,"counter":913,"content":"<p>Dr. Motherway referred to the potential to export energy to Europe.

It will be well into the next decade before the relevant infrastructure such as interconnectors, etc. will be in place to allow us to start selling energy further afield.  There is currently a strong trend towards a fully integrated European market, what some people refer to as the \"supergrid\", which will involve all countries being interconnected and power being moved over much longer distances.  Even though it costs more to move power over a greater distance, the fact that the resource available in Ireland is so strong will compensate for this.  The benefits of generating electricity in Ireland are sufficiently strong to cover the cost of transmitting it over longer distances.<\/p><p>  Our competitors will be other countries with strong resources.  We are of the view, however, that we have the potential to be a strong leader in the field.  It will be a question of whether the relevant technologies will be deployed.  Some countries, such as Britain and Germany, are focusing a great deal on offshore wind energy at present, which is more expensive to generate than onshore wind energy.  I accept, however, that the costs will decrease as technology develops.  The imperatives to move towards renewables and away from fossil fuels are so strong globally that there will be opportunities for many technologies to develop.  I do not believe there will be only one winner.  There will be market opportunity for anyone who can develop solutions which can be used to generate clean electricity and move it at a reasonable cost.  As a result of the fact that Ireland is a relatively small-scale player, it could be generating a great deal of electricity by its standards, but this would not mean that we would be taking over the European market or would be obliged to beat every other player.

I hope to talk briefly about the roles and functions of the CER and the impact of renewable energy on electricity costs.<\/p><p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is Ireland's independent energy regulator.  Under European rules the commission is independent of the Government.  Its remit includes broad economic and safety functions with regard to energy.  It may not be generally known that a significant fraction of our work is in the area of safety issues relating to energy.  Dr. Paul McGowan is responsible for the safety division.  The commission also deals with economic issues relating to energy.  The CER is likely to be appointed as the water regulator.  This has been discussed by the Government but no legislation has been published as yet.   I can provide members with further information on the role and functions of the commission.  The commission website is<i> cer.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>  I refer to the CER mission statement.  In a world in which energy prices and supply are highly volatile, as referred to in the presentation from SEAI, the mission of the CER is to act in the interests of consumers by ensuring that the lights stay on, the gas flows, prices charged are fair and reasonable, the environment is fully protected and energy is supplied safely.  These are the five elements of our mission statement.<\/p><p>  With regard to the functions of the CER, the commission jointly regulates the wholesale energy market - the electricity generation market - with the North of Ireland.  Statutory arrangements are in place in both jurisdictions.  Regulation and decisions are made jointly.  The energy networks consist of the electricity wires and the gas pipes.  Those networks will always be monopolies and CER regulates them directly.  We set the prices for those monopolies.  The generation market is a competitive market which we do not directly regulate.  We set the rules, we issue licences and monitor market players, and we monitor the retail energy sector.  All electricity prices and nearly all gas prices are deregulated.  We do not set those prices.  There is competition between various players, in tune with the EU framework.  We work on customer protection issues, providing a complaints resolution process and a customer care section.  Customers contact us if they have a complaint with a supplier and we have some statutory powers in that regard.<\/p><p>  We also deal with safety regulation.  We regulate what we call gas undertakings, which include gas installers, LPG installers and electrical contractors.  In the past year we have taken on what we call upstream petroleum safety, which means that we set rules for safety in offshore petroleum exploration.  This is a recent new responsibility.  Dr. McGowan can speak further about that if needed.  <\/p><p>  The recent rise in electricity market costs is hugely upsetting.  The SEM, single electricity market, operated jointly with the North of Ireland, makes up nearly 60% - it varies from 55% to 60% - of the total electricity cost.  The cost of generating electricity is the biggest single cost of electricity.  Gas prices are the biggest driver rather than oil or coal prices.  Almost 60% of electricity generated in Ireland comes from gas.  One of the key points to make is that gas prices affect gas prices.  The biggest single effect on electricity prices at the moment is also gas prices. That is the way it will be for a while.  However, as more renewable energy is available, that might be less of a factor.  We can discuss this later.<\/p><p>  The networks are monopolies and they make up 30% to 35% of the entire electricity cost.  They are what we call new capital build and interest rates are a big cost driver.  There are three residential electricity suppliers and four or five business suppliers.  The cost of supply is only 5% or 6% of the total; the main cost is in the wires and the generation.  Another component is the public service obligation, PSO, which consists of subsidies paid to certain forms of generation, notably renewables, but also others.  We can talk more about this if needs be.  It is approximately 3% or 4% of the total but it varies from year to year.<\/p><p>  Ireland's fuel generation mix is illustrated on the slide that is currently displayed.  The country is currently very carbon-intensive, but the use of renewable energy has increased.  Gas use is at about 55% to 60% of the total; coal is about 15% to 16%; peat is at 8%; renewables broadly considered are now close to 20%.  The target is to reach 40% renewable electricity generation by 2020.  At the moment I emphasise that we are very dependent on gas.<\/p><p>  The next slide shows how prices of international fossil fuels have changed over recent years.  The price shown in blue is the price of gas.  We buy nearly all of our gas from the UK.  The price shown in red is the price of oil.  Prices went very high in 2008 and then fell.  Oil began to recover more quickly while gas took longer, but in the past two years gas prices have risen significantly.  In the past year, gas prices have risen by nearly 50%.  These are the main drivers of electricity costs.  Renewables are a genuine hedge against gas prices.  We are very vulnerable to rises in gas prices.  This will still be the case in 2020 but less so.  <\/p><p>  I will ask my colleague Mr. Blaney to speak about renewables.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100008#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Nolan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353493200,"counter":922,"content":"<p>Much of the content has been covered already by Dr. Motherway, so I will not labour the point on the various issues he raised.  We support the opinions he presented to the committee.  The target for Ireland to obtain 16% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 is binding.  This includes energy all across the economy - not just the electricity sector but also transport and heating.  The largest slice of that 16% obligation sits on the electricity sector because the biggest changes can be made in that sector.  The 40% target for electricity generation from renewables by 2020 will contribute to the delivery of the overall 16% target.<\/p><p>  The next slide shows the position of Ireland relative to the rest of Europe and how the target compares with the rest of Europe.  The target of 40% is probably not strange in a European context.  Quite a few member states have higher targets than Ireland.<\/p> <p>Ireland is different in that it relies mainly on wind energy to deliver on that target.  Some 37% of the overall capacity will be delivered by onshore wind.  As the SEAI stated this morning, Ireland has a comparative advantage in this regard in that onshore wind energy can be delivered at a much lower cost than it can be elsewhere in Europe because of the significant wind resource we have on the island.  In Europe, there is much more reliance on photovoltaic generation.  I refer to the use of solar panels to create electricity directly from the sun.  Traditionally, the cost has been quite high in Europe in this regard.  When we talk to other regulators in Europe, we note there are significant challenges associated with the additional costs associated with photovoltaic generation.  Ireland has benefited from not having had the high cost subsidies.  We have had much lower cost subsidies through wind.  This has been significantly to our advantage by comparison with comparable nations across Europe.<\/p><p> The next slide shows our progress in the growth of renewables.  There has been steady progress yearly.  I will not say that there have been no challenges as significant challenges arise when delivering on the targets.  Networks comprise some of the challenges.  The absorption by the system of the amount of wind energy in question gives rise to certain challenges.  We have had continuing success regarding delivery, however, and this is recognised at European level.  When we talk to other regulators, we note our credibility has been significantly enhanced because we have delivered on renewables.  Our activity is not aspirational and has been demonstrated on the ground, as is evident from the facts and figures.<\/p><p> We have set out the various subsidy prices for the various sources of technology.  As one can see from the slide, high-volume wind results in the price that is by far the lowest, at &euro;68 per megawatt hour.  This is the floor price.  There are higher subsidies for other technologies.  A much lower volume of these is used in terms of the delivery of the target.  One must consider biomass and small-scale hydroelectricity generation.  Some members mentioned the latter form of generation.<\/p><p> Onshore wind is by far the largest component in terms of having resources available at the lowest cost.  From our perspective, which involves meeting targets at the lowest cost for consumers, there is a clear logic to using as much onshore wind as possible because of the cost advantage Ireland has in this area.<\/p><p> I will talk a little about the impact this has on wholesale prices.  Mr. Brian Motherway alluded to this when he spoke to the committee.  What happens when a wind farm has a large output in a windy half hour?   The wind-generated energy displaces fossil fuel energy on the system.  Those fossil fuels are set to price for the wholesale at that time.  As the fossil fuel generators are displaced, the wholesale price is reduced.  We have seen this demonstrated in a number of studies.  It is self-evident that the more wind energy there is in the system, the lower the wholesale price.  Obviously, if it is windy at a very expensive time, such as the evening peak, the benefit is much greater.  If it is windy in the middle of the night, when generation is much less costly, the benefit is reduced.<\/p><p> It is also self-evident that, as gas prices rise and more expensive plant is displaced, the value of wind is greater to the system.  If the prices are lower at that point, the value is lower.  The value of renewables to the system is very much dependent on the alternative price from fossil fuels.  This is an important dynamic in terms of the value of renewables to the system in Ireland. <\/p><p> We mentioned a number of studies that examined this effect and the other costs.  While there is a cost benefit in terms of the wholesale price, there are some incremental costs incurred in terms of the networks and the cost of delivery of networks to meet the targets.  There are also impacts in respect of the operation of the system.<\/p><p> As the SEAI representatives said, we are currently working with various parties, including the ESRI and the SEAI.  This work is being led by the Department.  We are working to try to have a definitive study.<\/p><p> The next slide shows the results of our own study.  It is slightly out of date and I attach some health warnings to the figures, which may not now be exact.  The study clearly shows that as fuel prices rise, the value of renewables in Ireland is significantly greater.  If fossil fuel prices were much lower &ndash; one could debate the likelihood &ndash; the value of renewables would be reduced.  However, it does provide a hedge, such that the risk of higher prices to consumers is protected by having a significant component of energy generated from renewable sources.<\/p><p> Let me refer briefly to the challenge to networks posed by the delivery of renewables.  A map of wind resources in Ireland shows that the best resources are on the west coast, particularly the north west.  Typically, this has not been an area with very significant network resources.  EirGrid, the company responsible for the planning of networks, has a significant programme in place called GRID25 to ensure networks will be enhanced and upgraded to allow sufficient networks to achieve the targets at a reasonable cost to consumers.<\/p><p> There have been significant and ongoing challenges associated with planning.  There are growing concerns over public acceptance of the grid.  It is important that the message be clearer that if we want to deliver on our renewables targets, we must have a network that can absorb renewable energy at a reasonable price.  This is an ongoing challenge.  The network companies are working hard.  The regulator incentivises the system to ensure that they can deliver on their targets in a timely and cost-effective manner.<\/p><p> Since Ireland is a leader in terms of having high levels of wind penetration into the system, achieving a target of 37% or 40% on the system is more likely than in most of the rest of the world.  This poses challenges for the system operator.  At present, only 50% of the energy accepted at any point can be wind generated.  We have set out a programme with the operators to increase this capacity to 75%.  In order to do so, significant technological changes are required.  A significant amount of innovation is also required.  We cannot follow others in this regard; we will have to be a world leader in terms of having this amount of wind generation in the system.  EirGrid and ESB Networks are ready for the challenge.  We have certainly incentivised them in respect of price control and oversight to ensure they deliver in this area.  There is a significant technological challenge but an opportunity arises for Ireland in terms of its being an innovator in determining what new technologies could absorb the required amount of wind energy into the system.<\/p><p> Mr. Motherway referred to smart grids.  We will talk briefly about smart meters and the need to change the way consumers consume electricity in the home.  It is important that we, as a nation, move from being a follower to being a leader.<\/p><p> My last slide refers not only to smart grids but also to the need for changes in the way consumers consume energy.  We heard the debate on energy efficiency and its importance.  It is not just a question of consuming less energy but of when we consume energy.  If we can consume less energy when there are high prices or large amounts of fossil-fuel energy and more energy when there are more renewable resources, cheaper wholesale prices and more sustainable sources of generation, it will help not only to develop the renewables industry but also to reduce the cost to consumers.  Obviously, the latter is a key consideration for us.<\/p><p> I am sure members will be aware of the challenge faced by consumers in paying bills at this time.  Approximately one in ten consumers is struggling to pay his bills at present.  We have a helpline that consumers can telephone directly with complaints, problems with suppliers and challenges that arise when paying bills.  The difficulties that arise prey hard on us as we regulate the industry.  It is very important that the renewables targets are met at a reasonable cost and that the best innovators and brains in the country are used to achieve this in a manner that works for consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100008#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353494400,"counter":924,"content":"<p>I thank the commission for attending the committee and for its presentation.  Energy prices are a major issue as they are constantly spiralling up.  I was in correspondence with the commission before about an increase in ESB prices several months ago.  Subsequently, the ESB announced it had a half yearly profit of &euro;230 million and was facing a &euro;500 million profit for the full year.  The perception is that this substantial profit is being generated by a semi-State body on the backs of the householders.

I have heard many concerns about electricity prices.  When the market was opened up, the ESB had the cheapest prices in Europe.

Be it some European directive or otherwise, I cannot understand why one would privatise a semi-State company that makes money for the State.  I am certainly opposed to any such move.  What role did the commission have in the original arrangements that brought this into place?  To me, it flies in the face of what I believe.  On top of that, jobs have been created by the ESB while profits have been consistently large but we keep jacking up the prices.  There seems to be price-fixing in either Europe or in Ireland or a combination of both.  What is the commission's view on that?<\/p><p>  We are very dependent on gas and our supply is linked into the European network.  How sustainable are gas supplies in the long run?

I am unsure how useful it is to say this but in terms of legislation regardless of whether a company is public or private we cannot treat it any differently.  I wish to be clear about that.  This comes partially from the European Union framework.  Under our statute we are bound to regulate the ESB or Bord G&aacute;is in exactly the same way as we would any privately-owned company.  It is simply the way the legislative framework works.<\/p><p> The profits earned by ESB include significant aspects that do not come from areas to do with regulation.  Having said that, I accept that it is an important area.  I put it to the Deputy that I would be horrified if the ESB had full-year profits of &euro;500 million.  I am not trying to justify the ESB or explain its actions.  Ultimately, the committee may wish to discuss this with the ESB, but my understanding is that it expects its full-year profits be no greater than, and possibly less than, its half-year profits.  While I accept that there has been an increase in profits in this half-year I do not expect it to be in any sense replicated in the second half of the year.  I do not believe the &euro;500 million profit will materialise.  I can offer some reasons for this, if the Deputy so wishes.  The ESB manages its own accounts but two reasons likely include the following.  The first relates to the ESB Networks business, that is, the wires.  It is a monopoly and most of the expenditure it will incur will be in the second part of the year.  The company pays salaries throughout the year but most of its expenditure will arise in the second half of the year.  It will have higher costs in the second half of the year but the same revenues.  The ESB will not have profits in that area in the second half of the year.<\/p><p> The other area is generation.  There are several large generation plants and, by their nature, they need to be refitted and production must stop for two or three weeks.  My colleague, Garrett Blaney, once ran a plant.  The ESB has informed me that it expects two of its largest stations, Moneypoint and Synergen, will basically be turned off for a time in the second half of the year.  They will be refitted and something will be done to them - I am not precisely sure what.  This happens to all generation firms.  The ESB does not expect to make any profit from those stations.  These were the reasons offered.<\/p><p> Let us consider past ESB profits.  They have always tended to be higher in the first half of the year.  The ESB has informed me that this will be the case particularly this year.  I am keen to give a full answer to the Deputy and I will try to explain why I believe profits have increased in this half-year compared to the corresponding half-year last year because it may be interesting.  One reason has to do with a financial swop.  I wish I could explain all the details but I probably cannot.  ESB bought the Northern Ireland network business one or two years ago.  This was a major financial transaction of more than &euro;1 billion and I understand there is an accounting profit included in the first half-year figures to do with a related financial transaction.  I cannot explain any more of the detail although I wish I could.  If necessary I will try to follow up if the Deputy seeks further information.<\/p><p> There are two other points and the second is especially interesting.  ESB's power generation profits are earning more in the first half-year this year than last year.  Why is that?  There are two reasons.  The first is interesting in the sense that coal prices have not risen but gas prices have.  Coal is more in merit than gas.  In other words, coal stations, effectively this amounts to the Moneypoint plant, with which the Deputy is probably familiar, is running a good deal more than it was last year and consequently it is earning more profits.  Gas is earning less.  We have seen that total generation profits throughout the entire sector are approximately the same but those relating to coal stations are higher and those relating to gas stations are lower.  The ESB has almost all the coal on the island.  There is a coal plant in the North of Ireland but it does not run very often.  Moreover, ESB has less than half the gas and it has earned more relatively because of its coal while other generators have earned less.<\/p><p> The second issue is interesting because it shows the potential impact of European Union policy on Ireland and Irish prices.  Some five years ago the price of carbon was included in all electricity generation in Europe.  A specific decision was made at European Union level to reflect the fact that it is carbon-intensive to generate electricity.  One of the purposes was to establish the true cost of generation using coal and gas.  These are dirty fuels and they are harming the planet and the view was that this should be priced in to give producers an incentive to use them less and to use renewables more.  The point of the exercise at European Union level was that the price of carbon would be included in the price of electricity.  However, for reasons that are difficult to explain but involving political compromise in terms of getting the bargain through, all generators were given the cost of carbon free for five years.  Basically this amounted to windfall profits for generators using carbon for a five-year period.  They were getting 90% of the cost of carbon which they should have had to pay for free.  This was a windfall profit that accrued to all generators throughout Europe.  It will come to an end at the end of this year and at that point there will be no more windfall profits.  Generators have benefited from these profits during the past five years, some more and some less.  In France there has been little benefit because they do not use carbon; power generation is all nuclear fuelled while in Ireland there has been a great deal of benefit.  To make the story even more complex, the profit ESB was earning five years ago was especially high because of carbon.  The carbon price was higher five years ago that it is today.  At the time this led to the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Department negotiating an agreement such that the ESB should give a rebate of &euro;250 million in 2008 to all electricity consumers.  That was when prices had gone particularly high.<\/p><p> This debate was taking place throughout Europe.  After one or two years, the Government moved to introduce a carbon windfall tax.  I am unsure if Deputies remember that but it went through the Oireachtas.  It lasted for approximately 20 months.  Another generator took a legal case against the State, arguing that this was against Europe and against various other things and that it wanted to pass on this cost.  The Commission for Energy Regulation defended the case successfully in the High Court but, unfortunately, we lost by a three to two decision in the Supreme Court, for which I apologise, but such is the nature of decisions.  As a result, the carbon windfall tax was ended in May of this year but it had only a few months to go in any case.  It collected more than &euro;140 million for the Exchequer during that period.<\/p><p> I realise I have been long winded but I am keen to give a full explanation.  Last year the ESB did not have all these carbon windfall profits because it was paying tax but for a period during the first six months of this year it did.  The ESB has informed me that this amounts to approximately &euro;15 million or &euro;20 million.  Unfortunately the ESB will have these windfall profits for the remaining part of this year and, frankly, as the regulator, there is nothing we can do about that.  We have no power to take those profits.  However the windfall profits for the ESB and for all producers in Europe will end at the end of this year and that is a positive step.<\/p><p> I apologise for taking so long and I can discuss the profits issue further with the Deputy and, if he so wishes, provide any further information.  We have done some comparison on ESB profits compared with other vertically integrated companies, that is, companies that have networks, generation businesses and supply businesses.  In a study over a four or five-year period the average ESB profit in terms of various measures &ndash; I can provide any detail that the committee wishes - have been average or less than average compared with general profit throughout Europe despite carbon windfalls.  I accept the point about profits.  I would be horrified if profits were doubled but I do not believe they will be, and if they are I expect to be dragged back in here.  In any case some of the profits during the recent period have been driven by the windfall profits and they will be ending at the end of the year.<\/p><p> Some of the Deputies have raised issues with regard to prices generally.  This gives me the opportunity to discuss the vulnerable consumer issues raised by the Deputy.  Prices have risen a good deal.  I can provide details on this as required but the latest comparison relates to prices at the end of 2011.  Our electricity prices are slightly higher than the average throughout Europe but not a great deal higher.  They are approximately 105% where 100% is the average for residential customers.  For some business customers the cost is slightly cheaper than the average.  We face serious disadvantages compared to most of the rest of Europe.  We are largely dependent on fossil fuels.  The average European dependence on fossil fuels is 40% whereas ours is 80%.  We have one of the most dispersed populations in Europe and only limited interconnection.<\/p><p> The Deputy said that prices were below the European average in the 1990s.  I can provide two reasons for that.  First, oil and gas were remarkably cheap at that time.  Unfortunately, as the price of gas and oil increases we get clobbered while other countries do not.  France has almost no dependence or only a 5% dependence on oil and gas while Sweden has 3% dependence.  The increase has occurred during the past two years.  About one half years ago we were below the European average generally for electricity prices.  However, there has been a 50% rise in gas prices during this two year period and this has made it worse.<\/p> <p> On gas prices and Deputy Moynihan's second point about abuse of the gas market in the UK, we buy roughly 95% of our gas from the UK.  Most of it comes from the North Sea and some from other aspects.  As stated by Dr. Motherway, we are price takers and have no ability to influence price.  I was horrified by the allegations a week and a half ago to which I will try to give context.  It is being alleged that the six big energy companies of gas in the UK, where the liquid market is very large, have been attempting to manipulate gas prices over time.  Ironically, the incident identified is a point in time where it was argued they were manipulating the gas price below the true cost.  People are asking if they manipulated gas prices below the true cost once, what is happening the remainder of the time and are gas prices higher than they should be?  Unfortunately, to be blunt, we have no powers in this regard.  We have been in touch with Ofgem, the UK regulator, which is investigating the matter.  It is also being investigated by the Financial Services Authority in the UK.  We are in touch with both organisations in this regard and hope it will be dealt with.  Unfortunately though, as I said, we have no powers in this regard.  While I do not like saying it, there is nothing we can do.  We are price takers on gas.  It relates back to our dependence on gas, which I will comment on again later.<\/p><p> I will try now to address some of Deputy Moynihan's questions in regard to vulnerable customers.  Obviously, prices have increased considerably.  On the question of whether customers are in difficulty the answers is \"Yes, they are\".  We deal with many queries from customers in difficulty through our helpline.  In terms of disconnection numbers, we regularly publish the statistics in this regard but will provide further figures if necessary.  From my recollection, the number of disconnections has increased significantly over the past two years.  They peaked in the summer of 2010.  In the first quarter of this year almost 5,000 electricity and 1,600 gas customers were disconnected, which is a lot of disconnections.  We will publish figures next week which indicate the number of disconnections reduced in the second quarter.  <\/p><p> I will now speak about some of the protections we have put in place for customers in difficulty and in regard to what we believe is happening in terms of the people being worst hit.  We interact fairly regularly with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, who work with people experiencing difficulty paying their energy bills.  I would say - I am not trying to be controversial about this - the biggest difficulties are faced by families with children.  The majority of senior citizens' energy bills are paid by the Department of Social Protection by way of the free electricity allowance.  By and large, it is families with children rather than senior citizens who are experiencing difficulty paying their energy bills.  The committee might like to engage with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on this issue because it is not one on which we have direct empirical information.  There are various protections in place.  <\/p><p> We have no role or ability to bring price below cost.  As a regulator we set the price at an efficient level of cost.  While I wish we had power over fossil fuels, we do not.  As I stated, we are price takers.  I am confident that regardless of how unpleasant the price increases have been - I know that they are extremely unpleasant - given our dependence on fossil fuels they represent an efficient cost.  I will discuss that further if the committee wishes.  I know that fuel poverty is a major issue for some people.  What we have tried to do is to give people further options and information to try to prevent disconnection.  The rules of disconnection are that no senior citizen can be disconnected during the winter months, although as I said earlier - I am not trying to be hard on them - they are often not the worst hit, and a person dependent on electricity for life saving equipment, which is a small fraction of people, can never be disconnected.  Beyond this, disconnections have occurred.  We have put in place a set of clear procedures that must be followed by an energy company wishing to disconnect.  They must have issued a specified number of letters and had various types of contact with the customer.  They must give the person every opportunity to pay, in particular he or she must be offered a prepayment plan.  The customer must also be offered a plan to get him or her out of debt over time, with no requirement to pay the full amount up front but over an extended period.  These are all actions that must be taken by the energy companies.  We have and continue to audit this process.<\/p><p> Also, before disconnection, the customer must be offered a prepayment meter.  This involves a visit from an employee of the energy company who will remove the existing meter and replace it with another one.  While this may seem like something out of the 1950s and 1960s, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service say it is a genuinely valuable tool in helping people to manage their bills.  It stops that running up huge amounts of debt.  As such, prepayment meters are a reasonably good idea.  Many people have had prepayment meters installed.  They were used in respect of gas prior to their use in respect of electricity.  Approximately 30,000 gas and 13,000 electricity meters have been installed.  We have found - we have no empirical way of doing this but I base my information on what we learn from talking to people, the supply companies and Society of St. Vincent de Paul - that one of the biggest problems is the reluctance of people to accept installation of a meter.  Some people will accept disconnection rather than have a meter installed.  People seem to think - this is a personal opinion - that having a meter installed says something about them.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Money Advice and Budgeting Service are working to make them more acceptable.  Anecdotal evidence shows that only one in four of people offered prepayment meters accepted them, with the remainder opting for disconnection.  Anything that can be done to make meters more acceptable would be welcomed.  They are a positive step in trying to assist people with their bills.  I can provide any further detail on this issue, as necessary.<\/p><p> Deputy Ellis spoke about privatisation of State companies.  Much of this is as a result of a European framework.  For good or ill, the European framework is that energy should not be directly regulated and there should be greater competition.  The promotion of competition is a major statutory objective given to the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  We cannot ignore that and must take it seriously.  We are not permitted to distinguish between State and non-State companies.  Were the statute in this regard changed, Europe would have a serious problem.  Personally, I believe that privatising the networks would not be a good idea.  However, I do not believe there are any plans to do so.  That is all I can say on that issue.<\/p><p> On smart metering, they will not be a panacea and will not be perfect.  Nonetheless, we have engaged in a fairly extensive trial of them which suggests that consumers while initially resistant of them have accepted them because they enabled them have more power over their electricity usage.  Most important, the ESRI engaged in a lengthy cost-benefit analysis which indicated there will be benefits, although those benefits will not be substantial.  I am not talking about the price of electricity falling by 10% or 15% but there will be benefits.  We would expect electricity prices to be on average lower because of smart metering.  Also, consumers would be more empowered and interested.<\/p><p> Mr. McGowan will comment later on safety issues.  While the idea behind export is a good one, a key factor is that our export of renewable energy should not result in an increase in prices here.  In terms of what is going on, Britain has its own energy targets.  It will have to pay a substantial amount to achieve them, in particular using the offshore wind in the North Sea, which is very expensive.  A number of private firms believe they can produce the energy more cheaply here and that they should do so and then sell it to others who will then achieve their targets more cheaply.  To me, that appears very sensible.  Without being controversial, coalition policy on renewables in Britain is slightly difficult but they are committed to reaching their targets.  Work in this area is likely to be privately funded.  Spirit of Ireland and a number of other companies believe they can do this.  This means generation would be undertaken here.  Discussions on the issue are taking place with people in Britain.  It is possible that Britain might pay for the construction of an interconnector.  In some sense, this is a policy matter rather than one for the Commission for Energy Regulation.  My understanding is that conversations on the issue are going on and that a memorandum of understanding may be signed before the end of the year.  As to how this will play out, I do not know.  It could be a good outcome.  While it will obviously be good for Ireland Inc if this happened our main focus will be to ensure that it does not lead to an increase in electricity prices in Ireland.  <\/p><p> I will now hand over to Mr. McGowan who will address the safety issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100010#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353496200,"counter":930,"content":"<p>To answer Deputy Michael Moynihan's question on registered gas installers, we take seriously any allegation of substandard work by a gas installer.

I am from County Mayo which has substantial wind energy resources.  While I was on the local authority, I chaired the committee that developed the renewable energy strategy.  Even taking NHAs, SACs, housing and visual amenities out of the equation and removing wind farms from these locations, we still came up with more than 20,000 MW of wind energy in County Mayo.  While we were never going to develop that level of output, it gives us an idea of what we could do if we were to get our export model right.

We do not know what the situation will be beyond that date.  The chief economist of the International Energy Agency who has more knowledge of the issue will be in Dublin next week and will talk about it then.  The demand for gas has risen significantly in the past few years.  One of the reasons for this - it is driving up gas prices - is that nuclear power plants are being closed down in Japan and Germany.  Therefore, the demand for gas will probably rise as a result.  I am not a scientist, but it is my understanding that there are still significant gas deposits in the world, but extraction costs may rise.  I do not know how this will impact on the industry.<\/p><p>  It would be great if there was another energy or heating source.  For example, in most of Scandinavia gas is not used to generate heat, rather electric storage heaters are used.  Currently, we are very dependent on gas supplies.  A comment I would make which might relate to fracking which is a tricky issue is that currently gas is very cheap in North America.  It is half the price, but there are no facilities to export supplies.  The reason it is only half the price is that fracking practices are used.  Perhaps they should not, but I am not expressing an opinion on that issue.  I wish I knew how gas prices will evolve here in the next five or ten years, but we will certainly be dependent on such supplies.<\/p><p>  Deputy Michelle Mulherin asked about oil usage, the figure for which is less than 1%.  Therefore, oil has almost no role to play in electricity generation.  Energy is generated mainly using gas and, to a lesser extent, coal.<\/p><p>  With regard to the State and competition, we do not have a view on whether something is public or privately owned.  We might have personal views, but the commission does not have a view.  Perhaps I should not say this, but I have the personal view which would probably be shared by my colleagues that the monopoly network should remain in State ownership.  There will only ever be one set of wires, one group running the electricity network.  There will only ever be one entity running the gas network.  These will be monopolists.  My personal view is that it is better to have a publicly owned monopolist than a privately owned monopolist. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100014#P00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1353496800,"counter":949,"content":"<p>Ownership of the network is different from generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100014#P00800","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353496800,"counter":950,"content":"<p>I accept that.

However, that is a policy matter and it is up to the Government to decide what it wants to do.  I cannot offer any other view.  All I can or should say is that I think the network should remain in State ownership.<\/p><p>  I will pass over to my colleague, Mr. Blaney, who will deal with the issue of renewables.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100014#P00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Nolan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353496800,"counter":951,"content":"<p>A number of issues were raised.  Deputy John O'Mahony mentioned generation in the west and demand coming from the east.  This is an important dynamic.  One of the factors in the electricity sector is that the sector has been affected by the downturn in the economy.  We have seen the level of demand reduce year on year since 2008.  There has been an approximate 2% reduction year on year.  As there are a lot of fixed costs in the system, this puts upward pressure on prices.  From our point of view, while the efficient use of energy is very important, there is an opportunity for Ireland to have new sources of demand.<\/p><p>  One of the areas we find particularly interesting is data centres which have a high demand for energy.  There is worldwide interest in such centres and we have sufficient capacity in the system to absorb them.  We have talked to IDA Ireland and others about what can be done in this regard.  As regulator, we have a limited role to play, but we watch out for opportunities to make better use of our energy supplies.  There is an opportunity to export energy supplies and there might be another to attract industry and increase demand in Ireland.  That would be a very attractive proposition.  In the case of data centres, we probably need to look at the data corridors and where the backbone of communications is.  Currently, it is on the east coast, but if more demand was developed on the west coast, that would be advantageous.  However, we need to look at all of the options.  If there was an opportunity to create more demand, that would be great, but we have limited capacity in that regard, although we have worked with other State agencies to try to encourage it.<\/p><p>  On the issue of exports generally, we have no statutory role to promote exports.  That is not required of us by way of legislation.  However, from our point of view, we see anything which would benefit consumers as something we should do our best to facilitate.  Therefore, if there is an opportunity to ensure some positive benefits, by allowing further interconnections without the cost of interconnectors falling on the Irish consumer or making better use of the networks and thereby reducing the cost to consumers, this will be encouraged.  <\/p><p>  The issue of royalties is very much one for taxpayers and Government policy.  As regulator, it is important that we do what the body was set up to do under statute and leave broader issues of policy to the Government which must make the decisions on them.  However, we have been involved with the Department in advising it and helping to ensure we find robust export solutions.<\/p> <p>We are happy to facilitate exports.  The issue of royalty levels is one for the Minister and his Department.<\/p><p> I was asked about the challenges for renewable energy projects.  The number of such projects is not matched by the level of network availability to facilitate them.  In effect, we have had to ration capacity on the network to ensure projects are developed in a timely manner.  That rationing process has been challenging.  We are in the third of three gates in the gate process and keen to try to reach a conclusion.  A number of important issues have arisen during the process.  As we hit the 50% limit about which we spoke, there is a point at which we will have to start turning down wind farms, even though they have the capacity to generate.  Obviously, that is inefficient.  Nobody wants to turn down those who can generate electricity at a low cost, but we will have to do so in order to facilitate the stable and secure operation of the system.  We are keen to try to increase the 50% limit to 75%.  If that is to prove possible, the issue of who bears the cost will have to be dealt with.  Should it be borne by those renewable energy generators who would like to generate but cannot do so?  How do we allocate the cost?  Should the consumer end up with all of it?  We have been working through this issue at the all-island body with our Northern colleagues.  I cannot say too much about it because it is still out for consultation.  I can say, however, that there has been active engagement with the industry on the matter.  We are trying to reach a balance that will work for the industry without imposing extra costs on consumers.  We will have to go through due process and engage in consultation to that end.<\/p><p> It has been somewhat frustrating for the industry that this has not happened as quickly as we would have liked.  Some of the biggest challenges in the system are posed by planning and the need for public acceptance of the grid as being necessary to meet renewable energy targets.  If members of the committee have influence in ensuring the planning process is efficient and streamlined, it would help consumers and everyone else.  It is difficult to meet the challenge of striking the balance needed.  The regulator will try to do its bit to ensure consumer interests are protected, national targets are met and the 40% renewables target is achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100014#P01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353497400,"counter":953,"content":"<p>Deputy John O'Mahony mentioned a couple of matters, including our helpline and fracking.  We operate an Internet service at <i>energycustomers.ie<\/i>, a straightforward, plain-English, user-friendly site.  We also operate a lo-call number that energy customers can use to contact us.  Typically, we receive queries, general complaints about prices or other issues and complex complaints from people who have serious issues with their network operator or supplier.  We receive calls, faxes, letters and e-mails.  When we receive a query, we try to assist the customer directly.  If it involves the customer's supplier, or if we consider he or she is having difficulty with his or her bill, we direct him or her to his or her supplier, in the first instance, or the Money Advice and Budgeting Service or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  We always encourage customers to deal with their suppliers first.  Each supplier has a process that must be followed when dealing with customers who are in financial difficulty.  The first thing we do when a complaint is made about a supplier or network operator is ask the customer to go through the complaints process of his or her supplier.  It is important for the customer to try to seek a resolution with his or her supplier because suppliers typically try to resolve complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100015#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1353497400,"counter":954,"content":"<p>The CER is the last resort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100015#Q00300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353497400,"counter":955,"content":"<p>Yes.

We deal with a constant stream of complex complaints.<\/p><p>  Typically, fracking - the full term is hydraulic fracturing - is a method for extracting gas from shale bed rock.  We are aware that some companies have proposed to pursue fracking in Ireland.  I will put our role in perspective.  The question of whether someone should be authorised to explore for or extract gas by means of hydraulic fracturing is a matter for the Department and the Government.  Our role relates to the safety of the process used to carry it out.  The simplest way to put it is that a company cannot explore for or extract natural gas, whether by conventional or unconventional means, unless it has a safety permit from us.  No company will receive such a permit unless it can demonstrate to us that it is able to carry out the process safely.  The international standard is that the risk must be \"as low as is reasonably practicable\".  We are in the process of putting the framework together and expect to go live with it in November 2013.  We are conscious that a major study of fracking is being pursued by the Environmental Protection Agency.  We are involved in the steering group that is developing the terms of reference for the study, but we will not be directly involved in deciding on the content of the report.  Our future role will be to adjudicate on each individual application to engage in hydraulic fracturing on its own merits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112100015#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1353497400,"counter":956,"content":"<p>I thank the officials from the CER for dealing with so much information.
