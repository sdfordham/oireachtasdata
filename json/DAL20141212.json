The latter is, of course, very important.  To date, the board of Uisce &Eacute;ireann has not facilitated much of either.  There has been an absence of representatives from the trade unions and householders from the process.  Members of the public are very frustrated by the fact that they have not had an input.  Section 7 states that the forum shall consist of at least 12 and not more than 60 members.  Obviously, there is a massive gap in this regard and it will be necessary to decide whether to opt for a membership or 12 or one of 59 or 60.<br\/><br\/>Sinn F&eacute;in is of the view that householders have been left out of the process completely.  The word &quot;consumer&quot; has been used in respect of the people who will use the services of Irish Water.  That word should be banned.  The words &quot;householders&quot; and &quot;citizens&quot; should be included in the Bill instead in order that people will be recognised as human beings rather than machines.  At this point, commercial water users are not sure what charges they will be obliged to pay.  They are facing a very uncertain future.  Currently, they pay charges that are set by the local authorities.  The Minister has indicated that this will remain the case for the time being.  Commercial users - our household would be classed as such because of the existence of a small business there - are facing a very uncertain future in respect of this matter.  Such users will not be represented on the forum.<br\/><br\/>The position is similar for trade unions.  There has been a great deal of discussion regarding the employees of Irish Water.  The focus has been on those employees who are well paid and on the bonuses on offer, and rightly so.  However, there are many employees of Irish Water who are not that well paid and who are on either low enough or middle incomes.  There are people who are working under the service level agreements, SLAs, to provide services on behalf of the local authorities.  These individuals were responsible for providing the service before the concept of creating Uisce &Eacute;ireann was even mooted.<br\/><br\/>There is a massive vacuum in terms of the fact that there will be no representation for key stakeholders, namely, householders and citizens, commercial water users and trade unions.  I request, therefore, that the Minister and the Government accept the amendment before the House.  There has been a great deal of recent discussion among those opposite about the fact that they are listening to people.  They now have an opportunity to ensure that representatives from the key sectors will have a say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200006#D00200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1418379600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I strongly support the amendment, which advocates the inclusion of householders, commercial water users and representatives of the trade unions among the membership of the public water forum.  In light of what is happening at present, this is a strong, important and very decisive amendment.  However, a broader issue arises in the context of ensuring that the democratic voices of people - particularly those of stakeholders - will be heard.  It is important that we should hear from those representative voices.  The amendment refers to householders.  On Wednesday, a huge crowd gathered outside Leinster House and many among its number were householders who are under severe pressure in terms of their ability to afford to pay water charges.  The other issue which arises - and which is often ignored - relates to commercial water users.  People must wake up to the reality that SMEs and other small businesses are finding it extremely difficult to survive.  It is important, therefore, that we should ensure they are represented on the forum.<\/p><p>  I have a difficulty with regard to the establishment of all sorts of forums to deal with different issues.

Citizens of this State are increasingly being turned into customers and consumers by the Government.  In that context, the amendment refers to householders, commercial water users - obviously, commercial water use is a key element in the context of the remit of Irish Water - and representatives of the trade union movement.  As the Minister is aware, the latter have expressed their intense disapproval of the entire construction that is Irish Water.<\/p><p>  The amendment is very timely, particularly in the context of questions regarding the Minister and the performance of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  This State has a chequered history when it comes to the performance of its regulators.  The House has not yet had an opportunity to consider that matter.  In the past ten to 15 years, the phenomenon of regulatory capture has arisen whereby regulators have effectively been nullified by major companies operating in certain sectors.  As a result of this kind of capture, the regulators involved tend to dance to the tune of the companies in question.  In this instance, we are dealing with a company which will have a monopoly and which may be privatised at some point in the future.<\/p><p>  The machinations of Irish Water and CER have been designed to totally confuse the people and householders of Ireland.  I am of the view, therefore, that it would be appropriate to expand the concept of the public water forum to ensure that ordinary householders will have some say.  I regret that the establishment of a forum of this nature is necessary.<\/p><p>I appeal to the Minister, particularly after the debacle of last night and the performance of the Department, to give consideration to withdrawing all of this nonsense and water taxes and returning the water function to the local authorities which can produce water at a far cheaper rate.

Yet the declaration under section F of the application form states:<blockquote>By completing and returning this form, I declare that to the best of my knowledge all of the information provided is true and accurate.  If I have confirmed that I am connected to the public water main and\/or the public sewer then I declare that I am a customer of Irish Water otherwise I am declaring that I am not a customer of Irish Water.<\/blockquote>People are being asked to tick a box at the bottom of that section.  Yet there are people who have sent that form back without filling it in and now they have been declared customers of Irish Water, but there is no definition of a customer in the legislation.  According to the representative from Irish Water, once one is connected to the public main or if one is connected to the public sewer, one is deemed to be a customer.  Who exactly will define who a customer is, if there is no definition of a customer in the legislation? <br\/><br\/>If this is going to be confined to those who have returned the packs and declared themselves as customers, we will not get a broad range of voices.  We have all noticed that there have been very few dissenting voices at fora or in board rooms but inquisitive voices are exactly those that are needed.  However, what this proposed forum seeks is people who are of like mind but that will not be of much value.  The forum needs to be broader than that and it must include dissenting voices.  Given that the word &quot;customer&quot; is not defined in the legislation, how would the Minister define a customer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200007#E00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1418380200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>One of the issues since this scenario commenced has been a lack of adequate scrutiny and accountability and the way in which this is configured and set up, it does not have the sort of democratic access or accountability that one would expect.  Bearing in mind that the local authorities played a major role in this respect in the past, they have been completely shafted in what is proposed in this section.  Given that the staff are retained under service level agreements for the next 12 years, I would have thought their representatives and the democratically elected representatives in those areas would be best placed to contribute in a forum such as this.  I question the understanding one has of the democratically elected personnel that we have even in this Chamber.  It is only incumbent on the committee with jurisdiction in this area to meet once a year to discuss the goings on within Irish water.  The lack of adequate scrutiny and debate has led to the scenario in which we now find ourselves.  This effort on the part of the Government is to give the impression that there is or will be some form of accountability and transparency but it lacks the democratic accountability that I believe would be necessary and appropriate in such circumstances, which is the only way forward.  Aside form that, in the context of what has been put forward, despite my objections to it, I can only agree with the proposal in the amendment to the legislation in order to have better personnel better placed to contribute to such a forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200007#E00300","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1418380200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>On this section, we need more meat on the bone because what is being proposed is vague.  What we do know is that the commission will establish a forum and its membership will be between 12 and 60.  That is a wide variation in numbers.  The section states that the Minister will elect a chairperson and a chairperson designate in the absence of a chairperson and it lists the functions of the forum.  It states: \"The forum will have the following functions:...to represent the interests of customers of Irish Water;... to provide Irish Water with comments and suggestions [on its] ...performance;... to comment on any policy document produced by Irish Water.\"  However, apart from that we have very little information on it.  We do not know its composition, how the Minister will decide who will and will not sit on it.  The section does not state that the forum should be reflective of the customers, rather it states it should \"represent the interests of customers\".  One could read into that that somebody could sit on the forum and not be a customer of Irish Water but as long as they represent the interests of customers they would be quite capable.  Obviously this forum will be hand-picked by the Minister; through regulations he will decide who sit on it.  If it is not to become simply a talking shop and a rubber stamp forum, it must be reflective of society in general.  Will people who are opposed to water charges and water metering get a position on the forum?  Will they get an opportunity to comment on the policy documents and the performance of Irish water?  Those are all questions that have yet to be answered.  We should be given information on how many members the Minister is considering having on the forum.  The range 12 to 60 is a wide variation.  Will the membership comprise 13 or 59?  The Minister must have some idea about that.  Will the number vary over the three-year period?  Will members come and go?  Could the number be 50 one month and 13 the next month?  There is very little detail on this and we need more information on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200007#E00400","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1418380200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.  Householders should preferably make up a majority of this forum and they should certainly be very strongly represented.  Dealing with Irish Water is already a disaster for the public, householders and public representatives.  Every Member in this House who has been dealing with Irish Water since last January knows that one cannot talk to Irish Water.  The public and public representatives cannot talk directly to Irish Water.  Irish Water will not allow the public to talk to the local authority people who are contracted to it.  They will not allow public representatives to talk to the local authority staff who are contracted to it.  One can only talk to call centre employees.  This has been going on since 1 January.<\/p><p>  Deputy Grealish told us yesterday of an incident involving a major water leak in his constituency of a weekend.  He was told by the call centre personnel that they had registered his complaint and would report it on the Monday morning.  Hundreds of thousands of gallons of water were leaking from the system as a result of a burst pipe.<\/p><p>  An elderly constituent of mine and his wife have been without water for eight days.  That constituent was in touch with Irish Water and he got his reference number.  He telephoned them again and again and they gave him a different registered number.  I rang them and I got a different register numbered and I emailed them but we made no progress.<\/p><p>Eight days later the elderly gentleman and his wife still had no water supply and but for the understanding of a local authority employee, who effectively did us a favour, the individual in question would be still without water today.<\/p><p> I put a question to the Minister yesterday but he did not reply to it.  I would like him to reply specifically to the query.  The situation relates to a blockage in the sewerage system.  I am currently dealing with a matter in that regard.

People buy their products and those companies view people not as human beings or citizens but as consumers because that is what they do as far as such companies are concerned.  The State should avoid playing into the same philosophy as large companies like that.  The State should go the extra mile when forming legislation and should insist that the citizens of a country remain so and are not commercialised in this manner.  Sadly, nowadays we build more shopping malls than community centres but I advise that the State should refrain from buying into this ideology.<\/p><p>  As for the make-up of the forum, unless it is a body that has the potential and the will to challenge how an organisation such as Irish Water will operate, I will perceive it as being surplus to requirements and unnecessary.  Similarly, the manner in which people are selected for committees, forums or authorities in Ireland is important but sadly it leaves much to be desired.  There is a need for far greater independence in how people are selected.  The question of who does the selecting is crucial because unless a truly independent body selects people, those who are selected can never be deemed to be independent.  Members saw a powerful example in this regard recently with the appointments to the chair of the new policing authority and of the new Garda Commissioner, both of which clearly were political appointments.  Both organisations are the poorer for it at a time when independence was something for which Members were screaming out and both organisations were entities that really could have done with it.  In respect of this forum and its make-up, I suggest the Government should not establish any forum unless it is prepared to put in place an independent group to select those who will make up the forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200010#H01400","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1418381700,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I also support the amendment tabled by Deputy Stanley.

While such errors can happen, at present the ordinary public cannot get through to Irish Water.  This forum can be established and I note the section mentions the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  However, the Minister has told Members countless times that he is setting the prices.  Originally, Members were told the CER was setting them but the Minister now states he will set them and he is trying to state he will set them fairly.  Members are aware that the figures do not stand up and that the company will make a loss.  Consequently, it will be obliged to get money from somewhere and while it will make a loss this year, it probably will double the prices in the next couple of years and then it will make the money.  However, my worry in this regard is for the existing commercial customers, be they farmers, business people, hairdressers, shopkeepers or anything else.  They will be crucified because they already are paying and at a good rate of payment.  I note that in my native county, the rate is up to 98% but if the charge is going to be jacked up, they will be unable to continue.  It is as simple as night follows day that the company must stay solvent and this is the only alternative.  Otherwise, this off-balance-sheet talk will be out the window because the company will be obliged to get money from somewhere and the easiest way to get it is to charge the existing customers.  Consequently, I am concerned about the proposed forum, with a minimum membership of 12 and a maximum of 60.  It will be another talking shop and will be under the jurisdiction of the Minister.  I do not refer to the present Minister but to any Minister in the future.<\/p><p>  Accountability is needed in respect of this utility and Members should consider the Health Service Executive, because this company will be almost as big.  One should consider the existing issues such as the pipeline programmes, as well as the issues that will develop.  Why put the cart before the horse?  Members should deal with this now.  A specific ombudsman should be established to deal with queries.  People will have reasonable queries, as they have with the county councils, where officials will negotiate and the public representatives often will intervene.  A balance is agreed in respect of repair costs and everything else, matters are worked out and life goes on.  However, this will lead to trouble after trouble because Irish Water is not accessible and people cannot get answers.  I cannot get answers when representatives of the company attend the so-called information meetings for Oireachtas Members.<\/p><p>I have still not got the answers, either because they do not have them or, in many cases, they do not want to give them.  This part of the Bill is flawed.  We need a dedicated ombudsman appointed to deal with these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200010#H01600","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418382300,"counter":159,"content":"<p>It is important to oppose this section.

Why the Minister is establishing a public forum to discuss the fact that money is not being brought in from the water tax is beyond me.

Section 7(5)(a) states that one of the forum's functions is \"to represent the interests of customers of Irish Water\", and that is clear.  Customers are the ones who use and pay for the service.<\/p><p>  I do not understanding the wording in amendment No. 29: &quot;and representatives of the trade unions with members in Irish Water&quot;.  That is illogical and does not make any sense.  I therefore do not support the amendment but I also think the section is completely flawed.  A public water forum is just a sop.  It is scant in detail and it is not clear how it would operate.  In addition, its purpose is unclear.  It is just an attempt to appease the anger that exists in respect of Irish Water.<\/p><p>  Irish Water and the Minister with responsibility for it are accountable to the D&aacute;il.  We live in a parliamentary democracy, so the actions or inaction and all the problems with Irish Water should be dealt with and teased out in this Chamber.  The people's representatives are elected to do that job.  If we set up a similar talking shop for every semi-State utility company, it would make a joke of the whole democratic parliamentary system.  I do not understand it.<\/p><p>  This section is meaningless and will do nothing to enhance the functioning of Irish Water.  It will not make Irish Water any more accountable than it already is.  It is simply a populist stunt, which is unfortunate because it is dishonest.  If the Minister was interested in genuine engagement on the functioning of Irish Water, he would be answering the questions he has been repeatedly asked here since last night.  He would also be treating this House with a lot more respect than he has done so far.  He would be interested in listening to Opposition amendments and accepting them.  Instead, however, it is a repeat of what happened here last December.  A public water forum, which is not clearly defined in this legislation and is, to my mind, just a talking shop, will not change that one iota.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200011#J00300","speaker":"1186"},{"type":"speech","time":1418382300,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I want to clarify what the amendment is about.  It refers to \"representatives of the trade unions with members in Irish Water&rdquo;.  Once Irish Water is fully established, there will probably be a number of trade unions of which workers within Irish Water would be members.  The best way would be to have a representative of each trade union on the forum, but that could be unwieldy.  In some other companies there is an agreed representative to represent the trade unions on the equivalent of this consultative forum.  The trade unions themselves come up with a mechanism whereby they can agree who is to represent their members' terms and conditions.  Sometimes, however, because the members of a company know the inner workings and are most visible in dealing or liaising with the public, their insights can be a lot more useful than others' who might be on that forum.<\/p><p>  There are major problems with the way in which this public water forum has been suggested.  While it is a good idea, we should have taken a different approach to it.  Once again, despite the Government's promise of change and democratic reform, it all lies with the Minister to make the regulations and appointments.  There is no mention in this section of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government, which is representative of most parties in this House and the Seanad.  That committee would have a view as to how appointments should be done and who should be on the forum.<\/p><p>  The section does not outline, which is common across other jurisdictions, that the forum should have a 50-50 gender balance.  If society comprises 55% women and 45% men, then the board should have a minimum of 50% female members, if not more.<\/p><p>  Pensioners are not listed as having a position on the forum, and neither are ethnic minorities or young people who will be served longest by this company.  A range of people are not listed in the section, and while I am not saying that was the Minister's intention, a future Minister may not have the same view.  If up to 60 people are to be appointed to the forum, it would be appropriate for the Minister to list them.  The legislation should provide for that.<\/p><p>  There is no mention of remuneration for the public or whether their expenses will be covered.  If the forum is to be representative of the whole country, one member might be in Donegal while another is in Kerry and the meetings may be held in Dublin.  There will be a cost involved.  I am not suggesting that people should be paid to attend, but if we expect them to be on a public forum, at the very least their travel and other incidental expenses should be covered.<\/p><p>  There is no mention of the breakdown of customers either.  Will the Minister ensure that customers of public and group water schemes will be represented on this forum?  The fact that the section does not, in this day and age, refer to trade union membership is a detrimental step.  I am surprised by the Minister, although maybe I should not be.<\/p><p>  I suggest that this section requires more substantial amendment than Deputy Stanley has proposed.  We should ensure that is reflected if this Bill is to pass at any stage.  I am opposed to the concept behind Irish Water, but if it is to be there, it needs to be the best possible company.

I believe it is.  The Bill continues: &quot;to provide Irish Water with comments and suggestions.&quot;  This is like a customer relations division.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett stated, it will probably be outsourced to Mumbai, where the cost of running call centres is approximately one third of what it is in Ireland <i>per capita<\/i>.  The Bill continues: &quot;to provide the Commission with comments and suggestions in relation to the performance.&quot;  This is customer rating stuff.  One sees it on hotels' websites.  It further states: &quot;to comment on any policy document produced by Irish Water, when requested to do so in writing by Irish Water.&quot;  This is so convoluted, it is like trying to do somersaults and acrobatics at the same time.  It continues: &quot;to comment on any consultation document produced by the Commission in respect of public water and waste water services, when requested to do so by the Commission.&quot;  That is like being on standby all of the time for a call that might never come.<br\/><br\/>The next subparagraph is the dynamite bit.

I know she has a particular problem with trade unions.  A member of a trade union is a representative of a worker in Irish Water.  A householder is someone who lives in a house, a flat or an apartment who has a public water supply to it.  A commercial water user is someone who has a commercial water supply to his or her premises.  In the case of my family, it fits into that category.  The reason I set this out was to nail down in legislation that these three key sectors will be represented at the forum.<\/p><p>  From Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s point of view, the key forums are local authorities.  We have opposed this mad project from day one for several reasons.  Politically, morally and from the point of view of efficiency, it does not stack up.  Reforming local authorities was the way to do this.  The Government, however, has gone down the road with this model.  The D&aacute;il Chamber is in danger of being side-lined as the Government pushes ahead with this project.  Irish Water will become like Bord na M&oacute;na with an annual report to the Minister and the odd appearance at an Oireachtas committee but nothing more.  I recognise all of this.  I am concerned about democracy being side-lined with the D&aacute;il and local authorities supplanted by boardrooms.

As he does so, the problem is we have a duty that these sectors are represented.  There are 949 local authority members across the State.  How many of them will be on this forum?  Will it be guaranteed that there will be some local authority members on the forum and board?  They have been elected.  The Government can set up the monster quango of Irish Water with all of the costs paid by the taxpayer and keep it all up there.  The reality is, as outlined by Deputy Mattie McGrath, that if there is a problem on the ground, it is the local authority which fixes it.  How many of local authority members will be on the forum?  If none, why is that the case?  Has LAMA, the Local Authority Members' Association, been contacted on this?  Has the LGMA, Local Government Management Agency, or its director, Mr. Tom Ryan, been consulted?  How will members of this forum be selected?  The Minister has significant powers in this regard.  What criteria will apply to the selection of the chairperson, the key position in any forum?<\/p><p>  Deputy Liam Twomey should note Sinn F&eacute;in would not hold Northern Ireland Water up as a model of perfection.  It was set up by the British Government during the time of direct rule.  We are constantly working to improve that company as it has significant shortcomings.  Some of these were shown during the big freeze winters several years ago.

I agree with Deputy Stanley that there have been huge issues with Northern Ireland Water.  The Deputy is right.  Only a few short years ago, tens of thousands of people had no water for days, so there will be issues and I have no doubt that there will be teething issues with Irish Water as well.  Sinn F&eacute;in's knowledge of this would be very useful to House in respect of how we roll out Irish Water and what happens, because it did have direct responsibility for Northern Ireland Water.<\/p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in never proposed dismantling Northern Ireland Water and giving responsibility for the delivery of water back to local authorities, so Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that there is a role for an organisation like Irish Water, in the same way as there is a role for Northern Ireland Water, to deliver a proper system of clean water and to get rid of wastewater in an appropriate fashion.  Sinn F&eacute;in could make a very valuable contribution by making comparisons in this House with what happened with Northern Ireland Water.

It shows the fate that could lie ahead for this country.  Thames Water and a number of the UK water companies were deeply involved subcontractors to some of the Irish local authorities so they know the water and drainage conditions of large parts of this country.  When one looks at the history of water services in the UK, one can see that in that kind of so-called market, services involving the most basic and precious product on the planet - <i>aqua vitae<\/i>- were starved of investment.  This is the fate that many of us fear lies ahead when a future Government, if not this one, might proceed further along the road to privatisation.<br\/><br\/>I again warmly welcome Deputy Stanley's amendment which aims to give householders some kind of an input into the future direction.  I would not be very hopeful about these kind of fora because we have seen them in other bodies.  I think colleagues have referred to this.  In particular, I note that in the financial services sector before the crash, there were a number of so-called consumer fora which were supposed to advise the Governor of the Central Bank on the kind of conditions that were happening in credit situations, mortgages and so on.  The general feeling is that those fora were talking shops and did not work because the Central Bank, as part of the European system, and the Government, through its fiscal policy, made the decisive moves.<br\/><br\/>I have never had much confidence in the Commission for Energy Regulation in terms of energy regulation.  When I was the Labour Party spokesperson on energy for a long time, I found that I was knocking my head against a brick wall in respect of energy costs.  For example, for the past couple of months, we have seen oil prices going through the floor and companies are still gouging us.  The Government takes a lot as well but companies are gouging us in terms of petrol and diesel week after week.<\/p><p>I am not sure about the situation in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency of Galway East but it was only in the last day or two that petrol and diesel prices remotely approximated the fall in wholesale prices due to the massive increase in production in the United States and Canada.  The introduction of a huge new element in production in these countries has eased the vice grip of the Middle East.  Disgracefully, gas prices also increased.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200014#M01400","speaker":"1190","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418384700,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Stay with the water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200015#N00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1418384700,"counter":204,"content":"<p>This is the regulator that the Minister has in store for us in respect of Irish Water.

They got away with murder, including the so-called roaming charges.

I assure those who have commented that this is being done for the right reason, which is to ensure everyone can give feedback.  As I have said already, I accept the spirit of the Deputy's amendment.

This amendment is in the right spirit.  The new forum will not be a talking shop.  It will allow customers to bring forward any issues they might have.  It is based on a model used in Wales and Scotland.  Other representatives will be able to bring forward issues if needs be.  As regards the numbers, I admit that the band provided for in the legislation is quite wide.  When I am making decisions on the draft regulations, I will take on board whatever the committee says about the numbers.  I can genuinely say I have no set figure in mind.<\/p><p>  This section of the Bill provides for the principle.  It has been designed deliberately not to be very specific.  I want to take on board the views of the committee.  I have said on numerous occasions that I will welcome those views.  I will also welcome the committee's recommendations about who should sit on the forum.  If they believe representative bodies such as trade unions should be represented on the forum, obviously I will not have any issue with that.  It is possible that local authority members will be involved.  I will look at whatever is suggested.  It is pretty open-ended.  I will make some recommendations about the draft regulations and send them to the committee.  I will make a decision on the basis of what the committee returns to me.  I will absolutely take on board the committee's recommendations.  I am making that commitment to the House in the spirit of the amendment that has been proposed.

Their members made a significant input into the annual water plans.  That has now been removed.  It is not good enough to say they may or may not be there.  The Association of Irish Local Government deserves the respect it has been given by the millions of people who elected our authority members, regardless of what party they represent, last May.  The 949 people who were elected and the people they represent are entitled to respect.  I hope they will not be treated in such a shambolic fashion in the future.

When discussing amendment No. 29, I referred to the existence of public forums - the local authorities - which used to mean something.  Representatives are elected to these authorities and these individuals can then be consulted by people.  In the past, they had offices in local areas and individuals experiencing problems with their water supply could call in to discuss the matter with the relevant officials.  Alternatively, they could phone their local councillors and inform them of the existence of a leak or a burst pipe and ask for assistance.  All of this has been rendered superfluous by the establishment of Irish Water.  The public water forum is a pathetic sop designed to try to pretend that the public and workers will have some input.  In reality, they are going to be obliged to deal with call centres.  As with most of the call centres with which people are obliged to deal these days, the centres relating to the forum will soon be outsourced to God knows where.  When people experience difficulties with their water - as happens week in and week out - they will be obliged to phone someone in Scotland, India or God knows where.  They will phone someone in Irish Water who, in turn, will contact the local council.  The council will call Irish Water back and state that the matter is not its responsibility and the council will say it is not its responsibility either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200019#R00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1418386800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>This section relates to the establishment of a public water forum, a matter the Deputy is certainly entitled to discuss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200019#R00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1418386800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200019#R00400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1418386800,"counter":346,"content":"<p>However, call centres in India are not contemplated in the context of the forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200019#R00500","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1418386800,"counter":347,"content":"<p>They will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200019#R00600","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418386800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1418386800,"counter":349,"content":"<p>They are when it comes to Bord G&aacute;is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200019#R00800","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418386800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1418386800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett should phone &quot;Liveline&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200019#R01000","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1418386800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Joe Duffy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200019#R01100","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1418386800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>If I could explain the relevance of my contribution to the Ceann Comhairle, the Minister outlined that the purpose of the section is to ensure that customers have some representation in terms of dealing with the issues that arise with regard to Irish Water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200019#R01200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1418386800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>On Committee Stage, we deal with the detail involved.

This is the democratically elected forum in which the spending of taxpayers' funds on behalf of taxpayers by the Government should be scrutinised.  The mistake that was made, which precludes this forum from having any role into the future, was the passing of the first Water Services Bill.  The funds used to set up Irish Water and to insert meters across the country, which combined came to the tune of &euro;700 million, came from the National Pensions Reserve Fund when the Economic Management Council, that secret agent within the Cabinet, decided to use that route to fund this quango, this sorry debacle.  That was the day this House was precluded from seeking answers as to how that fund was spent.  We saw that 16 months ago when we asked many questions in the form of parliamentary questions and were informed that because of the way in which this entity was constructed and funded, this House - this authority, Oireachtas and forum that is representative of the Irish people - has no hand, act or part in questioning the way in which public funds have been spent in this area.  That is the disaster that has been Irish Water since the get-go, since this sorry process began, and we are here today listening to what is nothing short of a sop to the public, to tell them that some quasi forum will resolve these issues.  What role, prospect or indication is given within this section to allow for that petty forum?  What accountability will it have?  What questions will it be able to ask?  Who will be obliged or accountable to it?<\/p><p>  This mess began 18 months ago.  The Government was offered the opportunity by virtue of the fact that it communicated to us that it was listening to us, the Opposition and the public.  It eventually came out with one hand up and offered ten U-turns in an effort to appease the public, but it has not succeeded.  It has failed abysmally again.  This is one of the biggest disasters in the legislation.  In is an effort by the Government to give the impression that it will continue to listen and take on board the suggestions that emanate from this forum, irrespective of who will be on it, and we do not know who will be on it.<\/p><p>  The bottom line is that 166 people were elected to this House to act on behalf of the electorate, those who gave us the privilege to be here to question any spending of public funds by any Department and by any Minister lucky enough to be appointed by the Taoiseach.  However, the way in which the Cabinet saw fit to set up this entity precluded any Member of this House getting information.  The answers we get are that it is sensitive information and we cannot have information that emanates from it because of the way in which it was set up.  That is ridiculous and, unfortunately, this charade will continue.  I have no doubt that eventually there will be a review or probably a tribunal or an inquiry into the way this entity was set up, carried on and the loss of funds to the taxpayer that has carried on regardless.  The Government is continuing along that road.  The entity and the model it is using stands a fair chance of being rejected by the EUROSTAT test when we come to next March.  The 44% subvention that it mentions is in danger by virtue of the figures we heard last night and by virtue of the fact that we will not have full compliance.  That along with many other things will allow us to be back here again next March or April listening to plan B.  It is unfortunate the Government will not give us any indication of what that plan might be.  It will continue to keep people in the dark, and with the secrecy surrounding the spending taking place within this entity, this forum will get no closer than elected Members in this Chamber have got since this debacle began.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200020#S01200","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1418387400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I, too, am disappointed with the response to the various amendments and to the points that have been put to the Minister and the Minister of State today.

I agree with Deputy Timmins and Deputy Finian McGrath.  This whole thing is just a sop.  When one looks at the history of Ervia, formerly Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, it was always a very distant, remote organisation.  Many felt it was not a cost-conscious organisation.  It lashed costs onto consumers.  A couple of winters ago it greatly increased gas prices for no obvious reason.  The body that had the capacity to invigilate Ervia, previously Bord G&aacute;is, was the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  I do not have confidence in CER given the manner in which it did its job.  The forum is to be placed within CER and to be more or less run by the Minister.  Once again, it looks like a fig leaf to try to cover up the grave errors, mistakes and the disastrous history of the organisation.  It seems a totally pointless exercise.<\/p><p>  When one looks at the section, given that Deputy Stanley's amendment was not accepted, one also wonders how exactly the interests of consumers of Irish Water will be protected, in section 7(5)(a), given the overweening power of the Minister to make regulations.  What exactly will Irish Water do with comments and suggestions?  The point is that for the first 18 months or so of its putative existence, Members, as Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett so eloquently expressed, found trying to talking to this entity that seemed to have no existence required an incredible rigmarole of phone calls and e-mails.  As another Deputy said, it was a case of machines talking to machines.  We were trying to get a human voice into the conversation.<\/p><p>  When one thinks of local drainage in the city and in the four Dublin local authorities which I know best, it seemed to be impossible to get to grips with it.  We had a disaster, for example, in a part of my constituency, namely, the Howth Peninsula and environs in early August when we had major rainfall and consequent flooding.  Irish Water seems to be an impossibly remote, vague entity.  The normal response would have been to have recourse to the city engineer or county engineer, who did such a fine job through the decades with limited resources from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael-led Governments.  We cannot have confidence that section 7 will have any real effect.<\/p><p>  The Minister said he has the right to appoint experts.  Who will such people be?  Will they be from abroad?  Is the Minister talking about people from Thames Water or another private company such as Veolia?  The latter is a massive private company and the French state under the Socialist Party President is trying to reclaim water services and bring them back into the fold of the public sector.  When the Minister launched a parallel document on housing, he said Fianna F&aacute;il brought an end to social housing through privatisation and that the Government had to start from scratch.  The Minister's responsibility is not to create another platform that could allow for the privatisation of one of the most important resources of the Irish people.  That would be an appalling legacy for anyone who describes himself or herself as a representative of the Labour Party.<\/p><p>  I refer to subsections and paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d).  The history of the establishment of Irish Water has been disastrous.  Some Fine Gael speakers referred back to the great difficulty involved in the establishment of the Electricity Supply Board, ESB, in the 1920s in the first ten years of the history of the State.  I do not think, however, there was ever a period in the immediate years after independence - we are coming up to the 100th anniversary - when people felt such anger and rage.  The ESB was welcomed with open arms.  It took the company up to 40 years to bring electricity to the entire country.  Parts of the country did not have electricity until relatively recent times which was disgraceful.  The chief executive of Ervia, Michael McNicholas, is someone whom we know well and whom I met in my previous portfolio because he was the head of ESB International.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200021#T01100","speaker":"1190"},{"type":"speech","time":1418388000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Deputy Broughan is straying from the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200021#T01200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1418388000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>What I am trying to say is that I do not have confidence in Irish Water given the disastrous start of this semi-State company.

I consider it to be an entirely empty, vacuous, meaningless part of this flawed legislation.<\/p><p>As many Deputies have stated already, what is proposed in the Irish Water public water forum is nothing more or less than a talking shop.  Essentially, it has no power, and the various elements referred to in section 7(5), which are supposed to be the functions of this water forum, are vague and toothless, to say the least.  They include representing interests, making comments and making suggestions.  They are the only functions that are supposed to be ascribed to this meaningless body.<br\/><br\/>This is an ineffectual and pathetic ploy, a tokenistic gesture to try to assuage the concerns expressed in all corners of the country in recent months about Irish Water.  It is an exercise in optics.  It is to give the impression that the Government wants to listen to people, hear their concerns and act on them, but there is nothing in this section that obliges the Minister or the Government to act at all.  It does not even oblige it to take into account or to listen to the recommendations and, primarily, the comments.  The primary purpose of this forum is to provide comment but there is no obligation on the Minister or the Government to do anything about that comment.<br\/><br\/>I said earlier that if this is to be a new <i>modus operandi<\/i>for a national utility, why not have a public forum for the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is and all the other utilities?  It is meaningless nonsense.  There is nothing to say that the Government should not be establishing various talking shops to accompany any range of quangos and semi-State agencies it chooses.  It is absolute nonsense and I do not believe anybody on the Government benches considers this to be a serious proposal to address the incompetence, mismanagement and waste we have seen in Irish Water in recent months.  It does nothing to address that.  It is nothing but an exercise in optical illusion.<br\/><br\/>The Minister for Irish Water is accountable to this D&aacute;il.  Article 28.4.1<sup>o<\/sup>of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann states that the Government shall be responsible to the D&aacute;il.  This is the Chamber where the people are represented.  This is the democratic forum for the Minister sitting opposite, who is the Minister for Irish Water, to be accountable and answerable.  This is the Chamber, but the problem is that this Government has repeatedly ignored, bullied and sidelined it and the elected representatives of the people.  Nothing but contempt has been demonstrated for the Members of this House and, by extension, the 4.5 million people who elected them in 2011.  We saw it on 18 December 2013 when the then Minister, former Deputy Phil Hogan, rammed the Irish Water legislation through this House, shut down debate and refused to accept amendments.  We have seen it over the course of the past 12 months when Deputies raised concerns with Irish Water, when the issue of bonuses arose earlier in the year, and when people tried to highlight the fact that secret deals had been done with trade unions to shore up the support of the unions for Irish Water through secretive deals, which were initiated by the then Minister.  All of that has been raised in this House and all of it has been batted away, yet we are supposed to believe that the Minister will take heed of some non-binding forum, with no powers and no real statutory authority, while at the same time showing total and utter contempt for this Chamber.  It is just not credible that this so-called public water forum will be anything other than a stitch-up, a talking shop and a so-called panacea for the public outrage that has been demonstrated in recent months.  As other Deputies have said, it is a joke.  It is an affront to our democracy and an affront to our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200021#T02200","speaker":"1186","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418388600,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I support the inclusion of the public water forum in the section.

He put it on the record of the House this week.  There are forces and my concern pertains to how selections are made or who is selected to sit on a forum.  One must have a clear understanding of its standing orders, stated purpose and so on.  However, I do not believe a situation will arise in which there will be the requisite type of transparency to keep as much democratic control as possible on the role of the public interest, that is, the role of the citizen, in any forum.<\/p><p>  It is clear that we must learn from what we have and, at present, we have the local authorities, which are democratically controlled by the citizens.  That is the forum that is being ripped apart and a corporate model is now being set up with a fig-leaf consumer or customer forum.  Clearly, it does not have an agreed understanding from the Oireachtas as to its stated purpose and I question whether it will prevent anything with regard to the forces that exist behind the scenes.  Obviously, the former Minister of State who was responsible at the time could not prevent the deletion of an inclusion in the legislation that would have prevented proposals on privatisation.  What is the purpose of this committee with respect to its role in protecting the public interest?  This provision proposes a public water forum set up by the Commission for Energy Regulation that will represent the interests of the customer.  There are a number of interests from different sources obviously, including the Department, some commercial, some from the citizens and some from the consumer.  It is incredibly important that this proposal be rejected out of hand because it would imply that Members would shift the liability and responsibility for accountability further away from this House and further away from the hands of the people.<\/p><p>  It is not even clear how the process of selecting those 60 people would be handled.  I would have major difficulty were the CER to select some of the dark forces that were being referenced in this Chamber on Tuesday night and who were driving the privatisation agenda that prevented the then Minister of State from putting in a provision.  I would have a major difficulty were the CER to choose from a pool of people who had an agenda to privatise Irish Water and to take it out of the hands of the people.  It is not transparent and Members are being asked to vote on something that clearly does not have a set of standing orders in which they can have confidence.  Moreover, it does not have a sense of purpose or a culture with which Members can identify in terms of its purpose and function.  It is important that Members reject this proposal.  It is a fig leaf and a distraction from the reality that there are other forces at play regarding another agenda.  In recent weeks, Members will have seen powerful meetings taking place with backbenchers down the corridors of power.  That is where the decision-making on this matter will take place.  It will not be with some public water forum set up by the Commission for Energy Regulation, which clearly does not have the confidence of the Government because after the budget, announcements were made on 11 U-turns on specific areas.  How can Members have confidence with the CER establishing a forum that would have a customer or citizens' interest without having a proper, open dialogue and debate here today on the kind of standing orders, on the forum's stated purpose and on how appointments can be made clearly and transparently?  Again, I have concerns that whomsoever is appointed to this forum easily could come from that basket of forces the former Minister of State talks about in respect of the agenda of privatisation.  Members must guard against this carefully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200023#V01400","speaker":"1188"},{"type":"speech","time":1418389200,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I must confess that I too am absolutely puzzled even by the intent behind section 7 of this legislation.  I tried to figure out what is the purpose of this forum of people.  I tried to work through a process of elimination and reckoned that if the purpose of the forum is to represent the views of the customers of the entity called Irish Water, the question is how will they do that.  Will there be a requirement on the forum members to speak to their neighbours and their local communities?<\/p><p>Who will set the agenda for them?  Will it be the local community?  Who will advise them as to how the local community views the operations of Irish Water?  I see nothing in this section to state that the representatives on this public forum must be elected by the people.  That is a fundamental and fatal flaw.  If members of the public forum are not elected public representatives, then the only people they will represent will be Irish Water and whoever nominated them to the forum.  <\/p><p> The last thing Irish Water customers need is a body of 60 people whose job it is to tell the nation how great they are.  Having read this section, the only thing that would make sense of it is that it is a public relations stunt for Irish Water.  Forum members will not be in a position to know what the public feel about the service, but they will be indoctrinated by Irish Water.  They will be brought into the boardroom, wined and dined, and told how well Irish Water is doing.  They will then be told to get out there and sell that message to the wider public.  That is what this public forum is really about.<\/p><p> We need something better than the equivalent of 60 little plastic nodding dogs on the dashboard of the gravy train that is Irish Water.  The Government talks about empowering local communities and strengthening democracy, but how in the name of God could this be regarded in any way as doing so?  Deputy Keating said the Government was being brave in establishing this forum, but I cannot figure out how it could be described as brave when it spawns a dysfunctional entity like Irish Water.  The Government has made a total mess of introducing the legislation to establish the company.  Ministers listen to no one but their own echoes, and guillotine democratic debate to push through flawed legislation, yet they are now to be considered brave because they will select 60 people to represent the views of this wonderful entity.  How in the name of God could that be described as brave?<\/p><p> The public forum that should have been heeded was the one outside the gates of Leinster House on Wednesday.  If the Government had listened to the tens of thousands of people then, this bad legislation would not be going through.  I hope that those people, and more, will be out again on Saturday, 31 January 2015.  If I were a gambling man, I would go down to Paddy Power's and put a sizeable wager on the fact that no more than a few of those on the protest marches will be on this nonsensical public forum for Irish Water.  The only people who will be on that forum are those who share the Minister's view that Irish Water is the best thing ever invented.  There will be no dissenters allowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121200023#V01500","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418389800,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Some 500,000 houses across the country are on group water schemes.

Water is a pretty simple commodity to handle, but we have made the task laborious over the past year.<\/p><p>  It can be sourced, treated, piped to a house and then consumed.  People did this work voluntarily around the country, yet we are now talking about creating forums.  It is like dreaming up ideas.  On one occasion, I naively joined a forum and after three or four meetings I saw that it had become a talking shop.  To be quite frank, I got to hell out of it because it was only people talking and drawing expenses.  I read later that some people were even paid a salary, but the nitty-gritty was not discussed.  I saw people appointed to a forum who knew as much about the issues they were discussing as I know about the moon.<\/p><p>  In addition, the terms of reference are restrictive.  It is like being in a barrel with nowhere to turn.  One is in a confined space and if one talks about anything beyond that, it is not listened to.

Whatever the faults in the Bill's wording, for example, not giving sufficient authority to the forum to act of its own accord as opposed to having to be asked in writing by Irish Water to consider a matter, fundamental to democracy is Irish Water's accountability to a forum like this.  I have no problem with it.  One of the points I made as a Minister of State was about the need for such a forum.  Specifically, the forum would need to be one where the regional policies of Irish Water, particularly its investment policies, would be discussed.  A potential conflict will not be between the Oireachtas and Irish Water, but between Irish Water and local authorities, their communities and their development plans.  If a county council proposes to develop an industrial site or zone an area for housing, there can arise an incompatibility between that proposal and the plans of Irish Water.  This potential conflict needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>There was support from many people with whom I spoke at the time of using the regional bodies to discuss these matters.  I have no objection whatsoever to any citizen going to a forum.  How they are selected is important.  It is crucial that it should be an open and transparent process and that the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, should be accountable in how it selects the forum&rsquo;s membership.<br\/><br\/>There is a significant need for public feedback on Irish Water.  Members are right that we got it on the streets last week and earlier in November when 100,000 people walked in protest.  The huge failure of Irish Water is how it did not listen or understand or even explain what it was about.  Anyone listening to this morning&rsquo;s radio news is aware that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, identified 42 separate locations where raw sewage enters our rivers and seas.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  Is it not right that those communities affected by this would have a voice to have this issue tackled?  Is it not right that a forum can tell Irish Water that it should do A, B, C and D to rectify water supply and treatment issues?<br\/><br\/>The forum should also be able to ask Irish Water about costs.  There are service level agreements between each local authority and Irish Water.  The forum should ask what changes have been made, county by county, to the cost of running a water service.  It should ask what plants and parts of the water network have been improved in each county.  There are many good productive issues that can be properly dealt with in a national forum.<br\/><br\/>Section 7 does not bar any local representative from being a member of the forum.  While I do not know the Minister&rsquo;s intentions in that regard, there is no reason local representatives should not be included.<br\/><br\/>I do not know what changes can be made to the legislation before Report and Final Stages.  There are reasonable and strong changes that could be made to make the forum stronger, give it a real voice and authority.  It would be an additional voice to this House&rsquo;s.  We cannot ignore the committee system of the House.  When I presented the original water services legislation, I made it clear that all reports from the CER and the EPA are accountable to the Oireachtas.  All Members know they can demand these agencies attend committees again and again.  When I was in opposition, Deputy Ross and I worked on an audit query we had with Irish Rail.  We had committee meeting after committee meeting, month in, month out <i>ad nauseam<\/i>with Irish Rail on that particular audit.  It is the duty of the Oireachtas to ensure Irish Water is accountable to the committee system.  The reports of the CER and the EPA can always be discussed in the House.  It is a matter for the Whips and I cannot envisage any situation where those reports would not be discussed here.  The claim that there is no democratic forum or accountability for Irish Water is untrue.<br\/><br\/>Every Wednesday, Irish Water holds meetings open to all Members where they can raise individual issues.  I praise it for the significant change it has made in response to representations it has had on problems with the installation of meters and other issues.
