Thank you, members of the committee.  In July 2009 I was on the panel on the Marian Finucane Sunday morning show reviewing the papers and the events of the week.  During a commercial break, Rachel English, who was sitting in for Marian, said that a couple of callers had phoned to ask that she would question me about my role on the board of Anglo Irish Bank.  I dealt with this as best I could at the time by saying that, as a former director, I would fulfil my obligations to the letter and co-operate with any legal matters that might arise.  I also said that morning that I believed I had a duty as a citizen of this State to participate fully in any and all inquiries established either by Government or by the Oireachtas.  I was obliged, as a citizen, to give whatever insights I might have into the events around the banking collapse.  Since then, I, like other former directors of Anglo, have attended interviews with the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement and the GBFI investigating certain matters and I accounted in full for what I knew.  I have been interviewed by Dr. Nyberg as part of his report, all of which was conducted in private.  I am grateful, therefore, to have the opportunity to appear before this committee and, in full public view, deal with those issues that I can deal with.  Where I cannot, I will say so.  In my written statement of a month ago to this inquiry, I prefaced the response to the points raised by the committee by making some general observations.<\/p> <p>  The first is that the part of the definition of \"non-executive directorship\" is to be non-executive and that in accepting such a role in any business, there is what I have chosen to describe as \"an unstated contract of trust\" between you, the non-executive, and the executives or senior management in that business.  The non-executive holds a part-time role on the board and he or she is dependent on the integrity and the openness of the senior full-time management who have access to all the information about the organisation's business.  In 2009 Donal O'Connor, the then chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, addressed the board's failings and made a fulsome apology to all those who had been affected by its underperformance, from shareholders to staff.  And as a result of the ... a result of what had happened - the ultimate fallout - an apology to the taxpayers.  I was party to that apology, as a former director, albeit I had retired in June 2008.  I want to recapture the essence of that apology this morning ... or this afternoon and restate it for my own part because with more ... the more that has emerged in the intervening period, I would want there to be no obfuscation when it comes to apologising for whatever part I may have played in the difficulties that arose.  Quantifying that is for others, including this committee, to do.<\/p> <p>  This is all by way of context for these proceedings, Chairman.  I will endeavour to deal with all the committee's lines of inquiry.  I will do so as clearly and directly as I can, with my only interest being to add to the weight of knowledge that might assist you in your work to ensure that the lessons are learned and can be applied to future shock scenarios - better to protect the financial system, better to protect the economy and better to protect the people of this country.  I believe there are valuable lessons to be learned from what we have experienced.  That experience cannot be of value though, if those involved are not prepared to come forward and give an honest account of what they know and to do so without concern for protecting any individual's interests, including their own.  Over a six-week period in the summer of 2002, I joined the board of Anglo Irish Bank and Paddy Power plc.  I served for six years on the bank's board and eight on the board of Paddy Power, six of those years as chairman.  At the time I fulfilled those roles, I had an equally high regard for the senior management of both companies.  Interestingly, so too did the markets and, in the case of the bank, international rating agencies.  I did my job with each company, with the same commitment, interest and the same integrity.  In taking on the roles, I did so in the belief that I was working with management teams that would share all the information required with me, as a non-executive director, to allow me to fulfil my responsibility to the shareholders.  Was that in any contract of employment?  No.  Did it need to be? No.  This is business at a level where not everything should need to be documented, where management ... senior management knows that it has an obligation to keep its non-executive directors appraised of anything that is material to the well-being of the business.<\/p> <p>  There's been a good deal of comment on the lending approach of Anglo Irish Bank.  Much of it is comment that could be applied to the many banks across the world that had or have a focus on one main sector, such as property.<\/p><p>Broader-based banks also got the emphasis wrong and continue to get the emphasis wrong.  Considerable focus is placed on risk and the management of the risk function within the bank and its oversight by the board and, specifically, by the risk and compliance committee.<\/p><p> As you said in your opening remarks, Chairman, I was a member of this committee for the duration of my time on the board, and its chairman for my last year as a non-executive.  It's understandable, correct, that attention has been focused on this aspect of the bank's governance and it's reasonable to expect that the committee of inquiry would want to question me about it.  Let me set some initial thoughts before you do.  I believed that the risk and compliance function was well-resourced and that the senior executives responsible within the bank were competent, committed and focused exclusively on protecting the bank's interests against any lending that could damage it.  I also believed that the overall structures, built around the executive function, were robust, comprising a risk statement which was reviewed and updated every year and, as part of that review, a comprehensive listing of all anticipated risks detailed and considered by the committee and the board.  That was, in effect, our bible for the coming year and a programme to mitigate those risks was reported on at each risk meeting.  Risk management as a function within the bank lived this on a 24-7 basis.  It was monitored by internal audit and external audit and quarterly reports were submitted to the regulatory authorities.  The risk and compliance committee reviewed the work of the asset and liability committee, which was a management committee, and we reported directly to the board.  Separately, we brought in external consultants to review the risk committee's work and the risk function on a regular basis.  In 2003, Bernard Somers and Associates was brought in to review the whole risk function within the function, post the Rusnak affair.  In 2006, that exercise was repeated when PwC were brought in to review the performance of risk within the bank and the minutes will show that I had recommended, as I finished with the bank and the committee, that a further external report should be carried out in late 2008 to see how the committee could be strengthened further.<\/p><p> There are issues that have been raised by other contributors to the inquiry to date around the bank's credit policy, its loan growth and the concentration on development lending, which I am sure you'll want to explore presently.  Before doing so, the Anglo collapse needs to be seen in context.  Yes, the bank over-extended itself and, despite efforts from 2006 onwards to curb lending in Ireland, it took on too much in the Irish marketplace - even with the application of the foot to the brake - in new development lending that the board had approved at that time.  Great efforts had been made over the previous decade to develop its franchise in the UK and North America with considerable success, the latter being down, in no small measure, to the work of David Drumm, a serious consideration when it came to his appointment as chief executive.  Nonetheless, the bank's exposure to development lending was at 23% by the end of 2008, with 50% of total lending in Ireland.  On the other hand, the board had supported the recommendation of the director of banking to stop new lending except to its top, most established clients and Anglo's share of major land deals in Ireland was less than half that of AIB and 10%  lower than Bank of Scotland between 2005 and 2007.<\/p><p> My friendship with Brian Cowen has been much commented upon in the context of Anglo's demise.  Let me deal with what I know.  In doing so, I realise there's a significant number of people whose minds are made up on the issue and nothing anyone can say will undermine their belief in a conspiracy theory.  Interaction No. 1 was a few days after St. Patrick's Day 2008.  I received a phone call from Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, the chairman of the bank, asking me if he thought that Brian Cowen would take a call from him.  I asked him why and he said it was about the ongoing liquidity issue, so I said that I knew Brian Cowen was overseas, but I would try and reach him.  I made contact with Mr. Cowen within an hour or an hour and a half, explained the situation to him, and he said he would need to talk in the first instance with the Governor of the Central Bank, but that he would then revert to me.  Within an hour or so later, he had called me back and he told me that the Governor was going to deal with the matter.<\/p><p> Interaction 2 - Heritage House, Stephen's Green, April 2008.  The first point to make here is that this was not a special, set-piece event built around Brian Cowen or his position as Minister for Finance.  Such events happened, on average, twice a year and had been in place since before I had joined the board in 2002.  Over those years, the board had held lunches primarily, though sometimes dinners, with people in public life - senior public servants, politicians and others - with the emphasis very firmly on it being a social occasion where there would be an exchange of views and experiences.  In my time on the board, I had attended, I would say, eight or ten and ... of those functions and among the attendees over those years had been politicians of different persuasion to what Brian Cowen's is.  Brian Cowen just happened to be next on the list.  I had undertaken to ask him to  do the event and, indeed, the records in the Department should show that he had at least ... on at least two previous occasions been diaried to meet with us, but other priorities had got in his way.<\/p><p> The event was completely unremarkable.  I recollect a general introduction by Sean FitzPatrick, as chairman, and then a broad discussion about all things other than banking, with the Minister going around the table asking each board member to set out their thoughts on their area of expertise or their view of the Irish economy or, in the case of those who had global experience, like No&euml;l Harwerth, who was a former COO of Citigroup, the global economy; the same with Gary McGann, obviously through his role as CEO of Smurfit Kappa.  <\/p><p> Interaction 3 - the Druids Glen golf outing.  I understand that some people find it hard to believe that we didn't discuss the bank during the course of that afternoon and evening.  I'm a sometime sceptic myself, so I understand the extent to which some people have difficulty in accepting this point.  Let me, though, ask a few questions.  Had we discussed the bank, what would we have discussed?  The general liquidity issues in the sector at that time or how the Quinn CFD position had unsettled the market and added to the pressure on the stock?  Perhaps we could have discussed those issues, but to what end?  The then Taoiseach is a friend of mine.  I saw him regularly, often in his offices, so why, if I, as a former director of Anglo at that time, wanted to lobby him or to bring undue and inappropriate influence to bear on him, would I choose such a convoluted and public route to do so, when I could have arranged to meet him in his office, closed the door, sat down and had the conversation well away from prying eyes?  For me, the idea that the meeting, the golf and the dinner in Druids Glen was part of some conspiracy to capture the support of Brian Cowen for some kind of imagined need that Anglo had in July 2008 is more lacking in credibility.  We met for about two hours, we went through an agenda that Alan Gray had prepared for the meeting and which did not have banking on it at all.  Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, Brian Cowen and I then went and played ... I don't even remember was it nine or six holes of golf and then we went to the bar and had some drinks, where we were joined by Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who happened to be in the Druids Glen hotel attending a wedding, and he asked Mr. Cowen to join the bridal party for photographs, which the Taoiseach - the then Taoiseach - was happy to do.  Later, Gary McGann and Alan Gray returned to join us for dinner.  Alan had retained the agenda, but in classic Brian Cowen fashion, he remembered that his driver was outside and he said he would like him to join us for dinner, which, of course, he did.<\/p><p>We reviewed some of the matters we had discussed that morning and we closed business early.  There are other material reasons why people should not believe the conspiracy narrative.  Brian Cowen may represent something that some people do not like and do not admire.  That is absolutely their prerogative, as all of us evaluate in our own minds, in our own hearts, people who are in public life.  What should be acknowledged, however, as I know politicians who are not part of his party readily do, is that in public office, Brian Cowen would never make a decision that was not centred on what he considered to be best for his country.<\/p><p> Equally, this is about me and my standards.  I would not act in a manner that is unethical.  And were I to have attempted to pressurise Brian Cowen in the interest of a private business, at the expense of the State who's duty it was his to serve, I would have been behaving inappropriately, and for those who know me well, in a way that would be completely and utterly out of character.  In my time as a director of Anglo Irish Bank and Paddy Power, and other private businesses of which I was a director, I never discussed the business of those organisations in any material way with Brian Cowen.  Confidentiality is integral to who I am and how I conduct my affairs.<\/p><p> Much of the comment on Anglo is commentary that could be applied to the many banks across the world that had or have a narrow focus, rather than the larger institutions that offer a wide array of products and services.  Much of the comment is also based on a view of the bank of its lending and of its growth, which has its source in the knowledge we now have of the cataclysmic global economic events of the mid-2000s.  I know, Chairman, that you've all probably had your fill of witnesses coming into these sessions and talking of 20\/20 vision or, \"If I knew then what I know now.\"  But while in normal circumstances, this may be a pretty poor line of defence, it is the case that the storm that broke in Ireland was a global financial tsunami that had its origins elsewhere and just took its time to crash over our small island and wreak the damage that it did.  There is no doubt that the damage was accentuated by the fact that our own defences were very weak.  We had gorged in the boom years and the banks had continued to feed our insatiable appetites.  I know.  I know because I was involved in both putting the menu on the table as a non-executive director of Anglo Irish Bank, and I know because I was one of the hundreds of thousands who sat there and ate more than I needed.  This is not excuse time, Chairman; it is simply to acknowledge the fact that when the massive shock waves stirred by global financial events washed over us, we were already in a vulnerable position.  We know now that Anglo Irish Bank most certainly was.<\/p><p> This statement is not an apologia.  It is an honest attempt to summarise what I would consider to be the main insights of the time that could help the committee in meeting its objective to assess what went wrong, where and why in order that it can apportion responsibility where it believes it should rest, and provide guidelines or learning's from its review of the whole episode.  I accept that to have been on the board of Anglo Irish Bank over the period leading up to the financial crisis, disallows absolutely any notion that one could claim to be in any way blameless.  But, as I have said before, it is for the committee to determine where the lines of responsibility lie and to weight them according to people's roles across the banking sector and the other stakeholders involved.  Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#CC00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Drury","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Drury.

So what you see is a letter from Ms Mary-Elizabeth Donoghue, banking supervision department, at the office of the Financial Regulator.  I'll just take two paragraphs of it there.  The first letter, it's May 2007 and it's a letter to Mr. Drumm and it says, \"I refer to the inspection of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc (\"Anglo\") carried out by the Financial Regulator between 9 and 17 May 2007.\"  Then moving on to the third paragraph, it says, \"The Financial Regulator's inspection process is a high level review and does not constitute a detailed examination or audit.\"  So, at this stage, it's high level, it's not drilling down into very, very specifics.  And as a result, it then goes on to say, \"Consequently, the inspection process may not be relied upon to identify all issues arising in the areas reviewed.\"  So, it outlines there that there might be other matters as things advance on.<\/p> <p>  So, if I could just move on to the regulator's letter then which is the next one up and you see there, there's a number of headings.  There's the \"Group Credit Policy\" is one with nine items under it.  The next one is the \"Exceptions to Group Credit Policy\" that has three items under it.  \"Credit Committee Terms of Reference\" has another item under it.  \"Group Risk Management Operations Board\" has two items under it.  \"Risk Management Reports\" have two items.  \"Personal Guarantees\" have an item.  \"Group Watch List\" have an item.  \"Loan Review Process\" have an item.  \"Breaches of Internal Limits and Targets\" have two items but is broken down into more detail with some Roman numerals.  It then goes on to \"Stress Testing\" has an item.  \"Hedging of Risk\" has an item.  \"Condition Precedent\" has an item.  \"Review of Loan Files\" has three items.  \"Interest Only Breakdown of the Loan Book\" has an item and \"Job Descriptions\" has an item.  It's quite extensive.  Were you, as a board member, made aware of this report and was it discussed by the board? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#LL02500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1438210800,"counter":307,"content":"<p>No.  The first time I ever saw this document was when I received it from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#LL02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Drury"},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#LL02700","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1438210800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>And I had no knowledge of it, whatsoever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#LL02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Drury"},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Okay.

I had a long experience of Hungary going back to the 90s when I established an office for my communications consultancy in Budapest.  I knew the Hungarian people quite well; I had worked very closely with a number of people in a number of businesses in Hungary.  And I believed in the value of what the Hungarian people and the Hungarian state was attempting to do post its accession to the EU.  And I always maintained a strong interest there.<br\/><br\/>Far from approaching the project, in the way in which you have profiled it, the project was an investment, a proposed investment, of a significant amount of money by a number of people - a small number of people - in a development in an area of ... outside Budapest called  Pilismar&oacute;t, which is not an area where anybody lives, was wasteland, and which the mayor, who was, as it happens, an independent politician of left wing disposition, wanted to see development in order that his community would benefit from the introduction of something that he saw and members of the council saw as being a positive venture.  As with anything like that, and you people in this room will know and understand this better than I, there is always people ... or likely to be people who are not in favour.  The project was not bankrolled by Anglo Irish Bank.  There were no loans from Anglo Irish Bank.  And the emphasis you have placed on a particular media or medium, is one which was challenged at the time, as being incorrect and was, subsequently, not followed through on.  I mean by that the report, just to be clear, was not accurate in a great many respects.  So, the representation or presentation of me, in this case, as being somebody who behaved in a manner which was to disenfranchise people from areas of land which they rightfully, or rightly wanted to manage in a particular way against their wishes, was completely and utterly false - No. 1. <br\/><br\/>No. 2 - There was never a line of credit established between me and Anglo Irish Bank in that respect, which gives me the opportunity to, if I may, Chairman, just make one point of clarification.  In 2005, my business wanted to make an acquisition and we needed to raise &euro;1 million to make the acquisition.  And it was discussed at the board of my company and we decided to proceed and I said, &quot;I would like Anglo Irish Bank, as I'm a director of the bank, I would like Anglo Irish Bank to have the opportunity to tender for the business, but I cannot go and meet with and deal with and interact with the bank.&quot;  So my chairman, who had no connection with Anglo Irish Bank whatsoever, went to a number of ... two banks, one of which was Anglo, and a deal was done whereby Anglo became the lender to the business and that is ... I'm simply using that to emphasise the point that in my dealings, I attempted at all times to create an appropriate distance between me and other parties in respect of my directorship of Anglo Irish Bank.  The presentation in <i>The Mail<\/i>was ... let's put it this way, it was inaccurate and misleading.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#RR00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Drury"},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Okay, there was the root of the question.

Mr. Drury, your testimony of this afternoon would indicate that you were unfamiliar or not aware of the following: key concerns expressed by the Financial Regulator about commercial property lending activities, the levels of exceptions of lending policies, the experience needed to manage a fast-growing monoline bank such as Anglo, broader implications of the rapid growth in lending and profits of Anglo, implications of lending to such a concentrated number of developers, the extent of breaches in regulatory sectoral lending limits, the extent of interest roll-up within the Anglo loan book, the implications of combining the roles of CRO and financial director.  Mr. Drumm, or sorry, Mr. Drury, my apologies.  Mr. Drury, can I ask you to explain to this committee what role and purpose did you provide for Anglo?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#YY04800","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1438210800,"counter":854,"content":"<p>I was appointed to the board of Anglo Irish Bank in 2002 and one of the reasons why I think I was appointed was because I was a generalist, as opposed to somebody who had, kind of, linear experience or professional experience.  And in that context, I feel that I contributed very well as a non-executive director.  I was somebody who understood what the bank was trying to achieve, who understood the ambition of the bank, who understood the need to balance growth with control and I think that the issue around my suitability really in some people's minds relates to question of my chairmanship of the risk committee and my role on the risk committee.  And I think in that respect, I would say ... make the following points, Chairman.  No. 1, when I assumed the position as chairman of the risk committee, I had served five years on the risk committee at that point.  So I had a ... a strong understanding of the risk management function, how it worked and how the risk committee worked.  I think that the second point is that at that time, I said very clearly to Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick that I would like the composition of the risk committee to be changed in order that there would be high-quality financial people on the committee with me and in that sense, Ned Sullivan, who had been chairman of the audit committee for four, maybe six years prior to that, he became a member of the risk committee.  No&euml;l Harwerth, who was chief operations officer of Citigroup, she became a member of the committee and Lar Bradshaw, who was former managing partner of McKinsey, became a member of the committee.  And my job was also, I think, to be seen in the context of I had been chairman of Paddy Power plc for a considerable period of time- almost six years by then.  Over that time and Paddy Power you know, may seem like a very different business.  But in many respects, the work that a company like Paddy Power does in the gambling industry is very, very significantly layered with risk and the management of risk.  And in that respect, my experience as chairman of Paddy Power of the board of Paddy Power overseeing significant growth in the market capitalisation of Paddy Power, overseeing the appointment of a new chief executive, I think made me suited to the position as chairman of the risk committee.  I accept fully, the points that you have made in summary, harsh and all as they may appear.  What I have been attempting to do in my testimony to your committee, Chairman, is ... is to account for what I could account for.

The Irish Government, the Administration and the regulatory systems did not have the tools that were required to deal with the combination of circumstances and problems that faced them.  Prior to September 2008, there had been discussions about the nature of a possible bank guarantee and a framework of draft legislation for bank nationalisation had been prepared.  There was no legislative provision for a bank resolution system until the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act of 2010.  Apart from the credit institutions winding-up directive of 2001, no bank resolution system was in place in the eurozone.  The eurozone implemented the single supervisory mechanism in 2013 and the single resolution mechanism, which is intended to deal with future bank resolution requirements, will come into effect at the beginning of next year.  Prior to the Irish bank guarantee in September of 2008, the UK had dealt with the Northern Rock and the Bradford and Bingley cases.  The Irish Government, prior to that, had gone through a dispute with the German Government on the question of which of them had responsibility for the Depfa affair.  That was resolved by the German Government having to take responsibility for it.<br\/><br\/>Ireland was the first eurozone member to find itself obliged to take action.  And I think it's fair to say that any action in an area like this by a first mover was bound to be controversial and, indeed, by definition, unprecedented.  Other countries followed.  Germany had to take action about Landesbanks, an issue that is still the subject of ongoing work in Germany.  France, Belgium and the Netherlands had to take joint action to deal with the problem in Fortis bank.  Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Cyprus all had to take action and Latvia found itself obliged to take action in this area, in fact before it joined the eurozone.  Of the early movers, I think its fair to say that the action taken by Ireland was the most comprehensive of any.  Indeed, I think it was probably to our disadvantage that the Irish Government at the time made it very clear that it was dealing with the whole banking system.  Other countries took action that was virtually as wide in its effect but they didn't have to say they were dealing with their whole banking system.<br\/><br\/>Retrospectively, it has been suggested that once the burning of bondholders was ruled out, the options available to the Government in September of 2008 were, first, a blanket guarantee, accompanied by nationalisation of the entire banking system; or a blanket guarantee, accompanied by the liquidation of Anglo Irish Bank; or a blanket guarantee, accompanied by the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank; or, the liquidation of Anglo, accompanied by what's been described as a &quot;political guarantee&quot; for the rest of the system.  In the event, the course of action that was adopted was a blanket guarantee, followed shortly afterwards - within a few months - by the nationalisation of Anglo and AIB and a partial nationalisation of the Bank of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The evidence available is to the effect that the European Central Bank, some eurozone partners and some US authorities, made it clear that repudiation of bondholders would have serious, if unspecified, negative consequences.  Relatively little attention has been paid to the fact that the repudiation of senior bondholders would, as a result of the <i>pari passu<\/i>treatment convention, have had very serious repercussions for depositors with deposits of over &euro;100,000.  These repercussions would have affected individual depositors, corporate depositors and other banks - both Irish and non-Irish banks.  In his evidence to this committee on the 15th of this month, Mr. Paul Gallagher, who was Attorney General at the time, said of the relative positions of depositors and senior bondholders, and I quote, &quot;The law at that stage was that they ranked equally&quot;.<\/p><p>Liquidation of Anglo in September 2008 would have had, I think, the following consequences,<i>inter alia<\/i>: first, a draw on Government funds to cover the &euro;100,000 deposit guarantee - Anglo was largely illiquid at the time - or measures to move the Anglo deposit book to another institution, which would have been a fairly complex exercise.  It was done later and it wasn't a simple exercise to carry out.  Other consequences would have been litigation issues arising from the absence of banking resolution legislation at the time.  And the need for some type of vehicle to realise the banks assets in order to avoid the contagion effects on other banks of calling in outstanding loans on the Anglo books, including many cases where borrowers from Anglo were also borrowers from other banks in the system.  NAMA didn't exist at the time, and I think it's fairly clear that any transfer of the loan book of Anglo to any other institution would immediately have spread the contagion to those other institutions.  On the face of it, that would have been a much more complicated procedure than the one actually adopted.  Again, in evidence given on the 15th of this month by Paul Gallagher, we find the statement that at the time, &quot;It was quite clear to everybody that you couldn't take the risk of winding down a bank, in whatever fashion.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Liquidation of Anglo would, in my view, have cast very serious doubt on any political guarantee that might have been ... that might have accompanied it, particularly given the fact that the liquidation of Anglo would have required ... would have inevitably had a contagion effects on the other banks.  And I think if there's need for any further illustration of the difficulties that would have accompanied a liquidation of Anglo at the time, I think we just have to look at what's happened since February of 2013.  In that liquidation, which involved a very much smaller outstanding volume of loans - I think about &euro;15 billion net - two and a half years later, the process has still not concluded.  And that's not in any sense a criticism of the liquidators; I'm sure they're doing as much as they can.  But I think that gives some indication ... a small indication of what the difficulties would have been of a liquidation in 2008.  I have to say that, having listened, debated, worked over the period since September 2008 up to date, that had I been in the position of the Government of the day at the time, with the knowledge, or the lack of knowledge that they have, I don't think I would have done anything very different.  <br\/><br\/>By the time that I was appointed to the board of Anglo Irish Bank in November 2008, that bank, and the other Irish banks, had greatly exceeded every prudential limit in terms of the concentration of lending by sector and by client.  It was very clear that they had already, at that stage, found themselves in a very, very high risk position.  This had happened under the noses of the regulators, who had access to all the information required to arrive at that conclusion.  I don't know whether the failure to appreciate this can be ascribed to role confusion in the then bicephalous regulatory structure, or through any lack of capacity.  Immediately after nationalisation, the Anglo board ... the new Anglo board set in train a detailed review of the banks provisioning policy.  We commissioned an independent external review of the methodology, and, on 15 April 2009, we informed the Department of Finance that the recapitalisation requirement at that point was in excess of &euro;4 billion, rather than the &euro;1.5 billion that the Department had in mind at that point, with a very substantial downside risk from any further deterioration in property prices.  And I don't think I need to remind the committee that property prices had been falling from some point in 2007.  That fall actually accelerated very substantially in January 2009 and from then out.  So, in mid-April of 2009, we informed the Department of Finance that the recapitalisation requirement for Anglo, as it was at the time, was in the region of &euro;4 billion, with, as I say, a very substantial downside risk from further deterioration in property prices.<\/p><p>That was clearly unwelcome news which also had substantial implications for the other guaranteed institutions.  When we conveyed that the Department of Finance itself commissioned a separate study, to the best of my recollection by PwC, and that came to a conclusion broadly similar to the one that we had arrived at in Anglo.  I have to confess, a Chathaoirligh, that I was a little taken aback to hear the second secretary of the Department of Finance say recently in the course of her evidence to this committee, \"Anglo surprised on the downside every time you looked at it.\"  The Department should not have been surprised since a very clear warning had been given in April of 2009.  I don't know whether the warning was understood or not.<\/p><p> Were the banks, including Anglo, insolvent in September of 2008?  That has been a question that has exercised minds.  I frankly don't know what the answer to it is, but my guess is that if the exercise had been carried out at the point when the guarantee was given, that Anglo would probably have proven to be solvent at the time on the basis of what was known, and the other banks I think would certainly have been.  That situation changed, it deteriorated as I've said, very rapidly over 2009 and continued to deteriorate for some time after that.<\/p><p> The then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan TD, came to the view early in 2009 that the staff resources in the Department of Finance were inadequate to deal with the issues facing it and personnel were drafted in from the National Treasury Management Agency.  I have to say, a Chathaoirligh, that that body's very considerable expertise lies in treasury management, not in securing repayment from borrowers, which is a different function.  Difficulties inevitably followed when staff of the Department, of the NTMA came to deal with issues of bank restructuring and dealing with externally recruited persons who had specific skills and a lot of experience in the area of restructuring.<\/p><p> The then head of banking in the Department of Finance proposed to me in 2011 that Anglo should be run, \"as a subsidiary of the Department of Finance\".  That proposal was a non-starter in terms of governance and prudence but unfortunately the bank's rejection of that negatively influenced the relationship with the Department.  And that problem was further compounded by the bank's later rejection of a suggestion made in a report commissioned by the Department of Finance from McKinsey's, a suggestion that the functions of chief financial officer and chief risk officer be combined.  The combination of those two functions in the bank in 2007 was identified by the Nyberg report as one of the deficiencies in the bank's structure and risk management system - and the committee had some discussions with a previous witness this afternoon on that issue.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding all of that rejection of that proposal - which we regarded as very, extremely unwise - the rejection of that proposal by the bank was seen by the Department of Finance as yet another example of obduracy on the part of the bank.  I have to say that a difficulty that continued throughout that period arose from what seemed to me to be an entirely inadequate appreciation by the Department of Finance of the role and obligations of the bank as a separate company set up by statute with all the duties that that implies under company law, and the duties and obligations of a regulated entity.  It was required, and this was indeed acknowledged, in the first relationship framework to operate at arm's length from the Minister for Finance for very solid prudential reasons.  And as I point out in the statement I submitted to the committee, I take issue with the current second secretary of the Department of Finance who observed to the Public Accounts Committee that that arm's-length requirement changed in some way when the bank was put into wind-down mode in 2011.  To my mind, and to our minds jointly in the board of management of the bank, the wind-down mode did not in any way affect the necessity for the arm's-length relationship for the prudential protection of the Minister and of the State.<\/p><p> On a more general note, I have to say that since the onset of this crisis both the Eurogroup and the European Union authorities have been, I must say politely, dilatory in their approach to all of this and have only gradually recognised and attempted to get to grips with the flaws of the architecture of EMU.  I think that's well illustrated by the fact that the crisis really began in 2007, the single supervisory mechanism came into effect at the beginning of 2014.  I think that's an extremely slow pace of reaction to one of the most difficult crises we've had to deal with.<\/p><p> Having said that, I believe that against this very difficult and confused background, the Irish authorities have dealt extremely well with the macro-level consequences of the 2008 bank guarantee and the challenges of resolving highly distressed bank assets.  And in that regard, I think NAMA has performed extremely well, and indeed the performance of all of the banks in dealing with the greater part of the distressed assets has, I think, been rather good.  I'm not sure that I would have the same level of comfort about their mortgage books but that's perhaps something we could get into at a later stage.  Apart from the Central Bank, it's my belief that the authorities here did not have the skills to micro-manage banks and should not have attempted to do so in any case.  And I have to say that the Department of Finance frequently seemed to adopt a defensive and hostile approach to outsiders who were recruited for their specific skills that they brought in.  Following the liquidation of IBRC in February of 2013, the directors produced a statement of affairs as required by the legislation.  This showed that, on the basis of the balance sheet, and the support measures in place up to the moment of liquidation, the bank was solvent.  The joint special liquidators are reported to believe, or to expect that on completion of their functions, there will be a surplus of something in excess of &euro;1 billion for distribution to unsecured creditors.  The Governor of the Central Bank forecast that that institution will make an appreciable profit of several billion euro from its participation in the funding and the payment flows associated with the bank bailout process, much of which, of course, was associated with operations concerning Anglo and IBRC, and NAMA expects to return a surplus at the end of its operations.<\/p><p> The combined effect of those factors will produce a useful mitigation of what will still be a very large final cost to the State, of the banking crisis.  Together with my colleagues of the board of management of IBRC, I'm happy to have been able to contribute constructively to the mitigation of that cost.  Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#FFF00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dukes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":984,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Dukes.

As you know, I came to Ireland in September '09.  I definitely had the view when I arrived, based on what I'd been told and what was available publicly, that there was a big job to be done here.  I had no idea that it would quickly become known as the most toxic bank in Europe.  By the time of my arrival of course, the decision to establish NAMA had been made and you will recall that there was a number of 20%, in about mid-2009, being referred to as the likely NAMA haircut estimate across the industry.  I've been involved in difficult situations previously, I knew that this was likely to be a light number.  I knew that the full extent of the falling markets was not at that stage apparent, and we would see further deterioration, but I didn't expect the free-fall to continue as it did.  By the end of 2009, the haircut was estimated at around 30% and, of course, right through 2010 it increased dramatically to the point where by the time all of the calculations were done, the industry average was around 58%.<\/p><p>For Anglo Irish Bank, this was devastating, as it was for the rest of the industry.  It produced a loss on transfer of assets to NAMA of &euro;21 billion.  And that &euro;21 billion loss on NAMA assets, that was a 62% haircut on &euro;33.9 billion of assets eventually transferred.  Of course, that 72% of the overall &euro;29.3 billion of State funding required to support Anglo and that's ... it's interesting to contrast that &euro;29.3 with the original &euro;1.5 estimate, just prior to the point of nationalisation.  Now, of course, the loans that remained in the banks, they were a mix of good loans but also of distressed and non-performing loans that didn't qualify for transfers.  So, the difference ... the other &euro;8.3 billion of money that went in, went to offset provisions on those loans and also to recapitalise the bank ... put it in a position to maintain its regulatory capital thresholds.  <\/p><p> Internally, what I expected to find at the bank was the requirement to fundamentally restructure the organisation.  I knew that that would be necessary, given past experience I'd had.  I knew that there had been a substantial dislocation in the markets and that that pointed to a long period of uncertainty and that there would be a need for very, very careful management of the distressed loan portfolio.  While the extent of the downturn was still very uncertain at that point, it seemed crystal clear that it wasn't just a cyclical aberration in markets; it was a structural change, and that was driven, primarily, by the global financial crisis and the collapse of the global funding markets. <\/p><p> So the business at Anglo needed to be restructured.  People there were focused on growing and lending and the mindset of the lending banker needed to be changed.  It needed to be changed quickly and it needed to be changed to, what you could refer to, as the mindset of a restructuring banker rather than a lending banker.  We assembled a management team, which, I think, collectively was capable of addressing any issue that was put before it in the bank.  The Minister for Finance, at the time, the late Brian Lenihan, specifically requested that the senior people hired should be unblemished and not have been associated with the Irish banking scene or involved in any way in the global financial crisis.  The new team included specialists in corporate finance, debt restructuring and insolvency, as well as debt capital markets, balance sheet and capital management, enterprise risk management, corporate governance, finance, legal compliance and control in an environment wherein the management capacity and the mix assembled was equally applicable to a bank in full wind-down as it was to a bank going through a major restructure.  <\/p><p> The work to transform Anglo-INBS - on merger, IBRC - into a fit-for-purpose vehicle was extensive and required essentially a rebuild of, not only the client relationship management functions, but also the governance risk management and control activities from the ground up.  This had to be a progressive process, as markets were deteriorating rapidly and due attention to the immediate loan portfolio problems was critical.  It was a difficult process, as the loan book at Anglo was characterised by a lack of thorough management information, poorly perfected security - in some cases, absent - and a need to retain and supplement the management teams themselves.  Timeframes set by commitments to the European Commission needed to be respected and progress was desirable in the identification of management of a significant number of legacy issues.  In both my main and supplementary statements to the inquiry, I've referred to a number of times to difficult aspects of the interaction between the bank and the Department over the period from nationalisation to liquidation.  I remain of the view that most of the conflicts could have been avoided if there was a better understanding in the Department of the constraints the bank was under in complying with the various requirements it was subject to and the legal and prudential need for the bank to act independently.  The bank was governed by the Anglo Act and as well as an associated relationship framework that required ongoing separation from the Minister and his nominees.  In conducting interactions, there were often complex considerations required across multiple dimensions.  These included, not only the regulatory obligations, but many others in managing the ordinary course of business, which referenced many possible overlapping areas such as the public interest dimension, the management of legacy issues, the management of stressed loans, the management of very large exposures, as well as the number of other relevant legal considerations.<\/p><p>Importantly, the bank needed to be on top of all associated technical and commercial aspects and be aware of any potential dangers involved to both the bank and the Minister should the separation not be respected.  Unfortunately, this ran against the grain of what became the preferred position of the Department from March 2011-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#KKK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Aynsley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":988,"content":"<p>Your papers are up against the microphone there, Mr. Aynsley, so it's creating ... that's grand.

This included management through a period of unprecedented market turmoil whilst dealing with multiple high-profile legacy issues.  It included building a new leadership team and driving significant changes in the broader organisation, including overhauling of risk functions and establishing new governance and control processes.  It included conducting a thorough due diligence of NAMA bound and post-NAMA loan portfolios to identify the true quality and value of the underlying assets, establishing asset and loan recovery strategies and setting up specialist work-out units to proactively resolve distressed loans, maximise recovery and, where appropriate, restructuring loans so as strengthen and improve asset quality.<\/p> <p>  The bank was also involved in supporting the Irish authorities' and the international authorities' broader restructuring of the bank and the Irish banking landscape.  This work was central to the task of working through multiple alternative paths which ultimately led to the ... Anglo and INBS being placed into wind down.  And, of course, we have successfully ... we have successfully executed the acquisition of INBS and downsized the total asset portfolios from pre ... pre-crisis highs of over &euro;100 billion plus to some ... in total assets to a point where the net loan levels were around the &euro;15 billion mark at the point of special liquidation.

If I have any immediate concern about what went on during the period, it is simply that I'm not certain that all valuable lessons have being learned with regard to the need to separate banking policy and operations functions within the State.  My experience with the Department of Finance makes me worry that it is likely that the Department will not only continue to direct banking policy but also look to take an active role in directing operations and the regulatory function.  In part, this approach was a significant contributor to the breakdown of the banking sector in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As Ireland continues to move forward in its recovery, I wish it well and hope the outcomes of this banking inquiry and the very important work you're doing can productively be used to safeguard the sustainability of the financial sector for the future.

The ... at the ... at the board governance level ... I ... I think the board governance level was weak.  One of the aspects that was brought to my attention early on was the fact that there were sometimes two board meetings with ... small number of board members meeting and deciding on things and then having a larger group meeting and ... and pushing things through.  The committee structures I don't think worked as effectively as they could have.  There were a small number of people in the organisation responsible for very large decisions.<\/p><p>The reporting frameworks I don't think were particularly detailed or complex and certainly not framed, in my view, in a way that properly informed the board of the risks and the activities that were being undertaken in the bank.  Risk management, I think, seemed to be a process that the organisation went through just simply to say that they'd gone through a process to approve lending transactions and ... I sort of recall one of my first meetings with the chief risk officer at the time of my arrival.  He was an incumbent chief risk officer who had been at the bank for many years and he'd been at the front end of the lending business.  And he described it as a role that he was put in because he started to question some of the transactions that were being done and they sort of banished him to the risk area where in, in his words, he was classed as a second-class citizen.  So, you know, I think the ... the governance and the risk management and controls would be the key ones ... but it also gets down to just the embedded culture at the front end of the business and the thoughts that ... thought processes and mindset of the people going out and doing transactions.  <\/p><p> Another good example, and of course a ... a foreigner coming to town, particularly an Australian coming to down ... to town, the local Australian embassy here ... I am here and they invite me out there one night.  So the first ... first night I went out there for a dinner, there's a whole group of people.  I ... I don't know anyone there, and this fellow came up to me, who will remain unnamed, and he says, \"I love Anglo.\"  He said, \"I'm glad you're here.\" An Aussie.  \"I just love Anglo.\"  So I ... okay ... talk to me, and he said, \"You know, I've been buying properties, investing in properties, for a long time\".  And he said, \"I don't know how they found out about it but I was at an auction one morning and a fellow came up and he handed me an envelope, and it was an Anglo Irish Bank envelope, and I opened it up, and there was a cheque inside, which represented slightly more than what the deposit would be and it says ... a note attached saying, 'Just in case you need the deposit'.\".  So, you know, this is the mindset at the time.  It was to go out there at all costs, find ways to go out there and grow the loan book and lend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#MMM00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Aynsley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":994,"content":"<p>Okay.

He'd been on the board for only a short time before that.  <\/p><p> Looking back over the picture as it was then, a few things struck me very, very forcibly in addition to what Mike Aynsley has said.  Anglo developed a reputation.  I knew Anglo when it was a very young bank.  I had some dealings with them and it was a business bank and it struck me as being a very progressive and active outfit doing business lending.  It went into property then, as you know, in a large way.  It was successful and grew rapidly in the property sector in Ireland and looking at it from the outside, it seemed to me they had decided to diversify so they went and got into the property sector in the UK and grew very rapidly.  Then they decided again to diversify and they went and did the same thing in the United States.  So here we had a bank that was rapidly becoming a monoline with the same kind of risk in three jurisdictions.  Now I know they had some other operations in Austria and in Germany but they weren't hugely material in terms of the total.<\/p><p> So there was a very great concentration of risk there.  It developed, and they were very proud of it, I think, this kind of system of what they called relationship banking, which was that, and this was part of their picture, they knew their clients very well, they could rely on a relationship with their clients and they knew their clients well enough to know when they could be confident that this was a good loan or this other one wasn't, which resulted in a situation where, as was explained this afternoon at one point, 6% of the loan book constituted loans for land in Ireland on which there was no zoning.  Now that to me indicated much more than a prudent appetite for risk and it indicated a failure to appreciate the dangers of the kind of concentration that they had.  That was a concentration by sector and then when after ... immediately after nationalisation, we began to look through the loan book and tried to figure out what relationship banking was all about, it became apparent very quickly, and I have dealt with this in my statement, that it took quite a lot of time to find out just where the exposures were or what the level of exposure was to given borrowers.  You would find a case where a given borrower ... there was a large exposure to the person in a particular project and then you'd find if you followed the threads through, there were other exposures to the same borrower and in fact-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#NNN00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dukes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":1001,"content":"<p>Mr. Dukes, I am sorry now ...

And we had a relationship framework that was drawn up and it set out the concern of separation of the bank, which was a risky operation, from the State, which wanted to avoid risk to the extent that it could.  And having done that, the Government decided they didn't trust the people that they had entrusted with this job of doing it.  And that then was compounded by the fact that two key proposals were made to the bank at different times, one about the head of banking in the Department of Finance being on the board who would, in my view, have been seriously conflicted, and it did not seem to me that that was in any way a runner ... that was badly ... the rejection of that was badly received.<\/p><p>And then the other point ... at a later stage, where it was suggested, on the basis of a report which was not shared with the bank ... we never saw that McKinsey report but one recommendation from it was to recombine the functions of chief financial officer and chief risk officer in a very risky bank where we were very concerned about protecting the State from the consequences of a default on the part of the bank or a cessation of business where it was absolutely the wrong thing to do - to mix the risk function with the finance function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#OOO01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dukes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#PPP00200","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1438210800,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>And that had been clearly demonstrated in the previous life of Anglo.

Now, I have to say that if you look at the relationship framework ... the two versions - the first one we had in 2009 and the second one that was there in 2012 - if you parse and analyse through those, the relationship framework say this should be operated at arm's length from the Minister, except where the Minister decides to do it otherwise.

I have to say, I frequently had the impression that information that we transmitted to the Department didn't percolate all the way through.  You know, it maybe didn't percolate all the way through to where it should.  And a second comment about a sales processes: we were very concerned at all points to ensure we got maximum value, which is how we designed the processes but there was, from time to time, a suggestion that we should do it differently.  For example, I was urged at one point by an official to speed up sales of various performing assets, whereas, as I say in my statement, we tended to take the view that if there was a loan that was performing, meeting all of its requirements and covenants and it was going to mature within the wind-down period of the bank, there wasn't a good reason to go and try to terminate that early, although this was what was being urged.<\/p><p>And when I asked the person in question why on earth we'd want to do that ... because if we had a performing loan and the borrower was meeting all the covenants the only way we could persuade the borrower to pay off the loan early would be to put some incentive on the table, which meant we would be getting less out of it than we otherwise would.  But, you know, there was a view, sometimes expressed by some people in the Department, that if there was a good loan there, we should take the money and run, you know, force a refinancing or a sale on the basis that, you know, there was a time value of money and that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, whereas we took a different view that we had to look at recoveries over the whole period and, in addition, if you had a performing loan that was paying, it was making a contribution on a continuing basis to the running costs of the bank.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#SSS03400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dukes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":1106,"content":"<p>So, finally, is it your evidence that there was a pattern of pressure from the Department, when it came to asset sales, to have a less transparent, less open sales process than the bank?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#TTT00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1438210800,"counter":1107,"content":"<p>No, I wouldn't say a pattern - occasional instances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#TTT00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dukes"},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":1108,"content":"<p>Occasional?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#TTT00400","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1438210800,"counter":1109,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#TTT00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dukes"},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>How many times?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#TTT00600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1438210800,"counter":1111,"content":"<p>Oh, it is hard to put a figure on it.

This is maybe trespassing on some other question.  It was decided in 2011 that we should wind down the bank over ten years - maximum recovery for the State and maximum avoidance of risk, if you like.  The actual outline proposal for the pace of the wind-down was one which the bank proposed.  I proposed it at a meeting with the relevant authorities and it was accepted.  I made the point, at that stage, that we could probably do a more rapid wind-down with not a very much bigger risk of execution and I was told, at that point, \"No, do not propose that.\"  And I assumed, and I think I was probably right in assuming this, that the authorities did not want to be corralled into a wind-down process that might be faster than we could actually deliver so we agreed on an outline wind-down proposal, what we called, in our own internal jargon, \"the blue bars\", which were the declining outstanding loan values in each year.  But, from time to time, we would be urged to accelerate the process.  Now we did actually wind down a bit faster than \"the blue bars\" proposal because we found we could do it without sacrificing the level of return and, in fact, the US book was a very good example of that.  We certainly thought that had we done a series of individual sales of those assets, we would have made a better return out of it, but it would have taken much longer than the process that we actually engaged in and we were concerned, for other reasons, for other considerations, to wind down the American operation, you know, as quickly as we could and to get rid of all the outlying parts of the bank so that we could concentrate on the core.<\/p> <p>  But, you know, from time to time there would be pressure to say, \"Well, can you not do it a bit faster?\" and we said, \"Yes, of course, we could do it faster but if you want us to do it faster than we have undertaken to do in the exercise, then please give us a formal instruction to do that\", and that was never forthcoming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#TTT00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dukes"},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":1114,"content":"<p>Chair, I want to formally put on the record a request that Mr. Aynsley's witness statement, including that extract and the testimony that we are being given, would be formally sent to the commission of investigation looking at certain transactions and other matters at the IBRC, that we would write and send that to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#TTT01000","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":1115,"content":"<p>Okay, I just need to get legal advice with regard to the separation of the two committees.

I think this is a very important concept because it gets right to the heart of, you know, the difference between the highest sale price and what is the best economic value in a transaction.  And, in this particular case with the US book, there were economic value considerations outside the control of the bank and they were really at the State level.  So whilst, you know, we're governed by the EC restructuring plan, we're governed by the commitments letter which says that we need to get certain returns on assets when we sell on on a net present value basis, and we have to deal with timeframes for running down a portfolio so ... in other words you just don't want to go and sell a portfolio and fire sale it and say \"I've done a good job because I've wound this bank down quickly.\"  The idea is to wind it down no quicker than the timeframe, but to achieve the best result.<\/p> <p>  In this case there was a major result that the State was looking for apart from the financial return in Anglo Irish Bank, and that was to alleviate this very significant problem with the ECB funding levels.  So the deleveraging of the system was something which was a statewide objective that we couldn't make a decision around.  The Minister needed to make that decision, ultimately decided that this was an important component, formed part of the decision-making process and resulted in a ministerial instruction for us to sell the portfolio or include some assets in the portfolio that we probably or that we definitely would have kept for a longer period if these other issues were not at the forefront.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#VVV01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Aynsley"},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":1159,"content":"<p>And did you put up an argument with the Department in relation to what-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#VVV01400","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1438210800,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>No, those sorts of issues we wouldn't argue with those sorts of issues, you know ... we understand those.

The bank at some point goes along and says, \"You've now got all of this extra value in your assets.  How about we lend you some more money so you can go off and buy something else?\"  So, they lend another &euro;100 million with the agreement that what they'll do when he spends money is go back and pick up the security on those particular properties.  And then, for whatever reason, it is not done.  So, enter the new management team.

There was a need.  At one point, in fact, probably early in 2010 when we were just beginning the process of transferring loans to NAMA - which was going to be a difficult process - I remember raising the question, just for discussion, whether we shouldn't transfer all of the Anglo loan book into NAMA and close down Anglo.

We found, as I ... that note that you referred to in the beginning, that was a note I prepared for my own guidance in chairing the meeting with Mr. Moran in May of 2011.  It set out areas where I felt that the interaction between the bank and the Department was not producing the kind of result that it might have.  For example, I think we were more aggressive ... we were more constructive about restructuring Arnotts, for example, than the Department would have been and we consulted them about that because that was an area that we thought might be an area of public interest ... you know, an iconic department store in a sensitive part of Dublin ... you know, there might be considerations to be taken into account but NTMA was nervous about the kind of deal we were doing.  And the same, there was another deal ... a Champion deal, which NTMA was nervous about but which we went ahead with because it was our commercial judgment that that was in the best interests of the bank.  And if you see on the section directly above that ... \"Anglo board has real concerns about liability issues\".  That goes to the heart of the way the relationship worked.  I felt at that time that we had to make it clear that the ultimate responsibility for what happened in the bank rested with the board and not with the NTMA or the Department of Finance and that it was the board's necks that were on the line for decisions that were made and we couldn't legally or prudently leave too many of those decisions to be made by other people, whose concerns were not, maybe, as informed by the realities of commercial life as ours were.  We found, from time to time, in discussions with the Department, that they raised questions, which was a legitimate thing to do, but some of the questions were extremely naive.  And as I said earlier on, we were never entirely sure just how far up in the Department the responses percolated and we found, from time to time, that it seemed to be difficult to come to a conclusion on an issue with the Department.  The Department would raise a series of questions, legitimately, about a particular set of activities or whatever.  We would sit down with them, explain it all, go through it all and they would ... we'd end the meeting and it would appear that that was concluded.  And, a couple of months later, they would come back to us with the same set of questions, so it seemed to be difficult to be sure that we had concluded on an issue with the Department.

As I said earlier on, the information was there about the concentration of risk by sector, and by borrower, and it was there available to the regulatory authorities.<\/p> <p>  The second point I would make is that I think this was common cause for most of the banks.  If they were asked about their loan exposures in the property sector they would have said, and probably would have believed, that they operated a 70% loan-to-value ratio.  On deeper examination I found, and this is making it very broad - this is broad brush kind of stuff - if you really examined their loan books, and tracked through individual borrowers, you would find that in a number of cases, and a not insignificant number of cases, the 30% equity that was supposed to go with this 70% loan-to-value ratio was borrowed funding either from the one bank or from another bank and brought in as equity to support a loan.  So that, in fact, the concentration by sector and by borrower was actually exacerbated by the loan-to-value ratios that actually existed in real terms.  The first two parts of that were information - if you like, gross level information - that was available to regulators and that should have set off alarm bells.  Regulators should have said \"Stop, you are over concentrated.\"  The last bit of it was much more difficult to find out and that was partly related to the design of the bank systems and the kinds of things that Mr. Aynsley has been talking about. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#NNNN00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dukes"},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":1370,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I think - and maybe it's not really useful to say this, but I think it should be said - there is quite a difference between winding down a bank, getting bank into a wind-down position, and liquidating it.  If you wind it down, you get to the point where you have satisfied all of the demands of creditors, there is still some base of assets left, there's enough left to deal with the tail risks that are there or else the tail risks are of a magnitude that it's safe to hand over to somebody else without creating a problem.  And I think, at the end of the day, that was, if you like, our preference to wind the bank down in that way.  As Mike Aynsley has said, from the State financing point of view, other priorities supervened and it became more interesting or more valuable from the State's point of view to liquidate the bank and get the benefit in terms of the easement of the promissory note burden rather than to continue with disposing of the assets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#TTTT01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dukes"},{"type":"speech","time":1438210800,"counter":1527,"content":"<p>Would you agree with Mr. Dukes's summary or would you like to add anything else to it, Mr. Aynsley?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015073000002#TTTT01100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1438210800,"counter":1528,"content":"<p>Yes, I would agree with that.

Some time later, another report came back detailing what kind of progress had been made on that and what kind of problems there were with that portfolio.
