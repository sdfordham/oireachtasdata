Members will recall that the statement of means is to be completed by the debtor in order that the court has comprehensive details of their income and outgoings in order that an assessment can be made of the debtor's capacity to repay the debt.  A second, or further statement of means would be required to be provided by the debtor where there is a proposal to vary the attachment or deduction order under the provisions of section 20.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 corrects the references by providing for an amended definition of statement of means in section 1, which now references the variation provisions in section 20.  Amendments Nos. 11 and 18 are consequential amendments.  I should mention at this stage that it is intended to introduce a number of amendments on Report Stage.  These are likely to include further refinement of the definitions sections, a possible further amendment to section 2, regarding the making of regulations, some further refinements to section 7 concerning the statement of means and a new provision concerning protection against unfair dismissals for employees with less than 12 months' service, amendments to section 15 concerning persons in the employment of the State, amendments concerning the service of documents, amendments relating to the enforcement of court orders Acts, some further refinements to the sections dealing with the deductions from social welfare payments and the variation of orders made under the Bill, and a possible amendment to the enforcement section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015071000002#A00500","speaker":"985"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436520600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436520600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Section 1, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436520600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436520600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Question, \"That section 2 stand part of the Bill\", put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436520600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>SECTION 3<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436520600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Question, \"That section 3 stand part of the Bill\", put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436520600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>SECTION 4<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436520600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Question, \"That section 4 stand part of the Bill\", put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436520600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>SECTION 5<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1436520600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, 6, 9,10, 19 and 20 are technical and drafting amendments and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015071000002#A01500","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1436520600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>In page 7, line 27, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>I propose to deal with amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, 6, 9, 10, 19 and 20 together.
