The commitment of Ireland to the promotion and protection of human rights is an underlying principle of Ireland's foreign policy and is a priority for the Government.  Ireland is currently a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council and we pursue our human rights priorities in many international fora.  Ireland is a firm supporter of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights system and liaises regularly with the UK in relation to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers' supervision of states' implementation of Court judgments.   <\/p>  <p>  I should note clearly at the outset there is not at this time any legislation before the British Parliament at Westminster to repeal the 1998 UK Human Rights Act.  Indeed the new British Government has not yet published its legislative programme for this parliamentary term, although it is expected to do so later this month.  In the absence of any detailed proposal it is difficult to speculate on potential consequences.  Obviously were any proposal to be made it would have to be carefully analysed.<\/p>  <p>  On the broad question of human rights and the Good Friday Agreement, the views of the Government are clear and unchanged.  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, predicated on the European Convention of Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Agreement.  As a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles.  The fundamental role of human rights in guaranteeing peace and stability in Northern Ireland cannot be taken for granted and must be fully respected.  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is an ongoing obligation.<\/p>  <p>  Placing human rights at the heart of the peace process in Northern Ireland has helped to ensure the participation and trust of all communities.  A shared emphasis on human rights and all that this implies is part of what makes the peace process credible and effective.  The Government will work closely with the UK Government and with the power-sharing Executive in Belfast to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We will follow closely all developments in this regard.

In her address to the Security Council, the High Representative made clear that the priority must be to prevent the loss of lives at sea and that this requires a comprehensive approach which must be undertaken in close partnership with countries in the region, with regional organisations, the wider international community and in particular with the UN Security Council.  She recalled the EU's firm intention \"to always respect international law, international humanitarian law and human rights\".

At that meeting, Minister Frances Fitzgerald and I, together with our EU partners, confirmed our strong commitment to act to prevent recurrence of such tragedies.  We agreed that work would be taken forward along three strands: reinforcing Frontex activities to save lives at sea, a fairer sharing of responsibilities regarding resettlement and relocation projects within the EU and a range of options to combat organized crime networks and human traffickers.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach attended a special meeting of the European Council on 23 April at which Heads of State and Government agreed that the immediate priority is to prevent more people from dying at sea.

The Council invited High Representative Mogherini to begin preparations for a possible EU CSDP operation to this effect.<\/p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended yesterday, EU Foreign Ministers adopted a Council Decision to establish a European Union military operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean.

A second phase will involve the boarding, search seizure and diversion of vessels of human traffickers who drive this trade in human misery and exploit people for profit.  A third phase provides for taking measures against the vessels including through disposing of them or rendering them inoperable.<\/p>  <p>  The Political and Security Committee, acting under the responsibility of the Council of Ministers, will decide on when to make the transition between the different phases, taking into account any applicable UN Security Council Resolution and consent by the coastal states concerned.<\/p>  <p>  In discussions to date Ireland has insisted that the EUNAVFOR MED operation should be carried out in full accordance with international law.

The recent steps taken by the United States are intended to impose financial and travel restrictions on seven named individuals in leadership positions in Venezuela whom the United States has identified as being involved in human rights violations.  The accompanying Executive Order signed by President Obama provides the legal basis for the sanctions in accordance with US law. <\/p>  <p>  The measures invoked by the United States have given rise to diplomatic tensions between the US and Venezuela and have been commented on widely.  I am pleased that the US has advised that the measures in question are not directed against the Venezuelan people as a whole, only against the named individuals.  Official sources have clarified that the US does not consider Venezuela to be a threat to its national security and Venezuela is not listed by the US State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism.  President Obama and President Maduro discussed their countries' bilateral relations at the Summit of the Americas in Panama on 10 April in what was described as a candid, serious and frank manner.  Since then, a team from the US State Department has returned to Caracas, at President Maduro&rsquo;s invitation, for official discussions.   <\/p>  <p>  I am following the situation in Venezuela closely and with concern.  Increasing internal tensions, political polarisation, and a severe economic crisis have led to serious shortages in medical supplies and daily goods.  I am concerned that a severe humanitarian crisis may develop if the situation is not resolved soon.  The deaths, casualties and detentions arising from the unrest in Venezuela require full, impartial investigation in accordance with due legal process.  The apparently high levels of impunity in the case of serious crimes are a matter of further concern.<\/p>  <p>  I share the view expressed by EU High Representative Mogherini, and by Venezuela&rsquo;s regional partners, that the government there must work with all parties and with civil society to overcome the difficult situation in the country.

It also remains important that all regional stakeholders who are in a position to exert influence are fully engaged in UN-led peace efforts.

However we also need to respond in the wider region by addressing root causes.  Political solutions are essential.  In the meantime, there is a huge need for increased humanitarian assistance, which Ireland is providing.  In recent weeks, we have provided funding of &euro;1 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross for its work with migrants in Libya.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland's support for people affected by the Syrian crisis will total &euro;41 million for the four years to the end of 2015.  We have also provided almost &euro;36 million in humanitarian funding to Somalia since 2008.  To date in 2015, &euro;1 million has been approved for the UN's Common Humanitarian Fund in Somalia, with a further &euro;1.7 million to be provided to our NGO partners for their lifesaving work on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  We are continuing to review the assistance which Ireland can provide in terms of the immediate humanitarian effort and long-term development needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900054#WRA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900054#WRA04850"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[19341\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900054#WRA04900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) is reportedly being kept in a section of a jail that makes it difficult for that person's parent to have contact with him during visits; and if he will try use any influence he has to ensure that the person is moved to different section, which will allow his parent better access to him, and more personal visits.

The European Council in June 2014 acknowledged that the UK&rsquo;s concerns need to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The new British Government is now committed to holding a referendum on the UK&rsquo;s membership of the Union before the end of 2017. Our hope is that the British people will vote to remain in the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is stronger with the UK as a fully committed member. Furthermore, as I have said before on several occasions, joint Irish-British membership of the EU has played an instrumental role in bringing our economies, peoples, and countries closer together. It has also played a significant part in supporting the peace process in Northern Ireland. A UK withdrawal from the EU would therefore be harmful to our interests and the strong relationship between our two Governments.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge now is for the British Government to work together with all Member States and the EU institutions to help find a consensual basis for continued British membership of the EU. This is in everyone&rsquo;s interests, including those of the EU itself. It is my intention that Ireland will play an active and constructive role in any negotiation process.<\/p>  <p>  Much will depend on the detail of the UK&rsquo;s proposals for EU reform and we look forward to soon learning more about what the British Government has in mind. Ireland has made it very clear that we are ready to consider the merits of sensible reform proposals that could improve the functioning of our Union. At the same time, we will be equally clear if we believe a proposal is undesirable or unachievable. We want to avoid any outcome that could undermine or otherwise adversely affect our Union.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is determined to do all it can to help keep the UK in the EU.

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2013, the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed was published.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.<\/p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.<\/p>  <p>  The Advisory Group also considered that it would not be appropriate to extend social insurance to the self-employed for short-term illness supports, such as illness benefit. In making this determination the Advisory Group acknowledged that some self-employed people could continue to obtain an income while suffering an illness whereas an employee, experiencing a similar illness, might not.  Furthermore, control difficulties might arise with a self-employed person self-certifying their non-participation in their business. On the other hand, the Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed is warranted for cases related to long term sickness or injuries and recommended that Class S benefits should include the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit for an additional mandatory contribution.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to change these provisions in relation to self-employed persons would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900055#WRB05100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900055#WRB05200"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[19277\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900055#WRB05300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the funding allocated to the school meals programme and the school books grant.
