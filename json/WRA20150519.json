The commitment of Ireland to the promotion and protection of human rights is an underlying principle of Ireland's foreign policy and is a priority for the Government.  Ireland is currently a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council and we pursue our human rights priorities in many international fora.  Ireland is a firm supporter of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights system and liaises regularly with the UK in relation to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers' supervision of states' implementation of Court judgments.   <\/p>  <p>  I should note clearly at the outset there is not at this time any legislation before the British Parliament at Westminster to repeal the 1998 UK Human Rights Act.  Indeed the new British Government has not yet published its legislative programme for this parliamentary term, although it is expected to do so later this month.  In the absence of any detailed proposal it is difficult to speculate on potential consequences.  Obviously were any proposal to be made it would have to be carefully analysed.<\/p>  <p>  On the broad question of human rights and the Good Friday Agreement, the views of the Government are clear and unchanged.  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, predicated on the European Convention of Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Agreement.  As a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles.  The fundamental role of human rights in guaranteeing peace and stability in Northern Ireland cannot be taken for granted and must be fully respected.  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is an ongoing obligation.<\/p>  <p>  Placing human rights at the heart of the peace process in Northern Ireland has helped to ensure the participation and trust of all communities.  A shared emphasis on human rights and all that this implies is part of what makes the peace process credible and effective.  The Government will work closely with the UK Government and with the power-sharing Executive in Belfast to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We will follow closely all developments in this regard.

In her address to the Security Council, the High Representative made clear that the priority must be to prevent the loss of lives at sea and that this requires a comprehensive approach which must be undertaken in close partnership with countries in the region, with regional organisations, the wider international community and in particular with the UN Security Council.  She recalled the EU's firm intention \"to always respect international law, international humanitarian law and human rights\".

At that meeting, Minister Frances Fitzgerald and I, together with our EU partners, confirmed our strong commitment to act to prevent recurrence of such tragedies.  We agreed that work would be taken forward along three strands: reinforcing Frontex activities to save lives at sea, a fairer sharing of responsibilities regarding resettlement and relocation projects within the EU and a range of options to combat organized crime networks and human traffickers.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach attended a special meeting of the European Council on 23 April at which Heads of State and Government agreed that the immediate priority is to prevent more people from dying at sea.

The Council invited High Representative Mogherini to begin preparations for a possible EU CSDP operation to this effect.<\/p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended yesterday, EU Foreign Ministers adopted a Council Decision to establish a European Union military operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean.

A second phase will involve the boarding, search seizure and diversion of vessels of human traffickers who drive this trade in human misery and exploit people for profit.  A third phase provides for taking measures against the vessels including through disposing of them or rendering them inoperable.<\/p>  <p>  The Political and Security Committee, acting under the responsibility of the Council of Ministers, will decide on when to make the transition between the different phases, taking into account any applicable UN Security Council Resolution and consent by the coastal states concerned.<\/p>  <p>  In discussions to date Ireland has insisted that the EUNAVFOR MED operation should be carried out in full accordance with international law.

The recent steps taken by the United States are intended to impose financial and travel restrictions on seven named individuals in leadership positions in Venezuela whom the United States has identified as being involved in human rights violations.  The accompanying Executive Order signed by President Obama provides the legal basis for the sanctions in accordance with US law. <\/p>  <p>  The measures invoked by the United States have given rise to diplomatic tensions between the US and Venezuela and have been commented on widely.  I am pleased that the US has advised that the measures in question are not directed against the Venezuelan people as a whole, only against the named individuals.  Official sources have clarified that the US does not consider Venezuela to be a threat to its national security and Venezuela is not listed by the US State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism.  President Obama and President Maduro discussed their countries' bilateral relations at the Summit of the Americas in Panama on 10 April in what was described as a candid, serious and frank manner.  Since then, a team from the US State Department has returned to Caracas, at President Maduro&rsquo;s invitation, for official discussions.   <\/p>  <p>  I am following the situation in Venezuela closely and with concern.  Increasing internal tensions, political polarisation, and a severe economic crisis have led to serious shortages in medical supplies and daily goods.  I am concerned that a severe humanitarian crisis may develop if the situation is not resolved soon.  The deaths, casualties and detentions arising from the unrest in Venezuela require full, impartial investigation in accordance with due legal process.  The apparently high levels of impunity in the case of serious crimes are a matter of further concern.<\/p>  <p>  I share the view expressed by EU High Representative Mogherini, and by Venezuela&rsquo;s regional partners, that the government there must work with all parties and with civil society to overcome the difficult situation in the country.

It also remains important that all regional stakeholders who are in a position to exert influence are fully engaged in UN-led peace efforts.

However we also need to respond in the wider region by addressing root causes.  Political solutions are essential.  In the meantime, there is a huge need for increased humanitarian assistance, which Ireland is providing.  In recent weeks, we have provided funding of &euro;1 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross for its work with migrants in Libya.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland's support for people affected by the Syrian crisis will total &euro;41 million for the four years to the end of 2015.  We have also provided almost &euro;36 million in humanitarian funding to Somalia since 2008.  To date in 2015, &euro;1 million has been approved for the UN's Common Humanitarian Fund in Somalia, with a further &euro;1.7 million to be provided to our NGO partners for their lifesaving work on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  We are continuing to review the assistance which Ireland can provide in terms of the immediate humanitarian effort and long-term development needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900054#WRA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900054#WRA04850"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[19341\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900054#WRA04900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) is reportedly being kept in a section of a jail that makes it difficult for that person's parent to have contact with him during visits; and if he will try use any influence he has to ensure that the person is moved to different section, which will allow his parent better access to him, and more personal visits.

The European Council in June 2014 acknowledged that the UK&rsquo;s concerns need to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The new British Government is now committed to holding a referendum on the UK&rsquo;s membership of the Union before the end of 2017. Our hope is that the British people will vote to remain in the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is stronger with the UK as a fully committed member. Furthermore, as I have said before on several occasions, joint Irish-British membership of the EU has played an instrumental role in bringing our economies, peoples, and countries closer together. It has also played a significant part in supporting the peace process in Northern Ireland. A UK withdrawal from the EU would therefore be harmful to our interests and the strong relationship between our two Governments.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge now is for the British Government to work together with all Member States and the EU institutions to help find a consensual basis for continued British membership of the EU. This is in everyone&rsquo;s interests, including those of the EU itself. It is my intention that Ireland will play an active and constructive role in any negotiation process.<\/p>  <p>  Much will depend on the detail of the UK&rsquo;s proposals for EU reform and we look forward to soon learning more about what the British Government has in mind. Ireland has made it very clear that we are ready to consider the merits of sensible reform proposals that could improve the functioning of our Union. At the same time, we will be equally clear if we believe a proposal is undesirable or unachievable. We want to avoid any outcome that could undermine or otherwise adversely affect our Union.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is determined to do all it can to help keep the UK in the EU.

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2013, the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed was published.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.<\/p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.<\/p>  <p>  The Advisory Group also considered that it would not be appropriate to extend social insurance to the self-employed for short-term illness supports, such as illness benefit. In making this determination the Advisory Group acknowledged that some self-employed people could continue to obtain an income while suffering an illness whereas an employee, experiencing a similar illness, might not.  Furthermore, control difficulties might arise with a self-employed person self-certifying their non-participation in their business. On the other hand, the Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed is warranted for cases related to long term sickness or injuries and recommended that Class S benefits should include the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit for an additional mandatory contribution.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to change these provisions in relation to self-employed persons would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900055#WRB05100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900055#WRB05200"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[19277\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900055#WRB05300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the funding allocated to the school meals programme and the school books grant.

There are approximately 69,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Department recently published a review of the maximum rent limits, &ldquo;Maximum Rent Limit Analysis and Findings&rdquo; and it is available on www.welfare.ie.  The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students.  Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market.  The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the review&rsquo;s findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances throughout the country, including those in the Meath area, are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits as appropriate.  I am satisfied that this is the appropriate response at this time which has assisted in excess of 1,500 rent supplement recipients throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation, which is representative of the position in Meath.  The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy.  My Government colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, is also considering a number of policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am keeping this matter under close review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided for rent supplement recipients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900057#WRD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Applications","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900057#WRD01850"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[19685\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900057#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Roscommon will receive a decision on an invalidity pension review; the reason for the delay; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>The department received a claim for invalidity pension (IP) from the person concerned on the 18 August 2014.

At that income point the application of the USC would result in a charge of &euro;180 approximately per annum.<\/p>  <p>  As you are aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by my Department in the lead up to Budget 2012.  The report is available at my Department's website at www.finance.gov.ie.  The issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public servants who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.\u00a0 However, the Government decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as it would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it would involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefiting from the exemption.  In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions.<\/p>  <p>  However, as a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum.  It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.  An estimated further 87,000 individuals have been exempted from the charge as a result of the extended exemption threshold introduced in Budget 2015.  This latter extension equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with Public Service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level.  Furthermore, I intend to continue to reform the tax system in this manner in future budgets, subject to having the required fiscal space. \u00a0I would point out however, that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that all those who paid Income Tax and\/or USC in 2014, including pensioners, will see a reduction in their tax bill this year where income is equal.<\/p>  <p>  Any review of public service pay is primarily a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

In addition, as the amount of\u00a0interest payable reduces as a mortgage is paid down, the level of mortgage interest relief also reduces in tandem.<\/p>  <p>  Given the additional relief already available to those that purchased their homes between 2004 and 2008, over and above that available to other qualifying homeowners and given that mortgage interest relief has now lapsed in terms of new qualifying loans, I am not convinced of the merits of revisiting the provisions at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900058#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900058#WRE02350"},{"type":"question","counter":275,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[19237\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900058#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the legal challenges or investigations in place which could prolong the process leading to the conclusion of the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation; and if in place, if he will provide details of the challenges or investigations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":276,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[19252\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900058#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the timeframe for the conclusion of the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The first &euro;1,270 of gains made by an individual in any year is exempt from CGT.<\/p><p>A relief from CGT, known as retirement relief, is available where an individual aged 55 or over is disposing of business or agricultural assets.  In order to qualify for the relief, those assets must have been owned and used for business or farming purposes for a period of 10 years prior to the disposal.  Retirement relief has been available since the introduction of CGT in 1975.<\/p><p>In the case of disposals outside the family, full relief applies where the consideration for the disposal is &euro;750,000 or less.  The threshold is reduced to &euro;500,000 where the person disposing of qualifying assets is aged 66 or over and the disposal takes place on or after 1 January 2014.  Marginal relief applies where the consideration slightly exceeds the relevant thresholds.<\/p><p>Where the disposal is within the family, for example, a disposal by a parent to a son or daughter, there is no upper limit on the relief except where the person who is disposing of the qualifying assets is aged 66 or over and the disposal takes place on or after 1 January 2014.  In such a case, the relief is capped at &euro;3m.<\/p><p><b>Capital Acquisitions Tax<\/b><\/p><p>Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) is the overall name for both Gift and Inheritance tax.  The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance.<\/p><p>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the &quot; Group threshold&quot;- below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.<\/p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.<\/p><p><b>Group A: tax free threshold &euro;225,000<\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild, and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<\/p><p><b>Group B: tax free threshold &euro;30,150 <\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<\/p><p><b>Group C: tax free threshold &euro;15,075 <\/b>applies in all other cases.<\/p><p>Where a gift or inheritance consists of business property (such as land, buildings, plant and machinery), the value of the business may be reduced by 90% for CAT purposes provided certain conditions are met, for example, minimum periods of business usage of the property both before and after the gift or inheritance.  This specific relief from CAT on the transfer of businesses by way of gift or inheritance was introduced in 1994 and is known as CAT Business Relief.<\/p><p>The introduction of business relief was an acknowledgement by the government of the day that it wished to encourage entrepreneurial activity and also prevent the forced sale of trading entities to pay significant CAT liabilities.<\/p><p>As stated, business relief reduces the taxable value of qualifying business property by 90% when calculating CAT.<\/p><p>Therefore, when business relief applies in full, business property with a market value of, say, &euro;1m, would be treated as worth only &euro;100,000 when calculating CAT.  This can have the effect of reducing the effective rate of CAT from 33% to 3.3% on the transfer of a business.

The relief is granted in respect of the profits of a new trade and chargeable gains on the disposal of any assets used for the purposes of the new trade. The relief is granted by reducing the corporation tax on profits relating to the trade to nil where the total amount of corporation tax payable by the company for an accounting period does not exceed &euro;40,000. Marginal relief is granted on a tapering basis where the total amount of corporation tax liability for the accounting period is between &euro;40,000 and &euro;60,000. <\/p><p>The qualifying period has been extended in subsequent Finance Acts, and the relief is now available to qualifying companies commencing to trade up to and including 2015.\u00a0 As part of one of the early extensions of the relief, in Finance Act 2011, the basis on which relief is computed was changed to link the reduction in corporation tax to the amount of employers' PRSI paid in an accounting period, subject to a limit of &euro;5,000 per employee and an aggregate limit of &euro;40,000. The purpose of this change was to better target the relief at companies generating employment. <\/p><p>Subsequent amendments have also extended the relief to provide that, where a start-up company does not have sufficient profits to claim the relief in a given year, any relief unclaimed in the first three years can be carried forward into future years for use against future corporation tax liabilities.<\/p><p>The total annual cost of the relief is &euro;6m, and it was due to expire at the end of 2014. However in last year's Finance Bill it was extended to the end of 2015, in order to allow for a review of the operation of this measure to take place in 2015 to ensure that it meets the policy objectives of creating jobs and activity in Ireland and provides value for money for the Irish taxpayer.<\/p><p>I would also mention that certain small enterprise grants made under section 10(5) of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Act, 1979 and section 21(5)(a) (as amended by the Industrial Development (Amendment) Act, 1991) of the Industrial Development Act, 1986 are not liable to corporation tax under TCA, section 223.<\/p><p><b>Capital Gains Tax <\/b><\/p><p>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is charged at the rate of 33% in respect of gains on the disposal of assets. The first &euro;1,270 of gains made by an individual in any year is exempt from CGT. <\/p><p>The Finance Act 2014 provides relief from a future CGT liability for entrepreneurs who, on or after 1 January 2014 and on or before 31 December 2018, invest the proceeds of an earlier disposal in respect of which CGT was paid in new business ventures, which are subsequently sold. <\/p><p>A qualifying enterprise for the purpose of the relief is defined as an enterprise which, at the time of the making of the initial risk finance investment, is a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise, as defined in Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003\/361\/EC of 6 May 2003 and which:<\/p><p>- has not been carrying on any business, trade or profession, or<\/p><p>-  has been carrying on a trade, business or profession for less than 7 years.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The relief is in the form of a tax credit against any capital gains tax liability on the future disposal of chargeable business assets of the qualifying enterprise made more than 3 years after they were acquired. The tax credit will be the<b><\/b>lower of:<\/p><p>- the CGT paid on the earlier disposal where all the consideration on the disposal, apart from any CGT paid, is invested in chargeable business assets (or a proportionate amount where less than the full amount is reinvested), and<\/p><p>- 50 per cent of the CGT payable on the disposal of chargeable business assets.<\/p><p>Chargeable business assets are assets used wholly for the purposes of a new business carried on by an individual or new ordinary shares issued on or after 1 January 2014 in a qualifying company in which the shareholder is a full-time working director. The assets must have been acquired at a cost of not less than &euro;10,000. In the case of investment through a company, each shareholder must own not less than 15% of the shares in the qualifying company carrying on the new business (or in a holding company which owns 100% of the ordinary share capital of a qualifying company carrying on a new business) and must be a full-time working director in the qualifying company. Assets held as passive investments do not qualify for the relief.<\/p><p>If the proceeds of a disposal of chargeable business assets are in turn reinvested in another new business, CGT relief can be claimed on the same basis as outlined above. At the time of its introduction, the CGT entrepreneur relief was estimated to cost &euro;20m in a full year.<\/p><p>I have no plans to introduce full exemptions on the lines of those referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900058#WRE03800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900058#WRE03850"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[19267\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900058#WRE03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has explored applying a relief similar to the United Kingdom&rsquo;s entrepreneurs' relief; the cost of implementing same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department carried out a review of the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) and Seed Capital Scheme (SCS) in advance of the\u00a0recent Budget.

In 2011, the High Court ruled that certain provision of the Industrial Relations Acts of 1946 and 1990 governing the making of Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) were unconstitutional. The experienced adult rate of pay provided for the Agriculture ERO at the time of the High Court ruling was &euro;9.10 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  The effect of the ruling was that National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) could not enforce the minimum pay and conditions of employment prescribed in EROs in force at the time of the High Court decision. <\/p>  <p>  However, existing contractual rights of workers in sectors covered by EROs were unaffected by the ruling. Contractual rights can be altered only by agreement between the parties involved.<\/p>  <p>  New entrants to employment in JLC sectors after the High Court ruling could be employed on a rate of pay agreed between the worker and the employer, subject only to the terms of the National Minimum Wage.<\/p>  <p>  On 1 October 2013, I  published the Report of the Labour Court&rsquo;s Review of the Joint Labour Committee (JLC) system. The Report owes its genesis to Section 41A of Industrial Relations Act 1946 (inserted by Section 11 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012) which provides that reviews of each JLC be carried out by the Labour Court, as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Act, and at least once every 5 years thereafter. The review assisted the Labour Court&rsquo;s  deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to the Minister to this effect.<\/p>  <p>  The Court&rsquo;s recommendation in relation to the Agriculture sector was that the JLC be retained for that sector with reduced scope. <\/p>  <p>  With the exception of the Agriculture JLC, implementation of the recommendations, regarding the scope of the other JLCs were given effect by way of Ministerial Order. As the Agricultural Workers JLC was established under primary legislation, and the scope of the JLC is derived from the definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; in section 1 of the 1976 Industrial Relations Act, any amendment to the scope of the existing JLC will require an amendment to this definition to reflect the Labour Court recommendation. I intend to introduce the necessary amendment to the 1976 Act by way of a Committee Stage amendment to the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015.<\/p>  <p>  It should be borne in mind that the JLC system provides a framework within which employers and employee representatives can come together voluntarily and negotiate terms and conditions of workers in their respective sector. For vulnerable workers, the advantage of JLCs is that they see fair terms and conditions such as wage rates, sick pay etc. agreed and given effect by ERO, while for some employers, the advantage of the JLC system, based as it is on the principle of self-governance, means that they can agree and set minimum pay and conditions, agree on work practices which are custom-made to their industry &ndash; a flexibility which cannot be achieved by primary legislation. Where both parties to a JLC see commonality of purpose and outcome then an agreement may emerge.<\/p>  <p>  This process sits very much within the context of Ireland's voluntarist system of industrial relations.<\/p>  <p>  Making work pay continues to be a cornerstone of this Government&rsquo;s agenda and the setting up of a Low Pay Commission is one of the key commitments in the Statement of Government Priorities agreed in July last year. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission was launched on the 26th February and it is currently operating on an interim non-statutory basis. Legislation to provide for the establishment of the Commission on a statutory basis has been published and I expect that it will be enacted quickly.  <\/p>  <p>  The principal function of the Low Pay Commission will be to annually examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the minimum wage is adjusted incrementally and progressively increased over time, without damage to enterprise or employment.<\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission will also be able to examine any matter generally related to its functions. A work programme will be agreed by Government and presented to the Commission in each February. Nothing relevant will be excluded from its deliberations. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission sought the views of anyone with an interest in the minimum wage as part of a public consultation process.  I understand that submissions are currently being considered and I expect the first report of the Commission by the middle of July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900061#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Retention","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900061#WRH01950"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[19241\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900061#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he has instructed his officials and Enterprise Ireland to provide all necessary support to the workers of Cadbury to save all the jobs now threatened by a proposal to move the jobs to Poland.","asker":"1190","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[19242\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900061#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he and agencies under his aegis have expressed grave concerns to 3G Capital-Berkshire Hathaway, following its takeover of Heinz-Kraft-Mondelez, on proposals to reduce the Mondelez Cadbury workforce.","asker":"1190","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":448,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together. <\/p>  <p>  Immediately after the announcement by the company concerned, I established an inter-agency group to coordinate the response to the proposed job losses. <\/p>  <p>  The group, chaired by Enterprise Ireland, will seek to secure alternative employment for the area affected and ensure that departing workers have access to supports they need from State agencies for retraining, access to social welfare supports, access to advice on employment rights and access to advice and support for those workers who intend to start their own businesses.

The manufacturing and internationally traded services companies that Enterprise Ireland (EI) works with are a vital source of employment in every county in Ireland and are spread across a wide range of sectors.<\/p>  <p>  In January, EI reported that its client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014, and when job losses in these companies are taken into account, they created 8,476 net new jobs - the highest net gain in the history of the Agency.  EI supported companies now directly provide employment for 180,072 people, comprising 156,202 full-time and 23,870 part-time workers.<\/p>  <p>  EI uses a developmental approach across all aspects of clients&rsquo; needs, including business development, sales and marketing capabilities, innovation and R&amp;D activity, technology development, continuous competitiveness and lean improvements, leadership and management development, and access to finance. <\/p>  <p>  Recognising the diversity of the EI client base, its supports are tailored to reflect each company&rsquo;s stage of development.  This ensures that all of its new and existing clients, from Entrepreneurs and Start-Ups, to exporting SMEs and scaling companies, can access the appropriate supports to help them to create and sustain jobs. <\/p>  <p>  EI works very closely with its client companies, seeking to proactively address development challenges or to engage before serious financial or other difficulties arise. <\/p>  <p>  EI engages closely with those client companies reporting difficulties or potential job loses to determine the appropriate action and proactive measures that can be put in place. <\/p>  <p>  Since the onset of the economic crisis, EI has invested in thousands of client companies with the objective of sustaining and growing their employment. In addition, EI works in close concert with partner development Agencies to respond to incidences with larger companies where a significant number of jobs are at risk.  The objective in these circumstances is to identify all opportunities to maximise the number of jobs maintained, for example, through support for spin-out start-ups, Management Buy Outs, or commercial partnering.  Taskforces comprising relevant personnel from the Development Agencies and other key stakeholders are used in these cases.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important that in the event that a company in serious financial difficulty downsizes or closes, a range of interventions in other government policy areas can be brought to bear e.g. Redundancy Payments Scheme, Labour Activation\/Training etc. which seek to ameliorate the impact of job losses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900062#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900062#WRJ00575"},{"type":"question","counter":484,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[19668\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900062#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to introduce a grant system, through the local enterprise offices, for small and medium sized companies affected by IS EN 1090, in order to offset the costs of achieving CE marking of steel certification to a European standard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Since July 2014 structural steelwork and aluminium now fall under the CPR and therefore must carry CE marking to demonstrate that they comply with the European Commission&rsquo;s harmonised standard EN 1090-1:2009 which relates to the Execution of Steel Structures and Aluminium Structures. <\/p><p>Under EN standard 1090, there are requirements for conformity assessment of structural components, which requires certification by a third party, known as a 'notified inspection body'.  In Ireland, the certification role is performed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).<\/p><p>In view of the NSAI&rsquo;s final certification role, and given the roles and responsibilities of other Departments and agencies, my Department has discussed the requirements of the CPR with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DCELG), the Department of Education and Skills, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEO&rsquo;s) network and the NSAI. <\/p><p>Any difficulty facing the small business sector is of course a concern.  While there is no direct funding available from this Department for companies to upskill or update their processes in order to meet the CE marking requirements, there is information and guidance available through the DCELG website, the LEO&rsquo;s and the NSAI. <\/p><p>With regard to the role of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in providing training support for companies affected by the CPR, the LEOs were established as a first-stop-shop for the provision of advice and supports to the micro and small enterprise sector. <\/p><p>Five information workshops about the requirements under the CPR have been hosted over recent months by the LEO&rsquo;s in conjunction with the NSAI at various locations throughout the country.  Steel fabricator companies affected by the CPR requirements were advised that they could explore training provision with SOLAS, Education and Training Boards (ETB) or Institutes of Technology (IT) for welding courses, and ultimately, CE marking certification which can be organised through the NSAI for companies who have successfully implemented the requirements of the CPR.<\/p><p>The provision of the specialist technical training required to achieve certification to an International or European Standard, such as that required by steel fabricators in this instance, is outside of the remit of the LEO services.  However, I understand that the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) in Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Shannon, Tralee and Waterford provide metal fabrication apprenticeship training, which incorporates elements of certification training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900062#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership","counter":486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900062#WRJ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[19669\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900062#WRJ00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he has availed of the opportunity to access the confidential reading rooms in the US Embassy in Dublin, in order to assess the content of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership; if so, if he has had the opportunity to read US input papers and draft partnership chapters, consolidated texts, in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Under EU Regulations governing the distribution of funding under the National Reserve, priority must be given to young farmers who commenced farming in the past 5 years and new entrants to farming who commenced in the last 2 years.  Given the number of applications received under these two priority categories, it is not envisaged that there will be available resources to cater for this large additional group of farmers who commenced their farming activity prior to 2008.   <\/p>  <p>  Many of the farmers in this group will benefit from an increase in the value of their entitlements under the convergence process between 2015 and 2019.  Farmers who hold entitlements that have an Initial Unit Value that is below 90% of the Basic Payment Scheme national average will see the value of their entitlements increase gradually over the five years of the scheme.  By 2019, all entitlements for all farmers in Ireland will be at least 60% of the National Average value.   <\/p>  <p>With regard to access under Pillar 2 to the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for young farmers who established their holdings prior to 2008, I intend to prioritise their applications under TAMS, with grant-aid payable at 40%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900063#WRK04000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Labelling","counter":577,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900063#WRK04100"},{"type":"question","counter":578,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[19622\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900063#WRK04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the current status of plans for an all-island animal health regime, and single country of origin food label; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":579,"content":"<p>I have been a strong proponent of origin labelling as a means of providing consumers with clear and transparent information about the food they consume, including as regards the origin of that food.  The rules on origin labelling are determined at EU level and I recently signed into law an SI to give effect to the new European Regulations for country of origin labelling of meat from sheep, pigs, poultry and goats.  These mandatory rules require a label to state the Member State where the animal was reared and slaughtered.  They do not operate on a regional, multi member state or all-island basis. <\/p>  <p>  The requirement at EU level applies only to pre-packaged meat.  However, I believe this information should also be made available to consumers purchasing meat sold loose through butcher shops and deli counters.  As a result, I have asked my officials to work with the Department of Health to extend these rules to &ldquo;loose meat&rdquo; and work is progressing well in bringing this to fruition. <\/p>  <p>  With regards to Northern Ireland, I have been in regular contact with my counterpart Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill on labelling issues that affect both jurisdictions on the island.  There is also considerable engagement at official level and, only last week, my Department met with officials from DARD Northern Ireland to discuss the practical implementation of the new country of origin labelling requirements, including any impact which these may be having on the trade in lambs from Northern Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, these issues are a function of the market and are driven by customer specification.  This is borne out by the fact that live export of beef animals to the North is nearly 50% higher than it was at this time last year and this has been achieved without any change to the beef labelling rules.  This shows that a true picture of the market forces impacting on the market takes time to become apparent and the situation for lamb this year is no different, particularly since the new rules have only been introduced from 1 April. <\/p>  <p>  Of course, it is important that we continue to monitor the impact of labelling rules carefully.  I will continue to work to ensure that mandatory labelling laws provide clear and transparent information to consumers, are practicable, and do not negatively impact on Ireland&rsquo;s agri food exports.   <\/p>  <p>  As regards an all-island animal health regime, there is already a substantial degree of harmonisation of the veterinary regimes on the island of Ireland, particularly in view of the fact that the bulk of the animal health and welfare measures implemented on the island are based on EU legislation.  However, the incidence of cattle disease is not uniform on the island, particularly in the case of Bovine TB and Brucellosis, resulting in different eradication programmes on both sides of the Border.  This aside, there is ongoing good co-operation between the veterinary services North and South in the context of delivery of the All-Island Animal Health and Welfare Strategy Action Plan under the North\/South Ministerial arrangements.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900063#WRK04300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Herd Numbers","counter":580,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900063#WRK04400"},{"type":"question","counter":581,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[19631\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900063#WRK04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Roscommon will receive a herd number; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":582,"content":"<p>An application for a herdnumber from the person concerned is currently being processed by the Regional Veterinary Office of my Department.

While there are many elements in this proposal that are welcomed, every Member State, without exception, had issues of concern.  The main elements of the proposal are as follows:<\/p><p>-Introduction of a risk-based control regime and the proposal to remove the requirement for the annual inspection by the Organic Control Bodies.<\/p><p>-Harmonisation of residue sampling, analysis and action thereby establishing a minimum threshold for pesticide residues above which the product cannot be sold as organic.<\/p><p><b>-<\/b>The removal of the current flexibility where a farm can, under very specific conditions of separation, produce both<b><\/b>organic and non organic products on the same holding.<\/p><p><b>-<\/b>Severe restriction in the reduction of the conversion period.<\/p><p>While, in principle, Ireland is supportive of many aspects of the text we feel that the proposal overall is too ambitious and does not sufficiently reflect the varying stages of development of the organic sector at individual Member State level.  The proposal, as formulated, could curtail the development of the sector in Ireland and may act as an impediment to farmers wishing to convert to organic production.<\/p><p>Organic farming makes a significant positive contribution to the overall agri-sector in Ireland both from an environmental and economic perspective.  Organic farming involves farming in an environmentally friendly and sustainable fashion within a closed system with very restrictive lists of permitted inputs which include the non-use of soluble fertilizers (synthetic fertilizers) and pesticides. <\/p><p>Bord Bia research has shown that there is a market demand for Irish organic beef, lamb, fruit, vegetables and cereals and currently the sector is contributing over &euro;100 million to the Irish economy.  However, a significant percentage of the Irish organic food market is comprised of imports.  The organic sector therefore offers real opportunities for Irish farmers and food processors in the form of import substitution in areas where Ireland is under-producing at present, and the large export markets such as the UK and Germany. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900063#WRK05500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Data Programme","counter":592,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900063#WRK05600"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[19689\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900063#WRK05700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will address concerns relating to the mandatory six contract requirement which is part of the new beef data and genomics programme; his views on concerns surrounding the complexity of the programme; the efforts his Department is making to effectively communicate the benefits of it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":594,"content":"<p>The Government has made a provision of &euro;52m for the BDGP in 2015.

The BDGP will accelerate improvement in the crucial area of environmental sustainability in the national herd through the application of genomic technology and will bring about long-term strategic improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  It will also position Ireland as a global leader in the application of genomics technology and confirm our reputation as one of the most important and renowned export focussed beef producing nations in the world.<\/p><p>Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 per hectare for the first 6.66 payable hectares under the scheme, and &euro;120 per payable hectare after that.  Payment to scheme participants is on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone for each of the actions undertaken.  All of the costs to the farmer, including in terms of time and effort, have been factored into the payment for the farmer as agreed with the European Commission.

This multi-annual approach is required for all EU funded agri-environmental schemes and, in any event, should facilitate long term planning on individual farms.

The key focus of the plan is on preventing loss of life. The 10-point action plan was considered by the Heads of States and Government at a Special European Council meeting on 23rd April. At the meeting of the Council, the Heads of State and Government committed to a comprehensive range of commitments, including at least tripling financial resources for Operations Triton and Poseidon, thereby enabling an increase in the search and rescue possibilities within the mandate of FRONTEX. EU leaders also committed to actions to prevent illegal migration flows, to reinforce internal EU solidarity and responsibility in relation to the processing of asylum applications and relocation of migrants, and to combat traffickers in accordance with international law. In addition, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was invited to start preparations for a possible CSDP operation.<\/p>  <p>  Following the announcement made by An Taoiseach at the meeting on the 23rd April, and Government approval and agreement with the Italian authorities last week, the L.E. EITHNE, with a crew of sixty-eight (68) personnel of the Permanent Defence Forces, departed the Naval Base in Haulbowline on Saturday, 16th   May 2015, to assist the Italian authorities in humanitarian search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean.  The despatch of an Irish naval vessel represents a tangible and valuable Irish national contribution to assisting the Italian authorities in the humanitarian search and rescue operation and highlights our commitment to assist with efforts to prevent further tragedy and loss of life at sea. <\/p>  <p>At the formal Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council with Ministers of Defence in Brussels on 18th May, a Council Decision to establish a European Union military operation, EUNAVFOR Med, in the South Central Mediterranean was adopted.\u00a0The Mission&rsquo;s mandate will be implemented in sequential phases. The first phase of the operation will support the detection and monitoring of migration networks through information gathering and patrolling in accordance with international law. A second phase, involving the targeting, seizure and possible destruction of the vessels and assets of human traffickers will only begin once appropriate UN Security Council authorisation is in place. The third phase is an operational\/disruption phase, and the fourth and final phase is a mission withdrawal and completion phase. <\/p>  <p>  While we are focused on the search and rescue mission, on the basis that the first phase of the CSDP operation will be carried out in full accordance with international law, Ireland has supported this aspect of the operation. In relation to further phases of the CSDP operation, we believe that many elements of the proposed action will require a UN Security Council Resolution. The Permanent Defence Forces will not be participating in the mission in the absence of such a resolution.   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports the actions of the Union to address the major challenge of migration in the Mediterranean.

The review concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation resource base would best meet public demand.  <\/p><p>The Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme provides for effectiveness and efficiencies through a programme of restructuring and reconfiguration of the service delivery methods, concomitant with changes to work practices within the new rostering arrangements already introduced. In addition, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the closure of these Garda Stations has resulted in an additional 61,000 patrolling hours being made available to the communities right across the country. <\/p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that table A below shows the breakdown of station closures for 2012 and 2013 per County. <\/p><p><b>Table A.<\/b><table><tr><th><b><font

However, the consensus both from the emergency joint meeting of EU Foreign and Interior Affairs Ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, 20 April 2015, attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and myself and the special European Council in Brussels on Thursday, 23 April 2015, attended by the Taoiseach, was that the EU and its Member States needed to take urgent action on a broad front, even if there is disagreement on certain individual elements of the solution.<\/p>  <p>  The Council Conclusions agreed on 23 April 2015 set out broad priorities which focused on strengthening Europe&rsquo;s presence at sea, fighting traffickers in accordance with international law, preventing illegal migration flows and reinforcing internal solidarity and responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the European Commission published the European Agenda on Migration (EAM) which has been adapted to reflect the current situation and the need for urgent action.  The EAM outlines the immediate measures agreed in response to the situation in the Mediterranean as well as the longer term measures necessary to re-balance all aspects of Europe's approach to migration.  Included among the measures is funding for Regional Development and Protection Programmes for North Africa and the Horn of Africa.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of immediate actions the two main proposals relate to resettlement and relocation.  The Commission indicated that they will be recommending an EU resettlement scheme by the end of May for 20,000 places. This number will be distributed among Member States in accordance with several clearly defined criteria (Ireland&rsquo;s proposed share will be 1.36% or 272 persons).  Participation would be voluntary, given that there are no existing powers under EU law to compel Member States to participate, but; depending on the approach adopted by Member States the Commission may bring forward binding and mandatory legislative proposals to cover the period beyond 2016. <\/p>  <p>  In line with our regular commitment on resettlement, Ireland had already agreed to resettle 220 refugees over the next two years.  However, the Taoiseach had indicated at the special European Council in April 2015 that we would re-examine this commitment in view of the deteriorating situation in the Mediterranean.  Rather than waiting until the proposals announced in the European Agenda on Migration to be discussed formally by Home Affairs Ministers in June 2015, last Wednesday (13 May 2015), I announced that the Government had agreed in principle to resettle an additional 300 vulnerable people as our contribution to this important European initiative.  This brings our total commitment on resettlement to the end of 2016 to five hundred and twenty (520) people, or nearly twice the quota of two hundred and seventy two (272) proposed by the Commission for Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  This is in addition to support under the Syria Humanitarian Assistance Programme (SHAP) which grants temporary permission, of up to two years duration, to vulnerable close family members of either naturalised Irish citizens of Syrian birth or Syrian nationals already lawfully residing in the State.  By the end of 2014 one hundred and fourteen (114) such family members had been granted permission under this scheme.  In addition, Syrian nationals legally resident in Ireland, for example, students or persons on work permission's may apply for an extension of their permission to remain in the State while the crisis situation continues. <\/p>  <p>  Relocation is a complicated issue and there are different perspectives among Member States.  To deal with the situation in the Mediterranean the Commission is now proposing to trigger the emergency response mechanism under Article 78.3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU via a proposal to be published by the end of May 2015.  This proposal will include a distribution mechanism for persons in clear need of international protection.  Such persons would have their asylum claim considered in the receiving Member State.  Until we see the details of what the Commission is proposing it would be premature to comment further at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900065#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reserve","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900065#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[19544\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900065#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on whether members of the Garda Reserve should receive some preferential treatment, if and when they decide to apply to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, considering the level of service they would have already given to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the experience they would have obtained in doing so; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1082","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":683,"content":"<p>I wish to put on record my appreciation for the contribution that those who volunteer for service as Garda Reserve members make on a daily basis to the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has a dualist legal system and therefore does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary. We are determined to take the steps necessary to meet all the convention's requirements in a constructive, proactive and appropriate manner. I should stress that for Ireland, ratification is the end of the preparation and implementation phase, not the beginning. <\/p>  <p>  A team within my Department has been charged with examining all outstanding obstacles to ratification, and has nearly completed the first phase of its work, which includes identifying all areas which will need attention to make ratification possible. An Interdepartmental Committee is in place to review issues and the actions and timeframe required to tackle them. Many of these issues involve amending unsuitable and outmoded language and in some cases, archaic legal provisions, in existing legislation. Another key task which is underway involves examining how the important issue of Reasonable Accommodation can be achieved in a meaningful way within our Constitutional framework as interpreted by the Supreme Court.<\/p>  <p>  Progress towards ratification therefore continues to be made and much has been accomplished. One of the core obstacles to Ireland's ratification of the Convention is the requirement for enactment of capacity legislation.

The Deputy may be aware that there is a political commitment among EU Member States against any form of process that would grant residence status to persons present in the State without first examining the merits of their individual cases. Broad regularisation programmes are problematic, in particular as they could give rise to unpredictable and very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously acknowledged however that the length of time that many applicants spend in the protection process is a matter that needs to be addressed particularly in light of the sharp increase in asylum application volumes in 2014 and so far in 2015. The Deputy may be aware that an Independent Working Group was set up in October 2014 to recommend to Government what improvements should be made to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers. One of the tasks of the Working Group is to identify improvements to existing arrangements for the processing of protection applications taking account of the Government's intention to legislate for a single application procedure.<\/p>  <p>  The Group began its work in November last under the Chairmanship of retired High Court Judge, Bryan McMahon and its membership is drawn from a range of interests in the international protection area including UNHCR, non-governmental organisations, protection applicants, academia, and relevant Government Departments and Offices. I understand that the Working Group's report to Government will be finalised in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  I have also committed to introducing legislative change in the Protection area to provide for a single application procedure with a view to reducing the length of time applicants spend in the protection process. On 25 March 2015 I published the General Scheme of the International Protection Bill, which has been approved by Government.  This is the first step in delivering the Government's undertaking in the Statement of Priorities 2014-2016 to legislate to reduce the length of time protection applicants spend in the system.  My objective is to reform the current multi-layered and sequential system which can result in applicants being accommodated in the State's system of Direct Provision for indeterminate periods of time. The single procedure will identify at a much earlier stage those who are in need of international protection and should be granted status and those with no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Government decision I have forwarded the General Scheme of the Bill to the Attorney General for the detailed drafting of the legislation which, subject to the approval of the Government at a future time, will be presented to the Oireachtas for enactment into law.

As the Deputy may be aware, neither the provision of social protection supports or mental health services are within my remit.<\/p>  <p>  On a more general point, I would note that an aftercare programme is based on an aftercare plan for a child who has been in care and is about to turn 18 years old.  Based on an assessed need, an aftercare worker can make arrangements for various supports, including support for accommodation, and accessing training and education.  Aftercare workers are provided both by Tusla as well as through services that are commissioned from community, voluntary and private organisations.  The aftercare worker support provided by Focus Ireland, similar to one which you may have seen in the recent television documentary, is an example of such a service.  Funding is also made available to support a person who is to remain on with their foster family as part of their aftercare plan.  In other cases, funding supports are available to facilitate independent living or supported lodgings.  Further, where a jobseeker has been in care during the 12 months prior to reaching 18 years of age then they are exempt from the reduced rates for jobseeker's allowance that would otherwise apply.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.  There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015.  This was an important priority for the voluntary youth organisations that have a key role in the provision of quality youth work services for young people. <\/p><p>Three of the targeted funding schemes, the Special Projects for Youth scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, and Local Drug Task Force projects scheme, were the subject of a recently completed <i>Value for Money and Policy Review.<\/i>The schemes support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities.  In 2012, expenditure on the schemes amounted to &euro;39.7m.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people's lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people, and should be considered for on-going public funding. <\/p><p>The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.  It recommends that the three schemes be replaced with a single, targeted, evidence-based and outcomes focussed scheme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people and their communities.  It sets out guidance as to how services may be developed to better meet the needs of young people in the target cohort and how demographic information and CSO data about local areas should be part of the programme design.  The key role of volunteers and volunteerism is both acknowledged by the report to date and considered a key element of the new programme, going forward.  The review does not include a recommendation that the funding programme should be operated on the basis of a competitive tendering process.  Instead, it recommends that the governance of the programme should be reformed with a greater role for the network of local youth officers throughout the county, employed by the Education and Training Boards, supporting the development of local youth services.<\/p><p>My Department has undertaken a detailed consultation process with the youth sector and providers of youth services, including volunteers, about the review's findings and recommendations.  The consultation included regional meetings across the country. All local services were invited to participate.  My Department is committed to working collaboratively with the voluntary youth sector, in the development and implementation of the new programme over the next two years.  Support for volunteers engaged in the provision of youth services is a priority for my Department in this context.  Supports in place include training and awareness programmes in child protection matters through the National Youth Council of Ireland, and support programmes for both staff and volunteer led youth services in implementing the quality standards initiatives in local youth services.  I intend that the reforms recommended in the review will be progressed in the context of the new National Youth Strategy, which is nearing completion.  The strategy will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years.  It will have a particular focus on the needs of young people who are at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes.  It is anticipated that the new National Youth Strategy will be finalised in early Summer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900066#WRN03600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inter-Country Adoptions","counter":755,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900066#WRN03700"},{"type":"question","counter":756,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[19709\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900066#WRN03800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the process for reassessment of applicants for the purposes of inter-country adoption whose declaration of eligibility and suitability has expired; if he will provide an outline of the timeframe, from application to completion, of this reassessment process; and if he will indicate whether priority is provided to applicants for reassessment as opposed to first-time applicants.","asker":"1103","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":757,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter under the remit of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, I have asked the Agency to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900066#WRN03900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":759,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[19710\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900066#WRN04100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of declarations of eligibility and suitability for the purposes of inter-country adoption that have been issued since the passing of the Adoption Act 2010; the number of these applicants who have completed an adoption; the number who have had to do a reassessment due to their declaration expiring; and the number who have discontinued in the process or failed to renew their declaration of eligibility and suitability.","asker":"1103","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":760,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter under the remit of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, I have asked the Authority to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900066#WRN04200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Poverty","counter":761,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900066#WRN04300"},{"type":"question","counter":762,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[19734\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900066#WRN04400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he is aware of a report (details supplied); the action he plans to take as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"978","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":763,"content":"<p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020 (BOBF),<\/i>which was published and launched by Government in 2014, provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people.<\/p><p>The relevant issues identified in the report referred to by the TD, are addressed within this National Policy Framework.<\/p><p>As part of the implementation of Better Outcomes, Better Futures, government departments have identified child poverty as a whole of government priority action for 2015.

A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes.  In addition in early 2015, I established an Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education.  The work of the group is focused on identifying policy objectives to guide future investment, including:<\/p><p>-  Improved outcomes for children, including those with special needs, in terms of their learning, wellbeing and development by ensuring access to high quality early years services.<\/p><p>-  Support for parents to care for their children<\/p><p>-  Contribution towards improvements in social inclusion and poverty reduction<\/p><p>-  Support for parents' participation in education, training and employment<\/p><p>My Department is also leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.  Currently 13 areas have identified and communicated the implementation of a number of specific interventions for children and families based on identified need in the local area.<\/p><p>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects.

In 2015, current funding of &euro;49.93m will be provided to my Department for these schemes.<\/p><p>Tusla, the child and family agency is also responsible for the delivery of educational welfare services and I am advised by Tusla that the statutory Educational Welfare Services worked with over 20,000 children in 2013. Some 2,434 cases involved intensive intervention and a multidisciplinary approach and the provision of sustained support by an Education Welfare Officer to address the child's needs and support school attendance.  During this period the School Completion Programme provided targeted support to approximately 36,000 children and young people at risk of early school leaving across 124 community based programmes.<\/p><p>Tusla also provides a range of services that offer advice and support to families.

It should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of doctors with expertise in using the product and with a full understanding of the risk of therapy and the monitoring requirements.<\/p>  <p>  When first authorised for use in Ireland in 1983, roaccutane was authorised for the management of cystic or conglobate forms of acne vulgaris, or for use in cases of severe acne which have failed to respond to adequate courses of accepted therapy.<\/p>  <p>  Under European and Irish legislation, all medicinal products must be authorised before being marketed.  As part of the marketing authorisation application process the applicant company must submit evidence that the medicine meets clear and predefined standards of quality, safety and efficacy, relevant to its proposed therapeutic use.  This information is provided in a dossier and the type of data to be submitted is set out in EU Directives and guidelines.  Relevant Irish Regulations set out the requirements for companies and the procedure for the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in assessing applications.<\/p>  <p>  Following assessment by the HPRA approval is given on the basis of a favourable benefit versus risk balance for the approved specific therapeutic indication.  The approved conditions for use are contained in the product information for patients and their doctors.<\/p>  <p>  Following authorisation, any change, for example new indications, updated safety information or product changes requires approval on foot of a formal application to vary the authorisation and the submission of relevant supporting data.  <\/p>  <p>  Once a medicine is approved and placed on the market, European and Irish legislation provides for ongoing monitoring of its benefits and risks.  This monitoring includes review and evaluation of suspected adverse reaction reports at National and EU level.  Roaccutane was most recently reviewed at EU level in April 2011 when further warnings regarding skin reactions were added to the product information for patients and their doctors.  The risk of depression associated with the use of roaccutane was also reviewed at that time.  However the existing comprehensive information on the risk of depression associated with roaccutane and the monitoring requirements provided on the product information were considered sufficient.  The inclusion of these, and other side effects and warnings, in the product information are on the basis of information on use of the product including reports of side effects from patients.<\/p>  <p>  The information for patients and for their doctors includes detailed advice on the risks associated with use of roaccutane and recommendations to minimise their occurrence.  The package leaflet advises patients to tell their doctor if they ever had any mental illness (including depression, suicidal behaviour or psychosis), or if they take medicines for any of these conditions.  It also advises them to contact their doctor immediately if they have signs of any of these problems.<\/p>  <p>  The information for doctors lists potential psychiatric disorders.  It emphasises that particular care needs to be taken in relation to patients with a history of depression and that all patients should be monitored for signs of depression during their treatment with the product and referred for appropriate treatment as necessary.  The benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh its risks when the product is used in accordance with the product information.  <\/p>  <p>  Monitoring of benefits and risks of medicines takes place through a system known as pharmacovigilance.  The EU passed new legislation in 2010 and 2012 to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system and this legislation has been fully transposed into Irish legislation.  One of the goals of the new legislation is to provide access to more information related to the benefit-risk aspects of taking a medication as well as providing opportunity for patients and consumers to directly report suspected problems.<\/p>  <p>  The national regulatory medicines authorities (in Ireland the HPRA) in each EU member state are responsible for gathering and evaluating national adverse reaction reports and in turn, submitting these reports to the European Medicines Agency, which is responsible for the overall co-ordination of pharmacovigilance activities across the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Reporting of adverse events has been a function of the HPRA since its establishment as the Irish Medicines Board in 1995 and prior to 1995 by the National Drugs Advisory Board.<\/p>  <p>  Reporting of suspected adverse reactions by health professionals is undertaken on a voluntary basis with all health professionals strongly encouraged to report a suspected adverse reaction. These reports may be submitted at any time to the HPRA.  The HPRA regularly reminds health care professionals about reporting in its Drug Safety Newsletter and further information on reporting and access to reporting forms is available on the HPRA website.<\/p>  <p>  Reporting of suspected adverse reactions however is only one of a number of ways of identifying new adverse reactions. Individual reports of suspected adverse reactions alone are rarely sufficient to confirm that a certain reaction is caused by the medicine in question.  Other factors such as the extent and conditions of use of the medicine, the nature of the reaction, the condition being treated, any new conditions arising and other medicines taken by the patient have to be taken into account.  Further data is usually required, including worldwide spontaneous case reports, clinical trials and epidemiological studies, to confirm the reactions and help determine their significance.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Irish Medicines Board&rsquo;s Acts 1995 and 2006, members of the HPRA are appointed by the Minister for Health.  In the case of 1 position, i.e. the chairperson of the HPRA&rsquo;s Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines, the appointment is subject to the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2011 this Government introduced new arrangements for appointments to State Boards which have contributed to greater openness and transparency in the appointments process.  Further reforms were announced by the Government in November 2014 whereby all appointments will be advertised openly on the State Boards portal operated by the Public Appointments Service (PAS), meet specific criteria necessary for the effective performance of the role and be processed in a transparent manner.<\/p>  <p>  Each member of the HPRA Authority brings to the HPRA essential expertise in areas such as human and veterinary  medicines, pharmacy, medical devices and  finance.  The members  are highly qualified and well respected professionals in their field and political affiliation is not a consideration.  I would also like to refer the Deputy to the detailed and extensive provisions in place governing ethics in public office, conflicts of interest and codes of conduct which govern the activities of all appointees to State Boards, including the HPRA.<\/p>  <p>  Since its foundation in 1995 the HPRA has played a key role in ensuring that health products used by Irish patients are safe.  I am satisfied that the HPRA operates to the highest standards of probity, accountability and transparency in its dealings with pharmaceutical companies, health professionals and patients alike.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900067#WRO01200","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"question","counter":794,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[19167\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900067#WRO01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the exact pattern of adverse effects for Roaccutane; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":795,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[19177\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900067#WRO01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in view of the fact that the Health Products Regulatory Authority has 289 adverse drug reaction reports, in association with Roaccutane since 1983, if he will identify these individually, by gender, year, and age; if he will provide a chronological list of these reports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":796,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[19179\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900067#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of adverse drug reports that a pharmaceutical company (details supplied) submitted to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, in association with Roaccutane, since 1983; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":797,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280, 283 and 285 together.<\/p><p>The information requested is not readily available and will be forwarded directly to the Deputy by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900067#WRO01700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":798,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900067#WRO01800"},{"type":"question","counter":799,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[19170\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900067#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application for a Medical Card in respect of a child (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":800,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

In that context, the Government introduced the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, which provides for the charging of all private in-patients in public acute hospitals.  The Government believes that the charge for private care in public hospitals should cover the hospitals' costs of providing the service, including the non-consultant hospital doctors, nursing staff, medical and surgical supplies, diagnostics, operating theatres, administration and support staff.<\/p>  <p>  Section 55 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, provides for the making available of private in-patient services and the charging for those private in-patient services.  The charge relates to the provision of in-patient services, rather than the use of a bed in a hospital. Persons who opt to be treated on a private basis on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care.  The charge is a per diem rate, which is a flat rate daily charge, dependent on the category of hospital treating the patient and on whether a person is accommodated in a single or multiple occupancy room or on a day case basis.  The per diem charges set out in the 2013 legislation were informed by overall cost of the provision of the private in-patient services and the policy of moving towards the recovery of full economic cost.  While a per diem charging system has the advantage of being relatively straightforward for the hospital, patient and insurer to understand, it does not directly relate to the cost of specific treatments provided to individual private patients, the level of complexity of a case or the costs of individual hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's questions concerning tax breaks for private hospitals and a land gift scheme, these are matters for the Department of Finance and should be referred to that Department for reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900068#WRP04900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Consultants Remuneration","counter":881,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900068#WRP05000"},{"type":"question","counter":882,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[19430\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900068#WRP05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the various current level of salaries of hospital consultants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":883,"content":"<p>There are a broad range of consultant salaries depending on type of contract held.

Currently, three ambulances during the day and two at night provide emergency cover in Roscommon town.  In addition, a rapid response vehicle, crewed by an advanced paramedic, provides cover on a 24\/7 basis.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the model of ambulance service delivery is changing. The service is moving away from the model of care where services are provided to a local area from a fixed ambulance base located in that area, and moving to a model of strategic deployment.  In this context, the general area of Roscommon can be supported from the north by services from Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon, to the east by crews in Longford and Mullingar and to the south from Athlone. Services are now coming on stream at Tuam and Mulranny stations which will enhance coverage across the region of north Galway, west Roscommon and east Mayo.<\/p>  <p>  Refurbishment of the former Garda station at Loughglynn is now completed and discussions are under way in relation to the staffing of this facility. The Loughglynn station will allow for strategic placement of emergency ambulance resources during shifts, to ensure coverage across the region as required.<\/p>  <p>  The Emergency Aeromedical Service (EAS), operated from Athlone by the Air Corps and staffed by NAS advanced paramedics, is also providing support to the people of the western region. The EAS provides swift transfers of seriously ill or injured patients to appropriate hospitals. Almost 1,000 missions have been completed since June 2012.  Roscommon and Mayo are the two counties which have benefited most from the availability of the EAS.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that I intend to drive further improvements to the ambulance service.

Reporting on these rates has been hampered by different definitions of stillbirth both nationally and internationally. In Ireland, four difference agencies are involved in the compilation and reporting of perinatal mortality data.  The analysis presented in the <i>Report of the Chief Medical Officer into Perinatal Deaths in Portlaoise Hospital (February 2014) <\/i>showed that there are weaknesses and inconsistencies in perinatal data collection, collation and reporting.<\/p><p>Perinatal death is a rare event in Ireland.  Given the small numbers involved the use of perinatal mortality rates by hospital as an indicator of patient safety creates a risk of false reassurance and also can raise false alerts.  It is, therefore, important to look at these in conjunction with, for example, confidence intervals per hospital and other methods in order to distinguish between the stability of estimates based on small versus large numbers. Therefore, caution needs to be exercised in the interpretation of perinatal data by hospital for the reasons set out.<\/p><p>A number of actions are being taken to address these discrepancies as follows:<\/p><p>- The notification of stillbirths is a mandatory requirement in the Civil Registration Act (2004).  This Act was amended in 2014 to make notification of early neonatal deaths mandatory.  The General Registration Office is working on the commencement of this.<\/p><p>- In addition the HSE has agreed to progress agreement of definitions and reporting of perinatal statistics in Ireland.  This would include systems such as the National  Perinatal Reporting System and the National  Perinatal Epidemiological Centre.<\/p><p>It should be noted, however, that national statistics on perinatal events are very important in benchmarking with other countries.  Irish national  perinatal data compare favourably with other OECD Member States which provides a level of reassurance on the quality of maternity services in Ireland. <\/p><p>National perinatal mortality data in respect of 2014 are still being collated and validated and it is not clear at this stage when these data will be ready for publication.<\/p><p>Patient Safety oversight in hospitals must take into account broader activity trends which can provide early warning of safety risks and early identification of safety issues. The Chief Medical Officer's Report identified the need to develop a more accurate and timely alert system.  The Chief Medical Officer recommended that all maternity hospitals should develop a <i>Patient Safety Statement <\/i>which would be published and updated monthly and would be used with other available information to risk-rate services and to target quality improvement measures that enhance local ownership and capability. Ideally a<i>Patient Safety Statement <\/i>should be presented and discussed at the senior management team meetings every month, as a standing agenda item.  <\/p><p>This should set out trends in relation to activity, interventions, complaints, adverse incidents, serious incidents, transfers, staffing and any other appropriate information from the perspective of patient safety and quality. This should be part of an on-going quality improvement  cycle. The Health Service Executive is progressing the CMO's recommendation. <\/p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that work in on-going to improve the data sources and the quality and safety of maternity units nationally. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900071#WRS03200","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":1035,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900071#WRS03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1036,"qnumday":369,"qnumall":"[19682\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900071#WRS03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Dublin will be admitted to Saint James's Hospital in Dublin 8 for a hernia repair; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1037,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Following publication of the two reports, in November 2014, the Minister for Health and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, especially where serious illness is involved. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.

Ireland is currently a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council and we pursue our human rights priorities in many international fora.  Ireland is a firm supporter of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights system and liaises regularly with the UK in relation to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers&rsquo; supervision of states&rsquo; implementation of Court judgments.  I should note clearly at the outset there is not at this time any legislation before the British Parliament at Westminster to repeal the 1998 UK Human Rights Act.  Indeed the new British Government has not yet published its legislative programme for this parliamentary term, although it is expected to do so later this month.  In the absence of any detailed proposal it is difficult to speculate on potential consequences. Obviously were any proposal to be made it would have to be carefully analysed.  On the broad question of human rights and the Good Friday Agreement, the views of the Government are clear and unchanged.  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, predicated on the European Convention of Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Agreement.  As a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles.  The fundamental role of human rights in guaranteeing peace and stability in Northern Ireland cannot be taken for granted and must be fully respected.  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is an ongoing obligation.<\/p>  <p>  Placing human rights at the heart of the peace process in Northern Ireland has helped to ensure the participation and trust of all communities.  A shared emphasis on human rights and all that this implies is part of what makes the peace process credible and effective.  The Government will work closely with the UK Government and with the power-sharing Executive in Belfast to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We will follow closely all developments in this regard. I plan to raise this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when I meet her later today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900073#WRU01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":1134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900073#WRU01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1135,"qnumday":403,"qnumall":"[19809\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900073#WRU01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will support the release of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1136,"content":"<p>I am aware of the advocacy work by a number of international NGOs in relation to this difficult case, including by Amnesty International.

Accordingly, my  Department engaged with the chief executives of these 5 non-training centre ETBs and with SOLAS in relation to how these ETBs would deliver on their training remit for 2014 and beyond. As part of its consideration of this issue, the Board agreed that the establishment of new training centres should not form part of these considerations.<\/p>  <p>  Following consultation with the sector,  the ETB\/SOLAS Programme Board has decided that each ETB without a training centre should be allocated staffing and resources to deliver Contracted\/Community Training and manage the Apprenticeship Employers in its area.

It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900074#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900074#WRV02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1214,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[19473\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900074#WRV02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide an update on the need for a sports hall in a school (details supplied) in County Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1215,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department's focus in recent years has been on prioritising the funding available for the provision of essential classroom accommodation to meet demographic need.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, due to the competing demands on my Department's capital budget imposed by the need to prioritise the available funding in this manner, it is not possible at this point to provide an indicative timeframe for the provision of funding towards a PE hall for the school concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900074#WRV02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Site Acquisitions","counter":1216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900074#WRV02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1217,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[19476\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900074#WRV02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"If she will provide a progress report from her Department on the efforts to secure a site of adequate dimensions in Buncrana, County Donegal, to facilitate a three-school campus for schools (details supplied); and if she will allocate the necessary funding for this project to proceed.","asker":"998","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1218,"content":"<p>I can confirm that a joint technical inspection of a number of potential site options for a proposed campus development in Buncrana has recently been conducted by officials from my Department and officials from Donegal County Council.<\/p><p>A technical report is currently being compiled by the professional and technical staff from my Department.

ACELS is a voluntary national scheme responsible for the development and management of the recognition and inspection of English language teaching organisations. It is not a regulatory body, as suggested by the Deputy in a number of his questions. ACELS therefore has no role in preparing regulations for the international education sector or in conducting either a regulatory impact assessment or an economic impact assessment of the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of ACELS is to establish and maintain standards in English language teaching organisations. Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the State agency which operates ACELS, is under the remit of the Ombudsman.<\/p>  <p>  As ACELS is a voluntary scheme, English language providers can operate in Ireland without having ACELS recognition. Equally, ACELS does not close English language providers or stop providers from operating and ACELS recognition is not compulsory for providers wishing to recruit international students. Many of the English language colleges that have closed over the last year have been operating in the State for a number of years without ACELS recognition.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question in relation to the working conditions of teachers, the relationship between teachers and private colleges is based on a private contract so issues such salary and working hours are a matter between the two parties. The regulations governing ACELS recognised schools specify a requirement that all obligations relating to national employment legislation are complied with. If teachers have a concern about their terms and conditions of employment they should contact the National Employment Rights Authority in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Justice and Equality have produced a package of reforms to the student immigration system for international education which will be brought to Government for its approval shortly. These reforms were prepared by the two Departments, rather than by ACELS or QQI.  While it is not possible to provide specific details of the reforms prior to their approval by Government as requested in a number of the Deputy's questions, I wish to inform the Deputy that the reforms are designed to improve the overall quality of offering to international students, improve protection for learners, enhance Ireland's reputation and diminish negative impacts on the Irish labour market and social protection costs, strongly in line with the goals of Ireland's international education strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, there are no plans at present to introduce primary legislation for this sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900074#WRV04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":1239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900075#WRW00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1240,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[19662\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900075#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress of a new school building in respect of a school (details supplied) in County Dublin; the reason there is such a delay in sanctioning the go-ahead for the school to move into the new buidling in view of the fact that the school was advised of this in 2005; if a meeting can be organised between the school management and her Department's schools capital appraisal team; if not, the reason for same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1241,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department remains committed to providing permanent accommodation for the school to which he refers.

The majority of English language schools in Ireland are privately run.  Education providers are subject to unannounced inspection by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the Garda National Immigration Bureau for immigration control purposes.  English language training organisations registered for quality purposes with ACELS (Accreditation and Co-ordination of English Language Services) on a voluntary basis are inspected as part of the ACELS scheme. <\/p><p>  While I have every sympathy for the genuine affected students who lost money when the colleges closed, the relationship between students and private colleges is based on a private contract so there is no obligation on my Department or the State to provide refunds, or to pay for alternative provision.  For that reason, the Task Force which I established jointly with the Minister for Justice and Equality to assist affected students has worked closely with the representative bodies of the high-quality private sector providers to develop solutions that could provide alternative courses at a significantly discounted rate for students impacted by the closures who were not covered by learner protection arrangements.<\/p><p>  I am aware that liquidation proceedings are underway in certain cases, and students are pursuing claims as creditors through this process, including with the support of the Irish Council for International Students.

My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard. The national average ARV decreased each year from 2010 to 2014; 2015 is not directly comparable due to the local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas.<\/p><p>Following the reorganisation of local government structures arising from the Local Government Reform Act 2014 there are now just 31 local authorities that adopt an Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV).

Moving rates downwards as a general policy would result in a very significant loss of income to the local government sector which would negatively affect the provision of services by local government. The challenge was to identify a solution that balanced these conflicting interests.<\/p><p>The local government reform programme requires authorities to harmonise ARVs across former rating authorities within each of the restructured 31 local authorities within a 10 year period, generally.

It reported that rents nationally were 8.2% higher than in the first quarter of 2014, down from the 10.4% annual increase recorded in mid-2014. While the report recorded a slow-down in rent inflation in Dublin, this was offset by an increase in the surrounding counties.  These trends are broadly in line with the most recent data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) whose rent index is based on actual rents paid as opposed to the asking price.  The PRTB data shows that in the fourth quarter of 2014, rents were 5.8% higher nationally than in the same quarter of 2013.  Dublin, however, was seeing the highest rates of increase nationally with rents there higher by 9.6% over the same period although the rate of annual increase was down slightly.<\/p><p>The daft.ie report notes that a shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts.  Construction 2020 A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed. Construction 2020 also commits to identifying and implementing further improvements to the planning system to facilitate appropriate development.  The General Scheme for a Planning and Development (No. 1) Bill aimed primarily at addressing the current housing supply shortage situation was published in November 2014.  The main provisions in this Bill are:<\/p><p>- the revision of the Part V arrangements on social and affordable housing;<\/p><p>- retrospective application of reduced development contribution charges, and<\/p><p>- the introduction of a vacant site levy to incentivise urban regeneration and the provision of housing in central urban areas.<\/p><p>It is estimated that the revised Part V arrangements will contribute in the region of 4,000 housing units to the delivery of the output targets included in the Social Housing Strategy.  The Bill is currently being drafted in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to publication in the coming weeks and enactment before the summer recess.<\/p><p>Addressing the supply shortfall in housing will take time but in the period since the publication of Construction 2020, some welcome signs of recovery in the sector have become evident.  Particularly notable in this regard is the increase in the number of house completions in 2014 to 11,016 units nationally &ndash; an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure.  The latest figures for new house completions show that 2,629 units were completed in the first three months of 2015, up 26% on the corresponding figure for the first quarter 2014.<\/p><p>Social housing is a key priority for the Government, evidenced by the additional &euro;2.2 billion in funding announced for social housing in Budget 2015 and the publication of the Social Housing Strategy 2020 in November 2014.  The total targeted provision under the Social Housing Strategy 2020 of 110,000 social housing units includes the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units through Pillar 1.  The private rental sector, through Pillar 2 of the strategy, will accommodate up to 75,000 eligible low-income households primarily through the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.  Social housing targets have been set for each local authority out to 2017 and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .<\/p><p>The National Economic and Social Council (NESC) report Ireland&rsquo;s Rental Sector: Pathways to Secure Occupancy and Affordable Supply which was published last week, is a welcome and timely contribution to the debate around the rental sector.

Under this Strategy a target of 3,000 units has been set for delivery in 2015 under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP). Within this overall target each individual Local Authority has a target for delivery under this Programme.   <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for each Local Authority to determine the most appropriate mechanism for reaching their target under SHCEP. Under SHCEP, units can be acquired directly by Local Authorities through rental or leasing arrangements. They can also be sourced by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) through construction, purchase or leasing arrangements and can be leased by both AHBs and local authorities from the NAMA special purpose vehicle.   <\/p>  <p>  There is no specific breakdown of the individual local authority targets be tween these delivery mechanisms. However, it is expected that some 1,000 units of the 3,000 national SHCEP target will be delivered by Approved Housing Bodies in 2015. Each Local Authority is best placed to determine how best to meet their individual SHCEP targets using all the delivery mechanisms available to them, taking account of the particular housing circumstances in their area.   <\/p>  <p>  There are a wide variety of possible rental and lease terms available depending on the delivery mechanism used. Units acquired by local a uthorities through rental agreements are in general in place for up to 10 year s and under lease arrangements for up to 20 years.

This will be achieved through a partnership between Government and commercial telecommunications companies.<\/p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available.<\/p><p>Last November, I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016.<\/p><p>The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention. All premises within the AMBER areas will be included in the State's intervention.<\/p><p>New private planned next generation access investments may be added to the national high-speed coverage map, once it is established that these plans are definitive and meet the relevant criteria required to be put on the map. i.e. that they will deliver high speed broadband service to end users. It is envisaged that the map will be updated on an ongoing basis from now until the award of a contract or contracts relating to the State intervention. How the map will develop beyond the contract award has yet to be determined.<\/p><p>Good progress is being made on all of the different elements of this complex project and we remain on track to publish the draft Intervention Strategy for public consultation in July. We are also on track to submit a State Aid Pre-Notification to DG Competition in June. Once the public consultation has been completed, I expect to move quickly into the formal procurement phase towards the end of the year.<\/p><p>As the draft Intervention Strategy is not yet fully finalised, I am not in a position at this time to comment in detail on whether the intervention will include any role for community co-funding in the access network. Based on my Department's on-going interaction with industry, it is clear that there is very significant interest in this project from several commercial operators so it is reasonable to expect a very competitive procurement process. The Intervention is also being designed on a wholesale basis with built-in assurances that it will be on a fully open access basis for all retail service providers who wish to use the new network to provide services to customers.<\/p><p>My Department is fully aware of the legal obligations in place under the relevant environmental impact assessment legislation and we are continuing to consider and address the application of this legislation to the State intervention.<\/p><p>There is no formal deadline in relation to contacting my Department as a potential bidder and bids will not be disadvantaged by not having contacted the Department in advance of the formal procurement process.<\/p><p>In relation to infrastructure sharing, last week my Department published a register of owners of infrastructure, as notified to us. The purpose of this register is to give potential bidders recourse to information on infrastructure which could be used as part of their bid. The register will remain open to any interested party should they wish to have their details included. Indeed, since publication, my Department has received further details for inclusion, and we will continue to engage with various organisations to ensure the maximum level of infrastructure re-use. The sharing of existing telecommunications infrastructure is considered a key enabler in reducing the overall cost of the project and in ensuring value for money to the State.<\/p><p>I expect the physical build of the network to begin in late 2016, and it will take between three and five years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids that we select.<\/p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and aims to conclusively address current broadband connectivity issues in mainly rural parts of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900078#WRZ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Television Licence Fee Payments","counter":1428,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900078#WRZ03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1429,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[19600\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900078#WRZ03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the arrangements in place for persons who are currently on social protection payments and on very low income and are having difficulty making ends meet, to pay their television licence on a weekly basis, where an official has called to the house in connection with the unlicensed television; if an instalment arrangement can be made to avoid the matter going to court; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1430,"content":"<p>The sale of TV licences and the associated inspection process is an operational matter for An Post as the Minister's statutorily appointed Agent under the Broadcasting Act 2009.

In such cases, and in the context of the finalisation of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, my Department is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of the EU Habitats Directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900080#WRBB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beit Foundation","counter":1525,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900080#WRBB02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1526,"qnumday":549,"qnumall":"[19524\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900080#WRBB02300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the intended beneficiaries of the Alfred Beit Foundation are the citizens of Ireland, and that the trust was established with the charitable objective of education in fine arts, her views regarding the risk that further sale of trust assets could be contrary to achieving the overall public benefit objective of the trust; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1527,"content":"<p>The administration of the Beit Foundation, which owns and operates Russborough House, is a matter for the trustees and my Department has no role in the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900080#WRBB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge","counter":1528,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900080#WRBB02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1529,"qnumday":550,"qnumall":"[19543\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900080#WRBB02500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist aici cur le l&iacute;on na scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; do scol&aacute;ir&iacute; &oacute;n m&oacute;rth&iacute;r chun freastal ar mhe&aacute;nscoileanna ar na hoile&aacute;in i bhfianaise an tionchair at&aacute; ag an sc&eacute;im seo ar iompar teanga na scol&aacute;ir&iacute;; c&eacute;n c&uacute;namh a thugtar leis an sc&eacute;im chun na scoileanna oile&aacute;nda a choinne&aacute;il ar oscailt agus chun pobal inmharthana a choinne&aacute;il ar na hoile&aacute;in; an m&oacute; &eacute;ileamh at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ar an sc&eacute;im; &oacute;s rud &eacute; go mbeidh com&oacute;radh c&eacute;ad bliain &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach na C&aacute;sca 1916 ar si&uacute;l in 2016 agus go raibh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge l&aacute;rnach don &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1530,"content":"<p>Faoi Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaime&oacute;ir&iacute; Gaeilge, &iacute;octar deontas laeth&uacute;il de &euro;27 le teaghlaigh ch&aacute;ilithe ar oile&aacute;in Ghaeltachta chun dalta&iacute; &oacute; cheantair lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht a choinne&aacute;il ar iostas fad a bh&iacute;onn siad ag freastal ar mhe&aacute;nscoileanna ar na hoile&aacute;in sin.
