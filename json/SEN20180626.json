I ask that his Department develop a long-term strategy to ensure the sustainability and resilience of the agricultural sector during and after periods of extreme weather.  It has been both an unfortunate and amazing year if one takes into consideration what has occurred in the past eight or nine months.  We started off with Storm Ophelia.  We then had nearly 2 m of snow in my part of the world in March and April and it has now been four weeks since we had rain.  This is part of the pattern of climate we are seeing.<\/p> <p>Most Oireachtas committees have a major focus on climate change and the drastic changes it is bringing for all sectors of society.  It will continue to have a major effect on the agricultural sector, for obvious reasons.  We are dependent on what the weather will bring in many ways, whether it is the storms and snow that arrived in the early part of the year or the drought we have experienced for the past three and a half or four weeks.<\/p> <p>In many ways, we need to revisit our strategies.  I am calling for a long-term strategy to be put in place to ensure the agricultural sector will be more sustainable and robust when it comes to dealing with these dramatic weather changes.  For that to happen, a major body of work must be done by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This will involve many stakeholders, including Teagasc, to ensure appropriate strategies are implemented.  We do not want a repeat of the two fodder crises we have experienced in the past five years when we had to purchase fodder abroad.  I have no problem securing fodder abroad but these crises have a major impact on the sustainability of the agricultural sector.<\/p> <p>In many ways, we need to build a new ethos for how agriculture, the agricultural community and industry can deal with major environmental changes, which will continue in the years and decades to come.  The body of work I am asking for should include education for farmers to ensure they have more stocks and training for agricultural advisers to ensure they treat spring as an important time of year.  In the event of a drought, discussion groups should meet every 14 days to respond to the climate changes that are taking place.<\/p> <p>In making this suggestion, I do not claim to have all the answers.  I hope the Minister has some answers.  In many ways, this is about a changing ethos and ensuring the agricultural industry moves and changes with the changing environment to remain sustainable and robust in the face of dramatic weather events such as those of recent years.  I hope the Minister will start this process.  We are dealing with a very short-term issue at the moment and the issue of fodder will also need to be addressed because problems will arise again in the coming months and years.  In my part of the world, winter fodder is now being used as feed, which could unfortunately have consequences in the coming winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#B00400","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the words of welcome and Senator Lombard also for raising this matter.<\/p> <p>As was the case for many other sectors, agriculture has been affected to varying degrees by a series of weather-related events in recent years.  Some of these were localised in extent such as the flash-flooding experience on the Inishowen Peninsula in August of last year.  Other events such at the severe flooding of the winter of 2015-16 was regionally focussed, in this case the west and midlands.  The winter and spring just past on the other hand were characterised by a prolonged and persistent period of poor weather, in the first instance affecting mainly the west and north west of the country.  Following the snow of Storm Emma in March, the situation, particularly as to the availability to fodder, spread to all parts of the country.  <\/p> <p>Extreme weather events can therefore be anticipated to occur at greater frequency and the agricultural sector is most vulnerable to the effects of these events, which are partially inspired by climate change.  My Department is now preparing sectoral climate change plans for the agricultural, forestry and seafood sectors, in line with the national adaptation framework, published earlier this year.  A key priority of these plans will be to provide guidance on adaptation planning at farm level to build resilience in the farm sector.  It is the building of this resilience that is at the core of my Department's focus in addressing the challenge of climate change.<\/p> <p>As occurrences of such events increased in recent years, the response of my Department to each severe weather challenge has been informed by the specific needs of the particular situation and delivered in a timely fashion within state-aid rules that specifically apply to the sector.  For example, in response to pressures on fodder supplies, felt initially in the west and north west, caused by a long wet winter and spring, I introduced the national fodder transport support measure in January 2018.  As a further support I introduced a fodder import support measure in the first week of April in response to the need for additional sources of fodder from abroad and also to complement the more locally-based fodder transport support measure.  These two interventions, working together effectively, addressed issues around fodder availability in the country due to the most recent weather event.<\/p> <p>I fully share the view that the agricultural sector must be enabled to sustain itself and build up resilience in the shorter term in the face of external weather challenges.  It was for this specific purpose that last May, last month, I requested Teagasc to convene a stakeholder group representative of industry, banks, agricultural media, farming bodies, etc., to co-ordinate advisory messages to farmers this summer concerning replenishing fodder stocks that have been used up.  The first meeting was held on 11 May with further regular meetings planned throughout the summer.  The message to farmers to harvest sufficient fodder, including a buffer amount, is continuously being amplified across the sector through Teagasc advisers, private advisers, FAS advisers, media, co-ops and banks.  I am very strongly committed to the work of this group and linked in by telephone with its most recent meeting which took place yesterday morning, to receive a first-hand update on progress so far and to urge no let up in activity until all issues around fodder security for next winter are fully addressed. <\/p> <p>A key information tool in this respect is a survey of the current level of fodder conservation on different farming systems in different regions.  This information will help shape the direction and content of the next stage of work by the group.  Today I am launching the first of two such Teagasc fodder surveys at Beef 2018, in the Grange research facility.  <\/p> <p>Sustainability and resilience are not only about fodder but encompass the entire farming activity.  In this respect the group is also focusing on best practices in matching livestock numbers with available fodder.  Financial budgeting is a key part of fodder budgeting and indeed overall sustainability of the farming system and must be a routine aspect of all farming enterprises. <\/p> <p>While outside agencies can provide some support to farming communities in exceptional circumstances, farmers themselves must take appropriate actions to ensure their own resilience and sustainability into the future.  Some actions are within the capacity of farmers themselves such as those being addressed by the Teagasc-led group, but others require the availability of specific tools to manage more complex threats, including risks posed by weather events.  I have asked my officials to examine options both under the CAP 2020 proposals, but also under existing programmes, that might provide an appropriate risk management option for farmers in light of these increasingly regular weather-related events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#C00100","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, does the Senator have a supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#C00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I wish to thank the Minister for his very comprehensive answer to the question.

A key part of my message to this working group is to make sure that, through their networks, whether it is the farm organisations, the co-op structure, Teagasc or the private advisory service, we need to be specifically focused on those farmers who are harder to reach in order to make sure they are part of the message.

I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.<\/p> <p>I cannot comment on individual cases.  However, I am happy to set out the position generally in respect of the processing of applications for citizenship.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, sets out the law governing Irish citizenship and distinguishes between the entitlement to Irish citizenship by birth and descent and the acquisition of Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process.  Should a non-national apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation, the applicant must fulfil certain statutory requirements, for example, residency and good character.  The Minister has absolute discretion and may dispense with the statutory conditions in whole or in part in certain circumstances.<\/p> <p>It should be noted that it is incumbent on any applicant to disclose the fact and circumstances of any ongoing matter that the Minister should be made aware of in the context of a naturalisation application.  Moreover, applicants are advised that reports are obtained from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies relating to applications for naturalisation, and that any failure to disclose any matter at any stage of the process will adversely affect the application.  The guidelines for the application form advise that, should adverse information come to light in the processing of that application, it will be taken into consideration.  In the particular section of the application dealing with background, this notification is repeated, stressing that applicants should disclose information even if they do not consider it material to the application.<\/p> <p>It is a matter reserved exclusively for the Minister to determine what factors are to be taken into account in assessing whether an applicant for naturalisation is of good character.  During the course of the processing of an application, information can come to attention from the various background checks that the applicant could reasonably have foreseen could be taken into consideration in the decision-making process.

They will be looking for accommodation for the end of August and the beginning of September once they get their results.  The problem is that there is an increasing number of students and a decreasing amount of accommodation.  In addition, the cost of the accommodation available is increasing far above the rate allowed within pressure zones.  I will give a specific example of that shortly.<\/p><p>The Government's national student accommodation strategy of July 2017 showed there was excess demand for purpose built student accommodation of over 23,000.  That will increase to over 25,000 by July 2019.  The figures in that report outline what the problem is and how it is increasing.  I met some student leaders in Galway last week.  They said that in the middle of their examinations in May the cost of official student accommodation in the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, was increased by 18%.  That confused me because Galway city is a rent pressure zone, which does not allow rent increases of more than 4% for accommodation.  However, I was told that this does not apply to student accommodation.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.  Am I wrong in the assumption that it should apply everywhere?  This will lead to students commuting long distances to get over this problem, sleeping on the couches of friends and mental health issues.<\/p><p>I am seeking information on the developments at all universities and third level institutions.  Is much extra student accommodation planned?  Is much being built at present?  If more student accommodation became available it would alleviate pressure on private rented accommodation for the general public.  Would the solution be to give some incentives or grants to provide student accommodation on the campuses of our universities or colleges?  That would in turn provide an income stream, help the overall development of those third level institutions and, perhaps, take some pressure off the Government to provide extra funding.  I am merely passing on the concerns that were raised with me and I hope the Minister can reply to some of the questions I raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#F00500","speaker":"1426","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I have met and spoken with the students' union in Dublin City University, DCU, and NUIG, where there were particular problems during the last term.

Provisions have also been made which allow applications for new, purpose-built student accommodation developments to move through the planning process at a faster pace.  <\/p><p>Alongside these initiatives, the Union of Students of Ireland and the Departments are working through the interdepartmental working group on student accommodation to promote and facilitate the provision of digs accommodation as an alternative to both purpose-built student accommodation and the general rental market for students.  The 2018 campaign was launched on 25 June and will seek to increase the number of homeowners offering accommodation to students during academic term time. <\/p><p>The recent rent increases in privately run, purpose-built student accommodation are a significant cause for concern.  I have met my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Damien English, to discuss this issue and we continue to work together to ensure that students are accommodated in the current housing market.  Officials from the Departments of Education and Skills and Housing, Planning and Local Government are working in close co-operation to identify a solution that will provide the longevity sought from any intervention.  This is a complex issue which may well necessitate legislation that is robust and does not give rise to unintended consequences.  As such, it is necessary to ensure that any potential solution is robust enough to withstand scrutiny from many different perspectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#G00200","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.

I acknowledge that the Minister comes to the Seanad on an ongoing basis and that is very much appreciated.<\/p> <p>I commend and thank the teaching profession for their hard work and dedication on behalf of our children.  We are very fortunate to have so many hard working and dedicated teachers.  Today I am raising the current role of the school principal.  In primary schools, the school principal is the manager or the captain of the ship.  He or she is the leader of the school.  Currently primary school principals are reaching out to the Department in respect of their ongoing workload and are seeking to have the allocation of release time increased in order to lessen the crippling workload they are undertaking and give them time to concentrate on their teaching responsibilities.<\/p> <p>As the Minister knows, 56% of school principals teach a class of children full time.  In addition to their responsibility to teach in the classroom, they have the responsibility of running the school, which includes administration, staff, curriculum, pupils, pupils with special needs, the board of management, the parents and building and maintenance of the school.  The teaching principal really is a multi-tasker.<\/p> <p>The situation has got to a point where it is no longer sustainable.  Teaching principals are at crisis point.  They are requesting the Minister to address this issue.  A few miles over the Border from my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan teaching principals enjoy time out from the classroom one to two days a week to do administration work.  They can plan to have a regular substitute teacher in place to allow for continuity for the benefit of the children in the classroom.  That facility has been in operation north of the Border for the past ten years.  Clearly I am here to plead with the Minister to look at the plight of school principals and the workload they currently have to undertake.  It is unsustainable and in many cases it is affecting their mental well-being.  It is at crisis point.  Something needs to be done.  I ask the Minister to review the current situation so that the role of school principals and their workload can be looked at with a view to finding workable solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#J00100","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#J00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gallagher for his kind remarks and for postponing this debate so that I could be in the Chamber to take it.  I absolutely agree with him that one of the most important things we can invest in is the quality of leadership in our schools.  If one looks at what influences a child's success in school, one is the teacher he or she experiences and second is the quality of the leadership of the school.  I am very keen to invest in upskilling and upgrading leadership.  I have done a number of things already.  In the past two budgets, I made provision for 3,000 additional posts of responsibility in our schools, both at primary and post-primary.  At post-primary, 475 deputy principal positions were created.  At primary and post-primary, 1,300 assistant principal posts were sanctioned.  The other very significant improvement is the new circular on management that has been negotiated with the trade unions and now circulated.  It provides for a much more flexible distributed system of management in our schools and allows for more flexible allocating of responsibilities and a more open system for identifying and reporting on what is done under that and the possibility for changing those responsibilities.  That is a real breakthrough in the way we allocate posts.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Richard Bruton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I know the Senator's particular concern relates to small schools that have teaching principals.  As my reply outlines, I made an arrangement this year to increase the number of days off that such principals have.  The number of days off in each of the three size categories was increased by two days, three days and four days, respectively.  As the reply sets out, I have added extra days so those who used to get 15, 20 or 25 days off now get 17, 23 or 29 days off, respectively.  This reflects the need to provide more leadership resources and capacity.<\/p><p>I am very keen to see more initiative devolved down to local level.  The new model of resource teaching allocation, which we discussed in this House last week, puts much more trust in the local school to allocate how teaching resources are deployed across the range of children with special needs.  It represents a move away from the very inflexible system that has been in place up to now.<\/p><p>I have agreed to the creation of 50 cluster posts, which will be of benefit to small schools.  This will allow groups of principals to combine their release days as a permanent position.  The holder of that position will be able to fill in across the various schools.  This will ensure principals do not have to contend with the hassle of trying to get substitute teachers on days which they have chosen to take as release days and allow them to plan the allocation of time in a much better way.<\/p><p>It is worth mentioning that we are making a significant and specifically designed investment in the Centre for School Leadership.  This year, 1,000 of the country's 4,000 principals will have opportunities to avail of coaching or mentoring or to pursue postgraduate study.  We are putting money into enhancing the quantity and quality of leadership time.<\/p><p>I gather from the text that has been provided that the specific request made by the Senator would cost &euro;12 million if we were to accede to it.  When these things are being put together as part of October's budget, we will have to look at the competing requests that are being made.  As the Senator is probably aware, there are many other requests.  We have debated them in this House and in the D&aacute;il.  We will have to make decisions on where priorities lie.  As we have seen, it will be a fairly tight year for additional resources.<\/p><p>We will not relent in our interest in investing in the quantity and quality of leadership.  We are investing in the Centre for School Leadership and building clusters to enable schools to come together for substitution and to do things together, for example, in the digital and DEIS spheres.  I know there are many DEIS schools in the Border counties, perhaps not in Monaghan but certainly in Donegal.  We are trying to encourage individual school leaders to show more leadership by working with others to achieve new things.<\/p><p>We are moving away from the much more rigid input-output way of allocating resources across our school budgeting.  In my view, the conversation focuses far too much on pupil-teacher ratios, capitation grants and appointment rates.  We need to look at what pushes on the experience of children.  I think that is where the kind of good and well thought-out investment in leadership that we are trying to sponsor can make a big difference.<\/p><p>I thank the Senator for his interest.  I cannot accede to his specific request today, but I will examine it in the context of other things we might be able to do in this whole area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#J00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response.

I am sure the Minister is aware of that as well.  This issue deserves attention.

In 2017, the HSE recorded a net operating deficit of &euro;140 million, yet last week, which was the anniversary of the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadker's, first year in office he made a significant virtue of the fact that he is a master of balancing budgets.  This does not seem to be the case.<\/p> <p>This matter has a very serious consequences, especially for ordinary people who rely on home help and those in need of mental health services.  There has been a reduction in home help hours and a serious crisis in mental health services, especially in the CAMHS sector.  These services have been left to languish with little or no support.  It is also shocking that the former secretary general, Tony O'Brien, warned the Minister privately that the deficit could reach &euro;800 million for the year, something which was not acted on.  This is horrendous.  The budget deficit increases have been attributed to older people presenting to hospitals.  In a general election manifesto in 2011, the Government ran on a platform of building primary care centres across the country.  In Drimnagh in my constituency, we were promised a primary care centre yet to date no sod has been turned and planning is about to run out.  What is the Minister's plan in regard to this matter?

I have tabled over 20 amendments for the Labour Party to make to that Bill but I understand it is not going ahead.  Could the Leader let us know whether Committee Stage can proceed at this point, given that we have received reports that the Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, has such significant concerns about some key measures proposed in the Bill, in particular that the provisions around the new judicial appointments commission are not in line with European standards and that a more substantial participation is required.  GRECO has urged the Government to reconsider the provisions in order to limit the potential risks of improper influence from the Executive and to ensure that any measures introduced are taken in co-operation with judicial authorities.<\/p> <p>Given these concerns the Minister should publish the GRECO report and, furthermore, we should be given some indication of how the Government proposes to address these concerns in its amendments which we have not yet seen.

It was a lovely ceremony in Dublin Castle.  Indeed, there were two very nice ceremonies in Dublin Castle on Sunday.  The other ceremony related to the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  There were lots of references to JFK and our current Taoiseach but a Fianna F&aacute;il Government was in power between 1957 and 1959 when it all started in 1958 and I think it would be nice if when referring to it, the Government did acknowledge that a Fianna F&aacute;il Government was in power at the time.<\/p> <p>I want to raise another point relating to policing and justice generally.  I wish the new Garda Commissioner well.  I also acknowledge that 22 years ago today, Veronica Guerin lost her life in the fight against crime and reporting crime.  If she was here today, she would say that there is a lot more work to be done.  I wish the new Garda Commissioner well but I do want to acknowledge that time.  I remember the day very well.  It happened on Booth Road in Clondalkin.  I would like to remember that.  <\/p> <p>I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality for the comments he made at the weekend about cycling.  He responded to a tweet.  I cycled in here today.  I regularly cycle in here.  I am lucky enough to live close enough that I can do so but it is not all that safe sometimes.  I do support the Minister and others who are saying that it is important that the cycle lanes that are there are available for cyclists and that they are not full of cars parked, lorries delivering or buses pulling in and so on.  The Minister has said he will meet with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who is far more interested in judges than he is in transport, to deal with this matter.  The Minister for Justice and Equality seems to be the one who is most interested in cycling infrastructure, far more than the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Perhaps he is the one we should bring in to talk about cycling, road infrastructure and the enforcement of road policing.

An initiative could be put in place for that.<\/p><p>Another national issue is childhood obesity and the fact that almost one third of our children are either overweight or obese.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, promoted an initiative in his own area, Wicklow, of a no-fry zone near schools, something which I fully support.  Local authorities need guidelines on this from the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, through the Department of Health but it will be a local authority issue.  The local authorities and developers need guidance.  We currently have a situation where there is a brand new primary school in Skerries with 365 children and there are proposals to build a huge fast food outlet beside it.  The initial proposal was for an all-night drive-through with all sorts of traffic issues but, more recently, that has been dropped.  It is a disproportionate development in a small local shopping centre.  Our children need to be protected from this.

I would also like to know where it is.  I have been seeking a meeting about this issue with the Minister for the last three weeks.  I hope to meet with him soon.

The Bill is by no means a panacea or the end of the beginning.  It is the beginning of the beginning for them, in having a process to put in place a national strategy which will give them the help that they need to reach the potential that they have to make their contribution to our society.

Of the &euro;15 million that was put in to boost the mental health budget, from January to March of this year, &euro;13 million of it was spent on agency staff.

We know fewer staff, chaotic working conditions and the use of agency staff, with the resultant lack of continuity of care, give rise to increasing assaults.  Between 2008 and 2018 there were more than 10,000 serious assaults on staff, 70% of them on nursing staff.  I know these nursing staff.  They have had their eyes gouged out, they have lost testicles and they have lost their own physical, never mind emotional, well-being.  They are languishing at home often in difficult circumstances, including marriage breakdowns, because of the impact chaotic working conditions have on them.<\/p> <p>I do not know who would want to sign up to working like this.

That should not go unnoticed, especially given the Taoiseach's visit to east Belfast and the reception he got from the Orange Order and its supporters in east Belfast, and also the reception he got in west Belfast at the opening of F&eacute;ile.  In addition, in recent weeks Prince Charles and Camilla were in Cork, the so-called rebel county.  This island is changing and that is very much to be welcomed.

I have not been able to get an answer from the Minister's office as to whether he is available this evening but if the Senator will indulge me, I will endeavour to have him come to the House tomorrow or on Thursday.  I have been in communication with the Senator since she first raised the matter in the House last week.  I certainly want to see the report on community banking debated in this House and I gave the Senator a commitment to that effect.  I cannot give a definitive answer with regard to the Minister's availability but if Senator O'Donnell indulges and trusts me, I will endeavour to secure the Minister's presence in the House later this week.  Otherwise, I will have to oppose her proposed amendment to the Order of Business which I do not want to do because the request being made is reasonable.  <\/p><p>I agree with Senator Devine that the number of assaults on staff working in hospitals is unacceptable.  I worked in a hospital previously and have family members who are nurses and I agree that any attack is one too many.  Senator Devine rightly drew attention to some of the dreadful injuries inflicted on nurses, care assistants and other members of hospital staff.  The safety of all of those who work in our health system is of paramount importance.  The Government is committed to recruiting additional nurses, care assistants and other front-line health service staff.  Staff numbers are growing every year but the important point made by the Senator is that we must ensure that the physical safety of all staff is assured.  The HSE has a duty of care to its staff and a responsibility to guarantee their safety in the workplace.  A national health and safety strategy has been put in place by the HSE but we must continue to highlight this issue.  <\/p><p>The issue of agency staff in our health system arises regularly in these Houses.  It was raised at meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, of which I was once Chairman, and it has been raised by Senator Colm Burke in this House.  The amount of money being spent on agency staff is frightening, especially in the context of the value for money that could be obtained if we invested that money in the retention and recruitment of permanent staff, which would be much better.  We must accept that we will always have some agency staff in our health system but the growth in the numbers of such staff is not acceptable.  I am happy to invite the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to the House to discuss that matter.  <\/p><p>I join Senators Feighan and Wilson in congratulating Ms Arlene Foster for travelling to the Ulster football final at the weekend, which was a positive gesture.  I heard what Senator Humphreys said but would argue that gestures are important.  It would have been unthinkable 25 years ago for the leader of the DUP to travel to an Ulster football final and to sit with a Cabinet Minister and a Chief Whip to watch the game, so Ms Foster's gesture is positive in that regard.  As Senators Humphreys and Feighan pointed out, it is absolutely imperative that the institutions in Stormont are back up and running as soon as possible.  It is unacceptable that no responsibility is being taken by politicians in the North and that there is no direct rule at Stormont.  It is incumbent upon Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP in particular to re-engage in talks and to re-establish a power-sharing Government in Northern Ireland.  I agree with the point made by Senator Feighan about the Commonwealth Games representing a missed opportunity.  <\/p><p>Senator Humphreys also argued for a dedicated transport police and the point he made in that regard certainly has merit in the context of last week's report of increases in attacks on both commuters and public transport staff.  The Senator called for a debate on the matter and I am happy to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to the House for that.  Senator Wilson seconded the proposed amendment by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell.  As I have said, I will try to arrange for the Minister to come to the House tomorrow or on Thursday and ask that the amendment be withdrawn.  If not, I will have to oppose it, which I am loath to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#V02000","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, \"That a debate with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the publication of a report on the introduction of community banking be taken today.\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#W00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>No, not if I get a guarantee that the debate will take place this week.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2390\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We will have a major gap because the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill will not come to the House.

At the outset I wish to thank HIQA for its report, which is frank, clear and helpful.  Through this report it has identified how we can provide better services for our children.  Children are, of course, at the centre of what we do and they will be at the centre of our response.<\/p> <p>Although HIQA has identified deficits in the child protection services provided by Tusla, it is important to say that the report found children at immediate risk received an appropriate and timely service.  Following the revelation last year that Tusla had sent a notification containing a false allegation of child sexual abuse against Sergeant Maurice McCabe to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I became concerned that there may be more systemic issues which needed to be addressed by the Child and Family Agency.  <\/p> <p>In regard to Sergeant McCabe, I would like to say that I welcome the restating of Tusla&rsquo;s apology to him.  I know that the events which triggered this statutory investigation were devastating for him and his family.  This investigation did not examine issues pertaining to his case as it is included in the work of the disclosures tribunal.  Not for the first time, Sergeant Maurice McCabe, at a personal cost to himself, has done a service to the State.  <\/p> <p>I am committed to implementing all the recommendations from this report in full.  Intensive work is already under way in Tusla and in my Department to ensure this happens.  This commitment is shared by the chair, board and CEO of Tusla.  When this is done, I believe Tusla will be better equipped to carry out the child protection functions which are so necessary in our country today.<\/p> <p>We knew from previous work done by HIQA that issues were identified in inspection reports on foster care and the child welfare and protection services.  I am conscious that considerable public funding has been made available to enable the modernisation and transformation strategy that is under way in Tusla.  I need to ensure that these public funds are having the impact they are intended to have.<\/p> <p>In response to my direction in March last year to HIQA to carry out a statutory investigation into Tusla&rsquo;s national practices in the handling of referrals of allegations of sexual abuse which involve adults of concern, HIQA has produced a report which clearly captures the progress and problems that were evident at the time the investigation took place.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In particular HIQA finds that child sexual abuse referrals, including retrospective allegations, were not always managed in a timely or effective way from the point of referral to the point of closure.  There was a variation in the level of adherence to Tusla policies and procedures and standard business processes for referrals.  There was no nationally agreed arrangement in place to ensure effective and consistent information sharing between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There were gaps in resource planning and critical social work posts remained vacant to varying degrees across the service areas.<\/p><p>HIQA's point about needing an innovative approach to workforce planning is well made.  We are coming from a position of low numbers of social workers per head of population in all areas, including child protection.  However, the report from HIQA states clearly that, \"Tusla has to manage the same workforce challenges faced by other jurisdictions [...] and avoid an organisational mind-set that sees such problems as insurmountable due to factors outside of its control\".  This will require a deeper examination of work practices and roles to make sure the teams are working to the greatest effect on children's lives.  Front-line teams need additional support and ongoing training to enable them to use their considerable skills in the most challenging of work and in a very high risk environment.  The recommendations identified specific actions for Tusla to act on directly.  They also identified areas for engagement by my Department with Tusla and HIQA to support these and to look at the overall regulatory environment.<\/p><p>To move forward, I immediately appointed Dr. Moling Ryan as an independent chair to implement the recommendation on setting up the quality assurance advisory oversight group.  The work of this group will examine the links between the action plan with Tusla's five-year child welfare and protection strategy and its three-year corporate plan.  In addition, my officials will engage with HIQA as to the kind of regulatory framework for child welfare and protection services that would be suitable for the Irish context.  HIQA is our expert in the social services regulatory field and I welcome its involvement.  I had a very productive meeting with the CEO of Tusla this morning.  I will be meeting the board of Tusla shortly to discuss the short and long-term implications of the report's findings and to discuss how to urgently drive the improvements that are needed.<\/p><p>Turning for a moment to the report itself, it says that it was evident that there had been considerable financial investment by the Government.  HIQA states that there is a clear strategic direction for Tusla and its services.  This direction is not fully incorporated into practices at local level.  In addition, the report is clear that the front-line teams are dedicated to the welfare and protection of children, and engaged positively with the investigation, which I welcome.  This is very much in line with my own experience of meeting with front-line teams throughout the country.<\/p><p>However, it was still the case that a key finding in the report was that there are systemic risks which require immediate attention and which pose a potential risk of harm to children.  Mr. Fred McBride as chief executive officer, CEO, has acknowledged that improvement is needed and he and his team will deliver on this.  They will have my full support, the support of the board of Tusla, my Department and the Government.  Tusla&rsquo;s appearance before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs - some of the Senators were present and grilled Tusla - provided colleagues with an opportunity to question the senior management of the agency.  It is important that Tusla understands the concerns raised by Senators and Deputies who have read the report but who also have \"on the ground\" experience about child protection services.  The Oireachtas joint committee provided Tusla with an opportunity to explain from its perspective how cases are managed and how risk is minimised.  <\/p><p>I know that Tusla is anxious to convey the message that it is not possible to eliminate all risk.  Sexual abuse is a secretive act, there is shame, there is denial and there is concealment.  A reflective learning culture is essential to good practice and early identification of previously unknown risks.  Using experience is also a way to minimise the risks.  Tusla has recently appointed a chief social worker.  Part of the role of the chief social worker is to ensure that learning is shared across the organisation.  This has not been happening to the extent that it should.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This has not been happening to the extent it should and HIQA was very clear about it.  I expect this to change and I am assured it will.  Senior social work practitioners will be part of the duty teams.  This should improve early identification of risks at the front door.  <\/p><p>With regard to retrospective allegations, I am working with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the future role of Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the handling of such cases.  Tusla's role has evolved from case law and needs to be considered further.  In the interim, Tusla's policy and procedures for retrospective allegations have been fully reviewed and will be available in the near future.  <\/p><p>The overall message is that there is an ongoing modernisation programme.  However, it needs impetus and focus.  This report serves to bring the actions needed into focus and sets a clear path forward.  HIQA's findings are serious.  Its recommendations will not be left on a shelf.  They will be implemented as they are intended to be to provide a more responsive, better and comprehensive service to our Irish children whom we have a responsibility to nurture, protect and respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#CC00300","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming here today to discuss this very important report.  It is a very serious report that makes for very sobering reading.  We have had almost a week to digest it.  I was at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs last week when Fred McBride appeared before it.  To be honest, I would have very serious concerns about his leadership.  It is clear that there was a management failure at the top.  In her speech, I think the Minister referred to the fact that front-line workers are very dedicated to the service they are providing.  The Government is funding the service to a reasonable extent but there seems to be a disconnect between the funding, front-line workers and delivery, which is very concerning.<\/p> <p>The report is very comprehensive.  I appreciate that a report as comprehensive as this one needs adequate time but I was a bit disappointed that it took a year to produce.  However, we have it now.  The failures around the systems and policies that were referenced in the report are very concerning.  There seems to be a lack of urgency around everything in Tusla.  I think we would have cut it some slack when it was in its infancy but four years after its establishment, there should be far more urgency with regard to getting the systems and policies up to speed and ensuring they are correct and working properly.  <\/p> <p>The lack of staff is one issue but even where there is no lack of staff and where it is adequately staffed, there are problems relating to processes that are in place.  When failings occur, there seems to be a lack of supervision around the failings and a lack of learning from those failings.  The management style does not seem to equate to the organisation being a learning experience, which is very concerning.  <\/p> <p>Another thing that is of concern is the relationship between the Child and Family Agency and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the fact that the two organisations do not seem to be exchanging information adequately.  This occurs at a number of levels.  One issue of serious concerning that I raised at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs last week was the fact that joint interviewing did not take place as standard.  I was told that it is taking place, although not to a great extent.  It needs to take place as standard.  Social workers need to be trained as a matter of urgency in that regard.  <\/p> <p>We must bear in mind that we are talking about vulnerable children.  They should be at the centre of everything we do in this regard.  It is very upsetting to hear that files have been closed inappropriately.  The number of files that are still out there awaiting allocation is staggering.  I would have a lack of faith in the actual numbers we have been given when it says in the report that files have been closed inappropriately.  This is something I would like the Minister to address in her response.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Throughout her speech, the Minister recognised that there were deficits.  She mentioned that she was going to implement the recommendations made in the report in full.  She also said she had appointed Dr. Ryan as an independent chairperson and that this would move things on.  However, throughout the entire speech, I do not see any timeline, which is concerning.  We need to be given a clear timeline.  If the recommendations and policies are not put in place within a short timeframe, I want to know where the buck will stop.  Will it stop with the Minister or Mr. McBride?  We need some answers.  The Minister has invested in this process.  I accept her sincerity in that regard and know that she will do her best.  However, it needs to be given more urgency and we need clear timelines and to know what the consequences will be if they are not adhered to.  I would appreciate the Minister's response in that regard.<\/p><p>My final point relates to the part of the Minister's speech where she says there is a low number of social workers in the system per head of population.  Will she make proposals on how to attract people from other disciplines into the system?  I know that there is a low number of people training to be social workers, but, despite this, there are those with life and academic experience in other areas who, if the right incentives were in place, could be retrained and brought into the system, bringing a lot of experience with them, including institutional experience.  I would appreciate it if the Minister made reference to that matter in her response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#EE00200","speaker":"1376","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I also thank her for calling for this report which stemmed from the investigation of Tusla&rsquo;s management of the false allegation made about the Garda whistleblower Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  Like most others, I was truly shocked to hear such major failings had occurred in how Tusla managed allegations of child sexual abuse.  HIQA's report highlights the fact that in a number of cases children were left in potentially high risk situations.  In my view and that of most reasonable people, including the Minister, this is not only unacceptable, it is also wholly objectionable.  The report also identifies serious shortcomings in the screening of child abuse allegations, the development and handling of safety plans for children and the manner in which those subjected to allegations of abuse were communicated with.  <\/p> <p>Without doubt, the most serious finding made in the report is that there were discrepancies in Tusla&rsquo;s safety planning practice.  This resulted in a number of children being insufficiently safeguarded, while others who also were at potential risk were not safeguarded at all.  Moreover, the absence of a streamlined approach for staff to manage allegations made by adults of abuse during their childhood is also completely unacceptable and, frankly, appalling.  The lack of a standardised approach has led to inconsistencies and postponements in the management of such cases which have been well discussed.  Moreover, it led to the mishandling of the communications on the allegations, if, in fact, any communication took place at all.  As legislators, the onus is on us to guarantee that our most vulnerable citizens receive the optimum care we can provide.  Where there are incidents of child sexual abuse or cases in which adults have made allegations that they were abused as children, there can be no tolerance of inadequacies such as those which have been highlighted in the report.  It is shameful that children are being left at risk of sexual abuse owing to discrepancies in how preliminary inquiries into allegations take place.  As Tusla representatives noted at the committee meeting last week, it is difficult on all occasions for Tusla to detect when children are in danger, which is understandable, given the nature of what we are dealing with.  It manages risk all of the time and it is a very difficult job for those at the coal face.  Nonetheless, there can be no tolerance of the inadequacies such as those highlighted.<\/p> <p>The report makes four main recommendations to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  They include establishing an expert quality assurance and oversight group and that the Department and Tusla seek the assistance of the higher education and training bodies to create formal career paths for students and graduates to reinforce child protection and welfare services.  Other recommendations have been discussed.<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister for her clarity in calling for the recommendations arising from a statutory investigation carried out by HIQA of the management by Tusla of allegations of child sexual abuse against adults to be implemented in full.  I also commend her for outlining a number of immediate actions to be taken, including the appointment of Dr. Ryan to chair an independent expert quality assurance and oversight group to drive implementation of HIQA&rsquo;s recommendations.  However, I share Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee's concerns about the timeframe and would be grateful if the Minister outlined it for us.  The actions also include finalising proposals, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice and Equality, for reforming the way Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deal with historical allegations of sexual abuse, as well as engaging with the Minister for Education and Skills and higher education and training establishments to support Tusla&rsquo;s workforce.  This is an important point which I made at the committee meeting.  We were speaking about the management of Tusla, but it is front-line staff who often have to deal with the negativity that naturally goes with the type of feedback a report such this has received.  Management is at a distance from the harrowing day-to-day situations with which staff deal.  There is an onus on management to protect the staff of Tusla by having proper policies in place for these difficult scenarios.<\/p> <p>Other suggested actions include using specialist HR expertise to work with Tusla on its skill mix.  This also came up at the committee, given the fact that there is an ongoing challenge when it comes to the mix of skills available in Tusla.  Its representatives spoke about the work they had done in trying to reform the way recruitment took place.  Certainly, those in charge of Tusla fully recognise that there were inadequacies in the way it had been done in the past.  They seemed to be genuinely and actively trying to rectify the position in the new processes.<\/p> <p>At this point, it important to point to some positives in the report.  In fact, the findings identify examples of good practice by Tusla personnel and a strong commitment on the part of a number of dedicated staff who were striving to provide for best practice in child welfare and protection services.  The Minister has spoken about the huge investment the Government has made in the area.  In the wider area of child welfare and protection it must be acknowledged that the front-line teams of care and social workers who are supporting children, young people and families do invaluable work to transform young lives, notwithstanding the obvious inadequacies discovered on occasion.  Significant progress has been made in dealing with important issues such as the mandatory reporting of abuse, the expansion of the number of family resource centres and the ongoing move towards providing better supports for the victims of child sexual abuse.  While this progress is very welcome, the fact remains the report highlights serious inconsistencies in the handling of child sexual abuse cases which simply cannot be tolerated.  As such, we need to be formidable in our determination to tackle these issues head-on in order to safeguard children and ensure they receive the protection and support they need and deserve.  I intend to work with my colleagues on the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister who I have no doubt is committed to this task.  I commend her and her officials for their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#FF00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to discuss the report.  The inconsistencies raised in the HIQA report are stark, as the Minister said.  It damages confidence significantly in a body that is our first defence in child protection in this State.<\/p> <p>I am glad that at the outset of her contribution the Minister acknowledged the source of this report in terms of what Sergeant Maurice McCabe has suffered.  In our worst nightmare we cannot imagine the horror suffered by him and his family because of what was done to them.<\/p> <p>I would not imagine that Maurice McCabe is the only person who has suffered because mistakes were made in the system.  Over recent years, consistent serious shortcomings in the governance and oversight of the organisation have been highlighted.  The organisation is suffering from a staffing crisis.  In a Committee of Public Accounts, PAC, report in January 2018,  we found that despite Tusla hiring 250 new staff in 2017, there was only a net gain of 18 due to the high numbers leaving the agency.  Tusla is also expecting a &euro;11.4 million underspend in the area of staff wages.<\/p> <p>It seems clear that there are significant issues with staff deployment and retention.  It is very obvious that many social workers are overworked and carry huge case loads which are impossible to deal with.  Those staff work directly with children, some of them very vulnerable and with whom they need to build up a long-term working relationship that is based on trust.  We must remember that there is nobody many of these children have been able to trust.  In some cases they have not been able to trust either of their parents.  They need a relationship where that trust can be built and cultivated.  Without it, the damage that will be done will be immense.  That is the reason the retention of staff is vitally important and we need to see serious improvement in this area.<\/p> <p>The Minister talked about reflective learning.  I am very much for reflective learning but that is not possible when social workers do not have the time to do even the crisis management they have to do within that system.  We need to listen to the social workers working in the area.  We need to listen also to the social workers who have left.  I cannot imagine what it is like to be a social worker who goes into work every day thinking they might miss something or that they will not do what they need to do and who experiences all that pain and suffering, without having time to reflect or even put in the protections they need to put in for themselves as social workers.  They cannot do that when they are in a constant crisis management situation.<\/p> <p>What actions are Tusla and the Department taking to restructure that to ensure that social workers are able to handle their case load effectively, that they are satisfied and retained in their work and that the grade of advanced social work practitioner is reinstated?  We want people to go into social work.  It is a dedicated job that requires passion and compassion but we will not be able to keep those people in the system, and attract others into it who would make very good social workers, if we continue to expose them, and the people they work with, to the risk to which they are currently being exposed.<\/p> <p>The report shows a clear lapse in the defences we have for children in this State that needs to be remedied sooner rather than later.  The children we are now failing will be adults by the time we address that, and that is my big fear.  We cannot lose an entire generation.  I acknowledge the good work done by Tusla and the many good people in Tusla who are dedicated to their jobs but they cannot do them unless they are given the resources, the support and adequate staffing to address the need they are trying to deal with every day.<\/p> <p>I am glad the Minister said this report will not rest on a shelf.  I hope it will not.  I hope she will come into the Seanad again to tell us of the practical and pragmatic actions that have been taken that make a difference on the ground to children, to families and to the many dedicated workers who are trying to do their very best in a system that is currently not fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#GG00100","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire ar ais chuig an Seanad.  I concur with my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague.  The current position with Tusla as highlighted in the HIQA report means we are failing children and their interactions with youth services.<\/p> <p>The report highlighted a number of key performances where Tusla is failing in its duties, one of which was the inconsistencies in practice around the screening of allegations and making preliminary inquiries.  While Tusla focused on examining current risk to children, that often resulted in a lack of urgency in responding to retrospective allegations of abuse against adults of concern.  This meant that children who are potentially at risk from adults who are alleged to have abused children in the past or who were convicted of child sexual abuse in the past and now have access to other children may be missed.<\/p> <p>I am particularly concerned as to how Tusla and the Department intend to deal with retrospective child protection cases that Tusla has now deemed to be completed or closed but were not investigated to their full extent.  Will the Minister outline the steps she intends to make on this?  <\/p> <p>Furthermore, what immediate steps can she take to aid Tusla with its heavy case load?  In response to a parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy Denise Mitchell, in March, the Minister said there were 25,000 open cases in the system at the end of December 2017, of which 5,000 were awaiting the allocation of a social worker.  Of those cases, there were a number of high priority cases, where a child is considered to be at high risk of abuse, with unallocated social workers.  Of those, 198 were waiting under one month, 189 were waiting between one to three months and 346 were waiting three months or more.  Tusla was unable to provide a waiting time for a further 87 cases.  That is indicative of poor record keeping.<\/p> <p>I am cognisant not just of the Health Service Executive, HSE, which is rightly getting a battering lately for its policies, procedures and lack of care, especially for women, but I am cognisant also of the hard working staff in Tusla.  They were my colleagues and many of them tell me they are terrified of going out socially and people asking them what they do.  They will not say they work for Tusla.  They are subjected to abuse because they are being blamed for the mismanagement of the policies and the report that has been produced.  These are the ordinary people, like the HSE staff, who are fire fighting because that is all they can do lately. Recruitment and retention is the biggest issue.  As my colleague, Senator Conway-Walsh said, there has been a gain of only 18 despite an influx of social work staff.  We cannot have a situation where caring staff are ashamed of their title and of their work.  I want to put on the record that that is not their fault.  They are the backbone in terms of protection for children and health services in our country.<\/p> <p>We have failed to fully implement issues arising from last year&rsquo;s report into section 12 of the Child Care Act by Professor Geoffrey Shannon.  He stated: \"Consideration should be given to having social workers assigned to specialist child protection units\", and that there should be a review of legislation to ensure that there are no legal roadblocks which might impede, \"child protection services sharing information relating to vulnerable children and their families\".  Will the Government now consider specialist child protection units to ensure that no child is failed again?  As I am sure we all agree, one child failed is one too many and the current failings of Tusla, as outlined in the report, is a calamity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#GG00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their helpful contributions.  It is clear that they have spent some time reading and reflecting deeply on the report and, where the social services provided through Tusla are concerned, have been in touch with colleagues and those who work within their communities.  All of them have referred to the commitment of and excellent work being done by the organisation's people on the ground.  I acknowledge and express my gratitude for that work.  It is a difficult time, given how critical the report has been of many aspects of the organisation.  I am at one with Senators in that regard.  I am also at one with the board and chief executive who are also in communication with the people concerned and have expressed their willingness to support them in a new way and commit to the sense of urgency for which all of the Senators have called.<\/p> <p>I will respond first to the Senators' focus on the people providing the services and what we owe them in difficult work circumstances.  All of the Senators referred to the sense of urgency.  I have communicated to the chairperson and the chief executive directly that I will also be seeking urgency.  HIQA is also seeking it.<\/p> <p>The first recommendation is for Tusla to develop an action plan that will respond to all aspects of the report.  When I spoke to the chief executive this morning, he stated Tusla was working on it.  When I meet the board at the end of this week, we will discuss it further.  The chief executive stated it would take a maximum of a couple of weeks to put the plan together.  It will not only outline what is to happen but also who will be responsible and what the timelines and deadlines will be.  HIQA has asked that Tusla, after it examines the recommendations and develops the action plan in response, revert to it with information on the timelines for the various actions to be taken.  I will ask HIQA to advise me on whether it believes the timelines are suitable.<\/p> <p>Regarding the recommendation on establishing an oversight or quality assurance group to ensure implementation of the recommendations and action plan, the House will be aware that I appointed the independent Dr. Moling Ryan to chair the group.  My officials have already met him and will do so again tomorrow.  They are undertaking a process of agreeing the group's membership and terms of reference.  Dr. Ryan will probably have read the report thoroughly by tomorrow and will make recommendations on the categories of members to be included - it will not be a large group - and the terms of reference that will be needed if the group is to do its work, which is targeted at the report's recommendations.  My understanding is those involved hope to have the process completed and the people gathered to do the work by next month and that the work will start in September.  That said, we need to keep an eye on the ongoing timeframe.  I will be happy to revert to the House on the matter.  I am trying to describe an awareness of the need for timelines, given the sense of urgency involved.<\/p> <p>The second question raised by the Senators was related to staffing issues, which were a key aspect of the significant criticisms raised in HIQA's report, as well as its recommendations.  Senator Rose Conway-Walsh asked what it was like to be a social worker.  Social workers face challenges and difficulties and want more colleagues to share the work.  That is a key issue and we will approach it in a number of ways, one of which will be engagement with the higher education sector.  This medium to long-term approach is meant to increase the number of professionally qualified social workers on which Tusla can draw.  It has been liaising with third level institutions in the Republic, Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  There are a limited number of graduates per year.  Since they make a significant contribution to Tusla, it is important that it liaise with other jurisdictions also.<\/p> <p>The Senators may be interested to know that we have been working with the Department of Health which has the lead role in the national strategic framework for health and social care workforce planning.  In addition, my Department has been working with the Department of Health and Tusla in examining the various relevant issues over a period.  That said, we need to increase the tempo in that regard.  I met the Minister for Education and Skills last week to discuss the issue.  We agreed that his officials would work with mine in considering the need for additional social work training places and specific courses within the overall degree programme and in examining other aspects of higher education training for social workers that could not just lead to more workers but also allow us to draw on others' expertise and training.  Practical issues such as these will feed into the discussions with officials and the Minister for Education and Skills on the mix of skills, workflows and staff in Tusla recommended in the report.  We will work with the third level sector to determine how we can not just train more people but also train more differently.<\/p> <p>Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee asked about training people from different backgrounds.  Mature students are welcome to apply for social work training.  When I met the chief executive and the chief operations officer this morning, they told me that Tusla offered training bursaries.  They want to draw on people from different backgrounds.  My officials are engaging with the Department of Education and Skills on the issue of increasing the number of training places.<\/p> <p>I wish to address two other aspects of the human resources issue.  We need to do something before the medium term hits and more social workers have been attracted into the system.  I will appoint an independent human resources expert to Dr. Ryan's group who will work specifically on immediate plans for a different staff mix and workflow in order that social workers will be able to focus more on their social work, as distinct from the other necessary aspects of working with families and children.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The other aspect would have to do with the retention of social workers.  Obviously, we need to bring them in but we also need to keep them.  Senior practice social workers are going to be on every child protection team and senior social workers are going to be deployed to all duty teams.  Tusla has a welfare strategy for social workers who experience stress.  All of these issues have been identified with regard to the changes that would be required to support the social workers who are there and want to stay because of their great commitment and their sense of vocation for what they are doing, as well as it being a profession.<\/p><p>The Senator also had questions around the relationship between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  The two bodies have developed a draft memorandum of understanding on information and data protection issues, given these have been some of the challenging aspects of working together that have slowed down some of the processes.  We now have a draft memorandum of understanding in regard to the way they share their information.  My understanding from my officials is that this should finally be agreed within a short period of time, that is, within the next couple of weeks.  It has been developed to ensure there is no practical or legislative roadblock that impedes the sharing of child protection information between the Garda and Tusla.  Equally, there is no legal barrier to the sharing of that information for child protection purposes, which is very important.<\/p><p>A question was also raised on another aspect, namely, specialist interviewing.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla are examining the development of additional specialist training to improve this area and they are working together, especially with regard to garda&iacute; training Tusla staff, in order to identify more people who can do that specialist interviewing with children.<\/p><p>Senator Devine also asked about specialist child protection units, which we have been working on in light of Professor Shannon's report.  We are working with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda in regard to developing a proposal, and I hope it will be completed to the point where we can, in the fall, identify at least some form of piloting approach to that.  While that is all I will say for the moment, there have certainly been many meetings, much thinking and the development of strategies with the Garda, as well as with my own Department.<\/p><p>In addition, to date in 2018 the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established four divisional protection units - in Cork, Louth, Blanchardstown and Clondalkin.  Tusla is working with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in assigning child protection social workers to work with each unit and a further eight units are expected to be open in the coming months.  I have tried to identity some of the key ways in which new actions which have been in the process of being designed are ready to, or are actually beginning to, be delivered, which I think and hope will make a significant difference.<\/p><p>Senator Clifford-Lee asked who is responsible.  The questions of oversight and governance are critical, especially in the agency that protects our children.  There is a board and there is also a chief executive.  The oversight group will oversee and quality assure the implementation of this report, and although it will not oversee the whole thing, it will have some responsibility in terms of oversight in that regard.  Ultimately, however, I am responsible.  I certainly feel very aware of and committed to assuring the recommendations of this report are implemented with a great sense of urgency.  That is why we have already tried to act on some of them.  Overall, it is my Ministry.  The chief executive also acknowledged at the committee that he too is responsible, given the level he is at within the organisation, and he is taking that very seriously.<\/p><p>It is given those different levels of accountability and oversight, as well as the changes I am indicating and the ways in which we are going to implement the recommendations, that I believe this provides us with the opportunity to move into a new period for Tusla.  The HIQA report states that the vision is good and that the strategic policies at national level, which have been developing in recent years, are good and strong, but it is not enough.  That is what our work is for the next period of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#HH00100","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1530019800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.35 p.m. and resumed at 5.45 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017: Motion","time":1530019800,"counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#KK00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>A message has been received from the D&aacute;il concerning amendments made by the Seanad to the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017.

We debated long and hard in respect of section 38 of the Data Protection Act.  The Data Protection Act obliges the Minister to consult first with the Data Protection Commission before passing regulations.  Perhaps more crucially, there is something about which I think there was strong feeling on all sides of the House and which was replicated in the D&aacute;il.  It is that when proceeding with regard to the advice given by the Data Protection Commission, the Minister must provide a written explanation as to the justification of why he or she is proceeding in that way and lay it before any relevant committee.  That is one aspect.  I know an alternative process is being proposed here.  Perhaps the Minister will give his perspectives and reassurance to us on it.

This section of the Data Protection Act provides that a Minister may make regulations for the processing of data for a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority.  Data sharing is included in the definition of data processing in the GDPR and the Data Protection Act.  In regard to the Senator's comments, we are not doing anything to dilute or undermine anything.  In effect, we are strengthening the existing provisions.  Everything we are doing is with regard to the existing provisions.  It means that it is currently lawful for a Minister to make an order under section 38(4) of the Data Protection Act authorising two or more public bodies to share data to carry out their functions.  Section 5(2) and (3) of this Bill are intended to prevent public bodies from side-stepping this Bill by making regulations for data sharing under section 38 of the Data Protection Act.  It is a reaffirmation of section 38.  The Data Sharing and Governance Bill recognises that data sharing is of particular importance in the context of personal data processing and, as such, sets out additional processes that must be followed before data sharing is permitted.  The Senator's proposed amendment would establish a more permissive data sharing regime than the one currently set out in the Bill.  On that basis, I cannot support the amendment and encourage the Senator to withdraw it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#MM00500","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I would not concur that it is more permissive.

This is why it was such a key point of interest.  Section 38 of the Data Protection Act relates to the public interest.  We all recognise that public interest is an important ground for exemption where data might need to be shared.  We felt that public interest requires scrutiny.  I imagine that a large number of those cases where public interest will be invoked will be situations where public bodies are sharing data with other public bodies.  We do not want to hollow out the operation of section 38.  I am happy not to press it at the moment but the Minister of State has not addressed the key questions I had, which were the concerns relating to committee scrutiny in the full sense, necessity and proportionality, the taking of advice from the Data Protection Commission, and the publishing of rationale.  Those are the elements of section 38.  I know there is a new process and do not mind it being done too but any new process needs to have those core elements reflected.  The process that is planned perhaps falls short on a couple of those elements.  Perhaps some happy compromise can be found.

The Bill also requires that the data-sharing agreements be published in advance and open to consultation.  Nothing in the Bill would preclude Members of this House, the other House, or the Data Protection Commissioner from making any kind of observations.  The data protection officers in public bodies who are party to the data-sharing agreement must be satisfied in the first instance that there is agreement and compliance with the data protection law before the agreement is submitted to the data governance board for further scrutiny as to its compliance with data protection.  We have to be confident that any public bodies entering into any agreement have to be satisfied that the existing legislative structure and the GDPR are complied with.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is being done because the data governance board, for which strict provision has been made in the Bill, will arbitrate on the agreements which will be subject to further scrutiny by the Data Protection Commissioner.

None of what I have identified as part of the Bill is laid out in section 38 of the Data Protection Act.  That goes to the core of what the Senator has said, namely, that the Bill reinforces the provisions and supports and scaffolds section 38 of the Data Protection Act in a way that is not done currently.  On that basis, anything that would dilute or erode the provisions of this section would have unintended consequences which I know is not what the Senator intends, and erode exactly what we are trying to have constituted in the Bill in the first instance.

Section 12 states: &quot;This section applies to the disclosure of personal data (other than special categories of personal data) by a public body to another public body, where there is no other enactment or law of the European Union in operation under which specific provision is made permitting or requiring such data-sharing&quot;.  It states it does not apply to special categories of personal data, yet section 6 has effectively been designed in a way which will permit an intersection between the public service identity dataset and section 12, with the exception of one small part of it.  The problem that arises is that the public service identity dataset contains special categories of personal information.  Under the GDPR, biometric data are defined as including facial images which allow for the unique identification or authentication of a natural person.  There will be circumstances where biometric data such as facial images and photographs will need to be exchanged.  Article 9 of the GDPR sets out the circumstances in which it may occur.  Special measures need to be taken to safeguard special categories of personal data which include facial images.  There is tension between section 12 in not wanting to deal with special categories of personal data and section 6 which covers how the dataset which contains special categories of personal data will be processable under section 12.  <\/p><p>I recognise that only specified bodies, not every public body, will exchange the data, but there is tension and I have put forward a few ways by which it might be tackled.  I have suggested the inclusion of the words &quot;excepting such parts of that public service identity which constitute special categories of personal data&quot;.  I have put forward another version in which I spell out the special categories of personal data to which I am referring and recognise that there may be interpretational differences.  That is the reason I have put forward two versions.  Amendment No. 2 which spells out biometric data include data &quot;such as facial images which allow for the unique identification or authentication of a natural person&quot; is better, stronger and clearer, but I recognise that the Minister, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and others are considering and questioning whether photographs constitute biometric data.  There should be no objection to amendment No. 3 which I hope the Minister of State will accept.  It provides for the insertion of the following words &quot;excepting such parts of that public service identity which constitute special categories of personal data&quot;.  That would make section 6 directly compliant with section 12 which states it does not apply to special categories of personal data.  Amendment No. 3 would simply reinforce that special categories of personal data would not be processed under section 12.  It is an issue of direct compatibility.  I will find it difficult to understand if the Minister of State does not accept amendment No. 3, although my preference would be for him to accept amendment No. 2.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 4 provides for the insertion of the following words &quot;where the information is disclosed [it must be] in accordance with the Act and compliant with Article 9 of GDPR&quot;.  Where there are special categories of personal information, Article 9 of the GDPR becomes relevant and must be abided by.  Another amendment proposes the insertion of the words &quot;where the information is disclosed in accordance with Article 9 of the GDPR&quot;.  These are literally suggestions.  <\/p><p>I have also indicated that section 6 is opposed, an issue that will be discussed separately.  I question if this is the appropriate place in which to deal with it.  Section 6 refers to the public service dataset and specified bodies under the social welfare legislation of 2005.  Many argue a social welfare Bill is the appropriate place in which to tamper with the terms of social welfare legislation and that we should wait for the next social welfare Bill to do so, especially given that the generality of this Bill deals with public bodies, whereas the social welfare Bill only deals with a closed set of specified bodies.  I know that the Minister of State wants to put some of the other good practices in place and perhaps that might be the appropriate Bill in which to do so in the context of how specified bodies engage with each other.  Giving him the benefit of the doubt, it is the only rationale I see for the inclusion of section 6 in this Bill, but if it is to remain in the Bill, it must be compatible with section 12 and, crucially, the GDPR.  Currently, there is an incompatibility.  <\/p><p>A particular concern arises in that regard, given that this is one of the issues being considered by the Data Protection Commission and which has been part of the debate on the public services card, on which we are still awaiting the decision of the commission.  Amendment No. 3 has been phrased mildly in that it does not seek to anticipate what the decision of the commission might be.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Amendment No. 2 is probably somewhat more specific and reflects what I believe is the correct interpretation.

It is important to point out that the observations of the Data Protection Commissioner and those involved in pre-legislative scrutiny have been incorporated in the Bill.<\/p> <p>On whether we have the luxury of waiting, I draw attention to a point I made on Second Stage regarding Part 5 of the Bill which is not referred to in these amendments but is of concern to me and other Oireachtas Members and regards the sharing of information to accrue pension entitlements.  All elements of the Bill have been formulated with the objective of protecting people&rsquo;s information and enabling a seamless public service.  I am a little hesitant to begin picking out parts of the Bill, particularly as it has undergone pre-legislative scrutiny but I am satisfied that data sharing is provided for under section 6 of the Bill and is restricted to the sharing of personal data only and that, as set out in section 12 of the Bill, the sharing of special categories is not permitted.  In addition, although it is not referenced in these amendments, section 36 of the Bill makes clear that special category data may not form part of a base registry.  Furthermore, the Bill sets out in section 5 that nothing in the Bill shall affect the operation of data protection law, including the GDPR.  As such, any actions carried out under this Bill must be fully compliant with the GDPR.  There is no need to restate that elsewhere in the Bill and to do so may give rise to confusion as to whether GDPR applies to some provisions of the Bill but not others.<\/p> <p>Having reviewed the issues raised by amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, with the Office of the Attorney General, I draw attention to the fact that the Bill does not try to unwind the public services card, to which reference was made, and which has widespread support across this House.  As PPS numbers are currently widely used by public bodies in the State, it is important that the legislation clarifies the position on the sharing of data.  Accordingly, section 6(1) of the Bill provides that it does not affect the operation of the 2005 Act except as set out elsewhere in section 6.  I know we are going around the houses somewhat but, having reflected on the four amendments, I think they could have unintended consequences and, on that basis, I do not support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#OO00200","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>We are going around the houses and we are going around the amendments because the section on pensions has absolutely nothing to do with this section, section 6, and base registries have nothing to do with these amendments.  The key questions and concerns I raised have not been addressed.  I have not raised concerns about pensions or base registries.  Nobody is in a position to invoke the Data Protection Commissioner as endorsing the Bill as the data protection commission is the adjudicator on rather than the promoter or presenter of a Bill.  We await a decision and report from the data protection commission on the public services card and, more importantly, the public services data set, which is addressed here.<\/p> <p>PPS numbers are very widely used and they are a key point but over the past year and a half photographs and biometric data have been added to that data set.  There is nothing wrong with the PPS numbers being shared as a normal category of personal data but there is a concern in regard to the processing of photographic and facial images, especially given the new contracts in social welfare and other areas.  Ultimately, there may need to be a mechanism whereby the PPSN element is shared but the photographic element thereof is shared under a different set of provisions compatible with Article 9 of the GDPR.  Article 9 is clear that the data may be shared but provides the circumstances in which that may be done.  Section 12 provides a completely different set of rules for the sharing of those data.  That is not to say that facial images cannot be shared but, rather, that that must be done in a manner compatible with Article 9.  It may be that the rest of the data set is shared under one set of rules and the photographs under another or that section 12 is adapted such that it is compatible with Article 9 of the GDPR.  It may be that section 12 will provide the grounds for most processing public bodies but specified bodies will operate on different grounds.  There is an incompatibility.  Saying it is confusing or talking about inadvertent consequences does not deal with the incompatibility which we must address.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to outline his objection to amendment No. 3.  If he is of the belief that the Bill already provides for the provisions in the amendment, why not clarify that such parts of the public service identity which constitute special categories of personal data would not be processed under section 12?

All of these amendments are being proposed to resolve a problem of legal incompatibility arising from a 2015 European Court of Justice case between Google Spain and a Spanish citizen.  I am addressing the same issue in sections 6 and 12 and in a later section as well.<\/p><p>I will quote from section 12 because it is the easiest one to use to make my point.  It provides that one of the grounds on which data sharing will be permitted will be, &quot;to avoid the financial and administrative burden that would otherwise be imposed on the second mentioned public body or on another person were the second mentioned public body to collect the personal data directly&quot;.  The key point is that European Court of Justice rulings make it very clear that &quot;the financial and administrative burden&quot;, as it is phrased here with a pejorative slant, is not in itself an acceptable basis on which to share data.<\/p><p>I recognise that we are talking about a combination of a public body's performance of its functions and its desire to avoid financial and administrative costs.  It is clear that the sharing of the personal data of individuals between public bodies will be allowed any time it happens to be a bit cheaper or handier for that public body.  Therefore, this extraordinarily wide provision will apply under almost all circumstances.<\/p><p>The European Court of Justice has previously recognised that this system does not work if a public body can simply say it is financially and administratively easier for it to get the data without having to go through any other normal process.  Such an approach does not stand up in the rulings of the European Court of Justice.  In the case involving Google Spain and other search engines, they argued that it was administratively and financially burdensome on them to exercise and vindicate the right to be forgotten of the individual or data subject.  It was ruled that it would never be necessary or proportionate for them to act on that basis.<\/p><p>We will come back to the question of what is necessary or proportionate later in this debate.  It is certainly the case that financial and administrative ease is not a necessary or proportionate ground.  The section of the Bill I am seeking to amend does not stand up legally.  We have case law in respect of it.  When I met the departmental officials, it was acknowledged that there may need to be movement in this regard.  I am interested to hear what the Minister of State is proposing in that context.  I will listen to those proposals before I expand on our concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#PP00600","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>There has been a great deal of engagement.  I acknowledge that the Senator has engaged and I thank her for doing so.  She referred to Google Spain, which is a private body.  This Bill refers to two public bodies.  It is not necessarily comparable.<\/p> <p>The Bill refers to a number of prescribed public bodies.  The prescription of the public bodies will make it possible for the Minister to add other public bodies, or other bodies which might yet necessarily be constituted, in the future.  We do not know what size such future bodies might be and we do not know how burdensome that would be.<\/p> <p>Outside of all of that, I repeat the point I made earlier, which was that any data sharing which will be carried out in the future on this basis will need to have regard to all the backstops, namely, the Minister, the governance board and the data commissioner.  While there are two parties to the agreement, we cannot really determine the size and the financial ability of one of those parties at the moment.<\/p> <p>The three amendments before the House propose the removal of the avoidance of a financial and administrative burden as one of the purposes for which data sharing can take place and a registry be designated under this Bill.  The primary legal basis for data sharing under the Bill is Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR, which refers to, \"processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller\".  This Bill, in seeking to further limit the circumstances under which data sharing may occur, lists the avoidance of a financial and administrative burden as one of a list of additional purposes, at least one of which must be engaged in, in order for data sharing to be permitted.  I emphasise that it is just one of the purposes listed.  The aim of this provision is to support the principle that people should have to give their information to a public body once only.  During the pre-legislative scrutiny phase and in earlier discussions in this House, Members said they were very keen to avoid all of us being confronted on a continuous basis with having to provide the same information to public bodies that are trying to deliver services to us.<\/p> <p>If this amendment is agreed, and if this is the only additional purpose a public body is relying on to share data, people will be left having to resubmit documents to public bodies on a continuous basis, rather than enjoying the benefits of the once-only principle.  This would undermine one of the main tenets of the Bill and would militate against the purpose of the Bill and the obligation on public bodies to provide an efficient and effective service.  It would also militate against the efficient and effective use of taxpayers' money by public bodies, which I am sure no one would intend.  We are committed to the implementation of the once-only principle under the Tallinn Declaration on eGovernment, to which Ireland is a signatory.  The Senator&rsquo;s amendment would effectively hold Ireland behind its European counterparts and militate against the achievement of the Tallinn objectives, one of which is the once-only principle.  On that basis, I cannot support these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#PP00700","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>The Tallinn Declaration is a declaration, whereas the GDPR is law.  They are quite different.  The GDPR takes significant precedence on the hierarchy of priority.  I suggest that in invoking the once-only principle, the Minister of State has given the Tallinn Declaration an equivalent status.  However, it is not in any way equivalent to the necessity and proportionality test we now have under the GDPR.<\/p> <p>Convenience, as represented by the once-only principle, is not a ground that stands on its own in fulfilment of the requirements of necessity and proportionality.  That has been determined by the highest courts.  That the case involved a private body rather than a public body is not pertinent in this context because it is a matter of necessity and proportionality.  I am not challenging the grounds we already have regarding a public body's performance of its functions, a large number of which are set out in section 12.  I refer to more effective delivery, etc.  All of those grounds relate to a benefit to the individual data subject whose data this is, who owns this data and whose benefit has to be paramount.  Those are the other circumstances.<\/p> <p>Perhaps it is misleading to refer to this as just one of many purposes.  Only one of these categories is needed to justify the protection of data sharing.  All that is needed is to have the function and the fact of it being administratively and financially convenient or less burdensome to the public body, rather than to the individual.  The Bill that is being proposed is not a matter of convenience to the individual - it is a matter of convenience for the public body.  Again, that is going away from the principles of the Data Protection Acts and the principles of benefit for the individual and, where possible, choice for the individual.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This incompatibility has not been addressed.<\/p><p>There is a reason that these provisions are included in the GDPR.

The grounds provided are so wide that almost any data sharing of individuals' data among public bodies will be possible.  The backstops are not really relevant.  They relate to the process of checking, but the initial data sharing agreement needs to be on a legal basis.  What is proposed in this section - a financial and administrative burden on the public body - is not a legal basis that satisfies the criterion that the data sharing be necessary and proportionate.  It is simply not legal and does not meet that standard.  I ask the Minister of State to re-evaluate the section.

We have had a good debate on the legislation.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins raised the issue of checks and balances and asked whether there is a legal basis for data sharing.  That is the reason we are discussing this Bill.  As I stated, there is a gap in the system and information is being shared on a regular basis.  I do not agree with the Senator's view that convenience is not an issue for citizens.  Convenience is an issue and people legitimately ask why they have to repeatedly submit the same information to Ireland Inc., as it were, to access public services.  People have a right to ask that question.  As the person who signed it, I accept that the Tallinn Declaration is a declaration.  The Senator is also correct that the GDPR is the law and the Bill has been developed to fully reflect that law and all the other data protection legislation on the Statute Book.  <\/p> <p>There is nothing in the Bill that is incompatible with the existing provisions of the law.  I reiterate that section 12(a) provides that personal data is disclosed for the purpose of the performance of a function of a public body and to avoid the financial and administrative burden that would otherwise be imposed on a public body or another person.  It is important to note that this benefits the individual concerned.  We should not lose sight of what we are trying to do, namely, to establish a framework to govern what is already occurring in public bodies.

It is good that he acknowledged that.<\/p> <p>On another issue to which I will return on Report Stage, the definitions of \"public body\" in the Data Protection Act and this Bill are inconsistent.  The definition of \"public body\" in this Bill is very wide.  A significant number of potential actors will fall within the scope of this definition.  A large number of bodies will share data, which is the reason we need to get this right.   With respect, the Minister of State spoke of the Bill having undergone scrutiny but this discussion - the legislative process - is scrutiny.  Many Ministers come to this Chamber and many Senators engage with them and give a higher degree of engagement in terms of recognising that this is the legislative process.  Our role is not to congratulate Ministers on bringing legislation to the House and agree to rubber-stamp it.  It is to ensure we are confident that legislation is as it should be and the proposals being put forward are constructive.  I ask the Minister of State to revisit the provisions of this Bill because I do not want a case to be taken against the State in the European Court of Justice on the basis of the grounds on which data may be shared. <\/p> <p>Crucially, the Minister of State referred again to convenience for individuals.  This would have been a different discussion, although there may still have been problems, if the Minister of State had spoken about the financial and administrative burdens on individuals.  However, the Bill makes no such references but refers instead to the financial and administrative burden on public bodies.  Convenience for individuals is not the ground on which data will be shared, although it, too, is included.  I am specifically querying the inclusion, as a reason for sharing data, of the financial and administrative burden imposed on public bodies.  This will allow any one of the large and growing number of public bodies to refuse a request on the basis that it would be inconvenient.  If the goal were convenience for the individual, a mechanism would be provided to allow individuals to abide by the \"once only\" principle or to allow all their data to be shared to the maximum and in the most convenient way.  It would still be the individual's data, however, because none of them belong to the public bodies, they all belong to the individual.

I am sure Ministers will make further amendments to the list in the future.

The reason for including this provision is to ensure the section is not prescriptive.<\/p><p>I am aware of another amendment to be discussed later, as I referred to it in my Second Stage speech.  The Bill specifically does not include the commercial semi-State companies for the obvious reason that these companies are in the business of trying to make an annual return and dividend for the taxpayer.  It would not be practical to ask them to share information in the format that we are expecting other public bodies to share information.

Again, there is a fundamental tension in the Bill between sections 6 and 12 and I will address the same issue in each of these sections.  The amendment proposes that a &quot;specified body may not make presentation of a public service card or access to a person's public service identity the sole or exclusive basis by which a person may confirm their identity in order to conduct a transaction or access a service.&quot;  It relates to a concern that has arisen regarding the public services card or, more specifically, the public service identity data set.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection which has considered this issue in detail.  Experts in data protection and the Department have made presentations to the committee.  We are awaiting a report from the Data Protection Commissioner who is considering the now notorious issue of whether the public services card is compulsory but not mandatory or mandatory but not compulsory.  The issue is whether it is appropriate to make the presentation of a public services card and-or public service identity data set number, which are effectively the same thing, the only basis by which a person may confirm his or her identity.  A number of challenges have been made to this requirement.  One such challenge was made by a pensioner who was denied a pension on this basis took a challenge.  We now know that persons have been denied child benefit or, potentially, denied student grants on this basis.  In all cases where challenges have been made, the body in question has backed down because the provision does not yet have legal standing.  <\/p><p>Alternative ways to prove identity is required, specifically for persons who are not happy to share their data in the new public service data identity set, which is under investigation.  I acknowledge that many people will choose to use their public services card, which is their prerogative, and many will choose to use the public service identity data set.  However, the Data Protection Commissioner is undertaking a section 10 investigation into a number of issues concerning the public service identity data set, including storage, access and whether the data is adequately secure.  I have listed only some of the issues that are being considered.  In the absence of a clear, strong assurance that the conditions regarding storage are satisfactory and meet the required standards, we should not force anybody to engage with the public services card or make it the only means by which essential services can be accessed.<\/p><p>My amendments to sections 6 and 12 simply suggest that the public services card and public service identity data set should be a non-mandatory means by which a person may verify his or her identity.  They provide that people can use this means and share data for certain purposes.  If an individual finds it wonderfully convenient to use his or her public services card, so be it but he or she should not be forced to do so.  The amendments provide a reasonable middle way whereby the data set can be used but other options are made available.  I hope they will be accepted by the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#RR00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>These amendments relate to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and its relationship to this Bill.  <\/p> <p>In the amendment tabled in respect of section 6, the Senator has proposed that the public services card, or the underlying public service identity data associated with the card, cannot be used as the sole basis by which a person may confirm his or her identity to access a service.

It is a result of the SAFE registration process that the card and MyGovID are the most robust and assured means of establishing a person's identity when he or she accesses a public service.  In this context, it is a matter for each service provider to decide the most appropriate means by which to verify a person's identity.  This should be necessary and proportionate to each service.

The language used by the Minister of State would be perfect and we could provide that there will not be a blanket restriction or requirement.  The decision to roll out the public services card as the only way people can access services is excessive.  For example, it has been presented as the only way a person can access the funds required to return to college and a condition for receiving child benefit or obtaining a passport to leave the country.  Thankfully, the requirement regarding passports has been changed and I applaud the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, for recognising that the provision had no legal basis.  I know that was a surprising move.  I also note the acknowledgement that insisting that people have a public services card before acquiring driving licences and taking the driver theory test was excessive.<\/p> <p>I will be pleased to withdrawn my amendment and accept a Government amendment which exactly captures the need not to have a blanket restriction and to show flexibility regarding the means of identification.

These people should not be forced to use a system that is still imperfect and requires improvement.

One of the key points made in that debate concerned the lack of a clear definition of data sharing.  The current definition simply describes some activities, but it does not describe clearly what the basis might be.  Some of the bases, for which there is a strong precedent in law, as I am suggesting, include a case by case basis for the validation and verification of data; a defined batch processing basis for the validation, verification and updating of specific populations of data and a once-off consolidation and integration of disparate datasets to form a new, shared, master data repository or a new base registry, as recognised later in the Bill.

If I came here with a narrow definition, I am sure we would be having a different debate and Senators would be arguing that the Minister was trying to restrict what was covered by the Bill for the purpose of the establishment of data sharing agreements between agencies and was doing so to suit himself.  The reason we have not done so is to make sure we capture everything that can be properly constituted as data sharing, which includes the disclosure of information and personal data by a public body to another public body.  The definition is wide because it should be.<\/p> <p>The Senator proposes changing the definition of data sharing which is set out in section 8 and used throughout the Bill.  It would have a consequential impact on section 18 which specifies the information that shall, at a minimum, be set out in a data-sharing agreement.  The purpose of section 8 is to provide a definition of data sharing.  This provision does not set out the processes under which data may be shared.  In addition, sections 12(1) and 14(1) set out the conditions under which data sharing may take place in the context of national and EU law. <\/p> <p>We have, as I said, set out a wide definition of data sharing to ensure all forms of data sharing that may be carried out by public bodies will be captured and, therefore, regulated by the legislation.  If the definition was limited, as the Senator is proposing, it would mean that other forms of data sharing not captured by the proposed definition would not be subject to the governance and other provisions of the Bill such as the limitations on processing set out in section 12 and the requirements for formal data-sharing agreements and associated consultation, scrutiny and transparency provisions, as I mentioned.  I do not think that is what the Senator intended.<\/p> <p>Section 18 specifies the information which shall, at a minimum, be included in a data-sharing agreement.  Among other things, it provides that public bodies must set out the purpose, function and legal basis for sharing and processing the data concerned and specify what data are to be disclosed and how they will be processed.  Notwithstanding that the requirements for the content of the agreements are comprehensive, section 18(2) gives the Minister the power to prescribe additional information that must be included in a data-sharing agreement, if required.<\/p> <p>The Senator&rsquo;s amendment to section 18 is very technical.  People want to know what data are held and why, what they are being used for, for how long they will be held, who is going to use them and what internal processing works will be used.

There is a need for a level of clarity on why it is happening and the basis on which it is happening.  Is it on a case by case basis?

There are entirely different definitions of public body in the Data Protection Act and the Bill before us.  The definition of public body in the Bill includes some elements of the definition in the Act and some elements of what are described in the Act as &quot;public authorities&quot;.  A potential tension arises because certain entities, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a number of other bodies, are described as public authorities in the Act but as public bodies in the Bill.  That conflict is a concern. <\/p><p>It is not simply the case that a public authority and public body have equivalent meanings because the Data Protection Act includes separate definitions of &quot;public body&quot; and &quot;public authority&quot;.  The definition of the former in the Bill takes a little from column A and a little from column B, which creates confusion.  We will have circumstances in which a concern or ambiguity will arise about whether an entity, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is considered a public body or a public authority.  As we can imagine, the Data Protection Act and this Bill will closely interact and are naturally linked because they substantially overlap.  I expect many cases will arise in which both are invoked, yet they have different definitions.<\/p><p>I will not press the amendment, which is an attempt to alert the Minister of State to this issue.  Amendment No. 9 would take the definition of a public body from the Data Protection Act and make it the definition in the Bill.  I recognise that certain groups and entities the Minister of State wants to absorb into the Bill will not be captured by the amendment, but this is one way of making the Bill and the Act compatible.  I am open to other proposals the Minister of State or Department may have on how to make them compatible. <\/p><p>It creates an inappropriate legal ambiguity when the House passes legislation featuring certain definitions and a few months later it is proposed that we pass legislation featuring a completely different definition which clashes with the original definition in the same area.  I am open to proposals from the Minister of State on how to resolve this issue and I hope he will put forward Government amendments to address it.  Amendment No. 9 is one way of addressing it, albeit one which I recognise is quite blunt as it proposes to take the public body definition from the Data Protection Act and put it into the Bill.  If the Minister has other suggestions I am very open to them.<\/p><p>The Minister said that the definition of public body is very wide.  We should bear in mind that these bodies may share data with each other.  As the Minister said, subsection (<i>q<\/i>) refers to any other body which a Minister decides to make into a public body.  Any body, public entity or company could become a public body.  We need to have firewalls in that respect.  In cases where the Minister designates as a public body under this section a body whose activities and functions do not relate to the delivery of services to the public under an agreement with the public body, the Minister should publish regulations on suitable and specific safeguards to protect against inappropriate access or data shared under the Act within the body.  For example, if a company which is under contract to the State to deliver one kind of service and, on that basis, is given access to a data set for that purpose, we need to ensure suitable safeguards are in place if a commercial section exists within the same organisation.  If an entity has other clients besides the State, there must be clear safeguarding of data shared by any public body with this entity, that is, the public body for the purposes of the Bill, which may be involved in commercial, State and public activities that may serve public and private purposes.<\/p><p>I am not attempting to be prescriptive and I will leave space and discretion to the Minister of State to set out the regulations.  I have used the same wording we used for the Minister for Justice and Equality in regard to the general data protection regulation, namely, &quot;suitable and specific safeguards&quot;.  I expect everybody will agree there should be some safeguards in place.  If we are to allow data to be shared by a Department with other fully public entities or partly public and private entities, rules will be required on how we protect such data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#TT00600","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>As I said, the reason there is a wide definition of public bodies in the Bill is the same reason to which Senator Higgins referred.

That is why the definition is as wide as it is.  Section 9(4) states that:<\/p><blockquote>The Minister may, at the request of a body that would not otherwise be included in the definition of &ldquo;public body&rdquo; in subsection (1) and with the consent of the Minister of the Government in whom functions in relation to that body are vested, by order designate that body as a public body where&mdash;<blockquote>(a) that body is financed wholly or partly, whether directly or indirectly, by means of moneys provided, or loans made or guaranteed, by a Minister of the Government or the issue of shares held by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government, and <br \/><br \/>(b) the Minister is satisfied that the principal activity of the body is the delivery of services to the public under an agreement with a public body.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>This covers circumstances in which there is part funding or whole funding.<\/p><p>I completely understand the issues relating to bodies and authorities.  The term &quot;authority&quot; is used more in European Union law than in Irish law.  Irish law has generally and historically referred to bodies and it is on that basis that references are to &quot;public bodies&quot;.  The wording in the amendment would mean the Bill would only apply to those public bodies established under the Companies Act 2014.  An unintended consequence of that would be that the Bill would not apply to the Civil Service, local authorities, the HSE, the Garda, education and training boards and several other bodies. <\/p><p>As I said when I introduced the Bill in the House last week, it is the Department's intention that the Bill should apply to as wide a number of public bodies as possible.  At a minimum, Government Departments and offices, local authorities and the HSE should be able to share data under the Bill.  They already do so, albeit in a legal vacuum which needs to be addressed.  It is on that basis that we are introducing the Bill.

As no similar requirement applied in the case of the Data Protection Act, a different approach to the definition was necessary and was used.  The two definitions do not have to be identical because the processes are completely different and the differences reflect the different requirements of both pieces of legislation.

Again, this is about making clear that that test is being applied.  In the Data Protection Act, it is clear that it should be applied in many cases and that was reinforced in several sections.  There was strong agreement across the Oireachtas, from colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in among others, to ensure that necessity and proportionality be made visible as a consideration.  In regard to page 15 line 4, I suggest the insertion of reference to the necessity and proportionality test within the section on directions regarding personal data.  I also suggest reference hereto on page 18 in regard to the content of the data sharing agreement, which is perhaps the most important place for it.  Necessity and proportionality must be the underpinning consideration in a decision to share data between public bodies.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a danger whereby the ease and smoothness of data sharing becomes the norm when we share data.  Necessity and proportionality need to be applied consistently, and this is very clear in the general data protection regulations to every purpose to which data is put.  It may be that every purpose meets that test, but necessity and proportionality must be applied.  There is a concern in the establishment that these data-sharing agreements would bring in a level of complacency.  Consider the Road Safety Authority, for example, and another entity - albeit semi-State agencies are excluded.  I refer to cases where public bodies from this proposed wide list have established an agreed data-sharing agreement, even between the driver theory test section and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, for example, it may cover everything.  It is important there would be a reminder that every time data is shared and every decision that is made to share data must meet the tests of necessity and proportionality, and that the purpose to which data is being used is constantly put under that scrutiny.<\/p><p>This data belongs to the individuals in many cases.  This is personal data that belongs to people and they need to be assured, as was said in the previous debate about rationale on Second Stage, that there is always a rationale for why their data are being shared, and that it is always necessary and proportionate.  This does not mean a huge or exhausting process every time, it just means that the test applies.  This is very clear under the GDPR.<\/p><p>I put it to the Minister of State that we are potentially talking about hundreds of data-sharing agreements because it covers a very large number of public bodies, and the Minister of State has quite rightly said it is a growing number, which are all sharing data with other public bodies.  This is a large number of data-sharing agreements being established.  If these data-sharing agreements are the key architecture of this Bill and how our State plans to share our information, then necessity and proportionality need to be built in at ground level.  This is why I urge the consideration test.  I have included it in two places, but the particularly important aspect is necessity and proportionality within the data-sharing agreement section.<\/p><p>The other two amendments that have been added to this section of the debate - I probably would not have added them but they are here - are around privacy sharing and data protection impact assessments.  I recognise that a data protection impact assessment is not always needed, necessary or relevant.  What is always needed and relevant, however, is a demonstration of consideration as to whether an assessment is needed or not.  Although I had considered it in this section, I have not suggested that a data protection impact assessment would always be conducted, because I realise there are many cases where it is not necessarily pertinent.  It is reasonable, however, to propose there would be consideration of whether it is needed or not.  This is the level, namely, that it simply requires a demonstration that whether or not a data protection privacy impact assessment is needed, it has been thought about.<\/p><p>Has amendment No. 17 been included in this group of amendments under discussion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#UU01700","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 13 and 15 to 17, inclusive, are under discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#VV00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 17 is a technical amendment.  It is clear.  There is a little bit of ambiguity here.  I regard it as a different issue and therefore a different discussion, but it relates to the ambiguity around the lead agencies and data sharing, and where that stands.  Consider the situation where there are data controllers within two public bodies, for example, in the context of discussion about lead agencies.  If an individual person has a concern there is a question over who he or she should go to.  We do not want a situation where individuals are being sent from pillar to post.<\/p> <p>The European Court of Justice ruling in 2015 made it very clear that both of the data controllers are liable.  We cannot have a situation where one data controller says, \"Well they were the lead agency so do not look to us\".  Both of the data controllers are liable.  While a lead agency may be a preferred point of contact, and while the lead agency may take the responsibility for outreach and so on, the amendment is important because it makes clear that this section of the Bill outlines how individuals may engage with the lead agency, \"without prejudice to and does not limit the rights of a person as a data subject in respect of any or all data controllers in a data sharing agreement\".  This makes it clear and ensures that Ireland is compatible with the European Court of Justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#VV00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>With regard to whether or not we are being complacent, it is important to make a few points.  The Senator spoke of the tests for necessity and proportionality.  These are absolutely necessary and they are happening currently.  Data is being shared at the moment, which is necessary and the agreements are necessary.  They need, however, to have a legal basis, and hence this Bill.<\/p> <p>Consider what is included in the Bill to cover proportionality, complacency and all the checkpoints and all the safeguards.  There is public consultation and publication online.  I am aware there is a later amendment on the timeframes that are allowed and whether or not there can be greater scope for that.  This is certainly an aspect I am very amenable to.<\/p> <p>On the agreements themselves there is scope around how the agreements are drawn up, who the lead agencies are and who the base registry holder is.  Given that this is a data-sharing Bill that will cover public bodies we have also taken a lot of time to make sure the governance board would have the proper people to see that everything is done in accordance with the Bill.  The data commissioner will be in the background and will have oversight on the laying of the agreements.  The agreements will have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister will also be involved.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins alluded to hundreds of agreements.  I believe there will be thousands of data-sharing agreements that will need to be registered.  That will tell us the level of sincerity and commitment the Government has on the issue.  This will take quite a considerable amount of resources.  We shall do this to make sure the public has confidence in us to mind, supervise and use the data for the purpose for which it is collected.  I agree that this has not always been the case.  The Bill is being brought before the House because this lacuna in the law needs to be cleared up.<\/p> <p>With regard to the lead agency and from the perspective of individuals who could be bounced around as the Senator has said \"from pillar to post\", the Bill makes it very clear that the lead agency must deal with the individual's request.  The agency cannot try to send the fool further or send people around the houses from Billy, to Jack, to Jim.  It does not prevent the citizen from going to the data commissioner.  It also does not prevent the individual from using the provisions available to him or her for consultations to have his or her views heard.  Given that the agreements will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas there will be opportunities for Deputies and Senators to make observations also.  In fairness, there are an amount of safeguards included.<\/p> <p>Discussion on amendments Nos. 13 and 16 went together.  I want to refer to amendments Nos. 15 and 17, which are related.  Amendment No. 15 proposes that a public body should, \"demonstrate a consideration of whether there is a need for a data protection impact assessment\".  As I have said, the Bill must comply with the GDPR.  Article 35 of the GDPR sets out when a data protection impact assessment must be carried out.  It is in the law already.  The Bill provides, at section 18(1)(h), that where a data protection impact assessment has been carried out, a summary of the assessment must be provided in a schedule to the agreement.  This is in accordance with the guidance on data protection impact assessments issued by the European Commission&rsquo;s Article 29 data protection working party.  The Senator&rsquo;s amendment proposes an additional requirement on public bodies that they would provide an explanation in the data-sharing agreement of what they considered in deciding whether or not to carry out an assessment.  This is not required under the GDPR and I do not consider it appropriate to oblige public bodies to go further than the GDPR in this regard.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 17 concerns the role of the data controller as specified in section 20 of the Bill.  This refers to lead agencies.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This section requires one of the parties to the data-sharing agreement to be designated as the lead agency responsible for carrying out the functions specified in the section and elsewhere in the Bill.

The GDPR sets out the rights of data subjects and this section of the Bill does not override those rights; it serves to extend them by providing that the lead agency is obliged to deal with requests made by data subjects to exercise their rights under the GDPR.  In other words, the Senator will not be sent around the houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#VV00400","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>While someone might not be sent around the houses, which I understand from the reference to the lead agency - in fairness to the Minister of State, he has affirmed it - it would be useful to affirm it in the Bill to be clear that it does not in any way prejudice someone's right to call to each of the relevant houses.<\/p> <p>Having heard what the Minister of State had to say, I almost reinforce the point about necessity and proportionality.  Necessity is not about the need at the very beginning to have a legal basis because we know that we are operating illegally.  I am surprised that there are not more public alarm bells about the fact that the State is not operating with a legal basis for what it is doing, but that is not the necessity.  The necessity and proportionality test applies each time one uses the data.  It is not about whether in general we need data protection agreements; rather, it is about each data-sharing agreement and how it applies.  There is a real concern in that regard.  In fairness, we are describing that the public will have a chance, but at the same time we are being told that there will be thousands of such agreements.  It is not the job of the public to test data-sharing agreements for necessity and proportionality.  It is not the job of the Data Protection Commissioner to do so, except in the general sense of oversight.  It is not the job of the data governance board, to which we will come.  It is the job at foundation level when two public bodies are agreeing to share personal information.  They must be satisfied at the starting point that it is necessary and proportionate.  It is not for people to catch it down the line.  It is not an issue of backstops.  It is not for the public who already put huge work into guarding data protection.  I applaud many individual citizens who have made great efforts in that regard.  It is for the public bodies who are making the decision to share data between them.  What I am saying is that it needs to be in that bit of the Bill.  I do not think it would take anything from the Bill and its operation, but it would add a certain assurance for the public.  I, therefore, urge the Minister of State to strongly consider taking it up on Report Stage.  I refer simply to mentioning necessity and proportionality and making it clear that they will be key considerations for the two public bodies involved in respect of the thousands of agreements that will be happening.<\/p> <p>I will not press the other amendments at this point.  On the question of data controllers, the Minister of State made it clear in his narrative and it would be nice if it was clearer in the Bill.

In other words, on the point made by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins about who would start the process, the data protection officer in each of the public bodies must state they are satisfied that the agreements are in order.

This effectively precludes public bodies from asking individuals for their data.  I recognise that there are situations in which public bodies might be more appropriate where consent is not the appropriate legal basis, particularly in situations with vulnerable users.  However, this does not simply state that there are certain circumstances under which a public body would go to the base registry and use that as the legal basis.  This literally forbids public bodies from engaging in other ways with citizens and individuals in the public and there are many public bodies where that data is on a base registry.  For example, someone cannot necessarily be asked what their address is.  Many public bodies provide services that need to be done on a legislative basis and there are other cases in which consent is the appropriate mechanism.  It may be the difference between being included in a Christmas raffle list as well another list.  At the moment somebody cannot be asked if they want to be in the Christmas raffle list as well as whatever else, their data has to just be taken from the base registry.  The provision precludes public bodies from having the discretion to recognise that there are certain aspects of their business whereby asking people might be the appropriate route.<\/p><p>My amendment simply states \"other than where that information may be sought or collected on the basis of direct consent of the person or data subject\".  I am simply introducing the option for a public body, in some of its dealings with people, to occasionally use consent.  That is the key concern there.  I recognise that there are certain situations or circumstances where it is not appropriate but this basically forbids the use of any other method or means of engagement.  It must be borne in mind that there is not a right to be informed on this.  If a person's name or address is in the base registry, he or she cannot be asked.  If that person's name, age and address and any other information are in the base registry he or she cannot be asked for that information, it has to be taken.  That seems to me to be excessively onerous on public bodies and to be an overreach.<\/p><p>I regard my amendment as excessively mild and I may revisit some issues on Report Stage.  I have genuinely come into this on Committee Stage with what I thought were achievable and reasonable amendments.  If progress does not come in any of these areas then I will come back with amendments for my ideal Bill and what it would look like.  Right now, at a minimum, we should allow public bodies, in the circumstances where it is appropriate and consent is an option, to have the option of using consent.  Part of that is the relationship that public bodies have with those clients and users of their services.  Part of it is the iterative process such as in the case of people who are accessing the data of vulnerable people.  Sometimes the dynamic of repeatedly asking questions is part of the relationship building that leads to the effective functioning of a public body and an effective delivery of a service.  The Minister of State might indicate if he is willing to give that flexibility because I am worried that we are cutting the data subjects out completely from the operation of public services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#WW03500","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>We are not cutting anyone out of it.

Things will happen between citizens and public bodies, where consent is an appropriate mechanism.  Right now the Bill states clearly that the public body shall not collect or use such information for that purpose from a source other than the designated base registry.  That source includes the individual, the data subject.  Public bodies are being precluded from seeking information from a data subject on the basis of consent.  The Minister of State said consent can be inferred.  It cannot.  In many of the functions consent is not inferred and is not even relevant in the case of some functions of public bodies but there are other functions of public bodies where consent is relevant and is required under the GDPR.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State is creating a tension because of the once-only principle he has described.  It is in the Tallinn Declaration but the once-only principle has no legal status compared to the general data protection regulation.  It is nice as an aspiration and it is there as a goal but do not let us pretend that this is the overarching principle which trumps every single other part of our law and of European law.  We are getting excessive emphasis on it.  On that basis there could be a base registry where people give their personal data once, they have one point of contact ever and then thousands of data sharing agreements are put in place and that individual does not have engagement with any part of the State again because all of the public bodies share data.  There is a danger there.  That is excessive.  I understand that the Minister of State wants efficiencies and there is great scope for that but it needs to be balanced with transparency, appropriate checks and balances and the individual data subject's rights in engagement with the State.  That balancing is skewed in this Bill at the moment.  I have not said not to use this in any case.  I am saying to allow public bodies to recognise that there are points whereby checking in again would be good because right now they are not even allowed to check in again if that information is on a base registry.  That is a concern because they cannot provide transparency to citizens in that way at the moment.  We could end up with a very distant State and set of operation of public bodies which is contrary to effective functioning and a sense of engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018062600002#XX00700","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1530019800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I am at the risk of repeating myself.
