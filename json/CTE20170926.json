I will give a brief synopsis of the tillage sector in its current form.  The total area under tillage in 2017 is 316,000 ha.  This is made up of 264,000 ha of cereals and the remaining 52,000 ha is made up of beet, maize, rapeseed and protein crops.  It is interesting to note that the cereal acreage is down 5.7% in 2016 and over 14% in the past five years.  These are scary figures for us.  It must be noted that there were over 1 million hectares of arable area in pre-war times.  A focus on beef and dairy cattle to supply the British market, as a result of a vast proportion of grassland there had been ploughed up to produce cereals and vegetables to feed Britain's growing population, resulted in the majority of land here being used to produce monocrop grass and the tillage areas remained in a few small pockets throughout the country, mainly in the south, the east and the midlands.  The area of land used for arable farming in Ireland is under 9% of the total of land in agricultural use.  The remaining land is either grassland for beef, dairy or sheep, approximately 80%, or managed forestry, 10.8%.<\/p> <p>  We currently need to import over 1 million tonnes of animal feed every year.  Ireland's temperate climate allows for some of the consistently highest yields in the world.  The importance of the Irish tillage sector should not be overlooked.  One acre of malt barley has the ability to produce over &euro;60,000 in revenue per annum for the Exchequer.  Bee, bird and wildlife populations thrive in well-managed tillage areas because there is always a constant supply of food for them.  Locally produced crops keep jobs local.  Employees in haulage, storage, processing and machinery sales and merchants and agronomists are all needed in this regard.  Imported crops do not produce as many of these jobs in the economy.<\/p> <p>  We envisage a growing demand for premium food grade crops for use in the beverage industry and export food market, such as gluten-free oats and malt barley.  We would like to see native wheat replace 90,000 tonnes of imported maize used in some Irish whiskeys.  Irish whiskey production is set to increase by 300% by 2030.  Demand for malt is forecast to rise from 200,000 tonnes to 300,000 tonnes.  In the region of 4,000 tonnes of barley were used in the production of craft beers in 2016 and this is forecast to be 24,000 tonnes by 2020.<\/p> <p>  There has been a 31% increase in the number of dairy cows and the national herd overall has increased from 6.3 million to 7.4 million.  Dairy cattle in particular require more protein, and an area of increased demand is Irish produced protein to replace imported genetically modified, GM, soya, which would give a fully traceable guaranteed Irish, non-GM product.  The protein payments have greatly increased the use of, and demand for, beans and peas in rations.<\/p> <p>  As stated, the area under arable during pre-war times was over 1 million ha.  A lot of land is under-utilised and there are many \"naked acres\" across the country.  We are seeing a drop in area in tillage, mainly due to poor pricing of the products.  If there was a fair price, farmers would be eager to produce more.  We have the land base and technology to produce all of our feed and should not require any imports of animal feed.  The Irish climate is almost perfectly suited to growing cereals.  While we have difficult conditions, particularly around harvest, for example, this year, we do not have the extremes that other nations do, which gives us a reasonably consistent yield of grain.<\/p> <p>  We need first to promote our non-GM status and push for fully traceable beef, dairy, pigs and poultry to be completely GM-free using non-GM proteins in rations.  There is no doubt that there are potential benefits to growing GM crops but it is viewed negatively by the premium consumer and we believe that Ireland, as an island nation, has a unique advantage in establishing a completely GM-free end-use product using native grains.  There are endless marketing possibilities for Irish products if there is linked-up thinking between all sectors and relevant bodies.  That said, tillage farmers should be rewarded for growing these crops with a unique selling point.  It is impossible to try to produce these premium products while competing with imported GM feed.  We would seriously encourage the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, Bord Bia, Origin Green and farmers to consider the idea of a GM-free Ireland.  It must be understood that there are big changes in the area of GM and what is classified as such.  Some farmers in the UK were in favour of Brexit because they thought it might open them to using GM technology on their crops.  If we were to consider the idea of a GM-free Ireland, farmers would need a premium or it would not work.<\/p> <p>  Organic farming has great potential in Ireland and needs to be supported.  Many cattle and sheep farmers are farming organically already and do not realise it.  For the majority of grain farmers, however, the issue is marketing and selling the product.  Apart from organic oats, there is not a huge demand for organic barley.  The market for organic beer is a relatively small and the organic beef industry does not have the demand for organic barley or wheat that would entice people to convert vast areas used for conventional cereal production.  Most organic beef is grass fed or finished on home grown forage crops.<\/p> <p>  The real future crops are those suited to Irish conditions, namely, barley, wheat, sugar beet, oats, beans, peas and rapeseed.  The use of first-generation energy crops can have a positive impact on food and energy.  Rapeseed can be used to produce pure plant oil, which can be mixed with diesel fuel, and a food oil.  The crop produces approximately one third oil and two thirds cake, which is the by-product that can be used in animal feed.  Likewise, sugar beet can be used to produce ethanol to be mixed with petrol.  These crops can be considered multi-use in nature because of their ability to be used in the production of food or fuel.  In both cases, the by-products can be used in animal feed.  These crops are break crops, which means that they form an integral part of crop rotation and give a yield boost in the following cereal crop.  Sugar beet, along with maize, can be used in anaerobic digestion, AD.  Again, these are both break crops and their use gives better yields in the following crop.  The by-product of AD, digestate, is a valuable fertiliser.  Feed-in tariffs and renewable heat incentive to encourage capital investment in plants are required to encourage farm-scale AD plants, which have the added benefit of taking significant pressure off the electricity grid and keeping production local.  There are many farm-scale AD plants operating in the UK and continental Europe.<\/p> <p>  Rather than encouraging valuable land out of production to grow energy crops such as miscanthus and willow, a better use of straw in combined heat and power, CHP, plants would be a more advisable route.  Miscanthus and willow are single-use crops and, if required, could be grown on more marginal land.  There is a need for 40,000 to 50,000 ha of energy crops to act as a carbon sink to mitigate against the 7.4 million cattle in the country.  All arable crops can help to mitigate against this because arable farming is carbon neutral at worst.  The introduction of more first-generation energy crops provides a more diverse rotation and encourages more ecological activity increasing, in particular, worm and bee populations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Clive Carter"},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#E00100","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carter for his presentation.

This sector stands out in Irish agriculture in that we are not self-sufficient in it and it is unfortunate to be importing grain when we have such a strong natural capacity to grow it.  Mr. Carter outlined how the percentage of land under crops has reduced in recent years.  What immediate action should we take to redress this?  The margin is the biggest difficulty and is driving down the numbers involved in the sector, along with the increase in the dairy herd in recent years.<\/p> <p>  Last year, a number of farmers along the west coast lost crops.

The grain industry is at a serious crossroads.  Coming up to Dublin this morning I saw combines working very hard and it is the second year in a row that we have had bad weather for the spring harvest.  The price grain has been getting in the past couple of years makes the economics of grain production in this country very questionable.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Carter posed as many questions as he gave us facts, and that is not a criticism because he is entitled to represent his sector.  He spoke of promoting a non-GM status for the country.  Can that work in practice?  We have an expanding dairy herd and our beef will always have a demand for grain but, at the current grain price, farmers are going to look at a value ration.  How practical is it to give ourselves GM-free status and put a wall around our country?  Flahavans pay a premium for oats for their porridge but it is a very limited market.  Will Irish whiskey be another niche market?  What tonnage potential does it have?  If we get niche markets such as these going, it takes away from the argument that we can supply the dairy and beef industry.  Can the sector carry through on this?  Can we be GM-free and, at the same time, keep our other industries cost-effective?<\/p> <p>  The future for the grain sector is in energy crops and anaerobic digesters.  Deputy McConalogue and I met an individual last week who has plans as to how this could be advanced.  The tillage sector has a huge role to play in the production of gas and in meeting our emission targets but it is something on which we have not focused at all.  If this sector is to survive, this is the way it will do so, with the by-products able to be used in the production of food.<\/p><p>I accept that GM-free status sounds lovely and it sounds like it would be attractive to the consumer, but both dairy and beef farmers have to be able to produce their products at cost.  If we go down that road, is it achievable?  I would seriously question whether it is achievable.  To me, the future is in diversity and doing something we have never done before with our crops.  We have lost our sugar beet industry.  I see us going the way of New Zealand very quickly so that all we will have are Friesian cows and that will be the only industry we have.  We see our suckler herd under huge pressure.  Mr. Carter gave us the figures relating to cereals and the way they could drop.  I am from Tipperary.  The conacre sector is definitely losing land to grass on a rapid basis and most of it is going into dairy.  If that slide is not stopped fairly quickly, it will be a retrograde step if we focus all of this country on one industry.  Putting all our eggs in one basket is never a good thing.  We must look outside.  What worked for us ten or 15 years' ago will not work going forward.  The price the world market is returning for grain is at such a level that we must be more imaginative about how we can help this sector to survive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#E00600","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506438000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I will deal with Deputy Kenny's question about the area of tillage at the moment versus what happened historically.  Mr. Carter or Mr. Miller will address the issue of acre of barley and what it produces.  I will deal with Deputy Cahill's question about GM and energy and then switch back.<\/p> <p>  As we said in our presentation, there were one million plus hectares of arable land in the country in pre-war times.  Why has it declined?  It has done so for many reasons, some of which were policy driven at national level while others related to farmers and EU policy on subsidisation of certain sectors in the broader agri structure.  We have somewhere in the region of 360,000 hectares.  If one incentivises any section, it will develop.  I will give the committee a very simple example.  There is a protein payment for beans or peas.  In the past three years, the area of beans has gone from less than 2,000 hectares up to something in the region of 15,000.  It is a very good break crop.  Deputy Cahill mentioned the loss of the sugar beet industry.  Why did this happen?  We could beat ourselves up over the reasons.  Ironically, the EU abolished sugar quota restrictions this week in the very same way as dairy quota was abolished after the cap two and a half years' ago.  There was a big promotion regarding expanding the dairy sector at national level but nobody helped us to get sugar beet back and I know this because I am involved in beet arable.  People were not interested.  I know we came in here to committee meetings, etc.  It will come back with the right mindset.  Arable farmers are very resilient people.  The decline in the acreage of arable farming since 2005 is significant and that was one of the reasons.  I will not delay too long on it.<\/p> <p>  In respect of GM and AD, we have huge potential on farm for biodiversity, including AD, and we can use the crops we grow in AD like maize, sugar beet and food waste.  However, the problem is that if I try to get planning permission for a small GM facility on my farm, we are talking about four or five years in the planning structure.  A friend of mine across the Border in Fermanagh to whom I sell straw has an AD plan.  It took him eight months from start to finish in the planning process and his total costs were somewhere between &pound;8,000 and &pound;9,000.  They have a very specific rural planning policy.  There is nobody saying that Northern Ireland is less rigorous in its environmental enforcement.  The same rules apply.  <\/p> <p>  We must make a decision in this country regarding GM.  We are talking about the expansion of dairy and beef farming.  That is fine.  They need to be fed but if we look at what is happening in the US, we can see that up to 30% of the shelves in most of the supermarkets are non-GM and the turnover of product on that segment if four times what is in the GM segment.  We must ask ourselves whether we are going to go down that route.  We do not know what is going to happen post-Brexit in the context of products coming in from the UK.  Everybody has to make a decision as to whether we are going to go down that route.  We are talking about labelling and branding Ireland so are we going to be fully traceable from the crop or animal?  How are we going to label this?  We have a great opportunity in the future but we must make a conscious decision.  Certainly, we see our sector having huge potential in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Cleary"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506438000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Deputy Kenny raised a point about what we require while Deputy McConalogue raised the issue of where we saw the malting barley producing &euro;60,000 per acre.

All we would be asking for is that what is imported is GM-free.  We would not suggest excluding the importation of grain, which we must do, although it is unfortunate that we have got to the point that we have to import our grain.  However, everything is about branding and marketing these days.  It would make marketing sense for all sectors in this country, whether dairy, beef, lamb or otherwise, to chase the higher end markets.<\/p> <p>  Some 11% of the world's baby formula comes from Irish dairy products and traceability is key for this market into the future.  Lately we saw the repercussions of the Brazilian beef scare.  Our focus has been the dairy sector, which is doing very well and fair play to those involved.  We are not here to chastise them for one second.  However, if there is a food scare of some description and it is traced back to this country, it could have a damning effect on the rural economy.  At present, inside the Pale - a word I hate to use but it is easy for lads from the countryside to understand the term - there is great growth.  However, if there is any twitch at all in the wrong direction, those in the countryside are looking at devastation.  It is, therefore, key that we have traceability and are aiming for the higher end markets.<\/p> <p>  The tillage sector affects every other sector in the country.

The witnesses alluded to it.  The increase points to increased demand for what the witnesses produce, crops.  To follow through on that, much of it seems to be aimed towards the export market and we are making more whiskey and beer.  How can the sector respond?  Will it put more land under crop?<\/p><p>Is an increase in price expected or are they the international figures?  Reading between the lines, I understand some of the issues that have been raised.

The situation in the United States is that a non-GM food product is the preferred product but GM was developed because it can produce a hardier crop to prevent pathogens and disease from developing.  Of course, we do not just throw anything on the market but what is the position if the qualities of a particular GM crop are properly, scientifically accredited and approved?  Do the witnesses consider our non-GM position a stronger one in terms of sales and the market?  Do they have other concerns?  I assume GM products would have to have their probity certified and tested.

The biggest issue at the moment is the lack of confidence.  There have been five years of depressed prices.  Large numbers of acres have been taken out of the industry to be used for other purposes.  The drive has been towards the dairy market.  Even this year has seen changes in my part of the world regarding tillage farmers moving to big dairy units.  I have a great worry for the industry.  We need to have a tillage industry if we are going to have a successful dairy industry because we need straw and the land for nitrates so both need to work together.  At the moment, we are at a crossroads and there is a major confidence issue in the industry.  The big issue is how to build that confidence.  Traditionally, the single farm payment that most grain farmers receive was quite high per hectare.  With the renegotiation of CAP happening in the next few years and as a result of Brexit and everything else that is going on, it is not guaranteed.  If the CAP deal goes wrong, it could be the death knell of the entire industry.  It is a huge issue.  If the CAP deal reduces by the amounts the British are paying into the single farm payment scheme at the moment, it will have a huge knock-on effect on the grain industry more so than any other industry.  I have a great fear about how it would survive taking into consideration the past four or five years of very bad prices.  It is one of the key issues.<\/p> <p>  We are having a welcome debate trying to make sure the industry survives.  The beet industry has been lost over the past few years, there have been bad prices and Brexit is coming.  The confidence factor is the biggest issue.  There are grain farmers in my part of the world and it is bad enough that they are doing badly, but the other industries are doing well.  It has a knock-on effect.  They do not wish ill on the other industries but the confidence has been drained from theirs.  The bad weather last year in my part of the world had an awful effect on them.  This year was not much better.  Yields might have been somewhat okay but moisture killed them when they were harvesting in the past few weeks.  <\/p> <p>  I question the view about where GM will come into the workplace.  Protein and protein-products, in particular soybean, is a big core industry and how we get that product into farm feeds is an issue.  If we were to have a ban on GM coming in, how would the import of soybean affect the core price of meal going into the beef and agricultural sector?  Would it have a major knock-on effect if the industry did not have the capability to draw that money back down through higher prices?  Are there higher premiums at the moment for proposed GM milk, butter, yoghurt or baby food?  I am not quite sure on that point.  It is something we need to tease out.  Perhaps it is something we need to ask the dairy industry about.  How would it cope if soybean was used on a GM-free basis?  As the Vice Chairman said, we are at a crossroads with the industry and how we move now will be very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#H00200","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation and answers so far.

I am from the midlands where we do not have big holdings in any sector.  When I was a young lad, and up to 20 years ago, nearly every farm was a mixed farm.  Farmers will get no cheaper feed, whether on their own dining tables or for feeding the stock, than growing their own.<\/p> <p>  It was farmers who made the conscious decision to move more towards livestock and dairy farming and away from tillage farming.  It does not make sense.  There is an argument every time one meets a dairy, suckler or beef farmer that, for example, Joe down the road is only getting &euro;130 a tonne for his grain yet another farmer is buying it back in to feed the cattle at &euro;250 or whatever.  Why did farmers make that conscious decision and walk away?  How do the witnesses propose getting them back?  The witnesses mentioned quality assurance and guaranteed prices.  If in the morning there was a major seachange, I cannot see those farmers going back.  The land capacity is not there for the people who stuck with the tillage or the dedicated tillage farmer to expand.  What do the witnesses suggest would be the best way of increasing the tonnage under those circumstances?<\/p> <p>  The grain sector got a hammering last year and again this year in our area.  Perhaps the climate is a little bit better down south.  I drive out a country road every day to get to my house.  A neighbour drove a combine harvester into a 14-acre field last Saturday fortnight and he finished cutting last Monday.  That combine sat in the field for about three days shy of three weeks.  If the witnesses got everything they are looking for here today with regard to price and quality assurance, they will find it very hard to get the man to whom I referred to sow grain again next year.  How could such a situation be overcome?  None of us is in control of the climate.  It is a major issue.  The witnesses are talking about enhancing, improving and increasing tonnage or output when that barrier is there and has been there for two years running.  There are many lads who will not come back next year irrespective of price.  How do the witnesses see that affecting the bigger picture going forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#H00400","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506438000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Carter to reply to Senator Mulherin's question.  I will respond to Senator Lombard and Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Lombard, the reason we are still in business is that over the past 20 years we have become more efficient.  We are producing more tonnes per acre, and we are using better agronomy and better crop husbandry in conjunction with the new varieties available.  We are hearing this propaganda about the dairy sector and that there is no future.  There is an adage that people should not put all their eggs in one basket.  People should remember that not so long ago we saw the risk of something like BSE or foot and mouth disease wiping out a sector and we need to have some form of resilience there.<\/p> <p>  On the CAP and the benefits of the tillage sector, one of the other issues will be climate change.  The one sector that mitigates and has a positive story to tell is the arable sector.  Members should consider what we are doing in the context of greening at the moment - ecological focus areas, cover crop and minimal cultivation are all contributing to addressing climate change.  Ironically the greening requirements for the tillage sector are much more rigorous than for other sectors.  We do not mind; we will comply as long as we are incentivised.<\/p> <p>  Why is the tillage sector in decline?  For 30 years not one cent was put in.  People have talked about the CAP but TAMS is the first scheme in 30 years to give any funding towards the tillage sector.  This is because nobody asked for it.  We were not being properly represented.  That is why we are here.  We need to stand up for the sector.  Some people argue that the tillage people have big single farm payments.  The only reason they have big single farm payments is because of economies of scale and they have to take bigger acreages of land every year.  When one drills down into that, there are probably four, five or six families being paid for out of that because 80% of tillage farmers lease land - 40% of all the land we farm is leased.  There are very lucrative incentives for farmers to lease at the moment - the armchair farmers, who take no risk while we do all the work.  That has a positive effect.<\/p> <p>  The need for the soya bean was mentioned.  What is wrong with using Irish beans?  Have members seen the difference between a soya bean and Irish beans?  When one looks at them, they are both beans.  One is GM and the other is not.  On is Irish and the other is imported.  The other difference is that it is possible to get the Irish product for considerably less.  The protein incentive has made a huge difference.  Why not use Irish proteins in our crops?<\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly mentioned the weather and farmers harvesting crops at this time of the year.  Why do farmers not grow more winter crops?  Most of the good quality grain this year was produced from winter barley which was harvested in July.  There is not enough promotion to make people aware of that.  We were in our field on the day of the Leinster final and we were cutting at a moisture level of 15%.  Farmers would love to be cutting at 15% today.  There is another way.  The straw we produced at that time was a premium product.  In the past five years prices have been down, but in the past five years winter barley yields on Irish farms has been on a par with or better than those of any farmers in Europe.  We have the climate if we use the right crops.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Cleary"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506438000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>The Chairman said he thought the future of the sector was in energy.  He suggested we should focus on energy and use the by-products for food.  I think that is the wrong way to go.  Energy is at a certain price per kilowatt-hour.  However, if we push premium product, and market and process it, we can add value at each step.  It was suggested that we do something different that we did not do previously; I believe that is what we are doing.  There is no need to reinvent the wheel.  We need to do something different, add value to what we are producing, do what we do and do it better rather than just completely turning things on their head.  There is still potential to produce energy from crops, but we should try to focus it more on by-products and areas after food production.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Mulherin spoke about whiskey.  If there is a price for a product, the demand will be filled; it is simple economics.  For an extra &euro;40 a tonne, they would get all the barley they want and vast acreage of other crops would be put into barley.  In my area in Laois, there has been a complete turn the other way.  It used to be a complete malt area and has gone more towards fed grains because people think there is more money in feed grains at the moment.  However, if there was an incentive to grow malt barley that area would turn around again and we could produce the extra barley for distilling.<\/p> <p>  She asked whether on a scientific basis we had any issues with GM products.  We think it relates more to marketing.  There are potential benefits to GM.  We are not fully aware of everything but there are issues as well.  It not just a blanket statement that GM products are easier for farmers to grow and that all farmers would prefer to grow GM products.  As we have seen in America and elsewhere, there are problems down the road with GM products.  That said, there have been big changes with GM.

That is achieved thanks to the climate here and our expertise and willingness to learn as growers and producers of these goods.  Some of the supports and incentivisation that could be included would be the quality assurance, and capital allowances for the tillage sector to upgrade machinery, which would help farm safety as well as everything else, buildings etc.  It would be of great help to the tillage sector.<\/p> <p>  We also need help in reintroducing the sugar beet industry.

Oilseed rape is grown on many arable farms.  At present, it is generally used in feed.  It is not processed in Ireland.  There is no processing plant for pure plant oil from oilseed rape which can be used as biodiesel.  There was an incentive some years ago and it was withdrawn.  Many who had invested in those processing plants went broke.<\/p><p> Oilseed rape is a versatile crop.  Energy can be produced from it.  The cake that is left after it has been rolled is a high-protein animal feed.  It is a fantastic break crop.  There are many people in the UK making other food products apart from cooking oil.  Mayonnaise can be produced if other products are mixed with it.  It is a very versatile crop.<\/p><p> Need we say any more about sugar beet?  Its primary purpose initially was sugar.  It can be and is used successfully for anaerobic digestion, AD.  All the surplus sugar beet in Germany is used and has replaced atomic energy there.  A substantial amount of that by-product was beet pulp, which was a great feed for livestock.  Ethanol can be produced from it, which is blended with petrol, and it also has industrial uses.  One of the relevant issues relating to that crop is it is the most carbon positive crop that can be grown because it filters or cleans the air.  As a practical equation, if there is a herd of dairy cattle grazing in a field and a field of sugar beet beside it, that area would be carbon neutral.<\/p><p> The reason the willow and miscanthus did not work was quite simple.  We are talking about first generation crops that are used in crop rotation that do not take the land out of production.  In fact, all these crops will suit the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, as a break crop at present with the three-crop rule, and with the following cereal crop there will be a bounce of 30% to 35% in yield.  If a person grows willow, that land is being taken out of production forever because it grows a root down into the ground.  One cannot switch after year three and not grow willow anymore.  Maybe there are areas where it can be used.  Arable farmers tried miscanthus and it did not work.<\/p><p> We will not take our land out of production.  It means that much to us.  If there is marginal land that people want to develop, that is fine, but we should not be asked to take arable land out of food or grain production.  We will not do it.  It just will not happen.  There are plenty of first generations, for example, the beet and maize for AD.  Obviously, we need to look at the whole REFIT tariff, the renewable heat incentives, etc.  I mentioned briefly that planning issues are a huge problem on farms.  We were put through the same rigours as those who would be doing industrial-type development, which is crazy.

Mr. Healy covered our costs.  We are starting a pilot project with tillage farmers.  Our biggest cost is machinery.  We are starting a pilot project to reduce our costs from a machinery point of view.  We need more research and development in this area.  The tillage sector has been neglected as regards research and development.  That would include GM.  It would include every sector, for instance, a person's food grade.  As a group, we are proactive about the way forward for the tillage sector.<\/p> <p>  The weather and climate were mentioned.  As Mr. Cleary alluded, we are, if not carbon positive, at worst carbon neutral.  By getting rid of the tillage sector, we are adding to this big bill that is coming down the road from Europe for being a carbon negative country.  Therefore, there are many reasons, from environmental to traceability of food, to invest in the tillage sector.<\/p> <p>  A government's choice on how it feeds its country is being decided here as well.  The quality of food should be paramount to a government.  If we get rid of our tillage sector, we will be dependant on imports.  I mentioned the Brazilian beef scandal previously.  We would be leaving ourselves open to all this as a nation if we do not halt the slide of the tillage sector.  A total of 85% of our income comes from the so-called cheque in the post, with only 15% of our income coming from our labour.  At present, we are working for &euro;1 or &euro;2 an hour as farmers.  Our income is on average just over &euro;30,000, far less than average industrial wage.  There are strikes, such as there were with teachers, Luas drivers and others looking for far more money.

Ten years ago or more in Leitrim County Council when I was a member, there was a debate about GM with a scientist from Teagasc and someone opposed to GM.  The scientist made all sorts of arguments about GM, such as how it was perfectly safe and there was no scientific reason for anything being wrong with it.  I asked him, if he had been there ten years previously and I had asked him if it was safe to feed meat and bonemeal to cattle, would he have told me it was scientifically safe, and he told me he would have.  However, science turned out to be wrong.  The logical problem many consumers have is where one does something which is a twist of nature to a fair extent.  There are situations where they are making GM crops which are frost resistant.<\/p><p>They go pretty much down the road of wondering what is going on here.  There is the potential for something to go wrong one day.  If we are depending on bringing in genetically modified, GM, products, or if we go GM in Ireland for many of our products, where will we get our food if some catastrophe happens?  That is the danger that the vast majority of the public have in their head.  Ultimately, we as politicians know that members of the public are not that stupid and it is not that easy kid them.  This is a matter in which we must trust the public gut feeling.  As has been said, the public's gut feeling with GM is that, in general, it is wary of it.  There is an opportunity for Ireland in this and I support the witness in what he says in this regard.<\/p><p> In my part of the country, in Leitrim and much of the west of Ireland, many trees have been planted, which is a permanent change of land use.  This has been done to make a carbon sink.  It would make much more sense to support the tillage industry, rather than having whole townlands and parishes in my part of the country where nobody lives any more because there is nothing but trees around.  That does not make sense either.

We are mandated under the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions, GAEC, that we must maintain a minimum of 3.5% of the soil on soil organic matter.  We do that within the tillage sector.  Historically, farmers were mixed farmers and there was farmyard manure and rotation was more diverse.  Tillage farmers now, and especially since the sugar industry went, have become involved in continuous tillage.  That has had to change because there is a three crop rule and we must introduce a break crop in rotation.  We do what is called minimal cultivation, so much soil is non-inversion.  Anna May McHugh will not like hearing this but the plough is becoming obsolete in certain areas and some farmers are direct drilling.  They are not even doing minimal cultivation.  We do a nutrient management plan and the Department is mandated to look at our soil structure.  We have analysis on that.<\/p> <p>  People may ask what the earthworm population has to do with soil but it is very important.

It is not just the soil organic matter that has improved but our yields have been enhanced.  It is a regulated sector and it should be controlled by the Department rather than others.  There are five or six regulatory bodies that I am responsible to.  It is crazy.

I am joined for the tillage presentation by Mr. Liam Dunne, who is a tillage farmer and the IFA grain chairman, and Mr. Fintan Conway, who is an IFA grain executive.  I am also joined by Mr. Damien McDonald, our director general.<\/p> <p>  First, I thank this committee for its support for the IFA and farmers in securing a weather related crop loss scheme for affected growers in the 2016 harvest.  Unfortunately, however, as I speak, a number of growers are struggling to complete this year&rsquo;s grain harvest and to save straw, as the weather has taken a turn for the worse.  It is vital we collectively devise an action plan to address the serious and deepening income crisis in the Irish tillage farming sector as we are now into the fifth consecutive year of low grain prices.  This cycle looks set to continue given the forecast for high world carry-over grain stocks for the end of the current marketing year in June 2018 and intense competition from the Baltic and Black Sea areas.  Current estimates put world stocks to use ratio for all grains at an all-time high of 23%.  In light of this, we need to take specific actions to build a solid foundation off which we can revitalise this important sector.  Failure to do so in a prompt and meaningful fashion will accelerate the decline of crop production, particularly in peripheral counties, further reducing biodiversity.  Continuing low, if not negative, crop margins have seen a significant swing away from cereal production over the past ten years, with the sown area down by more than 142,000 acres or almost 20%.  For the 2017 harvest, sowing was down by a massive 37,000 acres on the previous year.  This trend is expected to accelerate as we look towards the 2018 crop.  The prospect of another year of low grain prices will see many growers struggle to cover their production costs.  Forward selling prices for 2018 are at a small premium to current prices but offer no real income-generating opportunity, assuming average yields.<\/p> <p>  In terms of an action plan for the survival of the tillage sector, since I took up office I have outlined that political intervention is needed on a number of fronts to revitalise arable crop farming.  A vibrant tillage sector is the basis on which we can further expand our livestock sector and our world renowned drinks industry.  Implementation of the following action plan is critical to the survival of a central element of our farming system.  First, there is a need for the temporary abolition of the clawback on the sale of entitlements for tillage farmers who need to raise cash or stand back from taking overpriced conacre.  Second, under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, post 2020, the stacking of entitlements should be reintroduced as an option for tillage farmers.  Third, there is a need for a derogation for Ireland on greening requirements given our difficult climatic conditions.  In that context, crop diversification rules exacerbated crop losses in 2016 and again in 2017, especially in coastal areas and western counties.  Equivalence thresholds for the establishment of catch crops should be aligned with the crop diversification rules and not at 100%.  This would deliver greater environmental benefits, reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and increase biodiversity.<\/p> <p>  The fourth element is the reintroduction of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, agriculture flow loan support scheme to give greater access to competitively priced credit.  The scheme must be expanded in order that tillage farmers can access affordable credit on an ongoing basis, particularly given the fact that many of our EU colleagues can access funds from 1% to 2%.<\/p> <p>  Fifth, we need full support from all industry stakeholders for the use of native Irish grain.  It is unacceptable that native grain continues to trade at a discount to imported, given that Ireland is not self-sufficient.  In that context, we also need mandatory Department inspection and screening of grain imports to exclude economically damaging weed seeds such as black grass and sterile brome.  Furthermore, we need to see the establishment of a certification scheme to maximise the use of native grain and proteins in Irish livestock rations as well as increased use of native grain and Irish malt in the production of Irish whiskies and artisan or craft beers to grow our malting barley sector.<\/p> <p>  The sixth element is action by the EU to lower input costs.  This would include support for the IFA case for the immediate suspension of anti-dumping duties on ammonium nitrate and the abolition of tariffs on fertiliser imports.  EU fertiliser manufacturers have pushed through significant price increases in recent months, with CAN prices now up &euro;50 per tonne over the past three months.  This is despite the fact that natural gas prices remain significantly below historical levels.  The retention of key active ingredients, including glyphosate, triazoles and diquat, among others, is needed to ensure we can produce competitively priced produce.  We also need to see a review by the Directorate General for Competition of the cost of plant protection products.<\/p> <p>  The seventh element in our action plan is stronger tillage sector support under various farm schemes, including a specific environmental payment to encourage beneficial crop rotation and increased funding to allow for the expansion of the protein crop area eligible to receive the full coupled payment.<\/p><p>The eighth element is the development of a national policy on the bio-economy including the roll out of a properly targeted renewable heat incentive, RHI, scheme to drive on the development of a successful bio-energy sector using crop residues and funding for the development of regional biomass trade and logistic centres that optimise the sustainable mobilisation of Ireland's biomass resources.<\/p><p> Collectively, we need to devise and urgently implement a robust action plan to reverse the dramatic fall in tillage fortunes.  The sustainability of our livestock and drinks manufacturing industries are dependent on a vibrant arable crop sector.  An increased reliance on grain and non-grain feed ingredient imports will undermine the provenance of the Irish food brand.  National policy must instil confidence in growers showing that the Government is serious about revitalising the tillage sector.  The development of a targeted tillage action plan will send a strong message of support to all growers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Healy.

It is a very powerful one which outlines where this industry is at the moment.  We are at a crossroads.  That has been mentioned previously in the context of contributions we heard earlier today.  The biggest issue I can see at the moment is a lack of confidence.  We have had four or five years of exceptionally bad prices and as milk and other commodities have been going well there has been a major shift away from grain to the dairy industry in particular.  It is all about trying to rebuild confidence.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues Mr. Healy did not mention was the CAP and where that is going in the next few months.  Does he fear that with the proposed renegotiation of CAP, in the context of Brexit, tillage farmers will be more affected than those in any other sector?  Historically, they had higher payments than farmers in the dairy industry.  Would the knock-on effect of that signal the death knell of the industry?  Is that one of the key issues we need to consider in the context of the renegotiation of the CAP?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Healy referred to the world price.  There have been many good years around the world but, unfortunately, in Ireland we have not had such good weather in the past two to three years and we have suffered because of it.  Does he think the world price of grain has deflated the market and we are now looking at a surplus for one or two years or that a world event would change the price of grain?  In my view the price of grain is at an all-time low.  I do not expect much of a lift, if any, next year.  It is possible that such a price for grain would be sustained in the future and that would have a huge knock-on effect.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#N00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Healy for his very clear presentation and for outlining his key points and suggestions as to how the decline in the area under tillage can be addressed.

On the CAP, we referred to the stacking of entitlements.  I came across quite a few farmers this year who would gladly give up land based on the few bad years they had.  I came across one of them in Deputy Cahill's county of Tipperary.  A dairy farmer outbid him for the land that was near him and he had to take land 30 miles away.  That added extra costs and he would gladly have stacked his entitlements on the acres and sown a lot less.<\/p> <p>  Last year, we invited the Minister to a council meeting to launch an-all Irish grain formulation made up of wheat, oats, barley and beans.  We ran a few campaigns.  One of the campaigns was to try to include that as an option for farmers when they go to their local merchant or mill.  We also had a very strong campaign on increasing the percentage of Irish grain in the rations.  We took samples from two boatloads last year, one in Foynes and the other in Drogheda, and they showed the imported grain to be of inferior quality to what we have here.  Mr. Dunne and Mr. Conway were centrally involved.  Another concern was the presence of the two weeds I mentioned earlier which are detrimental to the Irish crop, namely, the sterile brome and the black grass.  That is something on which we will need to keep a close eye.<\/p><p> My final point relates to malt and barley.  There is potential in these areas and the IFA has been pushing hard for them since 2009.  There was a market for 60,000 tonnes in 2009 and the combined work of the IFA and Boortmalt has today grown that to 140,000 tonnes.  That is an increase of well over 100%, with the target to go to 200,000 tonnes in the not-too-distant future.

This is interesting to look at because we have not had a flat price for so long in well over 100 hundred years.  It is really quite extraordinary; it is even ore extraordinary when we stop to consider that the French lost a quarter of their harvest in 2016 without this having any effect on the market.  Many people have asked the question: what would it take to change this?  The impact of a world weather event was mentioned but I am not so certain that even a hurricane in the north Atlantic would make any difference at this stage.<\/p> <p>  Something has happened behind the scenes, however, which people may not realise and which is having a huge effect on matters.  In 2009, the G20 world leaders expressed concern that prices had been going either through the roof or through the floor right between 2006 and 2009.  When prices go through the floor, the producer gets hammered.  When prices go through the roof, the consumer gets hammered.  The people making money in between, of course, are the traders, particularly if they can spot these trends in advance.  Apparently, the G20 leaders were particularly worried about this.  They highlighted the problem and engaged people to do some work on it.  In 2013, a new system called the agricultural market information system, AMIS, was introduced whereby all the producer and major consumer countries and blocs made their data available in confidence to each other.  As the committee will be aware, in most countries it is not commercial bodies that carry out the trading, producing or purchasing of grain: it is governments.  Those governments then put the figures out.  As of June 2017, only two countries have not participated in this system, namely, Nigeria, which is a major consumer, and Kazakhstan, which is a major exporter.  The system provides information to anyone who wants to buy at any given time.  Last year, for example, the Egyptians wanted to buy French wheat.  When they saw that the French harvest was in disarray, all they had to do was examine the system and see where there were plenty of other supplies of wheat.<\/p> <p>  While there was always an understanding that somewhere between 15% and 20% was necessary as a kind of floating stock, it would now appear that this level could probably drop far lower.  The AMIS system has had the effect of driving the price down as far as it can possibly go and keeping it there.  Until that figure of 23% of stock starts to change - by which I mean drops below 15% - it is unlikely that we will see any increase in price.  We are clearly in a devil of a pickle.  We are in a high-cost area of production and while we can produce good yields, good quality wheats, by which I mean hard wheats and so forth, are difficult to produce.  Wheats for human consumption are difficult for us to produce.  We can produce animal feedstuffs to a large extent, but this is a high-cost country.  Almost everything we need in order to produce our grain has to be imported, which leaves us very exposed.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the actual physical importation of grains into this country, it is worth noting that we could shut down the 2 million tonnes that we produce and import it all instead.  We could probably get it even more cheaply if we wanted.  There is, however, a very important environmental issue that needs to be considered.  Recently, I saw a statistic showing that diesel engine cars in Europe outnumber those in the rest of the world's countries put together.  In other words, Europe has more diesel engine cars, vans and small trucks than anywhere else in the world.  The fact is however, that 16 major ships at sea will produce more emissions than all the cars, vans and trucks in Europe.  We can rely on imports if we want to but there will be an environmental impact.  I am quite certain that there are lots of farmers throughout the country, many of whom who use balers or combine harvesters, who are scratching their heads and wondering if what they are looking at is climate change.  Is this country going to be a virtual no-go area for certain activities?  Can we continue with such activities?<\/p> <p>  A farmer will look at three things at the beginning of any harvest: he will look at his crops and hope to have good yields; he will look at the weather and hope to have good conditions for the harvest; and he will look at where prices are and hope to get a decent return for his yields.  The farmer can probably cope with a misfire in respect of one of these three factors.  Last year and again this year, however, we are looking at two misfires so farmers are in a very bad way indeed.  Many of them are very seriously considering whether to resow.  As the committee is probably aware, resowing would generally be starting at this stage of the year.  We have lost 500,000 tonnes of production between 2015 and now.  In 2015, we produced 2.6 million tonnes and this year we are producing barely over 2 million tonnes.  Our current guess is that we could easily lose another 500,000 tonnes between now and next year.  Many people, including a sizeable number of the bigger growers, are thinking of getting out of the whole sector.  We are at crisis point.<\/p> <p>  I spoke to an agricultural journalist today who thinks that the drop could be as significant as 1 million tonnes.  That is how negative the sentiment is at the moment.  There is nothing to help or support people in getting through this harvest, mentally as well as financially.  That is one of the reasons we are looking at a claw-back on the sale of entitlements because it is one way whereby farmers could make some fairly fast money to help with their debts.  It costs approximately &euro;400 to grow an acre of cereal.  In almost every case in Ireland this year, the acres of cereal harvested are done so at a loss.  I can only leave it to the committee's imagination as to what happens when it is not harvested, but we went through that last year.  We still have our fingers crossed that crops are holding up reasonably well but there is going to be a serious loss of straw out there at this stage, regardless of whether we like it.  I have no idea what implications that will have for the rest of the winter.  I apologise for staying on this topic, I had better move on a bit.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue referred to the drop in production and where matters currently stand.  As Mr. Healy mentioned, the IFA's whole problem with the fact that our grain was being discounted against imported grains remained the case until last year or so.  The actions that we took last year highlighted to a lot of farmers what imported grains actually involve.  When we checked back on the situation, we discovered that poor-quality grain was being harvested in the United Kingdom, put straight onto boats and shipped over here.  That is what was going on.  We are in a deficit for feed wheats and this year, for example, we know that wheat came into Ireland that was rejected by some of the compound mills.  I was talking to the chairman of the pigs committee recently and he mentioned that a number of his members are complaining bitterly about the fact that some of the Ukrainian wheat is certainly not up to scratch either and is giving them very poor results.  If we leave ourselves at the mercy of imported grains, we will very much be at their mercy.  They are not as good as what we produce ourselves but there will always be people who put out a ration to farmers at an attractive-looking price.  That is the situation.<\/p> <p>  I now come to the GM issue.  As Mr. Healy mentioned, members might be interested to know that the IFA has produced a leaflet on the subject of the all-Irish rasher, what is involved in it and how it can be achieved.<\/p><p>In order to get enough protein into it, it is done with an alkali treatment and beans are included.  Both Dairygold and most of the major merchants have told us already this year - we have not met with Glanbia yet - that they will take as much beans as they can lay their hands on but at a price, of course.  We need the support we have been getting from the EU on beans.  That support has kick-started the whole protein industry here.  We need to push it on further but we need more support.  We are looking for that in the next round of CAP reforms.<\/p><p> On Energia and sugar beet, the EU is determined that the next round or second generation of energy crops will not impact on tillage land.  This policy is causing much concern and that crops such as oilseed rape may disappear from our repertoire which we cannot afford.  We would love to go back growing sugar beet.  If it becomes economically viable and possible, we will be the first to stand up and push it on.  The figures, however, suggest it is not likely to happen in the near future.<\/p><p> Mr. Joe Healy is correct on malt and barley.  When production dropped as low as 60,000 tonnes, the first thing we had to do was grow the industry.  There has not been any investment in additional plants for processing malt and barley.  Without giving away my age, the last plant I recall being built was in Athy close on 50 years ago.  It is on the cards that we will see growth in this sector.  The existing plants are working at maximum capacity but we need further development with new plants put in place.<\/p><p> There are only two countries in the world where malt and barley processors work hand in hand with farmers, Ireland and the Czech Republic.  In every country, there is always a third party in between.  We have pushed this industry as far as we can, getting every last penny in premiums we can, knowing each one is going back directly to the farmer, with no middleman like in other countries.  In the plant in Cork, the barley is assembled by Dairygold and Glanbia which does not happen with burnt malt.<\/p><p> Animal feedstuffs are where it is all at.  If we are going to produce high-quality Irish milk and beef, we are adamant the animals should be fed on an all-Irish ration.  How do we get there?  The proposal we put to Dairygold the other day was that it may have to put out contracts to farmers to grow barley.  We proposed that it gives us the base price, the international trading price, but top it up with a serious premium.  Giving a premium of &euro;5 to growers is not sufficient from a co-op.  If it wants stubbles for the excess slurries and municipal waste, then someone will have to grow it and something extra will have to be paid for it.<\/p><p> Many growers in the west complained to us last year that they did not count and we in the east would be just as well happy to see them disappear.  I told them this was not the case as every acre of grain in the west is worth twice what it is anywhere else because of its effect on biodiversity, that the stubbles are there and the grain has a short distance to travel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Joe Healy expand on his point about the crop diversification rules being an issue?

I know none of us can control the weather.  Farmers in the north midlands and the west have got a hammering in the past two years and this year is no better.  Earlier, I told of a case of a neighbour of mine who drove a combine into a 14-acre field three weeks ago and only finished harvesting last Sunday evening.  There is no way he will go back to tillage.  If he does not, what alternatives does he have?  I know this is due to the weather and we might have a good year next year.  However, Mr. Liam Dunne said farmers are frustrated.  What is the alternative?  One cannot advise a farmer try it again.  The old adage kicks in about repeating the same action over and over again and expecting a different result.<\/p><p>I grew up on a mixed farm which are far and few between.  It was farmers to go one or the other.  There was no crock of gold, however, in whatever sector they chose.  The deputation could be here next week with a beef crisis and the following week a milk crisis.  How are we going to get a farmer to make the sea change?  We are going to have to start increasing to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It is obvious the day is long in some areas but it is worse this tillage crisis is going to get and farmers are going to pull out.  Even if the requests in the action plan were worked on, farmers on the ground are left with no choice but to leave tillage due to climate reasons.  The answer from the last group was about moisture content and yield on the weekend of the Leinster final.  In other words, sow winter.  In the areas I am referring to, one cannot harvest in September and October and one will certainly not be sowing then.  That is not a viable answer for those farmers.  There must be some solution for them.

Once the milk price gets anywhere into the high 30s per litre, the fertiliser price goes up.  I know the IFA has done great work on tariffs.

Deputy Cahill is 100% correct on fertiliser prices and the fact there is no justification whatsoever for the price over the past several weeks.<\/p><p>The point is to try to get more competition and get the import duties and the anti-dumping tariffs scrapped.  A vast amount of work has gone into it.  We travelled to Russia and the Ukraine last year for the International Fertilizer Association conference.  We went to bring attention to this and to the need for action to be taken.  We have done considerable work at European level with the other farm organisations throughout Europe.  We have secured their support for it and we have worked with the various Commissioners as well to get some movement on both duties.<\/p><p> The IFA commissioned the International Food Policy Research Institute to do a report on this two years ago.  In February 2016, the institute published the report, which indicated the anti-dumping duties and the import tariffs were costing European farmers to the tune of &euro;1 billion extra on fertiliser bills.  In Ireland, the cost was between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million.  If we take the pig and poultry sectors out of the equation, fertiliser is the greatest single cost on Irish farms.  It is a key cost and that is why the IFA spent so much time on it last year.<\/p><p> Another area we worked on involved making the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland agriculture cashflow support loan scheme available to farmers at rates considerably below what farmers are paying at the moment.  We are lobbying on the matter again this year.  The IFA and our French colleagues led a campaign last year for a licence for glyphosate, which is crucial for all farmers but especially those in the tillage sector.  These are some of the things we have control over.  We do not have a great deal of control over world production, but where we have control over things we try to do whatever we can.<\/p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Conway and Mr. Dunne for comment on some of the other issues relating to crop diversification, crop certification and opportunities to grow winter crops.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506438000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I will deal with the fertiliser question.  The Commission has initiated an investigation into anti-dumping duties.  We need political support, and we need the Minister to tog out on this issue.  At this point, we do not have a lead country for targeting the tariffs.  I will try to put this in context.  In the tillage sector 20 years ago, the cost of fertiliser accounted for approximately 15% of the variable costs of production.  Today, the corresponding figure is 40%.  If that was put right straight away, it would make a major difference to our side.<\/p> <p>  The other issue clearly in vogue is the availability of plant protection products.  If they are taken from us, we will not be in a position where we can grow crops.  This is not simply an issue for Ireland; it is an issue for all of Europe.

To the best of my knowledge - I am nearly sure I have this correct &ndash; since the EU was set up, no voluntary organisation has ever managed to persuade the EU Commission to start an investigation into any industry.  This is the first time it has happened.  We are minnows In the tillage sector in Europe so for an organisation such as the IFA to have achieved that is something major in itself.  We could really do with the wholehearted support of the Government in what we are doing.  That would make a major difference.<\/p> <p>  Another point is worthy of note.  We had a paper from a Russian delegate at a conference.  He was going through the money being spent in Brussels on lobbying and he examined all the lobbying.  Committee members present will know better than me that people have to declare the money they spend on lobbying and so on.  The first on the total list &ndash; it was not an agricultural list &ndash; was Fertilizers Europe.  Tobacco and petroleum lobbyists were in second and third places.  Fertilizers Europe members do not sell any product directly to what we call normal consumers &ndash; I mean the person in the street - they only sell to farmers.  People should ask why on earth that organisation is spending that kind of money.  The amount of money it was spending was one and a half times as much as the next on the list, which was the tobacco lobby.  If we stop to consider it, it is clear these are massive figures.  For a country like Ireland to take on such a powerful unit and get this issue to where it is now is a point worthy of note.<\/p> <p>  Crop diversification was part of the greening brought in last year.  Many environmentalists in Europe were rather concerned that in some parts of Europe, one could be driving for miles and see only one crop.  When they first introduced this into the negotiations, they had figures as low as 2 ha and 3 ha of crops.  A farmer had to have more than 1 ha, which was ridiculous.  Eventually, they brought it in at a higher level.  It is relevant to Irish levels of production.  Most farmers, once they get over 10 ha, have to grow two crops.  If a farmer has over 30 ha, he has to grow three crops.  Most farmers in this country with over 30 ha would normally be growing three crops anyway.  Our greatest problem is with farmers who are in the middle band and who have to grow two crops.  I have received numerous telephone calls from people who are in that band, especially this year and last year.  Traditionally, they would have grown spring barley in counties Galway, Donegal, Cork and Kerry.  That is what the demand is for locally - their neighbours would buy it off them and the local merchant would trade in it.  Many in these areas had to turn around and grow a second crop.  If a farmer is in an area of the country that has high levels of winter rainfall, he is not going to sow winter crops because they simply will not survive it.  The country tends to have wet winters.  We are not like the Russians, who sometimes suffer from frost kill because of the cold.  Water is more our problem.  As a result, most of them have to grow a second spring crop.  The only option they have left is spring oats.<\/p> <p>  I talked to Pat Ryan from Liffey Mills at the ploughing match.  He said he has spring oats coming in at the moment.  They are poor quality because of the wet weather and he says he has no market for it.  Under these regulations, farmers are being told that they have to grow crops for which there is no local market.  There may well be a market somewhere else, but not locally.  This is the problem.<\/p> <p>  We managed to persuade the Commission to put in an alternative measure called equivalence.  Under equivalence, if a farmer is in an environmental scheme, such as GLAS, he can elect to grow only one crop but he must put in a percentage of catch crop to make up the difference.  Since he is doing one instead of two, he has to put in an extra measure.  The EU Commission has insisted on 100% catch crop.  Only 22 farmers in Ireland are attempting to do it.  Last year was the first year and this year is the second year.  All of them are in trouble, because trying to put in catch crops at the moment when the ground either has a crop in it or has straw on it is virtually impossible.  We have said to the Commissioner every time we have met him that we want the 100% requirement changed back to an equivalent of the amount of crop that a farmer has altered and taken out of the system as such.  That percentage should be sufficient.  We would even be prepared to take twice that percentage and we could still live with it, but 100% will not work.<\/p> <p>  It has another knock-on effect on malt and barley.  This relates to the areas of the country that grow good malt and barley.  It is not possible to grow it anywhere in the country, although I know small amounts are grown in Galway.<\/p><p>In the area where it is grown farmers traditionally just grew malting barley.  Now, many of them find they must grow other crops to cover themselves but they find it difficult to put in the extra cash crop.  We are looking for relatively small change.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been completely behind what we are doing, but the Commission has not been prepared to move and we have brought it as far as the Commissioner.  This is what the issue is about.<\/p><p> On the sale of entitlements, the problem is farmers who need to fulfil all of these entitlements must have the land.  If the entitlement is more than what the home farm is worth, and remember that 40% of the cereals grown in Ireland are grown on rented land, the farmer must rent extra land.  Most tillage farmers do this and there has been quite a strong tradition of this.  Given the pressure on farmers' income at present, and the pressure from other farmers wanting to expand dairy herds, people have no option but to travel longer distances to try to fulfil these entitlements.  We ask the Government to give us the opportunity to let these people sell some of these entitlements and get out completely.  Many of them are badly strapped for cash after five years and they really need this cash injection, which would make a difference.  It would allow them to downsize.  Effectively what is happening is the industry itself is downsizing because there is not sufficient income in it.  We will have to allow it to downsize and at the same time make sure it survives.  It can survive, but it needs the total and utter support not only of the Oireachtas, but also the rest of the stakeholders.  The co-operatives and merchants have massive role to play in giving this support.<\/p><p> It is not just grain that is being produced as there is also straw.  One of the placards that kept getting attention when we protested at the boats last year was the sign that stated there was no straw on the boat.  I am reliably informed that in the UK there is a big demand for straw to go to Poland at present.  Somebody who returned from Scotland two weeks ago told me that a 4x4 round bale of straw in Scotland was making &pound;34 in the field.  Scotland is also way behind in its harvest.<\/p><p> With regard to what to say to farmers who have come to the end of their tether, it is very difficult.  If the weather is the major part of the problem in their area they will have to look at grass.  Three weeks ago, a contractor in Galway told me he had 1,500 acres of ground ploughed for grass seeds but had not managed to sow any of it.  I believe he has done so in the meantime.  This much area is going to grass at present.  A farmer I spoke to today told me he will fallow half his land for this coming year.  If it costs money to grow a crop, in other words when people are still at a loss after they sell it and must use their single farm payment to pay the difference, they are better off not sowing it and just leaving the land idle.  Unfortunately, this is where we are at and it is serious.<\/p><p> Deputy Corcoran Kennedy raised several points, but I am afraid I did not make a note on them and I ask her to come back to me with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1506438000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Deering resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506438000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>To answer the question on the reason for the certification scheme, we sell malting barley at a premium to other countries because we build and sell the concept of Irishness.

We are joined by Mr. Thomas Cooney, our environment chairman, and Mr. Thomas Ryan, our environment executive.<\/p> <p>  The current review of the rules surrounding the use and management of nitrogen and phosphorous on Irish farms provides a real opportunity to reverse decades of declining soil fertility levels and ensure Ireland's farming sector is well positioned to sustainably grow agrifood exports over the next decade to almost &euro;20 billion and create 23,000 jobs in the sector.  Farming and the wider agrifood sector is the backbone of economic activity in rural Ireland, undertaken in every county and parish.  It is also Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous sector, providing employment to more than 300,000 people directly and indirectly. <\/p> <p>  Despite wider economic challenges, exports from the agrifood sector have grown by more than 50% since 2009, reaching more than &euro;11 billion in 2016.  This growth has been delivered through increased efficiency and better use of resources.  For example, since 1996 cattle numbers in Ireland have reduced by 1 million, greenhouse gases have declined by 4 million tonnes and rivers considered to be seriously polluted have declined by 92%.   <\/p> <p>  This good work is underpinned by a high level of collaboration in the sector.  Initiatives such as the Smart Farming programme, which is led by the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the IDIA&rsquo;s, dairy sustainability initiative supports strong Government policies, for example, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which has almost 50% of its measures aimed at improving water quality.  However, challenges remain, the national population has increased by over 1.1 million during the past two decades and 43 local authority-Irish Water sites are still discharging untreated sewage into rivers and lakes.  This, without doubt, is contributing to a decline in the number of high quality river sites.<\/p> <p>  Despite these challenges, this current review must be used to build on the progress made by the farming community, whose investment of &euro;2 billion and support from Government in bringing farmyards to the highest environmental standards is paying a dividend.  Chief priorities in this review are the continuation of both the derogation for the dairy and livestock sector and the transitional arrangements for pig and poultry farmers.  Even though fewer than 5% of farmers in Ireland avail of the nitrates derogation, they represent a cohort of progressive farmers who will underpin the development of the sector in the coming years, and are making farm management decisions today on the legitimate expectation that Ireland&rsquo;s derogation will continue.  It is worth noting that these derogation farmers endure increased compliance obligations, administrative burdens and face a greater likelihood of being inspected. <\/p> <p>  The call by the IFA for the continuation of the transitional arrangements for pig and poultry farmers is mainly because of the failure to develop a coherent bio-energy and, in particular, anaerobic digestion policy, with the necessary supports.  The options are limited here.  To avoid imposing thousands of euros of haulage costs on pig and poultry farmers, the transitional arrangements must be extended, at least until the long awaited renewable heat incentive is introduced.<\/p> <p>  Fertile soils are the bedrock of grass and crop growth.  However, low farm incomes and heavy regulatory activities have contributed to a reduction in fertiliser use in recent years. This has led to a decline in soil fertility levels, with a small proportion of soil samples - 10% for grassland and 12% for tillage - showing good overall soil fertility.  Currently, two thirds of soils nationally have a sub-optimal pH status, indicating a requirement for lime on most farms.  Liming creates the optimum pH environment by neutralising acidity in soils, and making nutrients available to grow crops and reduce the risk of run-off.  A lime investment programme must be introduced as part of this review to support the rebuilding of fertile soils.  This must be supported by more open access to Teagasc's nutrient management planning tools, which should be available to all farmers at no cost initially.  This will maximise adoption of best practice.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the inflexibility of the calendar farming regime when it comes to fertiliser spreading, this is once again in the front of our minds, with farm families, particularly in the west and north west, struggling to farm the land due to the exceptional weather this year again.  I would ask that this issue, which continues to be raised at IFA county executives, be addressed to support the farmers, who want to do the right thing and not get penalised.  This review is taking place at an important time in the development of Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood sector.  <\/p> <p>  Many of the measures proposed by the IFA in this review are focused on better resource management, which delivers on the double dividend of reducing costs while also protecting the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reduced risk to water quality.  In addition, the farming community is well positioned to continue to play its part in Ireland&rsquo;s recovery.  However, vital support to deliver sustainable growth is required across all sections of Government.  It is now the time to ensure that this review plays its part. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Healy for his presentation.

Farmers have the most to lose in the context of this review.  Substantial investment was made on infrastructure on farmyards under the farm waste management scheme and significant improvements were made in water quality, but it disappointing that the last water quality report published showed that water quality has disimproved in a number of areas.  In my county 66 villages have no water treatment plant.  In an agricultural county like ours, how can we get our water quality right if everyone is not going to make the necessary investment.  Farmers have made a huge investment.  County councils need to get involved.  The village of Golden in Tipperary, located on the banks of the River Suir, which is quite sizeable, has no water treatment plant.  That is inconceivable.  If water quality disimproves, we could easily lose our derogation.  If we lose our derogation, all the plans we have under Food Wise and every other plan and projection will go out the window.  It is critical that we get it right.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Healy referred to the calendar farming regime for the spreading of slurry.  That is something that hits farmers hard.  It is very important for us to maintain and improve our water quality as we move forward.  Our green image is very important for the sale of our product.  Leaving that aside, we simply have to get this right.  The ordinary consumer will see the report and farmers were put high up on the list as being guilty with respect to the last report.  That was not justified as we have made a huge investment.  If other sectors had to invest proportionately what farmers have invested, the story we would be discussing and the review would be much less onerous on us.<\/p><p> We have a job of work to do here and we need to do it collectively.  All sections of society need to pull their weight and ensure that they contribute and put their money and capital investment in to ensure we can continue to progress and our water.  We had a very good period of water quality improvement that, unfortunately, slipped back.  The wet weather has probably had an impact on the agricultural side of things.  Someone could say they wanted two dry days after spreading fertiliser but how could they get them?  There was probably some run off there which has contributed to the problem but that will always be an issue.  County councils have a job of work to do and it must be done immediately.  That investment must be put in place.  The fact that they are such contributors to that deterioration in water quality is not on.  We do not want this review to be taken for granted.  We have to make sure that Ireland's case is put forward well but for that, we need a battle plan to show what investment we will have to improve water quality from other than the agricultural sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017092600002#S00700","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>As Deputy Cahill said, there was a lot of investment for on-farm storage.

People were going around with nothing to do on 1 and 2 January and for most of 2009.  I know there is calendar farming, which we talk about, but many farmers came to me at the National Ploughing Championships to say that because of the cut off in the middle of September, they were actually spreading fertiliser in the rain.  Two days' later, the Monday was a lovely fine day but they could not get out on that Monday because they had to have had it spread.

Over 50% of the measures in GLAS are aimed at improving water quality.  We told it about the IFA Smart Farming initiative which also contributes to improving water quality.  GLAS needs to be re-opened because a number of farmers are not in it.  There are only 50,000 farmers in GLAS.

The purpose of the meeting is to have a discussion with the Minister on the breaches which came to light in a number of press articles.

I am announcing today a series of measures to deliver best practice in terms of fire safety.  The measures cover the following three broad areas: a programme of audits to ensure compliance with fire certificates; a range of measures for new builds to underpin the highest possible safety standards; and new procedures within the Department to ensure that all fire safety concerns are properly addressed.  <\/p><p> Members have been supplied with a detailed statement.  In the time allocated, I shall not go through the full text.  Under the heading of audits, there are two forms of audits that we are introducing.  First, we will have a comprehensive set of audits of the Western Building Systems involving 30 builds that it has undertaken.  It was audits of five schools that were the subject of the statement back on 1 September.  We are now doing a full audit of all of the WBS schools.  It is important for me to say this is not based on a concern that we have.  We believe that the premises have been to the highest standards but we just want to make doubly sure.<\/p><p> Second, we are going to introduce a series of representative audits.  About 30 representative schools will be selected across a range of types of build, such as rapid build that has outsourced design and build.  In terms of the different types of schools, other rapid schools have been built by other contractors.  This is obviously to ensure that there is the highest level of compliance with the fire certificates that applied in those cases.  They will cover schools built over the past 20 years, since new regulations were introduced about 20 years ago.<\/p><p> The second area where we are taking action, that I have outlined in my statement today, is in terms of new builds or schools that are being built.  We have taken a number of measures there.  We have written to all of the design teams currently involved in such builds to underline to them their responsibilities under the new building standards code.  We have written to their associations to again underline the importance of this aspect of work in terms of schools in particular.  <\/p><p> Finally, we have decided that we will appoint in each new project a clerk of works as well as the designated certifier.  The initiative will act as the eyes and ears of the Department in terms of each individual new build.  These are measures that we believe will ensure that all new builds are built to the very highest standard and fully compliant with the fire certificate that was issued at the time a planning application was submitted.<\/p><p> The third element where we are introducing new approaches is we are establishing an internal fire safety committee within the Department.  It will oversee all applications that come our way in terms of fire issues be they audits, requests for additional works and right across the system to make sure that all of those applications are properly scrutinised in respect of the importance of fire safety for children.  We are backing the initiative with the establishment of a new internal protocol.  The protocol will ensure that where such matters come to the attention of the internal committee, it will establish their significance and then immediately engage with the fire officer where there is a significant issue involved, introduce a system whereby the patron and the school are duly informed of the issues, undertake whatever necessary audit is in place, design the works, seek and obtain approval both from the fire officer on the adequacy of the works and inform the school of the approach that is to be taken to deal with the issues concerned.  Under the protocol, it will remain the responsibility of the schools to liaise with the wider school community, but they will do so with the very best information available to them. <\/p><p> We are, in addition, writing again to schools just to remind them of the various guidance and protocols that they have a responsibility to oversee.  This initiative has come from them.  We have engaged with the various patron bodies over the course of recent weeks.  We feel that it would be appropriate to provide a circular that sets out the various issues because, as Members will know, there are issues around fire drills, fire safety equipment being on the premises and so on.<\/p><p>I believe we have put in place a comprehensive set of measures.  <\/p><p> In respect of the individual schools which were the subject of the five audits and comment, in every one of these cases works are either under way or being put out to contract to be completed as a matter of urgency.  <\/p><p> I want to give the committee an absolute assurance about what occurred.  The fire certificates issued for the schools required a 60-minute retardation period, but it was found that some of the works had not fulfilled that requirement, which was why the wider audit was undertaken.  In respect of each of the schools we have undertaken or are in the course of putting in place measures to ensure the original fire certificate specification will be met.  In all cases we have, of course, as the first item, met the direct fire officer involved.  The fire officer is fully satisfied with the approach we are taking in dealing with the individual schools.  We have put in place a fresh approach which I am confident will deliver best practice.  We will continue to monitor all aspects of the matter, with the much strengthened approach now in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017092600002#A00200","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, but I would like to point out that we have not yet received copies of the statement which would be helpful for members of the committee and all of our Oireachtas colleagues who have joined us.  I thank the Minister for agreeing to meet the committee so soon after the resumption of the D&aacute;il.  While the comprehensive set of measures the Department is going to put in place is very welcome, there are still many questions that we need to ask about the process, what happened in the past and why it took so long to release the report.  The Minister mentioned the 60-minute fire retardation requirement, but in some of the schools mentioned it was reduced to 20 minutes.  It is incredibly significant that it was only one third of the minimum standard required.  I have a few more questions, but I will hold them for now and invite my colleagues to comment and ask questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017092600002#C00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>All of this is extremely worrying, but the slowness of the Department in coming clean publicly is particularly worrying.  This issue has been coming to the boil since 2008 and has featured in the media at various times in the past few years, but the first detailed statement on it from the Department was only issued on 1 September, on foot of which I requested that this meeting take place.  I am glad that the Minister is here and has facilitated the meeting.  On that date it was made public on <i>etenders.gov.ie<\/i>that there was a tender for a further report, but the Minister would have been in a position to announce it long before then to the D&aacute;il and the public.  The decision was obviously taken long before 1 September, but it was only at the very last possible moment that the information was released to the public.  It was also released on a day on which and in a week in which, in educational terms, a lot was going on.  Was there an agenda to reduce the impact by making the information public in the first week of the new school year?  I am not sure how successful it was, but it does lead on to other issues.<\/p><p>One such issue is the Department's handling of requests in recent years for funding for fire safety works.  It refused quite a number of such applications and seemed not to take seriously the concerns of schools when they applied for such funding.  The Minister has given figures in that regard and they are extremely worrying.  I ask him to explain the position.  Is the Department going to look again at decisions where it refused schools money for fire safety upgrades?  Will these decisions be looked at again, particularly in the light of what has happened, what the Department is now doing and safety concerns in other areas where people have died?<\/p><p> To move to the other issue I wanted to ask about, I, and I am sure every other Deputy here, have come across other major issues relating to building quality in recent years, including a brand new roof in my constituency which does not keep water out.  That is obviously not a fire safety issue, but is the Department in general very worried about building standards and is it looking at them closely or are we simply happy to see the bright shiny building built?  Of course we are, but it seems to me that some people think they can get away with shoddy standards in the schools sector.  That appears to be happening lately, particularly when the schools are not directly involved themselves.  A number of projects have taken place which have been managed separately from the schools.  I know there is an efficiency argument for that, but the boards of management are not involved in a hands-on manner, which is leading to problems.  Will the Minister comment on that?  In general, are building standards an issue for his Department and is it something he is taking a detailed look at?  Obviously the most important issue is the safety of our children, the staff who work in schools and the school community.  Will the Minister answer the specific questions which I have put?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017092600002#C00300","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming in to give a statement on such a serious issue.  I have just a few questions.  To reiterate what Deputy Byrne has said, why did it take so long to publish the reports?  Why would a principal have to write to the Department seven times to ensure pupils' safety?  Why was the Minister's Department so reluctant to give that information?  Why did it take an intervention from the Information Commissioner for the reports on these five schools to be released?  Surely principals should not have to beg for information to make sure their pupils are safe.  In the end they had to rely on a freedom of information request submitted by a journalist, in this case the <i>Dublin Inquirer<\/i>.  In the case of Belmayne Educate Together national school, there were simple solutions in respect of the stores which were present on the stairs.  Had the school been told about that it could have cleared those stores.  It seems nonsensical that schools would be kept in the dark about these issues rather than being worked with to fix problems as quickly and as effectively as possible.<\/p><p>That leads on to the next question.  What processes will the Minister put in place to increase transparency and direct communications?  He mentioned that he has written to the schools in respect of guidance and protocols on schools' responsibilities, but again there is no point in doing that because we have seen that principals were seeking the information and were not getting it.  One can have every fire drill in the world, but if a school will burn down within 60 minutes, a principal is entitled to that information, as is every child and every single person who works in that building.  It is despicable.<\/p><p>Does the Minister intend to introduce a programme to audit the fire safety of all school buildings in the State?  Perhaps that could not be done in one year but it could be done on a phased basis.  Will the Minister indicate a timeline for that?  It seems there are at least 17 schools which need to be looked at as soon as possible.  They are the other 17 which were built by Western Building Systems, apart from the five which we are discussing today.  I imagine that some of this work was subcontracted out.  Does the Department have a comprehensive list of work undertaken on any school by any company which held a subcontract under Western Building Systems?  That would seem to be the very minimum which needs to be done.  I imagine it would add up to considerably more than 25 schools.<\/p><p>As I said earlier, for practical reasons all schools cannot be audited immediately, but I would ask the Minister to consider that.  We need to ensure the safety of all children in every school in Ireland.  If the Minister is not willing to do that, will he outline why he believes that the sample which he has sought in his tender will be able to catch any and all fire safety deficiencies in the country?  It seems from these five schools that the instance of fire safety deficiencies could be much higher than could be dealt with by auditing just 25 schools.<\/p><p>The Minister stated in his reply to a recent parliamentary question that 37 schools were refused fire safety works by his Department since 2015.  While the information as to why each one is a mystery and has not been provided, there still appears to be a huge number of refusals, especially when weighed up against the number of approvals.  For example, in Donegal over the past three years only two out of seven applications have been approved.<\/p><p>I am just looking for information on that.  Why are there so many refusals?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017092600002#D00200","speaker":"1242","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Would any other member like to speak before I go to our other Oireachtas colleagues attending today?

This looks like an active attempt to suppress the fire safety issues affecting these schools, which is to my mind extraordinary and unconscionable.  Can the Minister explain his statement that none of these schools was dangerous or posed a risk?  This is an extraordinary statement.  I have read the reports, which state that there were multiple breaches of the requirement for 60-minute compartmentalisation.  It is not that the school could burn down in 60 minutes; it could burn down in ten or 15 minutes because where there is supposed to be resistance between units of 60 minutes, there was not.  The reports give details of that.  We know from fires in residential areas, like the recent fire in Newbridge where there was no compartmentalisation, that where a fire should have taken four or five hours to go from one unit to the next, it actually took 25 or 26 minutes.  These breaches meant that these children were and, where remediation has not been carried out, are still in danger.  There are multiple breaches of basic fire safety.  How can the Minister possibly justify the extraordinary statement that none of the schools in question was dangerous or posed a risk?  Can he tell us who originally signed off on these buildings back in 2008?  Who said that they were compliant?  We need to know the answer to this and those people need to be held to account.  Did architects sign off on this or, as the report seems to indicate, and this relates to the whole issue around certification for fire safety, is it the case that architects sign off on plans but the buildings do not then correspond to those plans?  Michael Slattery's report on this states that this is exactly what was happening, namely, that the plans were one thing but the buildings were another.  This means that somebody was playing fast and loose with the law on fire safety and those people have to be held to account.  I want to know what sanctions will be taken.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the number of schools Western Building Systems was responsible for.  I suspect that it was for this and if that is the case, it should never get a public contract again.  Can the Minister tell us how many schools this company is currently building?  How many other schools has it built?  We also know that it is involved in the Poppintree project for rapid-build.  Are these units being audited for fire safety?  It built the extension to Beaumont Hospital.  Has that been fire-safety audited?  I believe it did work in Temple Street hospital.  Has that been fire-safety audited?  Can the Minister tell us today that if Western Building Systems was guilty of multiple breaches of basic fire safety regulations?  Will it be banned forever and a day from ever getting a public contract?  It absolutely should be.  Can the Minister also confirm whether the Whitehall College of Further Education was also built by Western Building Systems in 2008?  It has been sitting empty to this day because issues were also identified there, initially by the National Standards Authority and because a case subsequently taken by the Office of Public Works over breaches of regulations and building controls.  That building is sitting there empty.<\/p> <p>  Can the Minister tell us who is paying for the remediation?  We understand the report on the Lusk Educate Together cost &euro;900,000.  Did we pay for that?  Have we paid nearly &euro;1 million for remediation of work that is actually the responsibility of Western Building Systems?  If we did then that is shocking.  Are we paying for all the other remediation works that have to be done?  Is the tax-paying public picking up the bill for the shoddy work carried out by Western Building Systems?<\/p><p>To what extent was the Department itself signing off on all of this right through the process?  Were there no checks on proper compliance back in 2008?  Why was the Department guilty, from what I understand, from October 2015 right up until now of suppressing the information about the extent to which these schools were failing to comply with basic fire safety, putting children at risk, and failing to acknowledge this when repeatedly questioned about it?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017092600002#E00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Deputy Troy had indicated to speak, I assume because one of the schools is in his constituency, but he has just stepped out.

Before even looking at matters of education and ethos, when a school takes children in as young as four their safety and security in their surroundings has to be absolutely paramount.  What we have learned since 1 September is incredibly concerning.  I share my colleagues' concerns, particularly with regard to the delay.  We know that it was reported in 2015 that one of the schools in question, a school in Greystones built in 2008, had serious fire safety concerns.  I would like to know what the Department did when this came to its attention in 2015.  We know that the reports on these schools were finalised in 2016 so it seems strange that they were not published until September of this year.  The summer holiday period would seem to have been a good time during which to try to do some of the remediation work needed, as opposed to not letting the schools know until 1 September, the very day the report was published.  It would surely have been more beneficial for the schools to have received these reports beforehand.  Educate Together, which manages some of these schools, has requested the reports on its schools on several occasions, as Deputy Boyd Barrett has indicated.  Why was was it refused, why was it denied these reports and why the delay?<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that the Minister has said that he will include the schools built under the rapid-build programme in the comprehensive set of measures he has put in place.  It was claimed at the time that all buildings constructed and handed over to the Department complied with the fire safety regulations.  We know, however, that the fire safety regulations have changed since 2008.  If this is the case, was it not the responsibility of the Department to ensure that remediation work was carried out in the school buildings so that they complied with the new regulations?  While I accept that protocols will be put in place, we are very concerned about the delays to date and about how this could have been allowed despite all of the different levels of sign-off required.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy has come in so I will allow him to comment before handing back to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017092600002#F00400","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Apologies.  I have a few questions, some of which may already have been asked earlier.  As the Minister knows, one of the schools identified - Educate Together in Mullingar - happens to be in my constituency.  Having spoken to the principal, I want to acknowledge that both the principal and the board of management are happy that remediation works are now being carried out.  My concern is over how this was allowed to happen and how, despite the carrying out of initial inspections and the fact that the board of management sought a copy of the report on a number of occasions, the school had to wait on the submission of a freedom of information request to learn of the actual defects in the school.  How can we have confidence that all of our schools across the country are up to adequate standards and regulations?<\/p><p>The principal of the Educate Together school has said the principals of other schools throughout the country have been ringing her to ask how she had made sure the defects in her school were being addressed because they could not have them addressed in their schools, which is quite worrying.  Is the Minister satisfied that adequate resources have been put in place to deal with defects found by schools that have gone to the bother of identifying weaknesses or defects, be they electrical, plumbing or a leak in the roof?<\/p><p> While the speed of delivery of the rapid school build programmes is welcome, another principal to whom I spoke had identified issues in the completion of snag lists.  In some instances they are not completed to the best standards unless the chairperson of the board of management is thorough and follows through to the nth degree.  In some instances schools have been passed, even though on issues such as disabled access and toilets they do not come up to scratch.  Who from the Department goes out to make sure new buildings meet the requirements of the health and safety and disabled access building regulations? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017092600002#F00500","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank members for the comprehensive range of questions.  The rapid build approach was introduced in 2008.  After planning permission was obtained, the contractor did the design and build work.  The contractor signed off in 2008 that the buildings were compliant with the terms of the fire certificate.  However, defects were found in a particular school in the batch from 2008.  The Department then undertook to conduct an audit of the other schools in the batch.  It's approach was to deal with the fire officer for the school and pursue the contractor to undertake the necessary work.  I understand the contractor indicated that it was being undertaken.  When a subsequent inspection occurred, however, it was discovered that it had not been undertaken.  That is what led to the Department stepping in and contracting to have the work undertaken.<\/p> <p>  The new protocol has addressed the deficiency of not informing schools and school patrons.  It requires in all cases where there are significant fire issues the school board and patron to be informed.  That is the approach being taken on every issue that comes to our attention.  It includes fire issues on snag lists, or applications to undertake emergency or summer works or audits.  They will all go through the new internal committee which was established to make sure no issue would be missed with a fire safety dimension, to be assessed, to ensure a protocol will be followed and the school will be informed, as I outlined in my opening remarks. <\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Thomas Byrne's question about works where there have been refusals, applications are received to undertake summer and emergency works which may have a fire safety dimension.<\/p><p>They will be refused where, for example, there is already an adequate alarm system in place and it is not necessary to replace it or where there was some dimension of add-on to the level of fire alarming and safety lighting and those additional works were not approved or it could have been an electrical upgrade. I will ask the new internal committee to make sure that the criteria being used in all these cases are robust and that no case is missed.  Each case would have been examined to see if it was appropriate for funding under the scheme.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked whether standards are slipping.  Under the new building regulation introduced in 2014, the certification process has been upgraded.  It is no longer the contractor certifying that this has been done at the hand-over.  There is now an additional obligation on the professionals concerned to individually certify that the work has been completed to those standards and in accordance with the fire certificate issued at the time of construction.<\/p><p> As I indicated in my opening remarks, to strengthen that, we have written to all the professional bodies and individuals involved in contracts.  Deputy Troy raised the new builds in place.  In addition, we have decided that a clerk of works will be appointed to be the eyes and ears of the Department to ensure that as the construction is conducted every element of the certificate is complied with.  We do not have an indication that the standards are slipping but we are taking every step to make sure that the standards are at the highest level.<\/p><p> In respect of the freedom of information request and why audits were not released, the decision on freedom of information is entirely independent.  It was made by an independent officer in accordance with the normal process.  The approach we are taking for the future is not to publish such audits but to pursue a protocol for snagging or audits.  It is first to assess the seriousness of the issue.  If it is serious there will be consultation with the fire officer and the school will be informed.  The school will then decide, as it sees fit, based on each individual case, how it informs the school community.  We will not as a routine publish every request for fire issues.  We are taking this new approach which we believe is robust and I think it is the correct approach to deal with this.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Martin asked how the representative audit will be conducted and how Western Building Systems will be audited.  I assure her that 100% of Western Building Systems will be audited.  The issue of sub-contractors does not really arise because the main contractor has the responsibility but we will conduct a 100% audit going back to 2003.  <\/p><p> In respect of the representative audit of another 30 buildings, they are being selected to ensure they have mix based on where there would be, if one likes, a risk-weighted.  we will look, in particular, at rapid builds as that is where these issues have arisen.  It will be a representative audit.  Given that it will be a representative sample of that size, we will be able to complete the work by January and at that point we will take decisions as to whether that reveals exposure in certain types of build and we will make decisions at that point as to whether an additional audit should be undertaken.<\/p><p> The issue of saying children were not in danger in these schools was based on a discussion with the fire officer in the context of the audit.  The audit revealed that the fire retardation period was not being fulfilled.<\/p><p>We understood it was more than 30 minutes, but it had not reached the 60 minute requirement.  The fire officer had not deemed it to be dangerous.  Obviously, with the fire officer, we were determined to ensure the defects would be addressed.<\/p><p> As to who is responsible for the defects, that is an issue which will have to be examined based on legal advice.  In some cases we have decided that simply going back to the original builder and requesting for some of the elements to be repaired would not be the best outcome for the school.  We have decided to contract for new fire doors with entirely new units rather than carry out repairs in order that we will be 100% confident the new units being installed are of the highest standard.  That means that we are meeting the cost involved rather than pursuing whatever hold we have over a contractor to undertake the corrective works.  At the end of the day, who is responsible and what costs we can recoup are matters on which we are taking advice from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.<\/p><p> As the Chairman stated, there should have been earlier notification of the schools and that will happen in the future.  We have changed the approach in the light of our experience and it is the right one.<\/p><p> On whether it is an issue of resources, it is not.  All cases where we have various programmes to deal with the issue will be dealt with where there is any question of a risk to a child.  Resources will not prevent intervention.  We always prioritise such cases.  One of the elements of the new protocol I have put in place is that there will be an internal fire safety committee which will comprise experts.  Every case, whether it involves a snag list with a fire safety issue or an application, an audit or whatever else, will go through the expert committee to ensure nothing will be lost, appropriate action will be taken and it will be prioritised within budgetary constraints.<\/p><p> Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett asked whether Western Building Systems was eligible to apply for further contracts.  It can.  The rules under which tendering occurs are very strict as to when an individual or a contractor can be disallowed from participating in the process.

That has progressed the position of the bank and also the position of the State during that period.  That is a positive transaction in confirming the position of private investors in terms of their view of the bank and realising for the State a significant amount of capital and positioning it to realise more capital as it wishes.<\/p> <p>  The financial performance of the bank, as reported in its recent half year financial statements, continues to be positive and strong, with strong levels of capital and strong levels of profitability.  The economy is one of the key issues that underpins the success and the position of the bank.  That continues to perform well and strongly and it is evidenced by our ability to grow our lending position into the economy as has been evidenced by the growth in lending statistics, both in the SME sector and the housing side during that period.<\/p> <p>  One of the key issues affecting the economy at this point in time, and nationally, is around housing.  The severe shortage of housing is one of the factors that we will focus on quite significantly as a bank and deploy our resources to try to help in terms of the bank's position around housing.  Interest rates are obviously a crucial issue in that context.  The bank has recently made significant progress in terms of announcing a fifth standard variable rate, SVR reduction and positioning ourselves in terms of our front and back book positioning across the institutions.  We believe the position we hold on SVR is very attractive and one that reflects the overall objective of the bank to be fair to our customer sets.  <\/p> <p>  The arrears, non-performing loans and tracker issues are an important development.  We have made significant progress in terms of the tracker redress scheme at this point in time.  Also, in term of our overall perspective on arrears, significant progress has  been made by reducing by a very significant amount the arrears position both in terms of the SME population, in terms of the construction side and the residential mortgage portfolios but we will undoubtedly talk about those later.<\/p> <p>  Brexit is a key issue for the economy and a key issue for the bank.  In the short term there has been very little impact on the economic side so far but that will progress as the economy develops.  Perhaps the key issue to talk about because it is not discussed significantly is what has actually changed in the economy from a banking point of view in the past eight years.  One of the sections in this report deals with how the regulatory environment has changed very significantly in the past eight years, as Europe has effectively taken charge of the banking system both in Ireland and across Europe in general.<\/p> <p>  The key elements that I have discussed which are important to reflect upon is that AIB, in line with other major institutions in the country, is now regulated from Europe.<\/p><p>We know that is the case but the effect is to have a standard common platform for deep and intrusive regulation across all key financial services companies in Europe and that provides a degree of assurance about the prudential standards being applied.  The level of capital implicit in the system has very significantly increased both in terms of its quality and the way it is calculated.  The amount of capital, as estimated by the Governor of the Bank of England rather than ourselves, is now about 10 times higher than before the crisis and that is because of increases in the quantum and the way capital is calculated.<\/p><p> The third point is that significant progress has been made on the recovery and resolution regime.  Effectively, in addition to equity capital, bail-in capital is being provided.  In combination with the recovery and resolution planning through which all institutions are forced to go that provides a degree of assurance that in the event of another crisis or problem emerging in any financial institution or marketplace the system is now quite robust and the rescue of any system or bank would in the first instance and, in most cases all instances, be out of a European resolution plan with the bail-in of that capital.  All of that increases the cost of operating the bank in terms of complying with regulation but it provides a much more secure and sound banking system that operates to European as opposed to individual jurisdictional norms for all countries concerned and not just Ireland.  As we conclude our IPO, it is worth reflecting how that system has changed quite dramatically over that time period.<\/p><p> We recognise future changes such as in terms of the competitor set but fundamentally think the Irish economy is well positioned and AIB is well positioned therein to continue to support growth in terms of individual customer ambitions and industry ambition to grow and develop.<\/p><p> That is a quick summary of the report and hopefully is consistent with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017092600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Byrne and his colleagues and thank them for the information provided to the committee in advance, including the detailed questionnaire and the opening statement.

I welcome the recent mortgage rate reduction announcement by AIB and that it applies to all customers, both new and existing.  That is an important point.  AIB bank does not offer cashback in respect of mortgages although EBS does.  I will address that issue in a moment.  Many EBS customers have contacted committee members to say they feel very aggrieved that once again an interest rate cut announced by AIB does not apply to them.  Mr. Byrne might explain the status of EBS as a separate entity that is also within the AIB group and explain its mortgage pricing policy because its existing customers feel very hard done by that they do not benefit from the 2% cashback which is offered to new customers of EBS and strongly believe - I support them in this regard - that they pay a higher interest rate than they ought in order to finance the cashback offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017092600002#D00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506438000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>In overall terms, the position the Deputy referred to of what AIB has offered in terms of front and back book pricing is our core principle that we believe it appropriate and fair to do that.

A figure in the region of &euro;190 million was referenced.  It is a very good example of the issue between front and back book pricing and its implications because to apply a rate reduction across front and back book is an expensive proposition but we believe it is the right thing to do and consistent with our proposition to customers that they do not need to look out for a better rate in the market because the rate we offer customers in terms of attracting new business is the same as the rate for the back book.

People did not think through the consequences of the suspension of the rate environment around the tracker position at that point with regard to new customers getting that rate.  Existing customers who had tracker mortgages obviously continued forward.

The implication is that the risk of funding off an ECB rate had changed and therefore the cost of an overall tracker at that rate was higher, considering the historical margin.  In the same way we can demonstrate that the margins had changed historically - even the rates I have quoted change from 0.42% to 1.6% - it is evident that there was a difference in margins at different times.  If one looks back at this historically, standard variable rates, SVRs, and trackers were quite closely correlated for most of history.  The disconnection took place after the financial crisis following the ECB disconnecting from funding rates.  The ECB rate became a non-fundable rate in the marketplace and therefore the cost of a tracker at an ECB rate would have had a higher margin and it would have equated it back in the same sort of territory as an SVR, if not higher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017092600002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":261,"content":"<p>How many customers would be in that category of a 3.67% prevailing rate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017092600002#H01400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506438000,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I do not know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017092600002#H01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Have they been communicated with?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017092600002#H01600","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506438000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Any customer who would have inquired or sought the information would have been communicated with.

Uncertainty is never a friend of any investor or business.  That is problem number one.  The other factors relate to how certain sectors will be affected because of their large trading position in the UK.

There are also regional influences given the considerations and lack of clarity over how the border issues will develop.  These are just three pieces but there are more.<\/p> <p>  I will outline what we try to do.  We have 21 Brexit advisers appointed across the network to work with SMEs to inform them of what is going on.  Many SMEs do not necessarily have the opportunity to understand the detail.  It is also a question of figuring out what we, as a bank, can actually do.  Therefore, it is a two-way pipe in terms of understanding the positioning.  The solution set depends on the size or nature of the business.  Some businesses that have very significant activities in the UK will seek to position part of their businesses in the UK, effectively to eliminate the risk of a separation.  That will take place, so there is an investment that people need to make.  It is sometimes quite a significant move for people who have operated indigenously to establish in two locations.  On the other hand, there will be some opportunity for UK entities coming into Ireland to invest.  We are positioned to try to deal with that.<\/p> <p>  Until there is greater clarity as to what is actually happening, it is about preparing.  The currency move has obviously taken place.  I am not saying it is over in terms of a sterling effect but a lot of businesses have had to address and deal with that.  Businesses have actually weathered that probably better than people might have thought possible.  There have been some countervailing benefits in terms of commodity prices which have probably helped but, to date, the phenomenon has been muted, other than in respect of one or two individual sectors that have suffered more dramatically because of totally currency-related effects.

A bubble would mean that this will bust and those values will come down.  The factors that caused that in the past include credit.  Now it could be that the factors causing it include cash buyers, that is, non-debt buyers, in the market, who are buying 50% of homes, and some of the larger funds, including pension funds, which are snapping up commercial property.  That is perhaps the reason we do not need to be as concerned as we were in the past about the debt that underpinned it.  However, 50% of the market are relying on debt and the other 50% are cash buyers.  If people are taking out mortgages or entering into debt with banks and they are in a game where the prices have been artificially increased, when the pin comes out and the bubble bursts they will see themselves in a worse situation.  The bank will probably be okay given the loan to value ratios are on average about 79%.  They can absorb it.  However, I am thinking from a customer point of view.

That is a different point.  On the residential side, perhaps a comfort point exists around the ultimate construction cost and the development cost of properties relative to the pricing that exists in the market.  There is quite a bit of evidence to suggest that pricing needed to rise in the context of a whole series of things.  I am happy to give my thoughts, for what they are worth, in respect of those things.  However, effectively, the construction costs that exist at this point in time and the development costs of the entire cycle are in line with where prices are getting to as opposed to being completely distorted relative to where prices are at this stage.  That, coupled with the affordability piece, which means that affordability is very strong, and macroprudential, as we said, gives protection around that, means that in the market, where prices are at this point in time, it is likely that there will be a significant number of buyers for a very long period of time who can afford those properties.

I agree with the Deputy that we have a challenge now in terms of the remaining customers with residual debt.  More than 40,000 solutions have been provided, but at the end of an eight-year period, we still have a residual of borrowers who are in difficulty.  Within that grouping we have borrowers who have no affordability, borrowers with some affordability who may be able to move on to one of the solutions, and borrowers with a short-term forbearance for whom engagement with us will work.  We do not see any silver bullet in terms of solving the problem for those with no affordability, which is the key category of customers.  However, the Government announced an enhancement to the mortgage-to-rent scheme at the end of last year.  That scheme, as we have discussed here previously, has not had the type of traction that everyone would have hoped for because of processes and so forth.  We now are now seeing customers coming through the old process and, to be frank, for the customers who are coming through, even though the numbers are small, it is a very good solution where there is no affordability.  It provides some dignity in that the customer remains in the family home and the process is not public in the sense that the home is rented through the approved housing body.  We have been working with a third party since that enhancement was announced to see how we can make the proposition more attractive because we feel that it has a broader remit.  As we come through with the mortgage-to-rent solution, albeit in only a small number of cases, we see that we are not picking up on the residual debt so we are having to compromise on that.  We are in the very late stages of that process and we expect to announce a final sign-off in relation to it soon.  Once we announce that, we feel that we will be bringing something to market which recognises the fact that we have people with no affordability who are not able to deal with their residual debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017092600002#V00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":474,"content":"<p>When Mr. O'Keeffe says the bank will be bringing something to market, will there also be a statement that the bank will deal with the residual debt?

They all left the bank as part of the reform and reorganisation of the bank up to 2011.  None of those who were part of the institution's overall governance structure survived in their role past that date.  That is not to say that I could even go back and think about that.  However, it is not the same people as those now running and organising the bank.  There is not a point at which a decision was made.

That was not done by the lady who is across the counter when a customer lodges his or her &euro;20 or &euro;100.  It happened at a senior level and, as the witness admitted, it was wrong.  We can call it whatever we want but it was theft.  The bank wrongly took money to a minimum total of tens of millions of euro from its customers and no one will be held accountable.  That is wrong.  It will happen over and over again.  No one is ever held accountable in the financial system and that is ridiculous.

To that end, we make our customers, our communities and the broader economy an integral part of all our planning and strategies.<\/blockquote> <p>I have never seen such sentences before in the opening remarks of a bank.  It is an acknowledgement of where we are now in terms of banking and all of the challenges that are faced by individuals.  However, in the next paragraph Mr. Byrne said, &quot;Likewise EBS, a separate brand but under the AIB Group, will continue to keep its interest rates under review.&quot;  I have received a letter that I shall not read in full.  However, I want to reflect the opinion expressed by the huge number of people who, as customers of EBS, wrote not just to me as Chairman but, I am sure, to other members of the committee:<\/p><blockquote>As you know several rate cuts have not been passed on to customers, many of whom are struggling despite record historically low ECB rates.  AIB customers receive the benefit of some of these rate cuts but despite the EBS being in the ownership of the State owned bank, EBS existing customers have not.  Instead, we have continued to be used to bolster the balance sheets of the bank to mitigate their reduced profits or tracker mortgages and to enable cash-back offers to be given to new customers.  As a customer in negative equity I am hit on the double as I cannot even vote with my feet and switch.  Those in the direst of circumstances with arrears and damaged credit ratings are the worst hit with artificially high rates and no option of switching, possibly ever.<\/blockquote><p>I brought that to the attention of witnesses because it reflects the message expressed in the numerous letters and emails we have received.  I have heard the various responses by the witnesses.  As they are the people responsible for the EBS as well, they should take the message into consideration.  It is not a one-off and Deputy Michael McGrath addressed the matter earlier.  I feel obliged, as Chairman, to mention the message to the witnesses.<\/p><p> The witnesses are to be commended for the social housing project or initiative.  How will it be rolled out?  I mean in terms of judging the success of the first tranche.  I can see from the tabular statement provided by the witnesses that court hearing are in progress in 3,347 cases.  It would appear that in the course of 2017 and 2018 we will see far more repossessions being achieved by financial institutions or the institutions being successful in terms of their court hearings.  Can the bank further examine all of these cases?  Can it minimise the number of cases that go to court?  Can it offer a solution either through an agency or otherwise to ease the pain for these families?  I have seen them in court and it is not a pleasant place to be.

Restructuring has been by far the most favoured option for banks.  In my last discussions here we said that one is 100 times more likely to get restructure out of difficulty than be repossessed.  Nonetheless, we recognise that we have reached the point in the cycle whereby many people are in deep difficulty.  Our legal grouping comprises three categories.  The first is people who have no affordability and will be unable to sustain a mortgage, the second is people who have some affordability and will probably be able to take on other solutions through engagement and the third is people who may fix over a period with some short-term intervention.<\/p> <p>  Earlier I referred to the mortgage-to-rent piece but I do not expect it to be the silver bullet.  Reference was made to thoughts in the industry around other pieces.  Certainly, AIB wants to identify the people who are at the point where, regrettably, they have no affordability because we want to help solve that issue.  We believe that those people are too nervous to come forward.  If they come forward then we will consider the mortgage-to-rent solution.  That is a programme of work that is taking place at the moment with a third party that we hope to launch imminently.  The initiative should give people in this category the confidence to approach us and say they have no affordability and ask what they can do.  We would then engage with them.  Some people with affordability will come forward and we will work with them to put in place the solutions we have already provided to over 40,000 customers whether that is a split mortgage, a low fixed interest rate, etc.  That is the initiative we are taking along with the proposition that has been provided by a third party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017092600002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1506438000,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Do AIB customers who find themselves in the set of circumstances described by Mr. O'Keeffe still find it difficult to approach and engage with the bank?
