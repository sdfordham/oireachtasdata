The countries which have introduced charges generally have a considerable amount of through traffic, such as Austria.  These countries want to capture revenue from hauliers passing through.  That issue does not really arise for us because most hauliers in Ireland are delivering here.  Furthermore, under European law we cannot levy tolls and road charges at the same time.

The purpose of this and any associated investigation is not to apportion blame or liability.  A safety recommendation in no case shall create a presumption of blame or liability for an occurrence.  A number of entities had safety recommendations made to them, which I mentioned, and under EU law they are required to respond to them within 90 days.  We expect them to do so.<\/p><p>  There were four recommendations made to the European Commission regarding flight time limitations, to which the Deputy referred; the role of the ticket seller; the improvement of safety oversight; and the oversight of operating licences, which relates to virtual airlines.  Three recommendations were made to the European Aviation Safety Agency relating to successive instrument approaches that can be conducted in certain meteorological conditions; the syllabus for the appointment of the commander; and the process by which the air operator certificate is granted.  Two recommendations were made to the operator, Flightline SL, regarding its operational policy and training.  One recommendation was made to the Spanish agency regarding the oversight of air carriers such as the one in question.  One recommendation was made to ICAO regarding the inclusion of the approach and the capability of aircraft, flight crew and plans.

The company&rsquo;s importance is recognised in the national ports policy, which designates the company as a tier 1 port of national significance and includes the continued commercial development of the company as a key strategic objective.  The company has published a master plan, which is available on its website and outlines its view of the challenges and opportunities for the period 2012 to 2040.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy states, there is a proposed regulation on port services and the financial transparency of ports, published by the European Commission in late May 2013 and currently under consideration by the European Parliament&rsquo;s transport committee and also by member state officials at Council level.  My Department published a regulatory impact analysis in August 2013 outlining the regulation&rsquo;s proposals and circulated it among the relevant stakeholders, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  My Department's analysis, supported by submissions received during the consultation period, was that the proposed regulation would have little impact on how port services are provided in Irish ports.  As part of my Department's consultations, no specific or general concerns were raised about the impact of this proposed directive on union involvement or worker participation in Irish ports; nor have any such concerns been raised in response to the national ports policy, published in 2013.<\/p><p>  In late November 2013, the Competition Authority published its review of competition within the ports sector  This report states that competition is working well in some areas, but the authority makes a number of recommendations for consideration that it believes will further improve competition in the sector.  In regard to Dublin Port specifically, the Competition Authority has made two specific recommendations.  As stated in National Ports Policy, I am committed to issuing a reasoned response to the Competition Authority&rsquo;s recommendations within six months of the publication of the report.<\/p><p>  The company recently published on its website a franchise review consultation document that outlines its views on the future management of port service operations within the port, which my officials are considering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800009#G00400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Those who favour competition will say it will lead to more jobs and growth, whereas those considering liberalisation will say it could result in job losses and a deterioration in working conditions.  There is a fear that profitability margins dictating policy and procedure will have negative effects on those companies that have been working at the port over the years and which have invested heavily therein.<\/p><p>  The issue of the workers also arises.  I am from a dockland community and know the way in which workers' rights, conditions, health and safety and a proper working wage have been fought for and negotiated down through the years.  I can remember a family who were involved in the button system and all the abuses that occurred at that stage.  I acknowledge the work of some of the unions, particularly that of the Marine, Port and General Workers' Union under the late Jimmy Dunne.  There are fears.<\/p><p>  The Competition Authority is pushing for more licenses.  This will bring in other companies that could bring in workers at the minimum wage or lower.  How can the traditional companies and traditional dockland families who have been doing their jobs year after year and handing down the tradition compete with that?  The wages and conditions of those in this group are seriously compromised, as could be health and safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800009#G00500","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>It is worth pointing out that Dublin Port is now a very lean operation; it has only approximately 100 staff.  Effectively, the port is now a landlord and estate management company.  The terminals are operated by three different private companies, all of which are competing with one another.  I am satisfied with the level of internal competition in the port.  I do not recognise any major need for increased competition at the port, although I acknowledge that the Competition Authority makes some valid points about the length of leases.  In some cases, they are very long.  The authority's view is that leases for as long as 90 years are inappropriate.<\/p><p>At the same time, we all know about property rights and I suspect it would be very hard to untangle those leases.  Even when it comes to issuing more licences, and the port is open to doing that, one would have to ask where those additional people would base themselves on the port estate.  I do not know how that will work out.<\/p><p> As regards the national ports policy, I refer to the view of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on our national ports policy, which is the Government's policy, not the Competition Authority's report, which is a different thing.  It states that ICTU welcomes the broad thrust of the policy.  With regard to the regulation to which the Deputy referred, ICTU says its understands that this regulation is now under active consideration.  It says that it has studied the proposed regulation and at this point does not see any policy emerging that is likely to result in the requirement to fundamentally change the organisation of the ports in the Republic of Ireland.  It has asked the European Transport Workers' Federation to keep it up to speed on any emerging developments so that it might offer a further view on this matter.<\/p><p> We remain engaged with ICTU on this issue.

Works on these roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded from this additional funding is also a matter for the local authority concerned.<\/p><p>  Last month, I announced that a total of &euro;331.9 million would be provided to local authorities for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads in 2014.  I will give local authorities significantly increased flexibility this year.  I have reduced the number of grant categories, increased the amount allocated under the discretionary grant heading and will facilitate the transfer of funds between key grant categories where local authorities need this.  Local authorities can also re-prioritise their road strengthening programme where necessary.  In addition, local authorities can use up to 15% of their discretionary grant for the local improvement scheme covering non-public roads.<\/p><p>  In making adjustments to the regional and local road allocations in 2014, my primary aim has been, as far as is practicable, to strike an important balance.  On the one hand, local authorities will have more flexibility than ever to target funding to appropriate repair and rehabilitation schemes in local areas.  On the other hand, I want to ensure key programmes that promote preventative maintenance and safety projects on public roads continue to be funded.  Given funding constraints, the Government's priority has to be to protect previous investment in the road network.  In short, we are putting maintenance and repair first.  It is also particularly important that local authorities do not reduce expenditure from their own resources on roads this year in view of the current difficult situation, and that they carefully reassess their planned road programmes for 2014 in light of the impact of the recent storms on their road networks.<\/p><p>  In principle, I\u00a0intend to give local authorities greater,\u00a0possibly full, discretion\u00a0over their spending of State grants for roads in 2015.  I believe local authorities and their elected members are best placed to make decisions of where and for what roads\u00a0funding should\u00a0be spent in their own county rather than allowing that decision to be made by central government or the Department.  This, however, will depend on wider Government consideration of the funding of local authorities and the various sources from which local authorities now receive their funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800012#K00700","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1392736500,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  His intentions and efforts in this area are very welcome.  It is very important local authorities do not reduce their funding for road maintenance or for improvement works where they can happen.  It is important to continue to invest in roads through maintaining existing local roads or improving road networks where we can, not only because of the recent weather issues but also in terms of investment and economic stimulus for the country.  It is also important that individual local authority members rather than the executive take more responsibility in managing funding and prioritising where the money must go.  It is not an unlimited amount of money, and some areas need more investment than others.  It is for the individual members of Dublin City Council and other local authorities to make use of the money and they know how best to do it.<\/p><p>  It is regrettable that the provision to each local authority of 80% of the funding from the local property tax raised in its area is not being maintained.  We need to put this commitment back in place on a statutory basis for 2015 so that future Governments will not be able to reverse it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800012#K00800","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speech","time":1392736500,"counter":79,"content":"<p>While no definite decision has yet been made on this, next year I would like to make a block grant to each local authority and leave it up to them to decide how they want to allocate it.

They can also use money from commercial rates.  It is intended that next year 80% of the local property tax will go to the local authorities concerned, and this can be increased or decreased by up to 15%.<\/p><p>The Government is moving towards much greater discretion on the part of local authorities in how they raise and spend money on local and regional roads, which is what local government should be all about.  As Deputy Eoghan Murphy will be aware, the local property tax is really a matter for the Ministers for Finance and the Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, I am of a similar view to the Deputy, that we should ensure the aforementioned 80% commitment will be honoured in 2015 and that the money will stay at a local level and be spent locally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800012#K00900","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Airport Security","time":1392737100,"counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800013#L00200"},{"type":"question","time":1392737100,"counter":82,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[7520\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800013#L00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on the fact that the Defence Forces have been called in on aid to civil power duties at Shannon airport over 300 times a year for the past number of years is undermining the commercial operation of the airport.

Under section 103, the duties imposed by subsection 1 do not extend to requiring the ombudsman to provide information where disclosure would, in its opinion, prejudice a criminal investigation or prosecution, jeopardise a person's safety or for any other reason is not in the public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800018#Q00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1392740100,"counter":150,"content":"<p>What is the relevance of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800018#Q00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1392740100,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Will the Taoiseach repeat that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800018#Q00500","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1392740100,"counter":152,"content":"<p>The Government considered the matter this morning.

Is that the scale of what will happen in respect of a matter that is extremely important?<\/p><p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that the Minister did not level with the D&aacute;il last week.  He did not share written information that was in his possession because he wanted to down play the entire matter by saying it was just a bottle of smoke.  One could hear the message on the news bulletins over the following 24 hours that we should move on because it was a bottle of smoke.  The members of the commission had to go on &quot;Prime Time&quot; to bury that notion.  The Minister did not refer to the fact that a public interest investigation had been invoked, that government level technology was being used or that the likelihood that the threats were benign was remote or close to zero.  He should man up and apologise to the House for his behaviour on this issue and the manner in which he treated GSOC.  The issue is wider than this.  I raised it with the Taoiseach last week and it is not going away because I will be raising it again this week.  There is something fundamentally wrong at the very core of the administration of justice.  The Minister has taken the wrong route on this issue and on a number of other issues that go to the very heart of the administration of justice in this country.

In recent weeks, the Taoiseach, along with the T&aacute;naiste, held out the possibility of tax cuts, as he said, as the Government finances improve.  It would be a miracle of convenience if the scope of such tax cuts became apparent in the run-up to the general election.  Such a cynical return to auction politics would surely fly in the face of everything the Government claims it stands for.<\/p><p>  The debate on tax cuts has begun and a conversation has started.  The tax cuts are being presented as necessary to give middle-income Ireland a break, but who precisely is middle-income Ireland, and will cuts in income tax benefit anyone to any great extent?  I refer the Taoiseach to the Quarterly Economic Observer from the Nevin Economic Research Institute, which was produced last week, based on the CSO's 2009 survey on income and living standards, which throws up some important facts, the most important of which is that there is now no middle-income Ireland.  What exists is a vast army of poorly paid working people struggling to make ends meet.  The average household disposable income after tax, PRSI and universal social charge is &euro;46,000.  Some 56% of householders have gross income of &euro;10,000 to &euro;50,000.  There are 2 million adults with disposable incomes of less than &euro;500 per week and more than 500,000 are on less than &euro;200 per week.  Only 30% of households have a gross income of over &euro;70,000.  Income tax cuts would benefit this layer but would do nothing for most households.<\/p><p>  Does the Taoiseach agree that what is required to give people a break is not a cynical political stunt by the Government on income tax cuts but a pay increase, particularly for the low paid, an increase in the minimum wage, strong wage floors in the revamped joint labour committees, and affordable child care?  A 50% reduction in costs would give more families an extra &euro;50 a week.  These are the things that can be done.<\/p><p>Is the Taoiseach prepared to look at these rather than introducing cynical tax cuts?  In the debate on tax cuts, VAT has not been mentioned once, even though it obviously would have been of most benefit to those with the least.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800019#R04600","speaker":"1032","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392741300,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Do not hedge your bets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800020#S00200","nonspeaker":"A Deputy"},{"type":"speech","time":1392741300,"counter":220,"content":"<p>The Government has set out its priorities for this year in the sense that the action plan for jobs and driving forward the Government's priorities to grow our economy constitute the real priority in terms of creating jobs.  As the Deputy is aware, following the exit from the bailout, the Government published its medium-term economic strategy.  That indicates a 2% growth this year, 2.5% next year and 3% in 2016.  It also indicates that in 2015 our deficit will be below 3%, eliminated by 2018, and all the jobs that were lost during the course of this recession restored by 2020.  To that effect, the Government introduced a number of issues in the recent budget to help small and medium enterprises, including bank targets for increased lending and access to credit.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the minimum wage and other things but these are all matters that have to be considered and discussed as we prepare for budget 2015.  Work on that measure is already under way.  The Deputy also referred to the report from the Nevin Institute, but the ceilings have been set for this year and the budget is in place.  As we move through 2014 the Minister for Finance and his Department will monitor the growth of our economy in the context of jobs.  <\/p><p>  For 20 consecutive months we have had a fall in the live register, which is now approaching European norms.  That is the best way of giving young unemployed people an opportunity to get jobs and to pursue careers.  <\/p><p>  As regards the Deputy's question on tax cuts, I have made it perfectly clear that it is the Government's priority that people hit the high rate of tax on too low a wage at the moment.  It is a priority to assist people in these sectors who are caught because of the challenges arising from the economic collapse a number of years ago.<\/p><p>  All of those issues will be considered by the Government as we prepare for budget 2015.

The Mandate union won a 3% increase for Penney's workers recently, backdated to 2013.  Mr. John Callan, a shop steward from Dundalk, was delighted with the backpay but he spent it on the local property tax.  Some 3,000 workers got 3% extra in their wages which should enable them to buy into the real economy.  People on low incomes require wage increases, not tax cuts.

In that sense, careful fiscal discipline and economic monitoring are important elements of the Government's work that is now under way as we prepare for budget 2015.<\/p><p>  There are no auction politics here; it is a straight statement of fact.

That does not suggest any great sense of urgency on the part of the Cabinet in respect of this issue.  According to the Central Bank's figures more than 140,000 families are in arrears but those figures do not include buy-to-let properties.  It seems to me the Government has made no real impact on reducing the numbers of families experiencing mortgage distress. For instance, in September 2009 the number of families in arrears for more than 90 days was approximately 3.3%.  The latest statistics show that this figure has increased to 12.9%.  Rather than having a solution to this matter we are seeing an escalation of the crisis for families and householders across the State.<\/p><p>  The number doubled in the last 18 months of the previous government and it has doubled again in the first two years of this Administration.  A research paper by the Central Bank analyst, Yvonne McCarthy, states that three-quarters of all homes in mortgage arrears have at least one person in employment.  That is interesting because it means that mortgage distress touches not just those thousands of unemployed people but also those in work. Ms McCarthy notes further that when one examines the figures, employment is not always secure.  That raises all sorts of issues concerning security of employment, the misuse of flexible work arrangements and zero-hour contracts.  <\/p><p>  The Taoiseach amended the Land and Conveyancing Act in such a manner as to leave home-owners at the mercy of banks when the threat of repossession looms.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears has removed some of the protections the code originally offered to home owners.  There are also issues around the personal insolvency regime, which was much lauded by the Taoiseach.  For many people, however, it is not fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800020#S01300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1392741300,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Perhaps we could have a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800020#S01400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1392741300,"counter":234,"content":"<p>This does not add up to a confident scenario.

That is why the committee will meet again in March.  It is sometimes interfered with by requirements to attend meetings elsewhere.<\/p><p>  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 has been passed and the legislation introduced three new forms of non-judicial debt settlement arrangement.  The Act also reduces the automatic discharge period of bankruptcy from 12 years to three years.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, was established to regulate the new debt settlement arrangements and it is open to accept applications from applicants in September 2013.  As of February, there are 111 personal insolvency practitioners who develop debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements.  These are two of the debt solutions.  There are also 63 individuals capable of acting as approved intermediaries who can develop a debt relief notice.  The insolvency service has indicated that there are hundreds of cases in the pipeline at different stages of verification by the ISI before it can be forwarded to the court for a decision.  The court may issue a protective certificate, which offers debtors legal protection for a period of 70 days, during which time an arrangement between the creditor or creditors and the insolvent debtor can be put together.  To date, two debt relief notices, two debt settlement arrangements and one personal insolvency arrangements have been approved.  There is, as yet, no definitive evidence of any banks vetoing proposals.  There is some evidence that some banks are trying to reach arrangements with clients short of entering into a formal insolvency process.  Banks are clearly becoming more focused in their attempts to reduce the mortgage arrears book and the existence of the ISI is helping as a catalyst in this process.<\/p><p>  Since March 2013, the Central Bank has set quarterly targets for six banks to make offers of sustainable solutions, and I mean sustainable solutions, to customers with arrears in excess of 90 days.  These banks are Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank, ACC Bank and KBC Bank.  The Central Bank has conducted an audit of the banks quarter 2 2013 results and found the banks have achieved their targets for sustainable solutions of 20% of those in arrears for 90 days or more.  At the end of September 2013, the lenders in total report that they had issued proposals to 43% of mortgage accounts in arrears, as against a target of 30%.  The Central Bank will shortly make undertaken audit of the banks progress against quarter 3 and quarter 4 targets for 2013.<\/p><p>  The introduction of the mortgage to rent scheme, which facilitates families to stay in their homes through the transfer of ownership to a local authority or an approved housing body is another issue.  To date, almost 1,975 cases have been put forward by the lenders and, of these, 1,360 are being followed through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800021#T00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1392741900,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Is that mortgage to rent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800021#T00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1392741900,"counter":238,"content":"<p>In addition, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, announced a new &euro;20 million fund to allow local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages.<\/p><p>  Deputy McDonald also mentioned arrears.  The total number of mortgage accounts in arrears has fallen by 5,833 between August and December of last year.  The number of mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days has fallen from 82,624 to 79,782, a drop of 2,842 compared to the end of August.  The number of total temporary restructures continues to fall and this indicates a move towards greater utilisation of permanent solutions.  The total number of permanent restructures has risen by 9,952 up to December.  There has been a significant rise in the split mortgages arrangements, from 2,500 to 6,239.  The Central Bank mortgage arrears statistics reinforces the picture of a gradual improvement, although not as quick as one would like.  Figures for quarter 3 to end of September in 2013 show that the number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses in arrears fell from 142,892, or 18.5% of the total stock, to 141,520.  That is the first decrease since the Central Bank series began in September 2009.<\/p><p>  Deputy McDonald mentioned mortgages being sold to portfolio buyers and suggested they would not be regulated by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, of the Central Bank.  The Deputy is aware that the sale process for the IBRC residential mortgages is currently under way.  The final bidding date is 14 March 2014 and the continued application of the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears in respect of the IBRC residential mortgage portfolio depends upon the regulatory status of who acquires the portfolio at the end.  In 2012, GE Money sold its residential portfolio of approximately 3,500 mortgages to the Australian company Pepper Finance Corporation (Ireland).  As the group acquired the entire servicing platform from GE Money, the acquired entity remains regulated and CCMA continues to apply to the transaction.  In December 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold its Irish residential portfolio of 2,000 mortgages to Apollo Global Management.  Apollo Global Management met the Central Bank and the Department and indicated clearly that it intended to voluntarily adopt the CCMA to manage the acquired loans.  Apollo Global Management believes following CCMA is in the best interests of both and forms part of its core strategy.  The Minister for Finance is aware of the concerns of borrowers about the sale of mortgage books to funds not covered by the CCMA.  The Minister has instructed his Department to examine the issue in consultation with the Central Bank with a view to bringing forward a solution.  Given that it is a complex legal issue, it requires careful consideration so as not to put at risk the application of the code of conduct.  We will not know the regulatory status of the ultimate acquirer of the portfolio until the sale process is concluded.  The outcome will determine whether we need to do anything.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party proposes to make adherence to the CCMA a condition of the sales process but the insertion of such a condition is legally questionable as it leads to the erosion of the value of the assets from which all creditors must seek proceeds.  The insertion of conditions that may erode the value would leave the special liquidators and the State open to challenge and possible compensation.<\/p><p>  Under current laws, compliance with the CCMA is a necessary condition for lenders seeking to obtain court orders for repossessions of primary residences.  The court will otherwise not allow it.  I do not have figures to hand but the vast majority of repossessions have been voluntary.  A number have gone down the court route but the vast majority have been voluntary.  I can supply the Deputy with up-to-date figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800021#T00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1392741900,"counter":239,"content":"<p>The inescapable reality is that the Taoiseach has no real appreciation of the huge crisis and distress in the lives of so many of our people as a result of unsustainable mortgages.  Over the ten-year criminal property bubble, a generation of young people were blackmailed into paying prices for the simple human right of a roof over their heads, the level of which has now imprisoned them.  With the number of crisis mortgages having doubled under this Administration, as the previous Administration did, putting forward that it has reduced somewhat, to just 80,000, as a major step forward does not in any way recognise that these are 80,000 individuals, or often families, who are hugely distressed.<\/p><p>The Government has come up with no alternative of a sustainable variety that would provide a quick way out for those in distress.  In his reply, the Taoiseach was at pains in referring to the 13,000 IBRC mortgages to look out for the interests of creditors, or in other words, the financiers that are involved.  Their interests have always been put first.<\/p><p> Is the Taoiseach in any way ashamed that his Government is handing over 13,000 individuals and families to vulture funds from God knows where?  Despite what he said, these people do not and will not have guarantees if the mortgages are bought by outside interests based in the United States.  Is it not the case that those home owners could be subjected, for example, to increases in interest rates and put under intolerable pressure with regard to repossession by means of threats or debt collection agencies pursuing them if the vulture fund wants to change or implement a sell-off in the portfolio?<\/p><p> Is it not quite shocking that as far as the Fine Gael and Labour Government is concerned, the financial institutions, bondholders and the hedge funds which were up to their necks in creating the financial gambling casino that was the international financial markets in the ten or 15 years to 2008 - a cabal that reaped obscene profits on the backs of vulnerable mortgage holders-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800021#T00500","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392742500,"counter":241,"content":"<p>We cannot have speeches now, as this is Question Time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800022#U00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1392742500,"counter":242,"content":"<p>They crashed the economy as a result but the Government is now handing over the victims of the crash for further torture to the very people who caused it.

It should write down generally to today's prices the level of blackmail mortgage debt that people were forced to take, calibrate downwards monthly mortgage payments and give security to the people now in distress.  It should also release hundreds of millions of euro per year into the domestic economy that would otherwise go into dead banks.  It would be part of a process of rebooting the economy.

It is an important issue and I have indicated to Deputies that there can be a series of priority questions regarding particular issues.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Higgins's contribution, we are talking about the recovery of the economy.  The number of people in work is increasing and the number of people on the live register has been decreasing for 20 consecutive months.  That is helping a number of people get out of their mortgage difficulties and provide the opportunity to make progress.  I have given the figures to Deputy McDonald.  There is a modest recovery in house prices, so that will lessen negative equity, although it does not apply all over the country by any means.  It is a small but welcome development.<\/p><p>  Deputy Higgins is well aware that at the height of the so-called Celtic tiger we were building 100,000 houses when we needed 30,000 houses per year but we are now building 6,500 houses when we need 25,000 or 30,000 houses per year.  To get to a point where we can catapult this goal into action, we must consider where planning permissions were issued that are not suitable for building, where other planning permissions are under consideration and the requirement for good contractors to be able to have a stream of income so as to develop a site and build houses.  That requires a lending opportunity from a lender or lenders.  There is clearly much pressure for detached and family houses in the greater Dublin area and that will be the focus of housing discussions here and at a special Cabinet meeting I called for next week.<\/p><p>  The Deputy specifically mentioned the IBRC.  There are legal requirements to maximise the returns in all these cases and at the end of May there were 17,411 residential loans in IBRC outstanding to 13,000 customers.  Taxpayers have already incurred far too high a price from this bank and no further costs should be imposed on them.  It is important to note that the special liquidators have confirmed that all borrowers are permitted to pay their mortgage at par value and there are no legislative barriers to that.  If the bids received are not in excess of the valuation set out, the portfolio will be sold to NAMA.  As I indicated to Deputy McDonald, in two previous cases in 2012 and 2013, the full compliance not only of the contracts applicable to the mortgages but also the extra code of conduct requirements set up by the Central Bank were adhered to.  The latest interested group has stated clearly that it wishes to be regulated and voluntarily submitted to abide by the codes of conduct if it ends up completing the acquisition.  That is the interests of everybody.<\/p><p>  The position with regard to repossessions is very clear and I do not accept at all the Deputy's scaremongering tactics and argument that people will have investigators outside the back door telling them to move because the house is in negative equity or the mortgage holder is in arrears.  If the bids are not received to value, NAMA will acquire these loans, and it complies completely with codes of conduct.  Repossession is the last resort, and as I stated in response to an earlier questions, the vast majority of cases have been voluntarily submitted, as distinct from being a decision of the court.  People make up their minds when they identify in their particular circumstances what is the best course of action.<\/p><p>  As the Minister for Social Protection has often pointed out, the fact that a person in a household is working allows for a solution to be brought about.  The banks have set targets to offer people sustainable solutions by the end of the year and we want to keep the pressure on.  This will be the subject of discussions at our forthcoming meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800022#U00500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1392742500,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I will allow very quick supplementary questions from Deputies Martin and Boyd Barrett.

Obviously, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has made quite a number of significant changes to the way we are dealing with the live register.

I do not want to set out what the agenda of any Cabinet committee should be, nor am I entitled to say.

It sold its mortgages to Apollo Global Management and voluntarily committed to honouring the codes of conduct set down by the Central Bank.  The Minister for Finance has been very clear about this.  It is a complex issue which warrants careful consideration.  The Minister has written to the Central Bank outlining his concerns.  If the bids do not reach the valuation, they pass to NAMA.  NAMA complies fully with both the contractual obligations and codes of conduct set down by the Central Bank.  As stated, repossession is the last thought in anybody's mind.

The President is a very good friend of Ireland and is keenly interested in our progress, so I took the opportunity to update him on a range of issues in which he remains keenly interested.<\/p><p>  President Clinton, of course, has been a major influence on the Northern Ireland peace process over the years, so I updated him on the current situation in Northern Ireland, including the talks process chaired by Richard Haass, which was still in its early stages at that point.  President Clinton has also provided valuable assistance to Ireland during our economic difficulties.  In February 2012, for example, he hosted the &quot;Invest In Ireland&quot; round-table event in New York, which I attended.  This was a valuable opportunity to engage with investors and to promote Ireland as a location for investment.<\/p><p>  Our meeting on 9 October was a good opportunity to update President Clinton on Ireland's progress towards economic recovery.  He had a particular interest in this.  We also discussed political and economic developments in the US.  The main reason for President Clinton's visit to Dublin was to support Philanthropy Ireland, and we discussed recent progress with Ireland's objective of increasing the level of philanthropic giving.<\/p><p>  President Clinton also updated me on the work of the Clinton Foundation.  I was pleased to learn about the progress the Clinton Foundation is making in tackling issues such as HIV-AIDS, health access, development, climate change and child health and nutrition.  We also discussed Ireland's very successful partnership with the foundation through the Clinton Health Access Initiative.  Ireland has partnered with the Clinton Health Access Initiative in Africa since 2003 and supports HIV-AIDS programmes in Mozambique and Lesotho, as well as programmes to improve maternal and child health and child nutrition.

The talks were hosted on the invitation of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to Dr. Haass and his team.

I hope to raise the matter again when I have the opportunity to travel to Washington in March.  A great deal of activity is going on in the United States.  I commend Ambassador Anderson on the number of meetings she has had both with representatives in the Senate and in the Congress on the matter.  It boils down to what will happen in the US House of Representatives.  President Obama and the US Senate have laid out their position very clearly.  I cannot say what will happen with the House of Representatives but meetings are taking place.  The general hope is that things could happen on immigration in 2014.  We are approaching the last two years of this presidency for President Obama and in that sense there is an understanding that immigration has a major impact in the United States given the number involved.  For our part, we will certainly engage with the immigration reform group and the Irish connections.  There are 50,000 young Irish people in particular who are undocumented.  It is a small segment of a very big pool but we would be hopeful that progress could be made.  We discussed the matter and President Clinton is hopeful.  President Obama and the Senate are also hopeful and now it is a matter for the House of Representatives.  Elections are coming up later in the year and that might well impact on what action is taken.

There is an obligation on the main parties in the Executive to fulfil the commitments they gave a long time ago on those issues.<\/p><p>  The British and Irish Governments need to become more involved than has been the case.  They are standing back a bit too far from the fray.  The dangers that can develop are very real in terms of the communities in the North and the potential of the issues to create more disturbances on the streets, as we witnessed at the outset when the issues came back onto the agenda in terms of the flags dispute, protests on the streets and the threats to people in their homes.  We do not want to go back to that.  I wonder at the toleration of people who come from the United States and elsewhere to mediate in such situations.  In some respects due deference is not shown by bringing the situation to a conclusion and getting a deal done.  A deal could have been done but that did not happen on this occasion for reasons of focusing on one&rsquo;s electoral base.<\/p><p>  Could the Taoiseach indicate the type of discussions that took place in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s level of philanthropic giving?  In that context, was there any discussion about tax relief or the situation pertaining to tax exiles and their treatment?  The head of Philanthropy Ireland, Mr. Frank Flannery, has made public statements in that regard.  Did he bring to the attention of the Taoiseach that the treatment of tax exiles should be changed in the context of the level of giving by the Irish philanthropic sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800025#X00300","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1392744300,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin asked me who was at the meeting.  I cannot recall, except to say that I was there myself with President Clinton and a couple of officials.  I can send on the details to him.<\/p><p>  As far as I can recall, tax exiles and tax on exiles was not discussed.  We had a discussion in respect of the work of Philanthropy Ireland.  I indicated earlier that the President was in the country to attend an event relating to Philanthropy Ireland.  He is very aware of Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to increase the activity in terms of philanthropic giving.  The forum on philanthropy and fund-raising set out a target to increase philanthropic giving by 10% year-on-year in Ireland from its current level of approximately &euro;500 million per annum to &euro;800 million per annum by 2016.  The drivers were the national giving campaign, improving the general fiscal environment and the opportunity to give, developing fund-raising capacity among not-for-profit organisations and creating a national social innovation fund.  Since the launch of the forum&lsquo;s report in July 2012 a good deal of progress was made in the implementation of the recommendations.  The national giving campaign - the 1% difference &ndash; has been launched by Philanthropy Ireland.  The tax treatment of donations to charities has been simplified and decoupled from business tax incentives.<\/p><p>A road map has been set out for implementation of the Charities Act and establishing a charities regulator which the Minister announced some time ago.  The social innovation fund has been incorporated and a board appointed.  All of these things are moving in the right direction.<\/p><p> I take Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's point on dangers developing in Northern Ireland and cross-Border issues if there is no constant engagement and interaction.  As I stated to Deputy Mary Lou MacDonald, these talks followed the invitation of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to Dr. Haass.  I met him on a number of occasions, as did the T&aacute;naiste, and we stated we were very supportive of his efforts.  People may ask why they were not able to conclude them.  It turned out that the most contentious issue was that of flags, as distinct from the past or parades.  They made progress on all three fronts, on some more than others.  It is fair to state that while they did not conclude by being accepted by everybody, there is a basis for moving forward at different levels on each of the three issues.  The five parties involved intend to meet in the coming period, of which we are very supportive.  I hope to travel to London early in March to speak further to Prime Minister Cameron and that from our perspective and theirs the support of both Governments will continue for the efforts of the parties to make further progress.  I hope we will keep engaged and involved.  We are cognisant of the dangers to which the Deputy referred and I share his concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800025#X00400","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392744900,"counter":329,"content":"<p>What is it about Presidents and ex-Presidents of the United States that so mesmerises establishment politicians in Ireland?  Are they drawn to the aura of power or former power, the fact that the people concerned were and the incumbents are in charge of the biggest imperial power on earth?  It is something about which I always wonder.  When the Taoiseach takes advice from President Clinton, I ask him to be careful, particularly with regard to economic advice, considering that for eight years he presided over the policies of extreme liberalisation of the financial markets, the casino economy and the privatisation and liberalisation that took place which, among others policies, laid the basis for the disaster which became the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the Freddie Macs and Fannie Maes which crashed the economy with disastrous consequences for the working class people of the United States and the world.  I ask the Taoiseach to be cautious when he takes an apparently uncritical approach to President Clinton.<\/p><p>  With regard to Northern Ireland and discussing issues of civil and human rights in which President Clinton supposedly took an interest, did the Taoiseach speak to him about similar issues in the United States, particularly about Irish America and how the establishment there treats the gay and lesbian community in banning it from marching on St. Patrick's Day in New York and Boston?  Did the Taoiseach discuss whether he should boycott either of these marches in the event that he has been invited to them?  The Minister for Social Protection who seems to be part of his protection detail today as far as D&aacute;il duties are concerned has apparently taken such a position.

The Bill would enshrine the dual mandate of Members of the Oireachtas - of representation and responsibility to conscience - in the Constitution.  It is clear and simple.  It reads: &quot;The Members of each House of the Oireachtas shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience&quot;.  This is identical to the second sentence of Article 38.1 in the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Constitution of Germany.<\/p><p>  The explanatory note on the Bill clearly and simply sets out its purpose, objectives and how it would work.  The purpose of the Bill is to effect an amendment to Article 15 of the Constitution by inserting a new section 15.16 after section 15.15.  The proposed new section would provide that all Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad &quot;shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience&quot;.  The background is Article 38.1 of the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany which states:<blockquote>Members of the German Bundestag shall be elected in general, direct, free, equal and secret elections.  They shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions and responsible only to their conscience.<\/blockquote>Accordingly, this is an independent mandate.  Therefore, any coercion to influence a Member's vote, be it legally, physically or psychologically binding, including an obligation to vote in line with a political party's policies, would violate that basic law.  Party discipline among the members of parliamentary groups can, therefore, only be based on the Member's free decision.  The principle of Members of the German Bundestag being responsible only to their conscience was enshrined in the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany in the re-establishment of the Bundestag following the Second World War.  This has the effect that fundamental democratic principles cannot be undermined by incremental, non-transparent power grabbing by individuals, parties, organisations or groups.  This fundamental principle of Members being responsible only to their conscience also applies in the subsidiary regional parliaments of the Federal Republic of Germany.  Under the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany, Members of Parliament are responsible only to their conscience and party discipline is based on this freedom.  Generally, parties adopt a joint or party position on issues and members who opt to deviate from the joint position must announce this deviation ahead of any vote.  The rules of procedure grant them the right to explain their vote, orally or in writing, after the conclusion of the vote.  Explanations of votes are commonly made in the Bundestag.  At other times the parties will not adopt joint positions.  This usually happens in the case of matters of conscience or ethical matters.  The principle of individual responsibility only to conscience has worked well in Germany in the aftermath of the Second World War through coalition governments and governments which have had a very slim majority.<\/p><p>  The proposed new provision sets out to replicate in an Irish constitutional context the elements of this basic law and express the fundamental principle that the individual Member's responsibility is only to his or her conscience.  I remind Members that this proposal is an exact lifting of the official translation.  I also remind them that Edmund Burke, one of the greatest thinkers of his or any other time, established the same principle.

It also needs sufficient capacity for the future and accessibility to sustainable energy generation.  It needs to provide this energy in an even manner across the regions.  What we do not need is a system that may endanger the lives and health of citizens or create fear.  We do not need a system that will reduce the cost of agricultural land and personal property.  We do not need a system that will prevent the development of the energy market for decades, owing to intractable conflict.  We do not need a system that will be forced on unwilling communities throughout the State.<\/p><p>  In the mid-north east, where it is proposed to provide the north east-south interconnector, we have had six years of this process.  We know more than most what is involved.  We have had surveys, meetings, fund-raisers, Oireachtas committee meetings and expert reports and in the intervening period there has been a huge increase in the level of technology.  We are now faced with confusion.<\/p><p>I believe the Minister made a statement to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>at the end of January indicating that the North-South interconnector could not be put underground.  This is despite the Government&rsquo;s paying big money to an independent commission which stated that it could be put underground and after the fact that similar kV lines from Rush to Batterstown in County Meath run underground.  We were told initially that the Minister said that it would not be included in the current review.  I have some sympathy for the Minister because the Taoiseach may have pulled the rug from under his feet, after speaking to some of his backbenchers, and disregarded a Cabinet agreement on the North-South interconnector.<\/p><p> An EirGrid planning application is being withheld, or held back, until the independent review decides how to proceed.  I stress that the North-South interconnector&rsquo;s material impact on the citizens of the counties it goes through will be no different from that of any of the other projects going through the country.  Not including it in the review is shockingly unfair to the citizens of that area.  The North-South interconnector, Grid West and Grid Link projects have the same challenges and issues.  They should be afforded the same level of analysis.  I have heard the talk of urgency in that the North-South interconnector project is further advanced - some have stated that it is 97% there.  This is not true.  It is at planning inquiry stage, exactly as it was almost five years ago.  EirGrid withdrew the planning application from this project in the middle of the oral hearing in 2010 because of a lack of thoroughness in its submission.  Where is EirGrid's urgency in that process?  A total of 97% of landowners along the route of the North-South interconnector have stated that they will never allow EirGrid onto their land to proceed with this.  This has major implications for the opportunity for this project to proceed in a timely fashion.  We are nowhere near 97% of the way through this process. <\/p><p> It has also been stated that there have been two previous reports on the North-South interconnector.  These reports, however, did not tackle the proper construction cost and route identification, neither did they include the cost-benefit analysis to cover all the associated costs outside the technical and construction costs.  We should make sure that we proceed in that manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800029#BB02100","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392747300,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I have appointed an independent panel of experts, chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, a former judge of the Supreme Court, to decide terms of reference for comprehensive, route-specific studies of fully underground and overhead options for EirGrid's Grid Link and Grid West projects.<\/p><p>  The panel will ensure that the studies are complete, impartial, objective and comparable.  Both the overhead and underground options will be published side by side, in objective and comparable terms, before consideration is given to appropriate next steps.  On the North-South transmission line, the situation is different.  Planning for this project has been under way for the past ten years.  A planning application has already been submitted for the part of the project in Northern Ireland and that planning process is in train.<\/p><p>  Detailed studies have already been conducted, most recently by the independent international commission of experts appointed in July 2011.  A route-specific underground analysis was conducted by PB Power, which found that the cost of undergrounding would significantly exceed the cost of the more usual overhead cables.  The PB Power analysis was considered and confirmed by the independent commission, which estimated that the cost of undergrounding would be at least three times that of overhead cables.<\/p><p>  The North-South transmission line is a critical and strategically urgent transmission reinforcement and is of vital importance in the broader North-South context. As well as reinforcing the grid in the north-east region of this State, the transmission line will be vital to maintaining the security of electricity supply for Northern Ireland into the future.  I met with my Northern Ireland counterpart, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, to discuss the very real security of supply concerns that would arise for Northern Ireland from any significant delay in progressing this project, and to assure her of our continued commitment to timely delivery.<\/p><p>  I have previously said I recognise the public would be reassured if they knew that the overhead and underground options for North-South were both investigated and that the published studies are sufficient to enable a similar comparison be made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in deciding on the merits of this planning application.<\/p><p>  When I met Mrs. Justice McGuinness I accordingly asked her to consider what work, if any, the panel might usefully undertake to establish whether there has been parity of treatment between the North-South project in terms of the work already undertaken and the issues the panel will examine in respect of Grid Link and Grid West.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness has since convened the first meeting of the panel and she has undertaken to raise with it what, if anything, it can do to help.<\/p><p>  Another very relevant factor is that the North-South line has been designated at EU level as a 'project of common interest', one of 248 key trans-European energy infrastructure projects listed as such.  It seems now to be clear, although I have yet to receive formal confirmation that, because of this status, the planning application will be subject to enhanced principles for public participation, which are set out in EU Regulation 347 of 2013, published in April last year.  It is too early to say to what extent this enhanced form of public participation in the planning process - which I stress will apply to the North-South project alone - might meet the concerns of the public and, perhaps, make separate and additional deliberations by another body both unnecessary and otiose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800030#CC00200","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1392747300,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I remind the Minister that we are also committed to the timely delivery of the North-South interconnector but not in its current format.

The nub of the problem is that the current conflict is leading to delays and each year of delay costs tens of millions of euro.  The Minister also mentioned the two reports.  If they are relevant to the North-South interconnector they are also fully relevant to the other projects overhead around the State, which have exactly the same issues.  One of the key differences in the expert panel the Minister has put together is that it has been given the latitude to develop its own terms of reference and will include the full comparative analysis of underground versus overhead.  This option was not available for the other report whose terms of reference did not allow it to study costs other than potential technical costs, in other words, the hundreds of millions of euro costs caused by the drop in property and land prices in the area.<\/p><p>  The sense of urgency that the Minister mentioned should also be afforded to the other projects.

Many of the fishermen who will go to sea today will not be in a position to catch many fish for the next few days, perhaps even for a week, because of the swell.  Effectively, the nets are hopping along the bottom of the sea.  This will make for a very poor fishing trip but desperation has forced them out in relatively safe and good weather.  I wish them well.  I am a little pessimistic, but that is the reality as relayed to me.  Even when they do make a catch, it will be some weeks before they receive any remuneration for it.  The reality is that it takes a couple of weeks for the cheque to arrive in the post.  It will take at least eight to ten weeks for some fishermen solely because of the bad weather.  <\/p><p>  Allied with this, the Minister is aware of the challenging quota issue in the whitefish sector.  Unfortunately, some fishermen have not had the benefit of a remuneration package or a cheque in the post since October.  That aside, I want to ascertain if it is possible to come up with a compensation scheme for fishermen, many of whom will go on a trip of up to five days.  Some of those heading for the Porcupine Bank to fish for prawns could be taking a 15 day trip to earn a wage to put food on the table for their families.  A compensation scheme was initiated about 20 years ago but it was so badly handled by the previous Administration that Members of this House could claim money.  That was a poor reflection on that Administration and there are those in the fishing industry who criticise that scheme.  They will say it was inefficient, poorly administered and not targeted, but the position has changed.  The regulations in the administration of sea fisheries have been tightened and a scheme could be easily targeted at those worst affected by the recent bad weather.<\/p><p>  I raise this issue also in the context of the much publicised comments made by a French MEP who publicly stated there might be access through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, under Article 33(<i>c<\/i>)(1).  Even though it has not yet been fully signed off on, it may well be a provision through which this country could make an application for funding.  I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that the Department and his officials were considering making such an application.  If not, will he consider providing for some compensation scheme for hard-pressed fishermen and their families along the coast?  We have heard calls from our colleagues in the North of Ireland who are also affected by weather issues.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800031#DD00300","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1392747900,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this genuine issue.  I know that he comes from the heartland of the whitefish fleet in Castletownbere and this is primarily a whitefish fleet issue.  We have tried to do what we can within the rules and regulations.  That is why, for example, in terms of a Government response, we have committed nearly &euro;9 million to repair over 100 harbours and piers around the coastline and also nearly &euro;1.5 million for fishermen who have lost gear, in the form of pots, and will have to bear the cost of replacing it.  We will provide capital grant aid of about 40%.  However, that is no of consolation to those involved in the whitefish sector who are looking to catch in the months of January and February a quota allocated in these months.<\/p><p>  In terms of the EMFF, the truth is that it has not been signed off on yet and we do not know how much money Ireland will be allocated.  It would be naive and foolish of me to look to spend money when we do not even know how much we will have to spend and I do not have access to it.  Some have been calling on me to do this and deal with the issue retrospectively in six or eight months time when we hope people will be fishing and have had a good middle of the year.<\/p><p>  I am anxious to do something practical to help people.  We sat down in the Department today to examine what we could do.  We have looked at the figures for the amount of fish caught in the whitefish sector in January and to date in February.  The figures for the pelagic sector are quite impressive.  There has been a very significant landing of mackerel and horse mackerel.  Some 40,000 tonnes of mackerel and 18,000 tonnes of horse mackerel have been landed, primarily in Killybegs, in the north west, but on the whitefish side the story has been very difficult.  Many boats have not been out since mid-December.  About half of the whitefish quota allocated was caught in January and probably less than this has been caught so far in February.<\/p><p>  We are looking to convene a special meeting of the quota management advisory committee which essentially comprises representatives of the industry and my Department to look at a significantly increased allocation for the remainder of February and next month in order that, as fishermen start to have a weather window, they could catch much more fish than they would otherwise be alllowed to catch and in that way try to compensate them for what happened in the first six weeks of the year which proved very difficult for them.  Fishermen will, rightly, tell me that there is a real problem in that when there is very bad weather, for safety reasons they cannot go out and as a result have no income.  If I had access to a fisheries fund and was allowed to provide some income support, that is something we would examine.<\/p><p>  I spoke to my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, this morning.  The Department of Social Protection has a facility to provide income support within the fishing industry under a number of schemes, in particular the fish assist scheme.<\/p><p>I recognise that is somewhat limited for many people because of the difficulties they have with access and the assessment procedure.  Given that fishermen have gone out today and yesterday, I want them to be able to catch more fish.  I hope the weather window lasts so they can earn a living.  We will allow them to catch more fish than they would otherwise catch for the remainder of February and next month to make up for the fact that they have caught only half of the quota allocated to them in the whitefish sector thus far this year.  I hope that will allow them to catch up in terms of income after a difficult start to the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800031#DD00400","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392748500,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's proposal for allocating extra quota over the next six weeks.

However, most of them are now living on credit and the goodwill of businesses in their areas.  We need to have a debate on the fish assist scheme because it is far from perfect with respect to fishing.  I am increasingly convinced that issues of social protection, combined with evolving policy on days at sea for the demersal or whitefish fleet, will give rise to some form of family income supplement instead of fish assist.  These individuals are self-employed and even though they are not fishing it does not mean they are not working.  They may not be earning but they still have to respond to their skippers' requests to keep their vessels and gear maintained.  They are working every day of the week they are ashore but they have no prospect of being paid in the next couple of weeks.

We need to consider issues of income protection for people who are committed to the fishing industry.  The sector also employs a considerable number of non-Irish nationals who work as deckhands on fishing boats.  Issues arise in this regard which we also need to consider.  I started a conversation with the Minister for Social Protection this morning about income issues in the fishing industry, and we will continue that conversation.  In the meantime, however, I want to give a strong signal that we are going to hold a special quota management meeting this Friday to significantly increase the amount of quota that boats in the whitefish sector will be able to catch for the next six weeks so that they can catch up, from an income and cashflow point of view, as long as the weather permits.

I take this opportunity to draw attention to the increasingly precarious existence of Irish farmers due to prices.  The volatility of milk prices has been well ventilated but we are also seeing great volatility in beef prices, particularly bull beef prices.  I discussed this issue over the weekend with Deputy Ann Phelan, who wanted to partake in the present discussion but unfortunately had to attend another meeting.<\/p><p>  I understand the Minister recently met representatives of the IFA to discuss this issue.  As he will be aware, the price for bull beef has fallen by &euro;150 to &euro;250 per head since feeding started this year.  This is now beginning to have an impact on beef prices more generally.  The number of livestock killed per week currently stands at approximately 31,000, and we are edging towards the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, but two years ago when the targets were being set, farmers did their part by retaining bulls, including Friesian bulls, and meeting the cost of feeding them.  They are now paying the price, however, because they are losing money on every head of livestock they hold.  This calls into question some of the general targets in Food Harvest 2020.  If the result of increasing our beef kill to 31,000 per week is a fall in prices, farmers will be worse off as a result of ramping up production.<\/p><p>  I should point out that I am a farmer.  I finish cattle, although I am not a winter finisher.  The prices obtained in September for cattle finished on grass were higher than the prices beef farmers are now getting for finished steers.  As the Minister will be aware, the cost of finishing cattle in the winter is much higher.  Farmers are taking losses on cattle they are finishing.  I realise there are no easy answers to this problem.  The factories will say there is no market for all of the bull beef produced, but farmers were encouraged to finish these bulls.  If there is no market, it raises the question of why they were encouraged to finish them.  Over time greater efforts will be needed to find markets for these bulls, but in the short term I encourage the Minister to call a meeting of producers, the IFA and the factories to see what can be done to ensure the ongoing viability of the beef sector.  Farmers took losses across the board last year.  We had an excellent summer but last winter was difficult.  Farmers cannot take another winter of losses without the beef sector being damaged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800032#EE00400","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1392748500,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McNamara for raising this important issue.  I spent considerable time discussing the issue with the IFA this afternoon.  The value of Irish beef exports was estimated at almost &euro;2.1 billion in 2013.  This export performance, which was based on a wide portfolio of customers, has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia's marketing strategy and its focus on the key attributes of Irish beef, namely, environmental sustainability, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages of production and superior eating quality.  I am committed to developing a policy framework that fosters innovation and promotes efficiency and improved performance at all levels of the beef supply chain.<\/p><p>  Aggregate cattle supplies at Department-approved meat plants to early February 2014 are up 7% on the corresponding period in 2013, with strong increases recorded in the steer, heifer and cull cow categories.  This higher throughput has led to factories giving preference to certain types of stock that are better suited to the requirements of their retail customers. <\/p><p>Prices for prime steers and heifers have remained relatively stable but the young bull trade is challenging at present as age and weight issues continue to affect demand.  However, I note that the young bull kill increased by 60% between week one and week six of 2014.  The Irish beef sector is hugely dependent on exports and needs to ensure that it is producing efficiently for overseas markets.<\/p><p> One of the main difficulties in marketing young bulls older than 16 months is that these animals are outside the specifications preferred by the UK market.  This is a major disadvantage at present because the UK market has effectively become the highest-priced beef market in the EU and it is where we sell most of our beef.<\/p><p> Delays in young bull slaughtering undoubtedly put pressure on producer profit margins but neither I nor any agriculture Minister can interfere in a trade that is cyclical in nature and prone to short-term price fluctuations.  Of course, I am entirely sympathetic to those farmers facing difficulties in getting their cattle slaughtered at a price that will allow them any margin at all.  In our discussions today, I gave a commitment to ask the CEOs of the meat companies concerned to come into the Department to have a blunt conversation to find a way forward that farmers can accept as fair and that factories can maintain an acceptable margin on, and I hope to do that within the next day or two.<\/p><p> It is the responsibility of the industry - in the first instance, processors and farmers working together - to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain operates for the benefit of both parties and does not undermine the viability of bull beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers.  I understand that producer and meat processor representatives have recently engaged in dialogue with some initial progress being made, but I can vouch for the fact that there is much more progress required in this area.<\/p><p> I fully recognise that we need to maintain confidence in the beef sector and earlier this month I announced the operational details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40 million to beef farmers in 2014.  This package will include &euro;23 million for the beef genomics scheme, &euro;10 million for the beef data programme, &euro;5 million for the beef technology adoption programme and &euro;2 million in residual payments under the suckler cow welfare scheme.  That being said, we have a genuine problem in the bull beef sector which is now translating into a problem in steer beef and heifer beef also.  Producers, that is, farmers, are growing ever more frustrated by this.  I will do what I can to assist in the process but, ultimately, both parties concerned will have to find an acceptable solution moving forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800032#EE00500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392749100,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I greatly welcome the fact that the Minister acknowledges there is a problem and that he will do what he can.  He mentioned that there was an increase in bull beef killed in the first weeks of this year but no doubt part of the reason for that was that, normally, beef prices increase in the run in to Christmas, this year they did not and many farmers were holding on in the hope that the prices would inevitably increase although they still have not done so.  The factories are aware there is a glut out there and they intend to take advantage of it.  That is one side of the coin.<\/p><p>  The State has consistently stepped up to protect the sector because it is hugely important, and a facet of that sector is the factories.  When the factories were in trouble last year with the horses, we stepped up.  The D&aacute;il was reconvened during the summer to protect one group which now enjoys a dangerously dominant position in beef, both here and in the United Kingdom, which is a considerable market.<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned that retailers are not interested in this type of beef, and that is true.  The unhealthy power that retailers, particularly the large multiples, enjoy is something that we have worked on in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I note Deputies Doyle and Deering here today and we all put a great deal of work into that.  Not surprisingly, there has been a certain backlash from lobbyists and other groups.  Those retailers have an unhealthy power to determine and, ultimately, they can decide that they will increase or drop prices whereas farmers have to plan two or three years ahead.  As I stated, farmers made plans a year or two years ago to increase bull beef production because they were told that was the thing to do and now they are losing money because of it.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding all of that, I greatly welcome the fact that the Minister is calling in the CEOs of the processors to a meeting.  I would ask whether he would consider bringing in a farmers' representative to that meeting as well, if that is feasible.<\/p><p>  In the longer term, I would ask is there a way to find markets.  I welcome the fact that there is a live trade being opened up through Stena but we need to increase the live trade to third countries outside of the EU.  Every calf we export live, if it is exported to European markets, we face as competition to one that we rear in Ireland whereas if we can get them out to third country markets it is a different matter entirely.  However, I welcome what the Minister has done.<\/p><p>  My last suggestion, which may seem a little silly and many might find funny, applies to all Ministers.  There are many of them going abroad.  Maybe one item on each of their agendas should be whether there is a market in the state they are visiting for bull beef because, as the Minister stated, it is a particular market.  British retailers, in particular, which are important customers for Irish beef, are not interested in it but that does not mean that there cannot be markets somewhere in the world, maybe even in Sochi, for bull beef.  Who knows?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800033#FF00200","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1392749100,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Nobody talks up the beef sector more than I do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800033#FF00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1392749100,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800033#FF00400","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1392749100,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Every time I go abroad I talk about beef access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800033#FF00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1392749100,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I refer to all the other Ministers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800033#FF00600","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1392749100,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Last year we got Japan, Lebanon and the Gulf states open.  We got live exports to North Africa, which is a difficult market to manage.  Even today, I spent half my meeting with the Chinese ambassador talking about beef access into China.  In addition, we are pushing to get access into both the United States and Canada this year.  We are expanding the spread of beef markets that we can access and we have a mature and street-wise group of companies that can take advantage when those markets open.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy McNamara.  We need to have an alternative outlet for farmers, the primary producers, if they feel they are not getting a fair price from the factories here in Ireland, and that is where live cattle exports come in.  However, my preference would be that we would minimise live cattle exports.  It needs to be there as an option, but what we want is to be getting a good price here in Ireland and employing people in processing and adding value to meat here before it is exported.  That is where the maximum dividend is.  As many farmers would say, however, it is important to have a live cattle export trade to keep factories honest.<\/p><p>  There is a specific issue around beef prices in the United Kingdom versus Ireland.  That is because the UK has become a separate market to the rest of the European Union in terms of prices.  Last year we were at 106% of EU beef prices, which is unusual.  Up until a couple of years ago, we would have been probably below 95%.  Irish beef is selling at a premium across the European Union, above the price of most other European beef.  That is not the case in the UK because consumers there are choosing UK beef and are willing to pay more for it.  We have a particular issue with that in terms of labelling, etc.  This problem is not simply solved by a live cattle export trade to the UK because factories in the UK do not want to kill Irish animals.  They want to kill British animals and label them as British beef.  They want to import Irish beef and label that as Irish beef.  With Irish-reared and British-slaughtered beef there is a confusing message on the label which is not what retailers want.  There is an issue here that we are trying to address as best we can.  There is also an issue with new restrictions that are being introduced in terms of slaughtering in Northern Ireland of animals that have been reared south of the Border, which is another issue.<\/p><p>  On the specifics of the bull beef issue which I accept is a big issue for farmers, 20% of our specialist beef is bull beef and we need to find an outlet for that.  I will do what I can to work with the factories to facilitate a more acceptable solution than is currently available for farmers but I cannot perform miracles.  There is ultimately a marketplace that decides here what it wants and what it is willing to pay for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800033#FF00700","speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Services","time":1392749700,"counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800034#GG00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1392749700,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter, as well as thanking the Minister for Health for coming in to reply.  According to <i>The Connaught Telegraph<\/i>, a report commissioned by the HSE conducted by the Dublin-based firm, Health Partnership, is examining maternity services in the west-northwest hospitals group.  The initial first draft of the report is recommending closure of the units at Castlebar, Sligo and Roscommon, and the centralisation of maternity services into University Hospital Galway and Letterkenny General Hospital.  As the Minister can imagine, that has caused considerable distress so the matter needs to be clarified urgently.<\/p><p>  The HSE has confirmed that the review is under way but has still not made any report.  The HSE subsequently said that there was a preliminary report.  The HSE has issued a number of different press statements, so maybe that can be clarified.  There was a preliminary report but this recommendation was not included in it.  <\/p><p>  I am asking the Minister to clarify a number of issues.  In 2012, the last year for which I have full figures, Mayo General Hospital had 1,788 births.  It is a busy maternity unit.  The Minister knows the geography of Mayo well and his roots are there.  A round trip to Galway from Belmullet or Erris is over 300 miles.  Some weeks ago, somebody travelling from Achill experienced a difficulty and had to go to their local GP who, luckily enough, had the skills to deliver a child in Mulranny.  The geographic difficulties are significant in the area and there is a need for access to maternity services.  Mayo General Hospital provides a quality service in its busy maternity unit.  The staff in the unit are renowned for their excellent work.  They are deeply caring and there is a huge level of community trust in their abilities, as there is in the other hospitals. <\/p><p>  How many reports are there and will the Minister publish the preliminary report?  What are the terms of reference for the overall examination and will the Minister publish them?  What level of public consultation will there be with GPs and local representatives?  What is the date for this report to be delivered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800034#GG00200","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1392749700,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for debate and also thank the Minister for his attendance.  The worst thing one can have is speculation started by leaks, which is suddenly taken as being the truth.  I firmly believe that is the case here.  The suggestion that Mayo General Hospital, Portiuncula and Sligo will have their maternity units closed is totally off the wall.  I have spoken to many people who have attended those maternity units and they have nothing but praise for the care and attention they received from staff.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Calleary has said, there were over 1,700 births in Mayo General Hospital in 2012 - a figure that has grown from 1,200 at the turn of the millennium.  The size of County Mayo is relevant also.  In recent times we have centralised many services at Mayo General Hospital, including the renal dialysis unit, which means that patients can be treated in Castlebar rather than having to travel to Galway.<\/p><p>  I presume that there is absolutely no truth in the latest report but it needs to be nailed now.  We have heard a lot of good stories about Mayo General Hospital, including treatment for renal dialysis and cystic fibrosis.  In addition, there are plans for palliative care between the Mayo-Roscommon hospice in conjunction with the HSE.  Only yesterday, the hospital was named as one of the top performers in meeting targets for treating people in accident and emergency within nine hours.  This is despite the fact that the hospital has taken extra patients as a result of the accident and emergency unit closing down in Roscommon.  By any measure, Mayo General Hospital has performed well.  It is important, however, that this matter is not made into a political football.  We do need these matters to be clarified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800034#GG00300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1392749700,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to provide reassurance regarding the future delivery of high quality and safe maternity services in the west of Ireland.  I thank both Deputies for having raised this issue.<\/p><p>  Recent reports appear to suggest that some hospitals within the west-northwest group, including Mayo General Hospital, are to lose their maternity services.  These reports are purely speculative and, as such, unhelpful.  I fully recognise that such unsubstantiated reports are a cause for concern for patients and staff, and I regret any upset which may have been caused.<\/p><p>  Maternity services in the west-northwest hospitals group are under review but, let me be clear, no decisions on reconfiguration will be taken in that context.  The position is that the review arises from the implementation of the recommendations of the HIQA report into the death of Savita Halappanavar.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Higgins report on the establishment of hospital groups, requires that each hospital group prepare a strategic plan for service configuration, consistent with national objectives for the delivery of patient services.  These reports provide the backdrop for the review currently under way in each hospital in the west-northwest hospitals group, including the maternity units at Mayo General Hospital, University Hospital Galway, Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe, Sligo Regional Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital.  The review is in the early stages and will take some months to complete.<\/p><p>  Maternity services in all parts of the country will be subject to review and evaluation this year as part of the development by my Department of a new national maternity strategy.

No decisions on service reconfiguration will be implemented without the agreement of my Department and certainly not in advance of the publication of the proposed national maternity strategy.<\/p><p>  Developing the strategy will provide us with the opportunity to take stock of current services and identify how we can improve the quality and safety of care provided to women and their babies.

Is &eacute; Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga a dh&eacute;anann monat&oacute;ireacht ar fheidhmi&uacute; na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  T&aacute; tuairim is 200 comhlacht poibl&iacute; cl&uacute;daithe faoin 113 sc&eacute;im reatha at&aacute; i bhfeidhm faoi l&aacute;thair.  T&aacute; pl&eacute; gn&iacute;omhach ar si&uacute;l ag mo Roinn, ar a bhfuil an fhreagracht sc&eacute;imeanna a dhaingni&uacute;, le breis agus 120 comhlacht poibl&iacute; faoi l&aacute;thair chun sc&eacute;imeanna teanga nua a aont&uacute; n&oacute; sc&eacute;imeanna at&aacute; i bhfeidhm cheana a athnuachan.<\/p><p>  Aithn&iacute;m nach bhfuil c&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna gan laig&iacute; agus go mbaineann d&uacute;shl&aacute;in ar leith le sc&eacute;imeanna a chur i bhfeidhm.

T&aacute; s&eacute; tr&aacute;th&uacute;il mar sin l&eacute;argas a thabhairt ar na bearta at&aacute; t&oacute;gtha ag an Rialtas chun cur leis an l&iacute;on daoine sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s a mbeidh s&eacute; ar a gcumas feidhmi&uacute; go h&eacute;ifeachtach ar bhonn dh&aacute;theangach.<\/p><p>  Is aidhm l&aacute;rnach pholasa&iacute; de chuid an Rialtais &eacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge.

Ceaptar gurb &eacute; an bealach is fearr chun an aidhm pholasa&iacute; seo a bhaint amach n&aacute; tr&iacute; chur chuige n&iacute;os spriocdh&iacute;rithe a &uacute;s&aacute;id chun a chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh foireann leis na scileanna riachtanacha Gaeilge ar f&aacute;il chun seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a shol&aacute;thar tr&iacute; Ghaeilge nuair a theasta&iacute;onn sin.  Ceapadh sc&eacute;im de mharcanna b&oacute;nais don Ghaeilge beagnach 40 bliain &oacute; shin.  Glactar leis go coitianta nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n d&eacute;anta ag an ionstraim pholasa&iacute; seo chun feabhas a chur ar shol&aacute;thar seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.  Mar gheall air sin agus mar thoradh ar chinnt&iacute; a th&oacute;g an Rialtas i m&iacute; Dheireadh F&oacute;mhair 2013, t&aacute; na bearta seo a leanas chun teacht in &aacute;it an pholasa&iacute; de mharcanna b&oacute;nais a tugadh as inni&uacute;lacht sa Ghaeilge.<\/p><p>  T&aacute; an Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe ag iarraidh ar Ranna agus ar oifig&iacute; sainaithint a dh&eacute;anamh ar phoist agus ar r&eacute;ims&iacute; oibre ina dteasta&iacute;onn oifigigh le Gaeilge mar chuid den phr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la don fh&oacute;rsa oibre.  T&aacute;thar ag iarraidh ar Ranna aird ar leith a thabhairt ar phoist at&aacute; lonnaithe i gceantair Ghaeltachta n&oacute; a dh&eacute;anann freastal ar na ceantair sin.  Beidh an pr&oacute;iseas seo l&aacute;rnach i gcinnti&uacute; go nd&eacute;anfar for&aacute;il d&oacute;thanach i gcom&oacute;rtais earca&iacute;ochta amach anseo do cheapach&aacute;in i bpoist ina dteasta&iacute;onn oifigigh le Gaeilge.  Ina theannta sin, sonr&oacute;far na poist sin ina dteasta&iacute;onn oifigigh le Gaeilge i sc&eacute;imeanna teanga amach anseo faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003.  Mar ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im sa chom&oacute;rtas earca&iacute;ochta d'oifigigh feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in at&aacute; ar na bac&aacute;in i l&aacute;thair na huaire, t&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist fo-phain&eacute;al de dhaoine le Gaeilge a bhun&uacute; nach rachaidh thar 6% den phain&eacute;al ioml&aacute;n.  D&eacute;anfar meas&uacute;n&uacute; ar thoradh an chom&oacute;rtais sin chun an t-&eacute;ileamh at&aacute; ar oifigigh le Gaeilge ar fud na St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;se a mheas.  M&aacute; t&aacute; an toradh sin dearfach, t&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist an socr&uacute; seo a chur i bhfeidhm de r&eacute;ir mar is cu&iacute; d'earca&iacute;ocht amach anseo agus d'arduithe c&eacute;ime i ngr&aacute;id neamhspeisialt&oacute;ra sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.<\/p><p>  Chun feabhas a chur ar inni&uacute;lacht Ghaeilge na St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;seach at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair agus chun feabhas a chur ar shol&aacute;thar seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; i nGaeilge, t&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist c&oacute;ras nua do th&aacute;st&aacute;il inni&uacute;lachta a chur i bhfeidhm faoina bhf&eacute;adfar St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair a shannadh do phoist shonracha ina dteasta&iacute;onn oifigigh le Gaeilge, mar a shainaithn&iacute;tear sin i sc&eacute;imeanna teanga at&aacute; aontaithe faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003.  D&eacute;anfaidh Ranna &eacute;asca&iacute;ocht do St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh chun freastal ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; oili&uacute;na i nGaeilge agus chun scr&uacute;duithe a dh&eacute;anamh faoin gcreat n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta&iacute; n&oacute; faoi theastas Eorpach na Gaeilge.  Beidh an Roinn Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta freagrach as na c&oacute;rais nua oili&uacute;na agus inni&uacute;lachta a chur i bhfeidhm faoi th&eacute;arma&iacute; an chomhaontaithe seirbh&iacute;se a aonta&iacute;odh leis an Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe anuraidh.

T&aacute; 3,000 bliain de stair, cult&uacute;r, eolas, eala&iacute;n, smaoineamh, feals&uacute;nacht agus f&eacute;ini&uacute;lacht sa t&iacute;r seo ag teacht chun deiridh fad is at&aacute; an Aire St&aacute;it ag faire amach.

Nuair a th&aacute;inig an t-eolas seo chun cinn &oacute; thaighde a rinneadh thar tr&eacute;imhse ch&uacute;ig bliana, socra&iacute;odh gur cheart an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain a chur le ch&eacute;ile.  De r&eacute;ir an taighde, b'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil 15 bliain f&aacute;gtha ag an nGaeilge mar theanga phobail.  T&aacute; an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain foilsithe, ach n&iacute;l s&iacute; &aacute; cur i bhfeidhm ag an Rialtas.

I studied Irish in primary and secondary school and I even went to the Gaeltacht on about three occasions and, much to my regret, I still could not converse in Irish.  I did make a contribution to the Irish language by virtue of the fact that I sent my children to an all-Irish school so they do not have the same disadvantage as me from that point of view.<\/p><p>  I thank the outgoing Irish language commissioner for his dedication, work and obvious concern.  The concern is the regret we will all have at the manner of his departure and the fact that he is pessimistic about the future of the Irish language.  I also wish R&oacute;n&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill all the best.  He will need to see some elevated concern from the Government because there is clearly a problem.  The number of people on the street on Saturday show there is a serious issue that must be addressed.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Ellis mentioned, it is not exclusively in the Gaeltacht areas that issues arise with the Irish language.  North Kildare is not an area in which one would expect to find such a problem.  We have four primary schools where teaching is done through the medium of Irish, three of them in the north-east part of the county.  The schools in Kilcock, Leixlip and Maynooth are very popular and have refused a place to 200 pupils at primary level because they are over-subscribed.  Scoil U&iacute; Riada in Kilcock has allocated 56 places and 94 children have been refused places.  Scoil Chearbhaill U&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh in Leixlip was established in 1979, which indicates that it is no fleeting idea.  The school has allocated 64 places for September and refused 32 children.  In Gaelscoil U&iacute; Fhiaich in Maynooth 62 places have been allocated and 71 children were refused a place.  There is no place for those children in secondary school.  An entire class of secondary school students is being pushed towards An Aonad in Maynooth, which according to parents is a downgrading in terms of education through Irish because they want their children to be wholly educated through Irish.  They understand the difference involved in being immersed in a language and being offered a few subjects in Irish.<\/p><p>  There is no shortage of people to assist in the revival of the language but there is a real problem with the necessary provision to allow that to occur.  That is a very practical issue.  If that position had been articulated 100 years ago when people were talking about the revival of the language and culture they would have been horrified to think that on the cusp of the centenary of a number of major events in our history we refuse to educate children that are queuing up to be educated through Irish.  We must examine dimensions of the issue that are not exclusively related to the problems that occur in the Gaeltacht.  This is another missed opportunity.<\/p><p>  The children that started in the first all-Irish school in north Kildare are now parents and are sending their own children to the same school.  We are into the second generation and a community has been established in the area but there is no Gaelscoil for the children to attend.  The Gaelchol&aacute;iste that was built in Lucan is fully subscribed to by the two Gaelscoileanna in Lucan.  A real opportunity is being missed.  The information must be factored into the initiatives and a co-ordinated approach must be taken by the Government, including the Department of Education and Skills, in the provision of the opportunities that are so demonstrably absent in the areas to which I draw attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800039#MM00100","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1392752400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Kyne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800039#MM00200","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1392752400,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I wish R&oacute;n&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill every success in his new job.<\/p><p>  We must ask ourselves why, in a small island like Ireland, ten of thousands of people like me have limited Irish despite going to school for 14 years.  I do not know what the problem is.  Maybe the Irish language has been taken over by a self-appointed elite group.  When I was appointed to the arts, sports and Gaeilge portfolio three and a half years ago, some members of this group wrote an article in a local newspaper saying they were unhappy.  They do not represent the Irish speakers or the people from the Gaeltacht.  Indeed, the reception I got in the Gaeltacht and from Conradh na Gaeilge and Comhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge, was absolutely terrific.  We need to do something to ensure Irish is not the preserve of the self-appointed academics.  People like me should be able to speak c&uacute;pla focal without having to worry if it is good enough or bad enough.  There has to be a certain level.  I wish R&oacute;n&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill every success in his new job.<\/p><p>It is vital that there be some discipline within the Irish language.  Once again I thank the people from Clare Island and the Gaeltacht and from all the various organisations who were very kind to me and understood that there are tens of thousands like me who spent 14 years at school.  Maybe we did not apply ourselves as much.  Something needs to be done there.  I thank the Minister for all the work he has done in the last few years.  This is an inspired appointment and I wish Mr. &Oacute; Domhnaill well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800041#OO00900","speaker":"1085","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392754200,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a thabhairt do na Teachta&iacute; go l&eacute;ir a labhair ar an r&uacute;n seo sa D&aacute;il inniu.

It started on Sunday, 9 February, when <i>The Sunday Times<\/i> reported that a security sweep of GSOC's offices, which was conducted on the evenings of 23 to 27 September last year, found that GSOC had been targeted as part of a sophisticated surveillance operation which used &quot;government level technology&quot; to hack into e-mails and WiFi and phone systems.  On the following day, 10 February, what I can only describe as the knee-jerk reaction or instinct of the Minister was not to run to the aid of GSOC, but to summon the commission to his office for an explanation as to why it had failed to inform him- as per the law in his view - why it had taken such action.  The tone and manner of this response caused grave concern and has compounded the situation rather than help resolve it.  All this time the public has been watching from the sidelines.  Despite everything the Government promised in the lead-up to and since the general election regarding transparency and accountability, these were not forthcoming in the response to this issue on Monday, 10 February.<\/p><p>  On Tuesday, 11 February, the Taoiseach, responding to growing public concerns, as articulated during Leaders' Questions in this Chamber from Opposition leaders, misrepresented the legislation.  Again, he failed to grasp the gravity of the emerging crisis and went on to defend the Minister rather than acknowledge what had been reported over the previous two days.  On 11 February, the Minister made a statement to the D&aacute;il in which he provided an account based on the briefing he had received from GSOC.  However, it has now emerged - a fact not disputed by anybody other than the Minister - that he was less than forthcoming with the information he had at his disposal.  <\/p><p>  On 12 February, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions invited GSOC to come before it to examine the matter.  During the course of that meeting, the chairman of GSOC, Simon O'Brien, flatly contradicted what the Minister had said and put on the record in this Chamber the previous day.  The written briefing the Minister received from GSOC has since come into the public domain and we now know what the Minister was told.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800043#QQ00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1392754800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I published it and gave it to committee members.

I did not say the Minister did not publish it; I said it had come into the public domain.  I will continue without interruption.  What the document shows is that what the Minister said in this Chamber was not the full facts.  It is no understatement to suggest that at this point the situation has become a farce and public confidence is on a downward spiral.  This must be stopped.<\/p><p>  This is the reason Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward this motion calling for an independent inquiry and for all options to be considered, including a commission of investigation as provided for under the existing Commissions of Investigations Act 2004.  Unfortunately, today's announcement by the Taoiseach, following a briefing to Cabinet today, falls far short of an independent inquiry.  It is evident that the Government made this decision reluctantly.  As Deputy Mary Lou McDonald said earlier today, it has been brought kicking and screaming to this decision to have what now appears to be nothing more than a review of documentation.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach confirmed a number of matters during Leaders' Questions.  First, he confirmed that a High Court judge would be appointed shortly to undertake a review within eight weeks.  The terms of reference will be drawn up by the Minister for Justice and Equality in conjunction with and on the advice of the Attorney General, and the judge will report his findings to the Minister.  Second, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will reflect, through a series of public hearings, on the efficiency and robustness of the law in regard to GSOC.  Third, the Minister for Justice and Equality will appear before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions to answer questions on the issue.  The Taoiseach also confirmed that a full, unredacted report would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that a debate on it would take place in the Chamber.  What was announced today is not acceptable.  Given the gravity of the situation that has unfolded over the past ten days, a number of questions remain unanswered.  I hope some of them will be answered tonight and tomorrow, particularly in the Minister's contribution.<\/p><p>  It is evident that the Government came only reluctantly to the point at which it decided to appoint a High Court judge to review documentation.  It is also evident the Minister was less than forthcoming with the information he provided to the D&aacute;il in regard to the briefing he received.<\/p><p>We need clarity.  Why is the Minister setting the terms of reference for the review?  That is like the fox designing the chicken coop.  It makes no sense whatsoever, given the Minister&rsquo;s performance in this regard in the past ten days.  This is not personal.  On many occasions, at committee meetings and in this Chamber, I have congratulated and commended the Minister on some of his initiatives.  In this area, on this issue, as Opposition Members, we have a responsibility to hold to account this Government and make no apologies for doing so in a robust manner.  This is not personal.<\/p><p> In essence, we are dealing with an allegation that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in some way had the Garda Ombudsman&rsquo;s office under covert surveillance.  This is a serious situation.  Why does this Government not see fit to enact the powers it has under the 2004 legislation to investigate an issue of such importance to the State?  If this is not an issue of such national importance that it warrants a commission of investigation under that legislation, what is?  The decision to hold a review does not restore public confidence.<\/p><p> The question being asked and discussed around the country is who gains by not having a full, independent investigation into this matter.  Who gained by the fact that all the information at the disposal of the Minister and his Department was not put on the table last week?  Who will gain by having a High Court Judge review the documents and report back to the Minister, under terms of reference set by the Minister?  We do not know whether the judge will have a panel of experts at his or her disposal.  The Taoiseach stated today on Leaders' Questions that the judge will not have the power to compel witnesses or to take statements.  The High Court Judge is being appointed to review documents and to come to a conclusion and report to the Minister.  Who will gain by that?<\/p><p> Why did the Minister not see fit to initiate a commission of inquiry under the 2004 legislation?  Why has the Government decided to go for a review rather than a commission of inquiry?  This is a very serious matter.  Public confidence has been damaged.  Questions remain.  Answers must be given.  Every Member of this Chamber, not just Opposition Members, has a responsibility to ensure that those who are tasked under law with the job of holding to account the policing authorities in this State can do so free from hindrance and from any targeting of their offices.  It is essential that public confidence in this process is restored.  We need a thorough, in-depth investigation into this, with the scope to examine all of the relevant papers and documentation as well as the power to compel witnesses to testify.  This is needed so that a balanced judgment can be made with findings based on the full facts.  We do not have that.  That is why we will press our motion to a vote tomorrow night.<\/p><p> We do not accept what the Government announced today.  I, and many outside this Chamber, see this as the Government trying to wish away the issue, just as the Minister has been doing for the past ten days.  His attitude has been cavalier, as much as to say there is nothing to say, let us move on and get on with business.  This is the business tonight in this Chamber and will be the business of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions tomorrow.  This is the business about which every member of our society is talking.  We need a full, independent investigation, not a review of the documents.  Nothing less than a full, independent investigation will suffice. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800043#QQ00700","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392755400,"counter":490,"content":"<p>The subject of this debate is hugely important to the safety of our citizens and to the quality of our democracy.  We are addressing the integrity of the police service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the mechanisms established by this Oireachtas to ensure proper accountability of that service.<\/p><p>  I stress the word &quot;service&quot;.  Too often we hear the word 'force' in respect of police here and in other jurisdictions.  The Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinane, addressing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, issue, referred to &quot;my force&quot;.  That displays a certain mind-set which has to be addressed if we are to see real reform and real accountability in policing.  We need political will on the part of Government to ensure real accountability.  Its conduct in this controversy, and especially, I regret, the stance of the Minister, shows a distinct lack of will in this regard.  The instinct of the Government and the Minister has been to try to close down this issue as quickly as possible.  It has been a closing of ranks.<\/p><p>  It is in the interests of the public, and equally of the garda&iacute; and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, that we get to the bottom of this issue.  We need to know if GSOC was indeed subject to a surveillance attack, why it was targeted in this way and by whom.  We need to know the background, including the relations between GSOC and Garda management and we need to scrutinise the response of Government and of Garda management.  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion provides the mechanism for all of this.<\/p><p>  I believe the majority of garda&iacute; provide a good public service, often at great risk to themselves.  I have no hesitation in paying tribute to them for that.  They are tasked with serving the people and, within the limits of resources, they generally do that very well.  How well served are the public and the rank and file garda&iacute; by the structure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself and by the restrictions, set by Government, on resources?  Most would answer &quot;poorly&quot;.  At the root of the current controversy is the failure of successive Governments to reform and modernise the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to provide for robust accountability for the police service.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 went some way towards reform but fell far short of what was required.<\/p><p>  The establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was a step forward, undoubtedly, which we welcomed at the time.  We also, however, pointed out its shortcomings.  Its powers are insufficient; the limits on it are too restrictive.  The then Fine Gael Justice spokesperson, the Minister's party colleague, Jim O'Keeffe, urged in the D&aacute;il in February 2005 that the Government should look to the North where the Police Ombudsman had been established and where the Police Service of Northern Ireland had replaced the Royal Ulster Constabulary. <\/p><p>The first Police Ombudsman there was Nuala O'Loan, now retired.  Commenting on the GSOC controversy in the past week, she pointed to the insufficient powers of GSOC compared to the Police Ombudsman in the North.<\/p><p> With respect to others in the Oireachtas, no one can speak with more experience and more authority than Sinn F&eacute;in on the long and painstaking task of transforming policing in the Six Counties.  It has been one of the most fundamental aspects of the entire peace process.  While the task is far from over, it can also be said that it has been one of the successes of the peace process.  In the North, we have replaced the RUC, a highly militarised, politicised and sectarian police force, with a record of sustaining a one-party state and later taking the front line in the British Government's counter-insurgency war.  In its place the Police Service of Northern Ireland was established and, while very far from perfect and with much work still to be done, it has begun the complete transformation of policing.  This could only have happened in the context of a peace process and a political process based on parity of esteem and inclusivity.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have played a key role in that achievement.<\/p><p> It is one of the ironies of history and of the peace process that we now have a situation where policing reform is more advanced in the North than it is in this State.  It is useful, therefore, to compare the current situation North and South.  At our request the Oireachtas Library and Information Service carried out a comparative analysis of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and I would like to summarise that analysis.  When compared, both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI are similar in organisational structure, rank-command and geographical layout.  Based on census 2011 figures for both jurisdictions, there is one full-time Garda member for approximately every 349 people in the Twenty-six Counties, and one full-time member of the PSNI for approximately every 244 people in the North.  The main difference is the additional layer in the Six Counties provided by the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which provides a layer of democratic and broad-based community accountability.  A similar structure does not exist here in the Twenty-six Counties.  A democratic policing board for the Twenty-six Counties is something we in Sinn F&eacute;in have repeatedly called for.<\/p><p> Regarding complaints procedures, both jurisdictions have police ombudsmen.  While similar in structure, the Office of the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland, OPONI, has a larger staff and budget than the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  More significantly, perhaps, the GSOC refers some complaints to the Garda for investigation.  The OPONI, however, has its own staff to carry out all its investigations.  Both bodies prevent police officers from making complaints about or against fellow officers.<\/p><p> While the matter which has brought about this motion and this debate is of serious concern and needs to be addressed in its own right, I believe it has also opened up a healthy debate about the need for an improved police service here with robust accountability.  We can and should learn lessons from the experience of peace building and police reform in the neighbouring part of our island in the Six Counties and apply them in this jurisdiction, working towards better policing on the whole island in the interest of all who view it as home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800044#RR00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392756000,"counter":492,"content":"<p>It has been a long while since we discovered that all was not well between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Commissioner.  As late as last summer, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission were before an Oireachtas committee saying plainly to the Deputies and Senators present that its capacity to investigate complaints against alleged Garda misconduct had been damaged by lack of co-operation from the Garda force.  They pointed to the length of time it was taking for the Garda to respond and provide information which was requested in the course of its investigations.  They spoke about the protocols in place for the previous six years, which clearly they felt were not working because the ombudsman commission was negotiating with the Garda to revise them.<\/p><p>  The obstacles put in its way were never more clear than when the ombudsman commission's office was denied direct access to the PULSE system and was forced to go though garda&iacute; to find information relevant to the inquiries it was investigating.  A garda just out of Templemore, therefore, could have total access to the PULSE system but a member of the ombudsman commission could not be trusted to have that access.  The Garda Commissioner actually suggested, just as this bugging story broke, that the fact that the security of the ombudsman's office might have been breached was justification to deny its members access to the Garda computer system.  Since the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the attitude of the force has been strong resentment at the very suggestion that it needs oversight accountability.  This attitude was reflected in the recent words of the Garda Commissioner about whistleblowers within the force.<\/p><p>  The real question here is whether the Government stands with garda&iacute; against the ombudsman commission or does the Government stand by the proper transparency and oversight that democracy demands of the Garda by the ombudsman commission?  Is the Government trying to get to the bottom of the matter in hand and to the core issue of growing public concern, that is, was the independent ombudsman commission bugged and, if so, by whom?  How did they do it and, more importantly, why did they do it?  <\/p><p>  The way the Minister and the Taoiseach dismissed the discovery of bugging of the ombudsman commission's office tells us that before they even had the full information, they sided with the Garda and dismissed the threat without even examining the evidence properly - a knee-jerk reaction.  It was a knee-jerk instinct typical of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and is an approach the public and this D&aacute;il do not like.  This is an issue of public trust and confidence but the Minister has served time and again to shatter that.  It must be remembered that at the beginning, it was news to us all that the offices had been bugged.  When the news broke in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>, would it not have been a normal<b><\/b>response from Government to have had other State offices checked for bugs as well, instead of distracting from the core issue and waffling on about who should have informed the Minister about it and when?<\/p><p>  The latest available figures show us that in 2012, the ombudsman commission received 2,017 complaints from the public about Garda misconduct, while the complaints received through the Garda Commissioner amounted to only 72.  The GSOC representative at the Oireachtas committee said that they would closely examine a downward trend in the number of these referrals from the Garda Commissioner.  They had decreased from 103, which is still a drop in the ocean of the total, in 2010 to just 72 in 2012.<\/p><p>  In a democracy, those in charge of a properly functioning police force should be working in close co-operation with those tasked to oversee it.  In a properly functioning democracy, the first reaction of a Minister for Justice, on realising that the police force was not co-operating with the body tasked with overseeing it and preventing or investigating its misconduct, would be to introduce support and assist with measures to fix the problem.  The Minister did not do that.  <\/p><p>  The people of this State suspect that this scandal stinks to high heaven.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality have tried to confuse the issue and tried to turn the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission into the scapegoat, assisted by the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> which this morning published a story that was completely refuted by Verrimus, the British security company called in by the ombudsman commission to check its offices for bugs when it first suspected their presence at its headquarters.<\/p><p>  The bugging of the offices of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, or the suspicion of it, is something the Minister for Justice and Equality should have taken very seriously.  The proper response would be to consider the evidence, establish the source of any threat to the office, which means a threat to the democratic brief it fulfils, and to prepare a response to it in conjunction with the ombudsman commission.  Instead, both the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, rowed in with the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, to blame the ombudsman commission for trying to establish if it had been bugged.  How did the Taoiseach and the Minister know that this was not an unauthorised action by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  How did the Minister and the Taoiseach know that this threat had not come from a criminal gang?<\/p><p>There are many questions to answer, some of which have been raised by the Labour Party Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Costello, regarding the case of drug trafficker and Garda informant Kieran Boylan.  How did the Garda know - how did the Minister, Deputy Shatter, know - it was not something to do with that case?  This man is not a small player in the drugs world.  He was caught with &euro;2.5 million worth of heroin.  The Director of Public Prosecutions decided to drop the charges against him as his trial was drawing to a close.  The ombudsman complained that the Garda had deliberately delayed and frustrated its four-year inquiry into allegations that Boylan was allowed by his Garda handlers to continue dealing drugs while he supplied information on the dealers to whom he was still selling.  The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, knows in his heart that if he was in Opposition and not in a Labour Party which has devoted itself to propping up this Government he would be joining Sinn F&eacute;in and other Opposition Deputies in calling for an independent inquiry into this affair.<\/p><p> How can the decent garda&iacute; who do their best to carry out their duties properly retain the confidence of the public while this latest debacle remains under wraps and not subject to proper public scrutiny?  More than 2,000 people per year bring complaints about the Garda to the ombudsman.  How are they to have confidence that the GSOC can pursue their complaints in circumstances in which garda&iacute; are not co-operating and the Minister is not fixing this problem?  I urge all Deputies to support Sinn F&eacute;in's demand for an independent inquiry and to oppose the Government's amendment so that public confidence in GSOC and the Garda can be restored and the matter of possible bugging can be dealt with by those qualified to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800045#SS00200","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392756600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Since the story of the bugging of the GSOC offices broke it has been clear that a full independent inquiry is needed to establish the facts of this case.

An independent inquiry would have the power to compel any documents relating to the illegal surveillance of GSOC to be brought before the commission.<\/p><p>  Instead of maintaining a shroud of secrecy surrounding these current events, the Minister should be looking to clarify what happened.  However, the Government in its wisdom has refused this Sinn F&eacute;in motion calling for an independent inquiry.

The Garda has become the centre of this scandal and the burden of responsibility lies upon that organisation to ensure it is above reproach.  It must acknowledge what types of surveillance gathering they are involved in and what technology it uses.  It must clarify whether it ever employs private companies to carry out surveillance operations.  Could surveillance of GSOC ever be legally justified - for example, if it was believed that members of GSOC were leaking information to journalists, as they have been accused of doing?  Could the Official Secrets Acts be used to justify such an operation?  Only a full independent inquiry will be able to resolve such questions.<\/p><p>  It is clear that the Minister has attempted to deflect attention away from the core issues by peddling misinformation and half-truths.  Why, in a properly functioning democracy, would the Minister with direct responsibility for policing be reluctant to initiate an investigation into illegal surveillance of a State body that has been established to hold the police force to account?  It is also clear that the relationship between certain journalists and the Garda and, indeed, Members of the Government needs to be scrutinised.  Today's cack-handed attempt by Paul Williams to discredit GSOC was the most obvious example of this.  The Government's line is being spun by certain elements of the media in order to deflect attention from what is really important, and one wonders what their true agenda may be.  As Deputy McDonald made clear earlier today, any investigation needs to be empowered to get to the heart of the bugging scandal.  It is simply unacceptable that the Minister might be allowed to set the terms of reference for this inquiry.<\/p><p>  The inquiry must investigate the Garda's handling of the well-known convicted drug trafficker Kieran Boylan, whose role as an alleged informant must be open to scrutiny because it is believed this relationship goes to the heart of the bugging scandal.  The only true means of determining the facts of the matter is a thorough, transparent, independent inquiry.  If the Government uses the powers available to it under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 it may well be able to get to the root of this matter.  The credibility of this Government to lead into the future may depend on its ability to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800046#TT00400","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1392756600,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Tonight's debate concerns one of the most important institutions of the State, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Recent events surrounding the alleged surveillance of GSOC have raised serious questions about its independence and its capacity to ensure proper civilian oversight of the police in this State.  The seriousness of this matter cannot be overstated but, despite the fact that almost certainly the offices of GSOC have been targeted by a covert and sophisticated surveillance operation that could only have been carried out by a Government agency, the Minister and senior Garda personnel have attempted to trivialise what has happened over a ten-day period.  This is unacceptable.  The Minister's failure to adequately address the compromising of GSOC's security is an indictment of his attitude and approach, and earlier today the Cabinet was forced into a U-turn, announcing an inquiry with a scope so limited that it is likely it will amount to nothing more than a review into the GSOC scandal.<\/p><p>  Serious questions arise around the Minster's capacity to oversee the role of the Garda and to be truly independent in his role as Minister for Justice and Equality.  His statement last week to the D&aacute;il completely misrepresented the GSOC report and his distortion of the facts has been repeated by senior Ministers and the Taoiseach, whose initial response to <i>The Sunday Times<\/i> article which broke the story was to misinterpret the legislation in an attempt to discredit GSOC.  The question arises of whether the Government wants an independent ombudsman.  Thankfully, these Government failures have not undermined the public's confidence in ordinary rank and file garda&iacute;, who provide a vital public service.  However, the failures of both the Minister and the Garda Commissioner were further underscored last Friday when, at their joint press conference at Templemore, the Minister attempted to row back and demonstrate his confidence in GSOC, only for the Commissioner to undo this effort by saying that the pigeon had come home to roost for GSOC.  Today's decision by the Government to belatedly initiate a review into this saga is a response to what has become a catalogue of controversy and crises under the Minister's watch.  The appointment of a retired High Court judge to inquire into all matters of relevance will be viewed with a certain cynicism, given that it will be the Minister himself, albeit on advice from the Attorney General, who will set the terms of reference and receive the report.  The Minister should also be placed under forensic scrutiny as part of any examination rather than being the one to oversee the review.<\/p><p>  Yesterday, Sinn F&eacute;in publicly stated that we would be making the necessary amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 in order to strengthen GSOC's powers, particularly in view of the need for GSOC to investigate the Garda Commissioner.  Today the Government announced that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality would be asked to review the existing legislation and make recommendations for change.  I suggest to the Minister that there is no opposition to strengthening the legislation and that powers to investigate the Garda Commissioner can be provided for immediately on that basis, even as broader policing reforms are considered by the committee.  It is also necessary that the ombudsman, when conducting investigations, has oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na up to and including the Garda Commissioner.  We will not have a policing culture based on accountability and transparency if the person at the top of the force is exempt from independent investigation.  This was eloquently noted in recent days by the former Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala O'Loan, who said that based on GSOC's current set-up she simply would not be an ombudsman.<\/p><p>We need to amend the legislation to give effect to these broader reforms and modernise our laws to match the policing challenges of 2014 and the administration of justice in the State.<\/p><p> There is great merit in the idea of creating an independent policing board with proper oversight similar to the body that exists in the North.  For instance, at community level joint policing committees have in most parts become talking shops.  There must be community input and structures which are responsive in order to win public trust and confidence in policing.  Additional powers must be devolved to joint policing committees to give local representatives direct input in the development of local policing plans.  Joint policing committees also need to be given a more effective role in ensuring that local policing plans are fully implemented.  The Garda must then be held to account for its implementation.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in became a driving force for progressive change and policing accountability in the North.  The Patten report provided a blueprint that enabled the creation of a policing service that is accountable and answerable to the public it serves.  It is clearly time to usher in new change.  The Government stood on a platform of dramatic reform.  Let us now match words with action and get on with the task in hand, which the people expect and which the Government promised to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800046#TT00500","speaker":"981","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392757200,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>To delete all words after &quot;surveillance;&quot; and substitute the following:<blockquote>&quot;- the investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, under section 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, into these concerns;<br \/><br \/>- the conclusion of the investigation that no definitive evidence of unauthorised technical or electronic surveillance was found; and<br \/><br \/>- the decision of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission that no further action was necessary or reasonably practicable;<br \/><br \/>reaffirms its commitment to maintaining the independence and functional integrity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission;<br \/><br \/>welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence (by the Government) of the appointment of a High Court Judge to review all matters of relevance to the initiation and outcome of the investigation commenced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on 7th October, 2013 pursuant to section 102(4) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, concerns that have arisen as to the possibility that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was under surveillance and all papers, including correspondence, and reports of relevance to the matter;<br \/><br \/>welcomes the engagement by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence with the Joint Committee on Public Service, Oversight and Petitions in its examination of these issues;<br \/><br \/>acknowledges a need to further examine all relevant parts of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 with a view to improving the statutory mechanisms, so as to provide for continued and effective oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to maintain public confidence in the process for resolving complaints against its members and agrees that such examination be undertaken by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and that it report thereon; and<br \/><br \/>looks forward to the reports of the Joint Committees and of the High Court Judge so appointed.&quot;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>On Tuesday last, speaking in this House I stated that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission are vital pillars in our democratic policing structures.  The work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in fighting crime, combating terrorism, and protecting the public, is of critical importance.  Equally, the role of GSOC, in independently investigating complaints or concerns relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is central to the maintenance of continued high levels of public confidence in the force.  My fundamental role, as Minister for Justice and Equality, is to protect the security and integrity of the State and its institutions.  My first and only concern, on learning of allegations of surveillance, was to establish whether GSOC, a critical oversight institution, had been subjected to surveillance.<\/p><p>  Prior to the establishment of GSOC, it was my view that we needed to establish such a body by way of legislation and some may recall that, following on allegations of Garda misconduct in Donegal, I was one amongst other Members of this House who called for a public inquiry and on 20 November 2001 proposed an extensive motion in this House for the holding of such an inquiry.  Some months later the Morris tribunal was established.  When issues of difficulty arose in Abbeylara, not only was I a member of the justice committee which commenced hearings into Abbeylara, but I took so seriously the need for not only independent oversight but accountability to Parliament that I personally attended both the High Court and the Supreme Court to make submissions in favour of the justice committee being permitted to continue its inquiry into Abbeylara.  Therefore, there is no one more committed than me to ensuring that we maintain the independence and functional integrity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and that there is full public confidence in the commission.<\/p><p>  In recent days I have listened to allegations made that I am seeking to undermine the role of GSOC or that I may want to abolish it altogether.  Such allegations of undermining have again been made this evening.  The chairman of GSOC, Mr. Simon O'Brien, in his presentation to the Joint Committee on Public Service, Oversight and Petitions on Wednesday last, stated on more than one occasion his full trust in me, as Minister.  Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, a member of the commission, when questioned in an interview on &quot;Prime Time&quot; on Tuesday night last on my statement that evening to the D&aacute;il, stated, &quot;we've no disagreement at all with the Minister&quot;.  Later on in the interview, when asked by Ms Miriam O'Callaghan why the commission did not report to me on the investigation undertaken by them, when it was suggested to Mr. FitzGerald that GSOC &quot;didn't trust&quot; me, he stated &quot;we have full faith in the Minister&quot;.<\/p><p>  My concern to ensure a proper working relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC, and the resolution of well publicised difficulties last spring between the two organisations, resulted in meetings with both the Garda Commissioner and the chairman of GSOC and, ultimately, the conclusion of a new protocol between both bodies, the objective of which was to ensure that GSOC could fully and properly carry out its statutory duties with the fullest necessary Garda co-operation.  Just over two weeks ago, prior to the commencement of this controversy, I announced my intention to bring before Government proposals to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to address aspects of the legislation that required change and which have been the subject of both reports and public comment.  I also took the steps necessary to ensure that, in the context of GSOC's investigation into the fixed ticket charge controversy, it had direct access to the PULSE system, and stated it will also have such access in other future investigations.  The statement I issued on Monday fortnight last has been available since that date on the Department of Justice and Equality website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800047#UU00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1392757200,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Why has it taken so long?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800047#UU00300","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1392757200,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Today, it was agreed at Cabinet that the input of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality would be sought on the amendments to be made to the 2005 Act with regard to GSOC, in advance of my finalising the proposals to be brought by me to Cabinet - hardly the actions of someone seeking to undermine the work of GSOC.<\/p><p>  On Tuesday last, in this House I detailed the background to the investigation GSOC initiated and the outcome of that investigation.  I summarised for the House the information furnished to me by GSOC's chairman, Mr. O'Brien, at our two hour meeting and that contained in the briefing note I received from GSOC and its public press release.  I addressed the central issues of the &quot;anomalies&quot;, &quot;potential threats&quot; or &quot;vulnerabilities&quot; identified.  Two of these, relating to a Wi-Fi system and a conference call telephone, resulted in GSOC initiating an investigation on 7 October 2013.  Following the instigation of that investigation, a third potential threat or vulnerability was identified in respect of a device that can access phone conversations and material from a UK telephone connected to a UK 3G network.  I detailed to the House the conclusion reached by GSOC following on from that investigation and work undertaken by Verrimus, the security consultants which had undertaken the original security sweep in September 2013 and which had assisted GSOC in the investigation that took place.  I recounted, specifically, from both the chairman's meeting with me and the formal brief I received, the conclusion that there was no definitive evidence of any technical or electronic surveillance of GSOC's offices.  I also recounted that there was no connection between any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with any of these matters.  Despite the fact that what I said with regard to the surveillance replicated exactly the conclusion contained in the brief received by me from GSOC, I have been subject to continuing political attack alleging that I have undermined the role of GSOC and been covering up Garda misconduct.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, both inside and outside this House, GSOC's conclusions and decision to conclude its investigation have been disregarded.  In this context, it is worth noting what the commissioner, Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, told &quot;Prime Time&quot; this day last week.<\/p><p>  Ms Miriam O'Callaghan asked the following question with reference to GSOC's press release of Monday, 10 February:<blockquote>In your statement last night you said there was no evidence of Garda misconduct, why would you say that in the first place if you weren't thinking that?<\/blockquote>Mr. Kieran FitzGerald replied:<blockquote>Because the reason we said that last night and that l'm happy to repeat it here now, is that it's part of the public discussion, in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann this evening, and all over the airwaves for the last couple of days, people are pointing fingers and may I say it is unfair of people to point fingers at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the basis of anything we have said or done.<\/blockquote>That was said by Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, a commissioner in GSOC.  Listening to the contribution of Sinn F&eacute;in members tonight, one would think it was said somewhere in outer space and no one was listening.<\/p><p>  Ms O'Callaghan, in reference to finger-pointing, continued, &quot;but your statement last night did that&quot;.  Mr. FitzGerald replied:<blockquote>No, our statement last night was meant to try to clear that up and say we did not find evidence of Garda misconduct because the public discourse seems to be pointing in the direction of finding the Guards guilty of this thing when we are saying quite clearly and categorically and in no uncertain terms, we found no evidence to point to that direction and for people to suggest that, you know, they were up to something, we're the people who did the examination, we're the people with the evidence, we do not have any evidence to point in that direction.<\/blockquote>It is unfortunate that, despite that clear statement by Mr. Kieran FitzGerald on &quot;Prime Time&quot;, we have had a week of continuous finger-pointing at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and calls for inquiries by persons who have not only assumed that GSOC was under surveillance or was bugged, but that the Garda were the culprits.  We have had more of that tonight from Sinn F&eacute;in.  Having regard to that party's history, of course, it suits Sinn F&eacute;in to have An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continuously under some form of suspicion.<\/p><p>  While I do not doubt the general legitimacy of concerns that have been expressed by various persons at reports of potential threats of surveillance of GSOC, it is a pity that we could not have had a more balanced and rational debate on these matters.<\/p><p> An inference has been drawn by some that one of the three potential threats identified by GSOC - the use of a bogus UK network device - could only involve technology available to government agencies.  The repetition of this inference has been fuelled by the Verrimus report and has caused real concern to many.  Information on the technology needed to create a bogus network - usually referred to as an IMSI catcher - is in fact widely available on the Internet.  It is also the case that such devices have a range of up to several kilometres, so that even if there had been such a device it could have been located anywhere in central Dublin.  There is no indication whatsoever of which I am aware that it was directed at GSOC, whose staff do not in any event use UK-registered mobile phones. <\/p><p> I referenced this fact in my speech last week based on the briefing I received from the chairman of GSOC.  It is also worth noting that in his presentation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee, the chairman clearly did not accept that the technology referred to could only be obtained by Government agencies, despite the statement to this effect in their security consultant's report.  I did not reference it in my speech to the D&aacute;il last week as the chairman had clearly placed no reliance on that advice, and this is clear from his own comments to the Joint Petitions Committee.  However, we have reached the stage where these and other factual arguments cannot get a fair hearing.<\/p><p> This political opportunism has extended to manifestly false claims that I misled this House or withheld relevant information from it.  I must say again that everything I told this House in statements on Tuesday of last week was based wholly, exclusively and accurately on the oral and written briefing given to me by the chairperson of GSOC and the press statement issued by GSOC.  If that were not the case, the endorsement of Mr. Kieran FitzGerald would not have been forthcoming.<\/p><p> Some Members opposite claimed to see significance in the fact that I did not specify that the investigation launched by GSOC was under section 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  I made it clear to the House, however, that GSOC had launched an investigation.  The fact of the matter is that section 102 is the only section under which GSOC could have launched such investigation.  As anyone with even a passing familiarity with the 2005 Act will confirm, no other section could have been used by GSOC to initiate an investigation on its own initiative, so it is of no relevance that I did not expressly reference section 102 in my D&aacute;il statement, just as GSOC did not reference it in its press release.  There has been no public criticism of GSOC for not referencing and naming the section in its press release.<\/p><p> There were other sections of the legislation relevant to the investigation undertaken by GSOC to which no reference was made and to which GSOC itself made no reference in its press release.  These include section 98 and section 103 of the 2005 Act.  It was not a night for delivering a legal treatise.  It was an opportunity to explain to the House in as non-technical language as possible the events that had occurred as recorded to me.  I assumed those speaking in the House and, in particular, the Opposition justice spokespeople were familiar with the Act.  I certainly never expected that my statement would be distorted to a false allegation being made by my political opponents that I had, in some way, misled the House for some perceived political advantage.<\/p><p> All sorts of motives have been attributed to me for not expressly mentioning section 102 of the Act, which have no credibility in the context of my knowledge that members of GSOC were the next day to come before the petitions committee and that, at an extended questioning session in the committee, there was a reasonable likelihood that specific aspects of the legislation applying to GSOC would give rise to questions.<\/p><p> It has been suggested that I wanted to conceal the fact that GSOC commenced an investigation into members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Those who make this charge choose to ignore the fact that GSOC's investigative remit is confined to investigating matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  GSOC has no statutory entitlement to investigate any other individual or body, other than a member or members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> The issue of whether GSOC should have advised me of the investigation which it carried out under section 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 has also resulted in spurious claims - repeated this evening - that either myself, the Taoiseach or other Government Ministers were attempting to divert attention away from the substantive issue of whether GSOC was under surveillance.<\/p><p> Much was made of what was seen as the discretionary nature of the provision in section 80(5) of the 2005 Act under which GSOC may - and great emphasis was put on the word &quot;may&quot; - make any report that it considers appropriate for drawing to the Minister's attention matters that have come to its notice and that, in its opinion, should because of their gravity or other exceptional circumstances, be the subject of a special report to the Minister.<\/p><p> First of all, it was never a question of diverting attention away from the substantive issue of whether or not GSOC was under surveillance.  There is no binary choice between one and the other.  Indeed, it is precisely because the substantive issue is of such importance - a point I have repeatedly emphasised - that the question of reporting this to me was such an important matter.  It was not appropriate that I first learned of it in a Sunday newspaper in a report derived from a leak from GSOC that remains under investigation.<\/p><p> It is true that section 80(5) of the 2005 Act provides that GSOC may make a report to me in the circumstances I have described, but this is better described as an enabling provision rather than a purely discretionary one.  In other words, it should be used in circumstances contemplated by the provision.  In that context, I do not think that any reasonable person would regard concerns of the nature we are discussing yet again this evening as anything other than grave or exceptional.  I am not sure how anyone could sensibly argue the opposite in circumstances where this issue has dominated the TV and radio news for days on end, has been the subject of countless newspaper headlines and articles, was the subject of statements in this House last week, is the subject of a motion in the House this evening, and is being examined as a matter of urgency by a joint committee of both Houses which took four hours last Wednesday to question members of GSOC.  If that is not a matter of some gravity or extraordinary circumstance I do not know how one would define the meaning of either term.  <\/p><p> Even apart from this, however, there is the separate obligation in section 103 of the 2005 Act.  Section 103 provides that GSOC, where it launches a section 102 investigation, shall - and I emphasise the word &quot;shall&quot; - inform the Minister of the progress and results of the investigation.  An exception to this strict requirement is allowed in only three circumstances, namely: where supplying the information would prejudice a criminal investigation or prosecution; would jeopardise a person's safety; or, for any other reason, would not be in the public interest.  The first two exceptions are irrelevant.  As regards the third, I find it impossible to see how it would not be in the public interest for the Minister to be advised of an investigation in these circumstances or of the outcome of such an investigation.  In any event, and to be fair to GSOC, GSOC has not argued that I was not informed for any of these reasons, and has expressed genuine regret at the decision not to keep me informed.<\/p><p> I make these points to illustrate how some Members opposite have sought every opportunity to generate controversy and manufacture concern in the hope of scoring political points, without regard for the consequences for GSOC, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or public confidence in either institution.<\/p><p> Since I addressed this House last week on these matters, the following events have taken place: Members of GSOC participated in a four-hour hearing before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions; I received from GSOC three reports of Verrimus Limited, the first relating to the original security sweep, and the second and third relating to further work undertaken by it subsequent to the commencement of GSOC's investigation of 7 October 2013; I received from GSOC a report pursuant to section 103 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005; I have engaged in correspondence with GSOC seeking to further clarify matters of relevance; I have received a peer review report on the technical matters of relevance from RITS, an IT security consultancy firm, based in this country, to seek clarification of the technical information contained in the Verrimus report and an opinion with regard to the risks as identified and presented to GSOC; and my officials have also obtained clarification from GSOC in respect of some matters.<\/p><p> I have considered in detail all of the documents and the information furnished to me.  I have also carefully read through the transcript of the four hour hearing before the petitions committee.  I have received from GSOC information additional to that furnished to me on Tuesday last, prior to my statement to the House, and some information additional to that given to the joint committee during the course of the four hour hearing.<\/p><p> Included within that information are further details concerning the unused Wi-Fi in GSOC's offices that was remotely accessed.  It seems that Verrimus identified, in September 2013, that it was being remotely accessed but could not identify from where.  The unexplained accessing of the Wi-Fi is, of course, an indicator of a potential threat or vulnerability.  However, as it was confirmed to me that the Wi-Fi at no stage accessed any information whatsoever contained in GSOC's office, there was of course no real breach of GSOC's security.<\/p><p> Whilst it seems Verrimus was unable to explain why the wifi was so accessed, the section 103 report explains that the wifi showed a connection to the Bittbuzz network and that the Wi-Fi system was found to be connecting to another Wi-Fi system &quot;located in a business premises close to the Ombudsman Commission's offices&quot;. <\/p><p>It also states \"the Bitbuzz equipment had been installed in that business premises in approximately August 2013\" and that the device using Wi-Fi in that business premises had only connected to Bitbuzz in approximately August 2013.  Some check was undertaken through Bitbuzz which confirmed that no confidential information had been accessed and the section 103 report records that no further inquiries were made.  It was concluded that it was likely that the Wi-Fi within GSOC was randomly linking into Bitbuzz \"due to some unknown technical anomaly rather than some unauthorised technical or electronic surveillance\".  That information only came to my attention on Friday.<\/p><p> In reply to an inquiry from one of my officials in the Department of Justice and Equality, GSOC advised this morning that the business premises referenced was an Insomnia coffee shop within a Spar outlet on the ground floor of the building occupied by GSOC.  It advertises Wi-Fi availability for customers and connectivity to Bitbuzz.  I am unaware of any credible information that surveillance is being, or has been, conducted on the offices of GSOC by any of the customers of Insomnia.  It is a matter of concern to me that this full information was not supplied to me prior to the D&aacute;il debate on Tuesday last, nor given to the Oireachtas joint committee on Wednesday.  Before this comment is used to accuse me again of trying to undermine GSOC, I reiterate that it is my only objective to ensure the truth is known about all of these matters.<\/p><p> The report mentioned earlier that I received from RITS gives as an opinion, based on the reports provided for RITS, that &quot;there is no evidence of any technical or electronic surveillance against GSOC&quot;; that is, no evidence at all, not merely no definitive evidence.  The report also disputes other conclusions reached by Verrimus.  I appreciate that GSOC relied on the reports it had received from the security company it had contracted.  I cannot ignore the report I received from the company asked to conduct a peer review of the technical documentation furnished by GSOC to me and the information accompanying it.  Having regard to the differences that have arisen, the additional information I have received since I made my first statement to the D&aacute;il, the ongoing nature of this controversy, its debilitating impact on the capacity of GSOC to get on with its work and the continuing overhang of suspicion voiced by some, despite the conclusions of GSOC, that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was engaged in misconduct, I concluded that it was important to do what was possible and reasonable to bring an end to ongoing controversy.<\/p><p> I briefed the Cabinet this morning on developments that had occurred in respect of this matter following on from the hearing last week of the Joint Committee on Public Service, Oversight and Petitions.  I gave the Cabinet my assessment of the potential damage to both GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and more widely to public confidence in the enforcement of law from the character of the current debate on surveillance concerns.  It was clear to me that it was necessary to provide a structure for all issues of controversy to be addressed with calm and reason.  I briefed the Cabinet on all the information at my disposal.  In the light of the briefing and my concerns, my Cabinet colleagues and I agreed to the appointment of a retired High Court judge to inquire into all matters of relevance to the controversy that had arisen.<\/p><p> Up to Friday, it was my view that GSOC had inquired into these matters and reached a conclusion and that calls for an inquiry could be seen as undermining public credibility of GSOC and a rejection of the conclusions it had reached in the investigation it had undertaken.  No such inquiry calls have in the past been made when, following an investigation, GSOC concluded that there had been instances of Garda misconduct.  It seemed highly inappropriate to hold an inquiry in circumstances where GSOC had concluded that there was no evidence of Garda misconduct.  However, the manner in which this controversy has continued, the new information I have received and the need to bring absolute clarity, insofar as that is possible, to all of these matters lead me to the view that it is in the public interest that a retired High Court judge undertake the task agreed by the Cabinet.  It is of the utmost importance that the full truth is established beyond dispute.  I hope all sides of the House will welcome this and now give the judge to be appointed the time and space necessary to conduct this inquiry and report on his or her conclusions.  I am reliant on the advices of the Attorney General on the terms of the inquiry and expect that they will shortly be finalised.  It is regrettable that Members of this House, following the announcements, should impugn my motives and objectivity with regard to the terms to be furnished to the judge.  This matter will be settled by the Attorney General and the judge to be appointed must be satisfied the terms of reference are appropriate to the matter to be looked into.<\/p><p> I hope the decision will enable GSOC to proceed with its work unhindered by controversy.  As stated, I will, of course, attend before the petitions committee tomorrow to address any issue of relevance.  The report to be produced by the judge will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, unedited and untouched in any shape by me.  It is regrettable that people should question my integrity and suggest anything other than that in the context of comments made in this House.  It is of the utmost importance that the matter be dealt with in a calm and cool way.  It is important that Members do not further impugn the integrity of either body or jump to conclusions and make public comment in jumping to conclusions in this issue and presenting themselves as defending GSOC, while denying the credibility of the conclusions reached by GSOC in its investigation.  I cannot understand that approach.  I cannot understand how that does what some say they are seeking to do, to ensure the integrity of GSOC.  My commitment as Minister is to ensure we get to the truth.  I do not express any favouritism as between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC.  They are hugely important bodies that will fill an important role in the State and must do so in the context of the statutory framework within which they operate.  It is important that they abide by the statutory framework and meet the obligations imposed on them.<\/p><p> It is important that no further comment be made leaving any cloud of suspicion hanging over any body in circumstances in which there is no evidence for such a cloud.  That is not in the public interest.  I plead with Deputies that we have had a week of hyperbole, hysteria and wild claims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800047#UU00400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392758400,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Of the Minister's making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800049#WW00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1392758400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>A journalist sent a question to my Department wanting to know generally what I was doing about bugging journalists.

The lack of understanding of the extent to which there is judicial oversight in a number of these areas is extraordinary.  I plead with those contributing further to the debate that we have a discussion based on facts, not fiction, based on reality, not hyperbole.  It is fair game for the Opposition to try to put a Government Minister, whether me or others, under pressure.  On occasion, it is fair game to question people's capacity or the credibility of what they say.  It is not fair, however, in playing that game that aspersions are cast on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in circumstances where there is no evidence for such aspersions to be cast based on the conclusions of GSOC.  It is unfair to suggest I have any interest of any description in trying to undermine the work of GSOC.  I want to ensure that if things went wrong in this context, including the concern about the leak of information from GSOC, that they are dealt with and addressed.  If there are lessons to be learned by either body, GSOC or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they should be learned.<\/p><p>At the end we have a judge with absolute credibility and independence - a retired member of the High Court - who will independently express views on these matters.

This is day nine of the controversy and everybody was hoping this week would ultimately see some form of light at the end of the tunnel so we could move on.  Behind everything going on there is a fundamental concern for all of us as the two major pillars of the justice system, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, have been under a sustained spotlight by all of us for the wrong reasons.  We all want a strong Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ombudsman, and we want to work with them as best we can.<\/p><p>  Part of the ongoing narrative for the past nine days was the creation of sides.  We have had to decide our sides, and whether we are on the side of GSOC, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Minister, but we are all on the same side.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been in touch with me, as I am sure they have with Deputies around the House, airing their concern about what broke in the newspapers last Sunday week.  I am sure the staff of GSOC are concerned as well, so we should pull together to sort out the issue.  Unfortunately, nine days on the controversy is still raging.  Today's announcement, which must be fleshed out, is a little underwhelming to say the least.  I will get to that in a moment.<\/p><p>  The tone of the narrative from the past couple of days was set by the Taoiseach, who stated on the airwaves that GSOC had to level with the Minister.  That was most disappointing.  We then had the public expression of regret by GSOC, having paid a visit to the Minister's office, and that served to undermine GSOC's independence.  I asked Mr. Simon O'Brien about that at last Wednesday's committee meeting and the public perception was that the body's independence was undermined.  That is also on the record.  The Garda Commissioner sought public clarification arising from a GSOC statement early in the controversy before the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors sought the resignation of the ombudsman.  It was all very unseemly and neither the public nor any of us liked it.  Much of the narrative, particularly that coming from the Government, was unhelpful, as I stated.<\/p><p>  I compliment the three-member Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  They came before the committee and were very impressive in their forthrightness.  They have a very difficult job and must be supported at every opportunity by legislators.  That is true for every independent office established by way of statute in the State.  I hope we will not see a repeat from any Government of what has happened over the past number of days, which has seen an attack on this body's independence, with the Taoiseach publicly carpeting GSOC.<\/p><p>  GSOC made a number of valuable interventions in the week's debate, and there have been three or four appearances on &quot;Prime Time&quot;.  Mr. Kieran FitzGerald came in as an honest broker and the Minister quoted him in his contribution.  The Minister spoke last Thursday evening on &quot;Prime Time&quot; and should have expressed confidence in Mr. O'Brien.  The Minister indicated the following day in Templemore that he would express confidence in the three members of the commission as a whole but when the public watches such issues, first impressions stick.  It is regrettable for the Minister for Justice and Equality not to express confidence in the chairman of the commission.<\/p><p>  We must remind ourselves that this comes against the backdrop of GSOC having had to take to the airwaves over the past number of months seeking an increase in the powers available to it under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  It was amazing to listen to Mr. FitzGerald and Mr. O'Brien taking to radio and television calling for necessary increases in powers and those pleas falling on deaf ears in the Department.  Why should they have to take to the airwaves to articulate concerns about legislation and allowing them to do an effective job?  If they had asked through official channels, a positive response was not forthcoming.  That is the only conclusion anybody can draw.<\/p><p>  Today we published a Bill which would do exactly what GSOC has sought over the past number of months.  It would provide scrutiny and oversight of the Garda Commissioner as chief of police.  He is already accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the financial side of the operation.  The legislation would allow serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to refer matters directly to GSOC, an act that is currently prohibited.  It would also give the commission access to the PULSE system, which it does not have.  It is ironic that the commission has full powers of inquiry under the legislation but it has limited access to PULSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800050#XX00200","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1392759000,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Did the Deputy not hear what I said about that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800050#XX00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1392759000,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I heard what the Minister said last week, and I will respond to it in a moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800050#XX00400","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1392759000,"counter":510,"content":"<p>It was two weeks ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800050#XX00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1392759000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>The legislation would also allow the commission to inquire into policies and procedure, which I hope would serve to fend off complaints or avert problems before they arise.  We are trying to play a constructive role and the Minister should enact that legislation as soon as possible.  Perhaps there are further or more far-reaching reforms in the Minister's mind but these are four basic requirements.  Mr. Conor Brady, a former commissioner, has articulated those points for a long time and I am sure the Minister heard the comments of Baroness Nuala O'Loan at the weekend.<\/p><p>  This is against the backdrop of the disastrous handling of the penalty points fiasco by the Minister.  Let us call a spade a spade.  The Minister finally referred the penalty points issue to GSOC and the matter was referred to on Question Time when we had our last session.  He did not tell us what had changed in his mind when he referred it to GSOC when it could have been referred in the first instance.  The Minister needs to put on record why he did not act sooner.  It will be very interesting to see the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report on the penalty points issue, as it has compiled a fairly comprehensive report that will be quite revealing when it sees the light of day.<\/p><p>  There is also the issue of the confidential recipient, and the Minister will have to man up to this matter.  The politics side of the issue is becoming irrelevant.  The way the man spoke to the whistleblower and what was said about what the Minister would try to do to him - a section of the transcript from the whistleblower - is now on the record.  It is very disturbing.<\/p><p>The whistleblower used all the relevant channels.  As in the GSOC case, rather than being regarded as the victim he was turned into the villain.  That is very concerning.  It is regrettable that the Minister has not shown sufficient concern in any of his public utterances over the penalty points whistleblower controversy.  He has not given any indication that he was genuinely and humanely concerned about the treatment to which the man was subjected when he tried to use the official channels.  The Taoiseach stated in the House that the man did not co-operate with officialdom and the relevant channels.  That is a very serious statement from the Taoiseach because it is completely misinformed.  The whistleblower attempted to communicate with the Department of the Taoiseach on many occasions.  This puts the Taoiseach's statement into an even more alarming context.<\/p><p> The people rejected the Minister's referendum on Oireachtas inquiries.  The Minister has not given us much detail on what he announced today.  What is mooted is nearly a form of ministerial inquiry rather than an independent inquiry.  All the Minister told us is that he is appointing a High Court judge to inquire.  His statement read that it was agreed by the Cabinet today to appoint a High Court judge to inquire into all relevant matters.  I was asked today whether I welcome this.   I will welcome it when this controversy is dealt with satisfactorily and conclusively.  However, we do not seem to be getting that.  The Minister's proposal is a step in the right direction but we want to see the details.  He has not given us any.<\/p><p> When the Minister spoke earlier, he did not address the content of the Sinn F&eacute;in motion and our call on Monday of last week to establish, under the very effective 2004 legislation, a commission of investigation.  This has been shown to be a very successful mechanism for conducting an inquiry in the State.  There are many examples of it.  He did not say in his contribution why he would not use this vehicle.<\/p><p> The Minister said there were false claims and allegations that he misled the House.  He spoke last Tuesday evening during statements and claimed there was no evidence of unauthorised technical or electronic surveillance found.  He said it was unfortunate that the Garda found itself to be subject to what appeared to be completely baseless innuendo and he also stated no information had been furnished to him.  Why did he not tell us what was in the briefing that GSOC gave him?  It was important.  A three-page brief that was made available at the committee and which is now in the public domain showed that the Minister was absolutely informed that GSOC had opened a public interest investigation.  This is significantly relevant to the debate.  The Minister chose not to reveal the information.  This is very serious.  He may dismiss it and refer to false allegations but it is not a case of false allegations as we did not write the Minister's statement.  We did not deliver his statement here last Tuesday, nor did we prepare the GSOC briefing note.  The Minister chose to cut and parse it and to insert his own interpretation, in keeping with the narrative that obtained all week, that is, that there is nothing to see and that we should move along.  Unfortunately, this caught up with the Minister.<\/p><p> We called last Monday for a inquiry under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, headed by a High Court judge and assisted by a person with expertise in technology and surveillance, and possibly a policing expert from outside the State.  What are we getting?  All we know at present is that a judge is to inquire.  Will there be compellability?  Who will set the terms of reference?  Will it be the Minister?  Will the report come back to the D&aacute;il or Minister?  Will the Minister appear before the House?  All these questions are outstanding.  It appears tonight that the Minister is trying to manage the process the whole way along.  If he is setting up a truly independent inquiry, it must be independent of him.  This is why the 2004 legislation exists.  If there is a judge who is not sufficiently resourced, is constrained by the terms of reference and must report to the Minister and not the Oireachtas, many questions will remain in people's minds.  Many doubts will remain in their minds also because they will have seen how the Minister acted in the past and how he acted regarding the narrative in the past eight to ten days.  The people are concerned.<\/p><p> There is a problem to be addressed regarding the outstanding question on the bugging and surveillance.  The Minister may refer to Wi-Fi and all the rest but the incident at 1 a.m. is the one that is sticking with people.  We witnessed the Minister's attempts to create a diversion, as if to move away from the substance of the matter and engage in camouflage and deflection from what is happening.  There was an effort in the past two days to discredit Verrimus, which is very concerning also.  We do not want a cover-up but an independent investigation under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800050#XX00600","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392759600,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate on the urgent need for an independent inquiry into what has been taking place in recent days in regard to GSOC, the Garda and Minister for Justice and Equality.

The bottom line is that in any democratic state, nobody is above the law.  All citizens must be treated fairly and equitably.

He and the Taoiseach have tried to muddy the waters regarding the whole controversy and scandal that has been raging for the past nine days.  The Taoiseach stated in the public domain on Monday, and again on Tuesday, that GSOC had an obligation under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act to report to the Minister and that it did not do so.  That was clearly not true.<\/p><p>The Minister said last Tuesday that he had taken the opportunity to underscore the importance of prompt reporting to him of issues of concern, as provided for under the legislation governing GSOC.  The legislation does not provide that GSOC is required to report to the Minister.  The Minister has said tonight that he assumed that Members were familiar with the Act, but one must wonder if he is familiar with it because he is certainly clouding the issue with the statements he is making.  The statements made by him and the Taoiseach have allowed the controversy to drag on.<\/p><p> Last Thursday night, during his interview on &quot;Prime Time&quot;, the Minister said there was an express obligation under the Act for GSOC to report to him and he quoted section 103 of the Act.  That section does not provide for any express obligation on GSOC to report to the Minister.  In fact, it states GSOC can choose not to report &quot;for any other reason not to be in the public interest&quot;.  That is expressly what Mr. Simon O'Brien said to the Oireachtas committee last week, that GSOC had the view that it would not be in the public interest to put it in the public domain by reporting its concerns to the Minister in respect of the surveillance incident that had taken place.<\/p><p> The Minister also referred tonight to the bogus 3G matter and attempted to play it down.  He said he had read the transcripts of the Oireachtas committee's proceedings last week.  If he had, he would have seen that Mr. Simon O'Brien stated there were British operatives with British mobile phones in the GSOC building at the time it was detected.  When asked who they were, he said they were the investigators for the English security firm it had brought over to investigate the problem.  When asked if it was possible that this false 3G device could have been activated to eavesdrop on their telephones, he confirmed that it was entirely plausible and possible.<\/p><p> The amendment tabled by the Minister states a retired High Court judge will investigate all matters of relevance to the initiation and outcome of the investigation commenced by GSOC on 7 October 2013.  Conveniently, that leaves the Minister, his reaction and handling of this fiasco out of the picture.  This must be included in the investigation also, as it goes to the heart of the clarity required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800051#YY00300","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392760200,"counter":516,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392760200,"counter":517,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 February 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
