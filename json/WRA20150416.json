Anyone ordinarily resident in the country is entitled, subject to certain charges, to receive public in-patient and out-patient hospital services. People who do not take out health insurance continue to have the same entitlement to services in the public hospital system<\/p>  <p>  Community rating, reflecting the principle of intergenerational solidarity, is a fundamental cornerstone of the health insurance system. This means that people who are old or sick do not have to pay more than the young and well.  Under community rating, the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid. Premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. <\/p>  <p>  For Community Rating to work we depend on adequate numbers of younger people taking out health insurance to help keep premium prices down for everybody. Lifetime Community Rating is being introduced to encourage people to take out health insurance at a younger age, thereby helping to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across society, to support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone who wishes to purchase insurance. It is a necessary measure to help support the viability of community rating within our system of health insurance. I have no intention of reconsidering the introduction of Lifetime Community Rating, as without it there will be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population, which in turn will contribute to claims inflation and higher insurance premiums for all.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth clarifying that those who do not wish to avail of private health insurance will not face a financial penalty.

At the end of December, 97% of clients over the age of 18 accessed treatment within one calendar month of assessment, and 100% of those under 18 received treatment within one week of assessment. There is much wider coverage of needle exchange services outside the Dublin area, with more than 130 community pharmacies recruited and trained.

The aim is to commence the GP service for under 6s and over 70s in the summer, with the Diabetes Cycle of Care commencing in Quarter 4 of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new arrangements, an additional 270,000 children under 6 will benefit from GP care free at the point of service.  All children under 6 will benefit from the new enhanced service under the proposed GP contract.  This will involve age-based preventive checks focused on health and wellbeing and the prevention of disease.  These assessments will be carried out when a child is aged 2 and again at age 5, in accordance with an agreed protocol.  <\/p>  <p>  The contract will also include an agreed cycle of care for children diagnosed with asthma, under which GPs will carry out an annual review of each child where the doctor has diagnosed asthma.  The asthma cycle of care will provide the key elements of best practice in the care of asthma with structured visits including education of child and parents, medicine and inhaler technique review and an individualised asthma plan for parents.  It will result in better quality of life for children, with resulting better health and wellbeing and less need to visit hospital.  The new expanded GP service will apply to all children aged under 6, including those who already have a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  The extension of GP care free at the point of service to everyone aged 70 or over and who does not currently qualify for this benefit will take effect at the same time as the under-6 service, subject to the enactment of the necessary legislation.  This service will benefit about 36,000 new patients.<\/p>  <p>  The Diabetes Cycle of Care will enable patients with a medical card or GP visit card and who have Type 2 Diabetes to avail of two annual visits to their GP practice for a structured review of their condition.  This initiative will help to integrate care across the continuum of care, will improve clinical outcomes for patients and reduce complications often experienced with this condition.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the HSE's 2015 National Service Plan has committed to a number of Chronic Disease Management initiatives as follows:<\/p>  <p>- It is planning to align the existing 10 primary care diabetes initiatives to the Diabetes Model of Care with the support of the Clinical Programme and augment existing podiatry services to deliver the model of care.<\/p>  <p>- It is also planning to undertake Chronic Disease Integration and Self Care Demonstrator Projects to provide proof of concept of integrating chronic disease services for Asthma, COPD and heart failure between Primary and Secondary Care, with particular focus on the education of practice nurses and local GPs.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a Memorandum of Understanding signed in February 2015 committed the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO to substantive negotiations on a new comprehensive GP contract.  A priority of these discussions, which have commenced, will be the inclusion of chronic disease management for patients over and above initiatives outlined above.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600055#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Expenditure","counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600056#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[14652\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600056#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the financial position of the Health Service Executive; his plans to introduce a supplementary estimate on foot of recent announcements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There are currently approximately 70,000 rent supplement recipients, for which Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015.<\/p><p>The Department recently published a review of the maximum rent limits, &quot;Maximum Rent Limit Analysis and Findings&quot; and it is available on <i>www.welfare.ie<\/i>.  The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students.  Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market.  The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation.<\/p><p>In light of the review&rsquo;s findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits if deemed appropriate.  In excess of 1,000 rent supplement recipients have received support through increased rent limits to date in order to retain their rented accommodation.<\/p><p>In addition, the Department in conjunction with Threshold operates a Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply is most acute.  The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance. <\/p><p>The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation.  The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy. <\/p><p>I am keeping this matter under close review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided for rent supplement recipients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600058#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600058#WRG00325"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[15018\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600058#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the eligibility criteria for the State pension (contributory) that applied pre-2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Therefore, with increased numbers of people living longer, it is important to ensure that those qualifying for State Pension (Contributory) have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for the State Pension (Contributory) prior to the reform measures of 2012 a person must have been aged 66 years or over, have started paying social insurance (at full or modified rate) before reaching age 56, and have a total of 260 full rate employment contributions paid where attaining pension age on or after  6 April 2002.  With effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State Pension (contributory) increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions. This provision was provided for a number of years earlier in the Social Welfare Act, 1997.  <\/p>  <p>  The rate at which a State Pension (Contributory) is paid at is determined by the average number of contributions paid or credited per year, with tiered rates applying in respect of bands of contributions.  For example, to qualify for the maximum personal rate, a person requires a yearly average of 48 or more contributions per year.  From September 2012, new rate bands for State Pension (Contributory) were introduced.  This resulted in one of bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions), being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Those with lower earnings and those with lesser contribution histories continue to obtain the best value for money from the Social Insurance Fund.  Even for those with an average of only 20 contributions per year (i.e. 38% of the maximum), the reduced rate State Pension (Contributory) of &euro;196 now paid is 85% of the maximum rate, and is higher than the full rate that applied in 2007.<\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State Pension (Contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State Pension (Non-Contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;219, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State Pension (Contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State Pension (Contributory).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600058#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":142,"content":"<p>Question No. 54 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600058#WRG00650"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[15021\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600058#WRG00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":145,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 10 March 2015, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600058#WRG00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":146,"content":"<p>Question No. 56 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to Work Family Dividend Scheme Administration","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600058#WRG00950"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[15023\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600058#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when payment under the back to work family dividend scheme will issue in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or\u00a0to the mortgage interest rates charged.\u00a0 It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.\u00a0 It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and\u00a0has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. <\/p>  <p>  As I have stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a former Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that in Ireland, as in most advanced economies,\u00a0it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants\u00a0when,\u00a0in fact, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there have been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may be entering a new and more competitive phase. <\/p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. Each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors such as cost of funds and commercial considerations (such as competition, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates).<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013\u00a0introduced changes to\u00a0Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which regulates fees and charges in order to attract new entrants to the Irish\u00a0banking sector. There is some evidence of\u00a0improvements in the\u00a0banking\u00a0sector with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business model.\u00a0 In the last 12 months there have been a number of new entrants to the Irish mortgage market bringing additional and welcome competition to this sector.<\/p>  <p>  I should add that myself and the Governor of the Central Bank meet regularly, the latest of these meetings took place on 2 April. Among the items discussed was the issue of mortgage interest rates.  The Governor provided an update on the ongoing work that he and his officials are carrying out on the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders.<\/p>  <p>  We noted that the SVRs charged in Ireland are higher than other euro area countries and have not fallen in line with ECB wholesale rates. The Central Bank will continue to research why this is the case and will publish results shortly.

Action against this illegal activity is, therefore, a priority for them, and they are implementing a wide-ranging programme of measures to tackle the problem. Key elements of this programme include the following.<\/p>  <p>  - A strengthened licensing regime for auto fuel traders was introduced with effect from September 2011, to limit the ability of fuel criminals to place laundered fuel on the market.<\/p>  <p>  - A new licensing regime for marked fuel traders was introduced in October 2012, to limit the scope for criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.<\/p>  <p>  - New requirements for the keeping by fuel traders of records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were brought in to ensure that data would be available to support supply chain analysis.<\/p>  <p>  - Following a significant investment in the necessary IT systems, new supply chain controls were initiated from January 2013. These require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns of their fuel transactions to Revenue, providing data that can be used to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions or patterns of fuel distribution. <\/p>  <p>  - Close cooperation, in the framework of the Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, with other enforcement authorities in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland, in combating the fuel fraud problem on an all-island basis.<\/p>  <p>  - The introduction from the start of this month of a new and more effective product for marking rebated fuels that was identified as a result of a joint process conducted with HM Revenue and Customs in the UK.  In addition, I have introduced a range of legislative measures in recent years to support Revenue in their work against fuel fraud, including reckless trading provisions that ensure that a mineral oil trader is liable for the mineral oil tax evaded where that trader knew, or was reckless as to whether or not, in making the supply or delivery of fuel, he or she was participating in a transaction or series of transactions connected to the evasion of that tax. In the Finance Act 2014, I introduced measures to further strengthen Revenue's ability to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where the trader does nor comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information.  Revenue's ongoing action against fuel fraud has yielded significant results. Since mid-2011, 136 filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions or for unlicensed trading, over 3 million litres of fuel have been seized and 31 oil laundries were detected and closed down. Industry sources report a much-reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market and increased road diesel consumption. Obviously other economic factors have contributed to this growth but reduced fraud is also an important factor.  I am advised also that the Revenue Commissioners have, since last summer, received reports from around the country of problems relating to petrol quality, and suggestions that these problems are attributable to petrol stretching. Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low-tax commodity to petrol, and the motive of the criminals who engage in this activity is to profit from the sale of the adulterated petrol, thereby defrauding motorists and the State.  Every filling station about which a complaint was made has been visited by Revenue enforcement officers and fuel samples taken from them have been sent to the State Laboratory for analysis. The scientific analysis required is complex and time-consuming, and the State laboratory has conducted an extensive series of tests and re-tests on the samples. Despite this extensive testing, evidence of the presence of prohibited stretching agents has been found in only two samples, both from one location. The conclusive results received from those tests led to the seizure of the product, and files are being prepared with a view to prosecution.  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results were received which indicated the presence of road diesel in several samples from a variety of locations. This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time. If the problems that have come to light were caused by unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed with petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved.

An Interdepartmental Committee is in place to review issues and the actions and timeframe required to tackle them. Many of these issues involve amending unsuitable and outmoded language and in some cases, archaic legal provisions, in existing legislation. Another key task which is underway involves examining how the important issue of Reasonable Accommodation can be achieved in a meaningful way within our Constitutional framework as interpreted by the Supreme Court. <\/p>  <p>  Progress towards ratification therefore continues to be made. One of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed is the enactment of capacity legislation. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the UN Convention. It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity.

Seven single in-patient rooms are reserved for  elective CF admissions for prophylactic antibiotic therapy (or other treatment as required), thus ensuring that adults with CF are rarely admitted as in-patients via the Emergency Department.

The &euro;74m now provided will consolidate and build on what has already been achieved. &euro;44m of this &euro;74m was provided to the NHSS to fund 1,600 more places under the Scheme.

Community first responder groups comprise this national network.  These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area.

Over 90 submissions from a wide range of organisations were received, some proposing legislative reform of a technical and complex nature.  <\/p><p>Issues raised included whether criminalising persons for the possession of small amounts of benzodiazepines is an effective response to the problem of abuse; striking a balance between proper oversight and minimising the disruption for patients; agreeing changes to the proforma prescription to be used for schedule 2, 3 and 4 part 1 controlled drugs; and addressing differences of opinion regarding the maximum duration of a benzodiazepine prescription and the total treatment period\/total quantity which may be dispensed.<\/p><p>Amendments to the Regulations were introduced in July and December 2014 to make provision for a number of issues which had been part of the consultation, including enabling authorised cannabis-based medicinal products to be used in Ireland. <\/p><p>While work continued on the remaining issues, including stricter controls on benzodiazepines, from the end of 2013 onwards, Departmental resources had to be reallocated to defending a constitutional challenge to section 2 (2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 under which Government may declare substances to be controlled, as well as making preparations for the introduction of emergency legislation in case this provision should be struck down.

We will also continue to address the humanitarian consequences of the conflict and provide urgent assistance and support to the civilian populations within Syria and neighbouring countries who have been displaced or suffered violations of their rights.  Syria has been discussed regularly at meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council.  At present, it is not on the agenda for the meeting on 20 April.  However, at the most recent meeting, in March, a strategy was adopted outlining how the EU and its Member States can counter the threat posed by ISIS and help restore peace and security in Syria and Iraq.  At the December meeting of the Council, the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan di Mistura, discussed measures to address the acute security and humanitarian situation, as well as possible steps to move towards a political process.  The protracted crisis in Syria and the region has resulted in immense humanitarian need.  More than 200,000 people have lost their lives, and there are now over 12.2 million people in need of immediate life-saving support within Syria.  Due to the violence and the lack of access to aid, 3.8 million people have left Syria for neighbouring countries.  The crisis has had a particularly devastating impact on civilians, as recent events in Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus show.  Ireland is particularly mindful of the impact of the crisis on neighbouring countries which are supporting large populations of vulnerable Syrian refugees.  We also remain gravely concerned about barriers to humanitarian access in Syria and have consistently advocated for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access and respect by all parties for International Humanitarian Law.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is the main donor in response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria, providing a total of &euro;3.6 billion since the outset of the conflict.  Ireland has played its part as one of the most generous international contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis, and has provided over &euro;32 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria since 2011, through UN partners, NGOs and the Red Cross.  At the recent UN Pledging Conference for Syria, which took place in Kuwait on 31 March, my colleague, Minister of State Sherlock, announced an additional pledge of &euro;12 million on behalf of the Irish government which will be used to provide lifesaving assistance to those in need in Syria and in neighbouring countries over the course of 2015.  This pledge will bring Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution to the Syria crisis to &euro;41 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600073#WRW01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Application Refusals","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600073#WRW01700"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[15121\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600073#WRW01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason one of the children of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 24 does not qualify for an Irish passport, while the child's parents and siblings are all Irish passport holders, in view of the fact that they were born here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This letter explained that the submitted application did not demonstrate their son&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship under section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended (the 1956 Act); the 1956 Act was amended in 2004 to stipulate that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>person&rsquo;s birth; and (iii) the submitted evidence of the mother&rsquo;s lawful residence in the State covered the period 12 April, 2006 to 4 January, 2009.  This fell short of the three year period as required by Section 6A of the 1956 Act.  On this basis, the applicant was not considered to be an Irish citizen and thus had no entitlement to a passport.<\/p><p>In a reply, dated 11 December, 2014, the parents referred to the fact that their three older children were all issued with Irish passports.  They accepted, however, that their son did not qualify for citizenship under section 6A of the 1956 Act.  Nonetheless, they were of the view that he was an Irish citizen by virtue of his birth and length of residence in the State.<\/p><p>These points, however, failed to demonstrate his entitlement to Irish citizenship for the following reasons:<\/p><p>the applicant&rsquo;s siblings were all born in Ireland before 1 January, 2005.  The 2004 amendment of the 1956 Act did not, therefore, apply to them.  Accordingly, they were all Irish citizens from birth; and (b) the lawful residence of the applicant in Ireland is relevant to an application for naturalisation.  No evidence has been presented to the Department to show that he is a naturalised citizen.<\/p><p>As the correspondence from the applicant&rsquo;s parents failed to establish his entitlement to Irish citizenship, the Department wrote to them on 29 December, 2014 to inform them that a passport had been refused to him.<\/p><p>It should be noted that this decision was taken on the basis that entitlement to Irish citizenship had not been proven under section 6A of the 1956 Act.  It may well be the case that such entitlement may exist under the naturalisation provisions of that Act.  The applicant&rsquo;s parents may, therefore, wish to pursue this matter with the Department of Justice and Equality which processes applications for this category of citizenship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600073#WRW01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":489,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600073#WRW02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":488,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600073#WRW02000"},{"type":"question","counter":489,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[15000\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600073#WRW02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of primary school classes which have 37 or more pupils; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":490,"content":"<p>Provisional results from the 2014\/2015 National School Annual Census show that there were 57 primary school classes in the State which had 37 or more pupils.

The work involved is now at an advanced stage and I anticipate that it will be completed shortly.  This work is focussed on identification of the liabilities with precision and accuracy, but as it has evolved it has been possible to estimate the likely aggregate liability for the purpose of the financial planning by Irish Water and the submission of forecast expenditure and liabilities to the Commission for Energy Regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600075#WRY00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Investigations","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600075#WRY00700"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[15097\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600075#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 501 of 25 November 2014, if he will place the relevant report on the record of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, in view of the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has decided not to pursue any issue within it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":528,"content":"<p>It is not my intention to make the internal investigation report relating to an independent Local Development Company available at this time, having regard in particular to the fact that the report references information given in confidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600075#WRY00900","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges Administration","counter":529,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600075#WRY01000"},{"type":"question","counter":530,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[15098\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015041600075#WRY01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the steps he will take with regard to home owners and tenants who do not pay their water charges bills; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":531,"content":"<p>Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2014 I announced a package of measures to ensure that domestic water charges are certain, affordable and clear.  If a customer does not pay their water charges, late payment provisions shall automatically apply, unless the customer enters into a payment plan.  In the case of a One Adult Household (capped at &euro;160), &euro;30 will be added to any bill where outstanding payments equate to the total annual payment and remain unpaid for 3 months or more.  An additional &euro;30 will be added on every anniversary of the original add on date while the bill remains unpaid or a payment plan has not been entered into with Irish Water.  In the case of a Two Adult Household (capped at &euro;260), &euro;60 will be added and again at each anniversary. <\/p>  <p>  The late payment charges will only apply where someone is in arrears for more than 12 months and has not entered into a payment plan with Irish Water.\u00a0 Payment plans will be developed based on an ability to pay and it is important to note that the late payment charges are focused on those who &ldquo;will not pay&rdquo;, rather than those who cannot pay.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A range of flexible payment options will be available.  Irish Water will facilitate bill payment through direct debit, electronic funds transfer, payment by cash at any retail outlet with a Paypoint or Payzone sign, or a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made.  The overall net cost for those who register is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others.
