The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved. In welcoming the outcome of last week&rsquo;s US Presidential election, I noted that the prospects for such reform would certainly appear to have advanced as a result of President Obama having won a second term. I can assure the Deputy that through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress will intensify even further over the coming weeks and months with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.<\/p><p>  I would add here that much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what such a deal might comprise.

His call for a ceasefire on the occasion of the <i>Eid al Adha<\/i>   festival had received broad support including that of key regional players such as Egypt, Turkey and Iran as well as the backing of the UN Security Council, only for the violence to re-ignite a few hours into the truce.<\/p><p>  Despite the <i>Eid<\/i>   truce setback, we continue to support Mr. Brahimi&#8217;s mission as there is clearly no other alternative available. I am greatly concerned by the dangers of further militarisation of the conflict and do not believe that proposals for external intervention of any sort are likely to help in any way to bring about a peaceful solution to the crisis. I fear such an intervention would only lead to an escalation of the fighting and casualties among civilian population and potentially risk spreading the conflict to the wider region. The priority must remain to secure an early ceasefire and get a political process under way. <\/p><p>  In order to compel the Assad regime to cease oppression and violence against its own people, the EU has adopted a series of severe sanctions, including at the last EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting, which are proving effective in increasing pressure on the Syrian authorities. Yet, to be truly effective, sanctions should include a global arm embargo to cut the flow of weapons and arms making their way to Syria. For that to happen, the international community and the UN Security Council in particular should live up to their responsibilities and act decisively through adoption of an appropriately strong Council Resolution.<\/p><p>  If a political solution to the crisis is to be successful, the Syrian opposition must do more to unite and agree on a workable programme towards political transition. So far the divisions between the internal and external opposition have only allowed Assad to maintain his no dialogue policy, arguing he doesn&#8217;t have a credible interlocutor. Ireland with its EU and global partners has been particularly anxious to ensure that the Syrian opposition overcomes its divisions and I hope the latest Conference in Doha will prove a turning point in gathering the entire democratic opposition under a single umbrella and with an agreed vision and programme of action on how they see Syria&#8217;s future.<\/p><p>  We also need to continue urgently addressing the critical humanitarian situation arising from the conflict which has resulted in over 300,000 people fleeing to neighbouring countries and more than 1.5 million people internally displaced. Ireland and the EU have contributed significantly to the international efforts led by the UN in providing relief and humanitarian aid with Ireland contributing some &#8364;2.45 million to date, including &#8364;1.6 million to ICRC, UNHCR and WHO and also an additional &#8364;200,000 to UNRWA for Palestinian refugees within Syria.<\/p><p>  Ireland and our EU and international partners will continue our strong support for all efforts to end the violence and suffering of the Syrian people and to promote the earliest possible political settlement and transition within Syria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400066#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400066#WRA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[50101\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400066#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide details of the discussion he had with the President of Malawi and the President of Mozambique; and if there will be any changes to the Irish Aid programme in these countries.","asker":"998","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>My colleague the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello, T.D., held bilateral meetings with the Presidents of Malawi and Mozambique on 16 October while he was in Brussels for the series of meetings and discussions organised by the Commission at the annual European Development Days event.

Since the end of the all-out civil war in 2003, progress has been made in establishing a democratic system of government in the DRC.  However, while much of the country has achieved a degree of stability, several localised conflicts have continued, in particular in the east of the country. These conflicts have in many cases been characterised by an appalling degree of brutality, with large-scale attacks on the civilian population and widespread sexual violence.  A large number of armed groups have based themselves in eastern DRC since the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, including Hutu extremists (FDLR) who fled Rwanda after taking part in the genocide, and Tutsi rebels (CNDP).  The situation is also further complicated and destabilised by the presence of followers of Joseph Kony and his so-called Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army who have moved across the borders form northern Uganda.<\/p><p>  The latest upsurge in violence has been triggered by a rebellion earlier this year by a group known as M23, which had previously been integrated into the DRC army.

I held wide-ranging and very positive discussions focussing on our bilateral relations and the potential for improved trade between our two countries. I also raised our candidature for the Human Rights Council.  All of the Ministers confirmed the very good bilateral relations between Ireland and Vietnam, and their desire, which I share, to further strengthen these.<\/p><p>  As well as completing a full schedule of meetings in Hanoi, I travelled to the province of Quang Tri in the centre of the country, to see the work of Irish Aid at first hand. I visited a number of projects, including a school and clinic in a remote area where the population belong mainly to an ethnic minority. A major focus of our work in Vietnam is with some of the poorest and most vulnerable ethnic minorities in the country, many of whom live in remote mountainous regions.  The work we support in Quang Tri province provides schooling, health care and basic rural infrastructure for these communities.<\/p><p>  I also saw the work of the Mines Advisory Group, which, with the support of Irish Aid, is helping clear the legacy of war in the province.  This area still contains a large amount of unexploded ordinance, particularly from undetonated cluster munitions. To date nearly 500 dangerous areas have been identified and over 400 emergency ordinance disposal response tasks have been carried out.  In view of the continuing need, I announced that Irish Aid will make a further &euro;600,000 available over three years to support the Mines Advisory Group&rsquo;s work in removing unexploded bombs from villages and farmland in Quang Tri and other heavily affected provinces.<\/p><p>  Vietnam is a country in transition, and, in addition to focusing on the needs of the poorest communities, Ireland is playing its part by providing economic expertise, and working to build stronger bilateral economic links.  A major focus of our trade promotion efforts is on the education sector. I attended a prize giving ceremony in Hanoi for a major national competition, co-sponsored by the Embassy and Enterprise Ireland, which helped raise awareness of Ireland as a destination for some of the many Vietnamese students studying overseas every year.<\/p><p>  I also hosted a networking lunch for key contacts in the education sector, which was attended by an Irish company which is helping to develop the secondary school system in Vietnam. I was Guest of Honour at a dinner hosted by ESB International to celebrate 25 years of its work in Vietnam. This provided an opportunity to showcase Ireland&rsquo;s achievements in the presence of the Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam, and brought together key contacts in the rapidly growing power generation and energy sector.<\/p><p>  I was very satisfied that our programme in Vietnam is delivering assistance where it is most needed. The current Country Strategy runs until 2015, and while subject to ongoing review and evaluation, I am satisfied that its overall focus remains appropriate.  I also believe that we are making real progress in building stronger economic links with Vietnam, which has made huge progress over the past 25 years, with the potential to become a key economic partner for Ireland.

This includes the recent indiscriminate bomb attack in Manama city which resulted in the deaths of two foreign workers.<\/p><p>  I have noted the recent decision by the Bahraini Government to ban protests, which I fear is likely  only to further increase tensions.  The way to address the concerns of those who engage in peaceful protest and demonstrations is through dialogue and consultation.  National dialogue is urgently needed in Bahrain.  In all our contacts with the Bahraini authorities, including those which have taken place in the period since the ban on protests was announced, we have emphasised the need to launch a process of reconciliation.  I believe this would be very much in the interests of Bahraini society as a whole.<\/p><p>  The Bahraini authorities have committed themselves to implementing the recommendations of the Bahraini Independent Commission of Inquiry report.  While I acknowledge that Bahrain has implemented some of the reforms recommended by the Commission, I believe that renewed impetus in implementing the BICI recommendations is necessary. This would help create an environment conducive to reconciliation and dialogue and enable reform and change to take place as a result of a consultative process.<\/p><p>  I am greatly concerned by the decision of the Bahraini Government to revoke the citizenship of 31 activists, including former members of parliament.  This renders some of those concerned stateless and deprives them of their most basic rights.  I believe that this decision will serve only to deepen divisions and tensions in Bahraini society.  I understand that the decision can be appealed through the judicial system and I hope that the individuals concerned will avail of this option and seek to have this decision reviewed and hopefully overturned.  I strongly encourage the Bahraini authorities to pursue reconciliation through a genuine process of dialogue and reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400067#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400067#WRB02200"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[50192\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400067#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to review the Diplomatic Service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>I keep the operation of the Diplomatic Service under constant review in order to ensure that the service my Department provides to Irish citizens, the Oireachtas and other stakeholders continues to meet the high standards they have come to expect.

The President&rsquo;s visit to Brazil, and the accompanying trade mission, offered a valuable opportunity to raise Ireland&rsquo;s profile in this high growth economy, which is a priority market in the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy.  Some 42 Irish businesses and third-level education institutions took part in the trade mission, spanning a wide range of sectors including telecommunications, financial services, and engineering services. Representatives of the State Agencies &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and Bord Bia &ndash; also participated.<\/p><p>  The President and Minister Costello met with Irish companies and their Brazilian partners and witnessed the signings of significant contracts in the commercial and education sectors.  Two Irish companies opened new facilities, substantial new export contracts were secured by participating companies, and six Memoranda of Understanding were signed between leading Irish and Brazilian Universities and Institutions of Technology.  Another key event was the launch of the participation of Irish third-level institutions in a Brazilian scholarship programme that focuses on Science and Technology.  Under this programme, we look forward to up to 4,000 Brazilian students studying in Ireland at undergraduate level over the next four years, as well as up to 1,500 post-graduate students.<\/p><p>  The President and Minister had a very positive meeting with Brazil&rsquo;s President Dilma Rousseff during which they discussed the growing bilateral relationship, in particular as regards trade and education, as well as international developments.

Tackling the effects of the financial crisis will remain an important challenge for the Union, but the focus must now shift to creating the conditions for economic recovery and job creation. Delivery on concrete initiatives, building on the Compact for Jobs and Growth is a core objective of our Presidency. During the next six months as Presidency, Ireland will also work to make progress on measures aimed at strengthening internal and external trade.  A strong emphasis will be attached to enhancing the EU&rsquo;s trade links with the third countries to facilitate and increase EU exports, and to boost levels of Foreign Direct Investment into the EU.<\/p><p>  Ireland will host an informal Ministerial meeting during its Presidency focussed on EU-US trade and we hope to advance a mandate for EU-US trade negotiations.  Within the EU, the Presidency will work intensively to better equip the single market to deal with rapidly growing sectors of the economy, including the digital economy.  Ireland will work across a number of Councils during its Presidency to advance dossiers to stimulate growth in the digital economy in areas ranging from Cyber security, to e-Identification, and from Data Protection and to high-speed broadband rollout.  Ireland will also host the annual Digital Assembly in June 2013.     Fighting unemployment, and particularly youth unemployment, will also be a major priority of the Presidency and will be the main focus of a meeting of Employment and Social Affairs Ministers in Dublin next February.  The Minister for Education and Skills has also made the promotion of greater access to skills and training a major priority including through reaching agreement on the &ldquo;Erasmus for All&rdquo; programme.<\/p><p>  Ireland will make sure that we use our Presidency to identify and stimulate areas of the economy that have the potential to deliver sustainable future growth and smarter jobs.  For this reason the Presidency will work to make progress on reaching agreement on the EU&rsquo;s Horizon 2020 framework programme for research and innovation.  A further priority will be sharpening European competitiveness by working to complete the European Research Area.  A number of conferences will be held during the Presidency in the innovation area, aimed at ensuring broader participation, including by SMEs, in the Union&rsquo;s future research funding schemes.  But Europe&rsquo;s economy can only grow and develop if there is stability and consumer, business and investor confidence grows.  The Presidency will work to restore stability by managing the effective implementation of the EU&rsquo;s economic governance measures, and in particular the European Semester process.  This, combined with existing EU programmes including the European 2020 Strategy, provides a blueprint for economic reform and growth.  The Presidency will also work intensively to restore confidence to the EU&rsquo;s financial services sector through building agreement on the Banking Union proposals.  <\/p><p>  I look forward to the Irish Presidency programme being published later this year. Throughout November members of the Government will continue to meet with EU partners and with several delegations from the European Parliament for discussions in preparation for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400068#WRC00800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[44571\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400068#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the cost to the State of hosting the Presidency of the EU.","asker":"954","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[50177\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400068#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the budget for the Irish Presidency of the EU Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.<\/p><p>  An overarching focus of the Government in planning for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union during the first half of 2013 is to run an efficient and cost-effective Presidency.  The Government decided in December 2011 to allocate a budget in the order of &euro;60m over 2012 and 2013 to resource the Presidency, which excludes security costs.

Short-term benefits include significant stimulus for the local economy from an influx of up to 15,000 delegates, press and representatives of NGOs who will use local services including hotels, restaurants, taxis etc. over the six month Presidency period.

The Strategy builds on Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding relationship with Africa, based on political support and the Irish people&rsquo;s commitment to working to end poverty and hunger in some of the poorest countries on the continent. It explicitly recognises the role which greater economic and trade cooperation can make to relations between Ireland and Africa, and to development in Africa.  The second Africa Ireland Economic Forum was held in Dublin on 22 October 2012.  It was attended by over 250 people, including representatives from 160 Irish companies as well as officials and business representatives from 25 African countries. The theme of the Forum was &ldquo;Building on Success&rdquo; and participants heard from a wide range of Irish businesses who have successfully engaged in the African Market. I addressed the Forum and held discussions with many of those present, from Ireland and from Africa.  I am confident that the Forum and the work of my Department and our Embassies abroad are giving added impetus to the development of trade and investment between Ireland and Africa.<\/p><p>  A recent study by Barclays Bank of 200 companies in Ireland has found that some 91% of respondents believe that there is untapped potential for Ireland in Africa. These findings echo the reports from our eleven Embassies in Africa which all report increased interest in bilateral trade between Ireland and Africa. I visited a number of African countries earlier this year and was impressed by the rapid pace of change at a political and economic level and the strong entrepreneurial spirit that I witnessed.  We will continue to pursue a strong trade promotion agenda in key growth markets across Africa in the coming months. This week the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello T.D., is travelling on trade promotion business to South Africa and Nigeria, two markets where Irish exports increased in 2011 by 9% and 40% respectively. He will also travel with officials from Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia on the first ever trade focussed visit from Ireland to Ghana. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400068#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Catalan Self-determination","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400068#WRC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[50093\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400068#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"in view of the increased support for Catalan self-determination, if he supports the right of the Catalan people to self-determination within the European Union.","asker":"1066","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>It is a matter for the people of any country of the European Union to establish the arrangements for their own democratic governance and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that process in any one country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400068#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Neutrality","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400068#WRC01750"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[48507\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400068#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when the Programme for Government commitment to discontinue the use of Shannon Airport by the United States military will be implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p><font color=\"#212100\">No commitment has been made in the Programme for Government to discontinue the use of Shannon Airport by the United States military.

The EU High Representative, Cathy Ashton, has led negotiations for the E3+3 group (UK, France, Germany, US, Russia and China) with Iran at three negotiating sessions this year, as well as a number of ancillary meetings.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the EU, along with its other partners, is doing everything it can to encourage Iran to change its course and to negotiate seriously so as to address the major concerns existing regarding its nuclear programme.   Regrettably, this has included the necessity to impose several rounds of EU sanctions.   A further round of sanctions was agreed at the Foreign Affairs Council in October. <\/p><p>  The E3+3 have shown both great patience and creativity in seeking every avenue for agreement. I believe that there are those in Iran who also wish to reach agreement.   However, the regime as a whole has thus far regrettably failed to respond and engage in serious negotiation.  I very much hope that they will do so soon.   Following the US election, it is likely that a fourth round of talks may be convened in the next few months.   But if Iran shows no willingness to negotiate, further meetings are likely to serve little purpose.  Ireland has shared the widespread international concerns about the nature of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme.  These concerns are felt most strongly by other states in the region, not confined to Israel alone.  There can be no doubt that this issue has increased instability and could even conceivably lead to conflict in an already very troubled region.<\/p><p>  Israel in particular has stated clearly that it considers itself actively under threat from Iran.   It points to statements about Israel by Iranian leaders, Iran&rsquo;s supplying of rockets to militant groups who use them to attack Israeli civilians, and alleged Iranian involvement in terrorism against Israelis in other countries.   Israel has stated that it will not accept Iran developing a nuclear weapon, and is prepared to use military force to prevent this.  I am aware that both Israeli and Iranian leaders have sometimes used directly threatening language, for either domestic or external effect.   I have made clear our view that an attempt by any country to resolve this issue by military means could be hugely destabilising in the Middle East and lead to unknown consequences.<\/p><p>  I will continue, as I have always done, to advocate strongly that the issues arising in connection with Iran&rsquo;s nuclear activities can only be resolved through diplomatic negotiations and not by any other means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400068#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400069#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":83,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[50193\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400069#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to establish a greater diplomatic presence in Asia and Africa, particularly due to the trade remit of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":84,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network includes 56 Embassies, 7 multilateral Missions and 10 Consulates General and other offices overseas.

I emphasised that we were working to ensure that the fight against hunger, which is a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, featured strongly in our Presidency programme. <\/p><p>  The main development cooperation priority of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency will be to ensure that the EU engages actively and coherently in the September 2013 Special Event on the Millennium Development Goals, to be held at the UN in New York.  The UN Special Event will consider the progress to date on the Millennium Development Goals and will be an opportunity for world leaders debate for the first time the shape of the post-2015 global development framework.

Any decision to adjust the State&rsquo;s external representation by closing, opening or relocating missions must be made having regard to clear national priorities and available resources and on the basis of an anticipated and ongoing significant return for the State.    Our diplomatic and consular missions abroad perform a wide range of functions in pursuit of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy interests, such as: representing and advancing government policies with other States and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; trade, economic and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities and harnessing the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries. While these functions do not apply equally to all missions - missions to international organisations, for example, have no direct trade promotion functions &ndash; and the priority assigned to each function in specific countries is not constant, Ireland&rsquo;s economic and political interests abroad are best advanced by optimal allocation to all these functions of the overall resources available. This allocation must, as I have said, reflect national priorities, available resources and anticipated and ongoing return to the State.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy covers both established Irish markets in North America and in the European Union and emerging and high growth markets on other continents where our economic engagement is at a lower level but has strong growth potential.

I am familiar with the competing claims on resources of established versus emerging markets. The Chief Executive Office of the Irish Exporters Association is a member of the Export Trade Council.  In this context and more generally, my Department engages actively with the IEA.

This Presidency will also coincide with the 40th   anniversary of Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the European Union. <\/p><p>  As in the past, our overriding objective will be to demonstrate that Ireland is a strong supporter of the European project and a committed member that is capable of contributing to progress on the EU&rsquo;s wide agenda.  Next year we will follow the guiding principle that governed our six previous Presidencies by seeking to deliver an efficient, impartial and results-driven Presidency. My ministerial colleagues and I look forward to working closely with our counterparts in Council and the European institutions to deliver concrete initiatives and real added value for all the citizens of the Union. We will adopt a constructive and pragmatic approach to these engagements during our Presidency. I know that this House will follow a similar example in its relations with other national parliaments.<\/p><p>  The Lisbon Treaty recognises the contribution of national parliaments to the good functioning of the EU through their scrutiny of draft legislative acts, including checking for compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, and through their participation in inter-parliamentary co-operation between national parliaments and the European Parliament. This is facilitated by all member state national parliaments having at least one representative based in Brussels. <\/p><p>  There is an established trend, particularly since the Lisbon Treaty, for national parliaments of the country holding the Presidency to host a number of interparliamentary conferences as part of the &ldquo;parliamentary dimension&rdquo; of the Presidency. For example, the Houses of the Oireachtas will host eight such meetings from January to June 2013, including the Conference of Speakers of EU National Parliaments, Conference of EU Affairs Committees of National Parliaments, Interparliamentary Conference on CFSP\/CSDP and the Interparliamentary Conferences of Sectoral Committee Chairs.<\/p><p>  2013 will also mark the European Year of citizens. During our Presidency we will work across all Council formations to make progress on a range of policy and legislation that better serves the needs of citizens across the EU.  <\/p><p>  The Government also sees the need to raise awareness of the wide range of rights we enjoy as EU citizens and to encourage greater engagement by citizens in the EU decision-making process, particularly as the Union takes further steps towards closer integration. Coinciding as it does with the 40th anniversary of our accession to the EEC, the European Year of Citizens also provides the opportunity for public reflection here in Ireland on four decades of EU membership. <\/p><p>  To this end, the Government is planning a range of events for next year under the broad rubric of Communicating Europe. We intend to hold a public event in early January, a Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue, to mark the launch of the European Year of Citizens. This will provide a forum for a representative cross-section of citizens to voice their views, with participation by senior political figures both at national and European level. A number of similar meetings are planned in other Member States. We also intend to hold a series of regional Town Hall meetings as well as a conference in Dublin during Europe Week in May 2013 on the broad theme of the EU and the citizen. The overall aim will be to encourage grassroots citizen engagement in EU affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400069#WRD01200","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"United Nations Resolutions","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400069#WRD01250"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[50106\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400069#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will support the upcoming UN resolution on Observer State status for Palestine, which is likely to occur this month; and if he has discussed this resolution with other EU States.","asker":"1022","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>It is expected that the UN General Assembly may be asked to vote, perhaps as early as this month, on a resolution to admit Palestine as an &lsquo;Observer State&rsquo; at the UN.

The fighting broke out when the authorities attempted to arrest militants alleged to have captured and tortured Omran Shaaban, the rebel fighter credited with Gaddafi&rsquo;s capture.  Given the large number of people killed -- many of them civilians -- during the fighting and the widespread damage to the city, it is very important that there be a thorough investigation by the Libyan authorities into the events that took place and that, where clear evidence of criminal activity or serious human rights offences is discovered, those responsible are held to account.     A degree of stability has now been restored and the residents have begun to return to their homes. Basic services are returning to close to normal levels, and schools are beginning to re-open after the fighting.  The UN has provided teams to help assess the humanitarian needs in Bani Walid and to assist the Libyan authorities in clearing munitions. The Libyan authorities have also pledged to provide financial support to residents to re-build their homes damaged during the fighting. <\/p><p>The violence in Bani Walid was indicative of the serious security challenges facing the Libyan Government.  The new Libyan government led by Prime Minister Zidan, which took office last week, faces a momentous challenge in imposing its authority on the myriad of militias vying for power  .  Militants seized control of the parliament building only days after the new Cabinet was approved in protest at the inclusion of some Ministers with links to Gaddafi.  The first priority for the new government should be to restore the rule of law and to improve the security situation.  <\/p><p>I met with the then Libyan Foreign Minister during the UN General Assembly.   He briefed me on the steps being taken to disarm the militias and to integrate the militias into a national army. There is no doubt that Libya faces a long and what will no doubt often prove a difficult road towards building democratic and legitimate state institutions.   I believe, however, that it will overcome these challenges.  Ireland, along with its EU partners, stands ready to provide assistance to the Libyan authorities in all relevant spheres, including security sector reform, capacity-building and public administration and the promotion of human rights.  The EU is also continuing to consult with the Libyan authorities about the possibility of launching a   civilian CSDP mission to help the Libyan authorities improve border security. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400069#WRD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illegal Israeli Settlements","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400069#WRD01850"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[50190\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400069#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he is satisfied with EU action regarding the implementation of measures to stop illegal Israeli settlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>I have stated previously in the House that I believe that Israel&rsquo;s policy of relentless settlement expansion is now the major obstacle to achieving peace in the Middle East.

Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.<\/p><p>  Ireland supports the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses, including supporting the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures and Mandate Holders and the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council.  At the UN, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situations in a number of countries from all regions.  Ireland is fully associated with these statements.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to the promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards.  Active participation in multilateral organisations including the EU, UN and the Council of Europe provides an opportunity for Ireland to voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses.  Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for violation of human rights.  Ireland will continue to use these mechanisms as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400071#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Peace Process","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400071#WRF00850"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[50465\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400071#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will indicate the extent to which he continues at EU and UN level to focus attention on the ongoing situation in the Middle East with particular reference to addressing the complaints on all sides in their respective areas of concern, whether a particular permanent structure exists whereby ongoing grievances can be dealt with; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[50466\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400071#WRF00950","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which attention continues to be focused at international level in the matter of achieving progress on the Palestinian Israeli issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.<\/p><p>  With regard to the prospects for on Palestinian-Israeli issues, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question 7 (50191\/12) earlier today.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the question of a permanent structure, I would refer him to my reply to him in response to Question 70 (45233\/12) on 17 October, which included the following:  &ldquo;I do not think there is any lack of a forum for the parties to express their grievances, rather the opposite.

Although it is difficult to gain reliable statistics and information on human rights abuses in Iran, there are a number of reputable and thorough sources and reports, such as the reports of the UN Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran, through which governments can monitor the human rights situation in Iran. It is clear from these sources that the deterioration of the human rights situation in Iran continues to be a grave concern.<\/p><p>  The Iranian authorities continue to deny civil and political rights in Iran, including in relation to freedom of expression and assembly, arbitrary arrest, and torture and other cruel treatment in detention. This highly targeted repression has been particularly stringent against not only academics but also members of Iran&rsquo;s religious and ethnic minorities, political activists, journalists and bloggers, human rights defenders and members of the legal profession in Iran who represent clients detained by the authorities. These actions are in clear violation of Iran's international obligations under the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, of which Iran is a signatory. I would also condemn the ongoing detention under house arrest of the two leading opposition politicians, Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who contested the 2009 presidential election against President Ahmadinejad.<\/p><p>  Ireland will co-sponsor a General Assembly resolution, due to be voted on later this month, expressing the international community&rsquo;s deep concern at the human rights situation in Iran, and calling upon the Government of Iran to take a number of specific and urgent steps to improve the situation, including ending the harassment, intimidation and persecution of among others students and academics. The Resolution also calls upon the Government of Iran to provide unfettered access for the Special Rapporteur to carry out his mandate. On March 22 this year, Ireland co-sponsored the UN Human Rights Council&rsquo;s Resolution on Iran, which welcomed the report and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran and expressed serious concern at the developments noted in that report, as well as the lack of access permitted to the Special Rapporteur. <\/p><p>  The EU has also repeatedly raised human rights issues in contacts with the Iranian authorities and adopted a travel ban and asset freeze against those responsible for grave human rights violations in April last year, further extended to additional persons last October. This sends an important political signal to those in the judicial system and elsewhere in the Iranian regime who perpetrate human rights abuses. I fully support the strong Conclusions on human rights in Iran issued by the Foreign Affairs Council in October last year. Ireland will continue to be active at EU level in pressing for stronger EU action in relation to the human rights situation in Iran. <\/p><p>  At a bilateral level, my Department engages in ongoing dialogue with the Iranian Ambassador and his Embassy on these issues. My officials regularly hold meetings with the Ambassador to convey our grave concerns at the human rights situation in Iran. Ireland will continue to raise human rights in Iran, bilaterally and at the EU and UN, at all appropriate occasions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400072#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400072#WRG00450"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[50468\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400072#WRG00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which he continues to galvanise support for the alleviation of starvation, strife and famine in the horn of Africa; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>One year on from the devastating famine and food crisis which killed tens of thousands of people across the Horn of Africa, the humanitarian situation across much of the region remains extremely fragile.  While a huge relief effort, followed by good rains last autumn, saved hundreds of thousands of lives, the crisis forced many more from their homes, devastated their livelihoods and left them vulnerable to future hunger shocks.   In many areas, the tentative progress made thus far risks being undermined by further external shocks, such as another poor rainy season or a later than usual harvest.  <\/p><p>  Gripped by drought and racked by conflict for over twenty years, Somalia was the epicentre of last year&rsquo;s crisis and in late 2012, remains by far the worst-affected country in the region.  The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s visit to Mogadishu this summer, one of very few by senior international politicians in recent times, brought into sharp focus the continuing and critical nature of the humanitarian situation. The T&aacute;naiste highlighted the need for sustained and properly targeted assistance to what remains, recent media attention notwithstanding, one of the world&rsquo;s most significant &lsquo;forgotten emergencies&rsquo;. The visit also underlined Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to continuing to support progress towards peace and stability in Somalia and to supporting development and resilience-focused programmes, whilst continuing to meet humanitarian needs.  Indeed, and as the T&aacute;naiste underlined in his own recent speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, the visit reinforced the Government&rsquo;s ongoing determination to work closely with our partners in the UN at EU level to highlight forgotten crises and the needs of fragile states, such as Somalia.  <\/p><p>  In terms of direct humanitarian funding and assistance to date in 2012, Ireland has provided just under &euro;6 million in emergency funding to address the humanitarian needs caused by the ongoing insecurity and food crisis in Somalia.  Elsewhere in the Horn of Africa, Ireland has provided a further &euro;1.3 million in humanitarian assistance to partners operating in Ethiopia as well as some &euro;900,000 in support for agencies providing direct relief to drought-affected communities in Kenya.   <\/p><p>  In addition to this humanitarian assistance, Ireland also maintains a major bilateral development programme with Ethiopia, one of the countries most affected by last year&rsquo;s crisis and where chronic food insecurity remains a major issue.   This is the rationale behind Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing support for the Productive Safety Nets Programme, which provides money or food to some of the poorest people in that country, in return for participation in a public works scheme which benefits local communities.  Building on lessons learned from Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing support for this and other similar initiatives, the Government will, in the months and years to come, continue to increase its focus on helping people to become more self-reliant and less dependent on humanitarian aid.  <\/p><p>  Finally at international level, the Government remains actively involved in pushing for humanitarian and relief efforts in the Horn to be closely tied to work to build the resilience of vulnerable communities across the region.  We will continue to champion these efforts in the context of our forthcoming EU Presidency in the first half of 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400072#WRG00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":155,"content":"<p>Question No. 68 answered with Question No. 66.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400072#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[50470\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400072#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which any progress has been made in the matter of undocumented Irish in the US; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>I am hopeful that the outcome of last week&rsquo;s US Presidential election will advance the prospects for the necessary reform of US immigration systems and procedures that would help improve the situation of undocumented Irish immigrants in the United States.

the OSCE&rsquo;s predecessor. The Office for Free Elections was renamed as the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) in 1992 and ODIHR&rsquo;s role in comprehensive election monitoring has been enhanced over the years, notably at the Istanbul Summit in 1999. <\/p><p>  In 1997, a Cooperation Agreement on election activities was concluded between the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA) and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), reflecting a desire to avoid overlap, redundancy, unnecessary expense and confusion between the two OSCE institutions. The 1997 Cooperation Agreement provides inter alia for exchange of information, participation by the Parliamentary Assembly in Needs Assessment Missions, common briefings and de-briefings and logistical support to Parliamentary Assembly short-term observers.  In accordance with the Cooperation Agreement, the OSCE Chairman-in-Office may designate a political figure as a Special Coordinator to lead the short-term OSCE observer mission. This political figure should normally be the President of the PA or an OSCE PA senior official recommended by the PA in consultation with the Chairman-in-Office. Among the key duties of the Special Coordinator is to deliver the preliminary post-election statement, in conjunction with other relevant figures.<\/p><p>  The Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions is normally issued at a press conference on the day after an election, and is based on the work of the entire Election Observation Mission (EOM), including both the long-term and short-term observation components. While the OSCE PA has reserved the right to issue its own independent statement after elections, the usual practice in recent years has been for joint statements, reflecting not only the views of ODIHR and the OSCE PA but often including other election observation bodies, such as the European Parliament (EP), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) or the NATO Parliamentary Assembly (NATO PA).<\/p><p>  At the request of the Ukrainian Government, an OSCE\/ODIHR EOM was deployed to observe the Parliamentary Elections in Ukraine, which took place on 28 October 2012. The EOM opened in Kiev on 12 September, led by Ambassador Audrey Glover of the United Kingdom. It consisted of a 20-member core team of experts from 14 OSCE participating States, 90 long-term observers and 600 short-term observers requested from OSCE participating States.  <\/p><p>  On 10 August 2012, in line with the Cooperation Agreement and at the request of the President of the OSCE PA, I appointed Ms Walburga Habsburg Douglas of Sweden, Vice President of the OSCE PA and Head of the OSCE PA delegation, as Special Coordinator. Her function, as indicated above, was to lead the short-term OSCE observer mission and deliver the Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions. The appointment of a Special Coordinator was in line with the practice for all other EOMs during the Irish Chairmanship of the OSCE, and recent practice during previous Chairmanships.<\/p><p>  The Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions issued on 29 October found that the Ukrainian parliamentary elections were characterised by a lack of a level playing field and that certain aspects of the pre-election period constituted a step backwards compared with recent national elections. The campaign environment was assessed as not fair overall by 22 of the 45 OSCE\/ODIHR EOM long-term observer teams. While election-day was assessed to be calm and peaceful overall, and voting and counting were assessed mostly positively, the tabulation process was assessed negatively, as it lacked transparency.  In the Post-Election Interim Report issued by ODIHR on 9 November, it is reported that tabulation was negatively assessed in 77 of the 161 District Election Commissions (DECs) and that approximately 25 DECs observed in the days after the election experienced serious problems with tabulation due to irregularities and other issues.  The OSCE\/ODIHR is expected to issue a comprehensive final report, including recommendations for potential improvements, in the coming weeks. <\/p><p>  The 14-page Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions was agreed by the OSCE\/ODIHR, the OSCE PA, the EP, PACE and the NATO PA, the result of a common endeavour involving 802 observers from 42 countries, observing at 2,521 polling stations. I note that many other bodies also deployed smaller teams to observe the elections, including the European Academy for Election Observation (EAEO).  While I am unable to comment on the individual assessments made by other organisations or their methodology, I can confirm that I have the fullest confidence in the election observation methodology used by OSCE\/ODIHR, which is widely recognised as the gold standard in election observation activities and is consistent with the UN Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation and the related Code of Conduct for International Election Observers.<\/p><p>  As regards the attempt by Ms Walburga Habsburg Douglas to visit Yulia Tymoshenko, leader of a political party which gained significant representation in the recent elections, this was a decision in which the Irish Chairmanship was not involved. Nevertheless, following the refusal to grant access to Ms Tymoshenko, I was in contact with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Kostyantyn Hryshchenko, to outline my concern at the cancellation of visiting rights. I am not aware of any involvement by Ambassador Glover or the OSCE\/ODIHR Core Team in the attempt to visit Ms Tymoshenko.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400072#WRG01800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Election Monitoring Missions","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[50478\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the recent statement made by the Attorney General of Texas who stated that overseas election monitors from agencies such as the OSCE were liable to be arrested in the State of Texas in the pursuit of their duties; if he will outline, even at this stage, the results of the OSCE observation mission to the USA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1030","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":173,"content":"<p>At the invitation of the United States Government, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) deployed a Limited Election Observation Mission (LEOM) for the General Elections of 6 November.

The role of the LEOM, as with all election observation missions, was to assess the elections for their compliance with OSCE commitments and other international standards for democratic elections, as well as national legislation.  As a participating State in the OSCE, the United States has committed itself to conducting elections in line with OSCE standards and inviting international election observers.  ODIHR has assessed elections in the United States on five previous occasions, since 2002.  Observers followed campaign activities, the work of the election administration and relevant federal and state institutions, implementation of the legislative framework, and the resolution of election disputes. <\/p><p>  The mission met with representatives from relevant federal and state authorities and political parties, as well as with candidates, and with representatives from the judiciary, civil society and the media.  As part of the observation, the LEOM conducted comprehensive monitoring of the media.

However, Mission members visited a number of polling stations across the country to follow election-day procedures.<\/p><p>  On 23 October, in an open letter to Ambassador Everts, the Attorney General of Texas, Greg Abbott, stated that OSCE representatives were not authorised by Texas law to enter a polling place.  He indicated that it might be a criminal offence for OSCE representatives to maintain a presence within 100 feet of a polling place in Texas and that failure to comply with these requirements could subject the OSCE&rsquo;s representative to criminal prosecution for violating state law. <\/p><p>  On 24 October, the Director of ODIHR, Ambassador Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, expressed his grave concern over the threat of criminal prosecution of OSCE\/ODIHR election observers.  The ODIHR Director wrote to United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, noting that the threat of criminal sanctions against OSCE\/ODIHR observers was unacceptable and that the United States, like all countries in the OSCE, had an obligation to invite ODIHR observers to observe its elections.  He stressed that any concerns or reports that the election observers intended to influence or interfere with the election process were groundless, underlining that OSCE\/ODIHR election observers adhered to all national laws and regulations, as well as a strict code of conduct. <\/p><p>  A Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions of the LEOM was issued on 7 November.  It noted that election observation in the United States was regulated by State law, which generally did not provide for international observers, as was required by paragraph 8 of the 1990 OSCE Copenhagen Document.  It further noted that OSCE\/ODIHR observers were not provided with full and unimpeded access to polling stations in several States, including Texas, and that observers were publicly threatened with criminal sanctions if they entered polling stations.  This was in contravention of paragraphs 8 and 10 of the 1990 Copenhagen Document.<\/p><p>  More generally, the Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions assessed that the elections took place in a pluralistic environment and were administered in a professional manner.  Election day was calm and although most voters were generally able to cast their vote without difficulty, there were reported instances of long queues and shortages in polling station staff.  Overall, the elections enjoyed the trust of the majority of stake-holders, although shortcomings were identified in areas such as voting rights, accuracy of voter lists, campaign finance transparency and recount procedure.  It was also reported that decisions on technical aspects of the electoral process were often unduly politicised, and the absence of a federal election management body with oversight responsibility was noted.  A final report on the observation of the entire electoral process will be published in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA) also deployed a short-term observer mission to the general elections in the United States, led by Jo&atilde;o Soares of Portugal, whom I appointed as Special Coordinator for the short-term observer mission.  The OSCE PA deployed a total of 100 observers in Washington D.C. and four of the 50 federal States.  In its preliminary post-election statement, the OSCE PA lauded the professionalism of the election authorities, while pointing to capacity problems at some polling stations.  After a generally peaceful but highly polarised campaign, voters were given a genuine opportunity to make an informed choice.  The OSCE PA expressed particular concern about the role of unlimited private campaign financing and the decentralised and highly diverse electoral system, which continues to lack country-wide standards, creating vulnerabilities in the system.  The OSCE PA will issue its final report on the elections at its Bureau meeting on 5 December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRH00300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRH00350"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[50540\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRH00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of bodies that have been abolished or amalgamated by his Department out of the list of bodies listed in the Public Service Reform document of 17 November 2011; the savings or cost of this in 2012; the projected savings or cost of this programme in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":176,"content":"<p>A decision on the future of DEAC will be made in the near future when the Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid is finalised.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Promotions","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRH00550"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[50977\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of promotions made in his Department to principal officer higher scale, principal officer standard scale, assistant principal officer higher scale, assistant principal officer standard scale, higher executive officer scale, executive office scale and staff officer scale; the total for all of his Department; if he will provide a breakdown for for 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":179,"content":"<p>Promotions in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been relatively few since the introduction of the moratorium by the Government with effect from 27 March 2009, with any exceptions requiring the specific approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

This was reflected in the report on Economic and Monetary Union prepared by the Presidents of the European Council, the Commission, the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank. A complete banking union is understood to combine a single supervisory structure, a single rulebook, a common deposit protection and a single bank resolution mechanism. The Interim report on the Future of the Economic and Monetary Union from the President of the Council was discussed at the European Council on 18\/19 October. Discussions are continuing in relation to proposals on a Single Supervisory Mechanism and the associated regulation amending the European Banking Authority Regulation, the Bank recovery and resolution proposal, the recast of the deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive and the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive (CRD IV).   The issues raised by the Deputy refer primarily to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive. I attended the ECOFIN Council meetings on 9 October and 13 November. At both of these meetings the Cypriot Presidency gave an update on the progress thus far in the negotiations with the European Parliament on the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive (CRD IV). The two proposals set out to amend and replace the existing capital requirement directives by two new legislative instruments: a regulation establishing prudential requirements that institutions need to respect, and a directive governing, amongst other things, access to deposit-taking activities.<\/p><p>  They are aimed at transposing into EU law an international agreement approved by the G-20 in November 2010. The Basel III agreement, concluded by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, aims to strengthen bank capital requirements, introduces a mandatory capital conservation buffer and a discretionary countercyclical buffer, and foresees a framework for new regulatory requirements on liquidity and leverage. While the proposed regulation and directive contain references to the issue of bank remuneration, the issue of bank bonuses was not discussed at the recent ECOFIN meetings. <\/p><p>  In tandem with this, the conclusions of the Heads of State or Government at the European Council on 18\/19 October called for the rapid conclusion of the single rule book, including agreement on the proposals on bank capital requirements (CRD IV) by the end of the year. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Liikanen Report was published on 2 October 2012 and my Department has received a copy of the Report and is carefully considering the Recommendations of the Liikanen Group, which includes a number of recommendations on banks&rsquo; remuneration schemes including bonuses. The European Commission is currently conducting a public consultation and a legislative initiative is not anticipated before spring of next year. A legislative initiative would likely be accompanied by a regulatory impact analysis and further consultation period. <\/p><p>  I look forward to seeing the results of the public consultation currently underway.  We will need to examine the outcome of this process and the impact of any forthcoming legislative proposals on our recovering banking system.  <\/p><p>  Ireland broadly supports the EU&rsquo;s regulatory initiatives to bring greater stability to the banking sector. We agree that the EU banking sector should be capable of meeting the needs of and supporting EU economies and societies. I hope that our efforts in this regard will convert a safe and stable banking system into one that also supports growth in the real economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[42653\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the recommendations of the Fiscal\u00a0Council should be implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[45673\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has received the recommendations of the Fiscal Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 96 together. <\/p><p>  In line with normal practice, the Fiscal Council forwarded its September 2012 Fiscal Assessment Report to me just before its publication. The Fiscal Council&rsquo;s analysis and recommendations were considered in my Department&rsquo;s preparation of its updated economic and fiscal projections, which will be published this month in the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement (MTFS).<\/p><p>  The Council believes that it would be prudent for the Government to implement more consolidation than currently planned so as to achieve a deficit of 1.9% of GDP in 2015. This would require &euro;1.9 billion in additional consolidation over what is set out in the SPU for the period 2014-2015 but would result in a significantly improved debt trajectory. The Fiscal Council suggested that there be no additional consolidation in 2012, but further consolidation of &euro;0.4 billion in 2014 and &euro;1.5 billion in 2015. The Council suggests that this could provide additional fiscal sustainability, by front-loading the consolidation necessary to meet the General Government Deficit target of 3% by 2015.<\/p><p>  While the Fiscal Council suggests that it would be prudent to undertake additional consolidation in 2014 and 2015, it states that the additional adjustment is not recommended lightly given the existing pressures on domestic demand and the high burden of unemployment. <\/p><p>  The Government is very conscious of the potential impact additional consolidation could have on economic activity. In striving to restore sustainability to the public finances, it is necessary to also be mindful of protecting the emerging economic recovery and seek to strike the right balance between the two. This balancing act is difficult but the Government view is that a reasonable balance has been achieved. The consolidation completed to date has been achieved with remarkable social cohesion, and the adjustment path is supported by the European Commission, ECB and IMF. The fact that the Council sees Ireland achieving its deficit targets on the basis of the already committed adjustments reinforces this view in that regard. However, we will continue to closely monitor economic developments and will take the measures necessary to meet our targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ01650"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[44105\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has met the members of the Fiscal Council recently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[47227\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if officials from his Department have met with members of the Fiscal Council recently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[49612\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has met the Fiscal Council or members thereof recently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 98 and 105 together.<\/p><p>The following table details recent meetings between the Department of Finance and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Minister\/Officials<\/th><th>Date of Meeting <\/th><th>Nature of Meeting<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Finance Officials<\/td><td>Tuesday, 23rd October 2012 <\/td><td>To discuss methodological issues related to the Departments forecasting approach<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Minister Noonan and 2 Finance Officials<\/td><td>Thursday, 25th October 2012<\/td><td>General fiscal discussion<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finance Officials<\/td><td>Tuesday, 6th November 2012<\/td><td>To discuss practices &amp; procedures required in order to set up IFAC on a statutory basis<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, officials from my Department are in regular contact with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council in relation to various matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ02050"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[44101\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if\u00a0the\u00a0reports that the draft EU agenda for the October Council\u00a0meeting contain proposals for tighter binding contracts for Eurozone countries\u00a0expanding control of national economic policies are correct; his policy in relation to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>Arising from the Four Presidents&rsquo; Paper on the Economic and Monetary Union was released in June, an interim report was presented by President Van Rompuy to the October European Council.

President Van Rompuy received a mandate, together with his colleagues, to explore the proposals further and to present a specific roadmap for the achievement of a genuine Economic and Monetary Union at the December 13-14 European Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":233,"content":"<p>Question No. 96 answered with Question No. 93.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":234,"content":"<p>Question No. 97 answered with Question No. 91.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":236,"content":"<p>Question No. 98 answered with Question No. 94.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":237,"content":"<p>Question No. 99 answered with Question No. 85.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRK00350"},{"type":"question","counter":239,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[47361\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of bi-lateral meetings he has held with Mr Mario Draghi since 1 January 2012.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":240,"content":"<p>Since January 2012, I have held two individual meetings with Mr Mario Draghi.

The maximum allowable pension fund at retirement for tax purposes (the Standard Fund Threshold) has already been significantly reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 from over &euro;5.4 million to &euro;2.3 million while the annual earnings cap which operates in conjunction with age-related percentage limits to determine the annual amount of tax-relievable contributions that can be made by an employee or individual to pension savings has been reduced from over &euro;275,000 in 2008 to its current level of &euro;115,000 per annum. The level and design of these thresholds and caps are, for example, among the range of issues for consideration relevant to achieving the commitment referred to.  The National Pensions Framework, which was published by the previous Government in March 2010, included among other things, proposals to introduce a new pension system involving auto-enrolment for employees without supplementary pension coverage. The system proposed in the Framework would be introduced when the prevailing economic circumstances allowed. The Framework proposed the introduction of a State contribution equivalent to 33% tax relief in respect of employees covered by auto-enrolment. This equivalent relief would also replace the current standard and marginal rates of tax relief for existing contributors to pension saving. I would expect that the report of the independent review of long term pension policy in Ireland, currently being conducted by the OECD on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, may also deal with the issue of an auto-enrolment pension system.<\/p><p>  The debate around the incentive regime for pension saving has tended to focus either on a further reduction in the maximum allowable pension fund for tax purposes at retirement or on a reduction in the rate of tax relief on pension contributions. These approaches are not, of course, mutually exclusive.  In my 2012 Budget speech in December last, I said that I did not propose to make changes to the existing marginal rate relief at that time but that the incentive regime for supplementary pension provision will have to be reformed to make the system sustainable and more equitable over the long term. I said that my Department and the Revenue Commissioners would work with the various stakeholders in the next year to develop workable solutions. On foot of this, a broad informal consultation was undertaken this year across a spectrum of stakeholders in the pensions sector to establish their views on further changes to the incentive regime for pension saving.<\/p><p>  I will give due consideration to the views of all interested parties in the pensions sector in the context of any proposals I may make to Government regarding the incentive regime for pension saving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Promotions","counter":263,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[50976\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of promotions made in his Department to principal officer higher scale, principal officer standard scale, assistant principal officer higher scale, assistant principal officer standard scale, higher executive officer scale, executive office scale and staff officer scale; the total for all of his Department; if he will provide a breakdown for for 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>Since my appointment as Minister for Finance on 9 March 2011, 24 staff members who were serving as Administrative Officer (AO) and Higher Executive Officer (HEO) have been awarded promotions through an internal competitive process to Assistant Principal Higher level.  8 staff members, serving as Assistant Principal (AP) have been awarded promotions through an internal competitive process to Principal Higher (PO) level.<\/p><p>  6 staff members serving as Executive Officer (EO) have been awarded promotions through an internal competitive process to Higher Executive Officer.<\/p><p>  10 staff members serving as Staff Officer (SO) and Clerical Officer (CO) have been awarded promotions through an internal competitive process to Executive Officer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRL00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[44959\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will intervene in the school bus service that is provided by CI&Eacute; and that has been withdrawn from the parents and school children from the Lucan area, County Dublin, who attend a school (details supplied), while at the same time the service remains in place for families from nearby Celbridge, County Kildare, and in view of the very close proximity of the Celbridge route to Lucan and the fact that so many Lucan families are being discommoded by losing this established school bus service, if he will engage with CI&Eacute; with a view to having the Lucan bus service re-established; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":268,"content":"<p>Under the terms of my Department's School Transport Scheme a minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus &Eacute;ireann, are required before consideration may be given to the retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits.<\/p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport schemes on behalf of my Department, has advised that as the above criteria was not met for the 2011\/12 school the service was withdrawn.

I wish to advise the Deputy that SNAs are not allocated to individual pupils.  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupils' disability categorisation.  SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<\/p><p>  As such, the specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of SNA hours allocated to children with autism in Co. Donegal is not quantifiable, as the level of SNA support provided per pupil is not designated on the basis of disability categorisation, nor is there a set limited allocation of hours per pupils, once an allocation has been made to a school, and where care needs can vary over time.<\/p><p>  I can advise the Deputy, however, that all schools have been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocations for the current school year. Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to each school, including schools in County Donegal, are available at www.ncse.ie and are detailed on a per County basis.<\/p><p>  In addition, in relation to the availability of placements, I wish to explain that my Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs.  In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism.  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports.  Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and\/or care assistance.  Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required.  Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs\/strengths\/abilities emerge.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 540 special classes for children with autism have been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.  Twenty five such special classes are provided in Donegal.  Thirteen new special schools for children with autism were also granted official recognition in 2010.  However, as children with autism may also attend mainstream classes in primary and post primary schools, there are not a set number of places specifically designated for children with autism in Co. Donegal. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Conservation","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRM01050"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[50425\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRM01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to require all schools in receipt of capitation funding to implement targeted energy efficiency programmes to cut wasteful usage of lighting, heating and electronic equipment, considering that existing voluntary and piecemeal projects show the potential to save 15 &ndash; 40% of schools&rsquo; energy costs within two years at most, using models and guidance provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland which are unknown to most schools; his views on whether such energy efficiencies could save up to &euro;15 million a year of the &euro;200 million cost of capitation funding, thereby making cuts that do not hurt in place of cuts to vital educational services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>For the past 15 years the Planning and Building Unit of my Department have been using a process called the DART approach to develop sustainability and energy efficiency in educational buildings.

The 2012 current allocation for the bodies was &euro;7.7 million, compared to an outturn of over &euro;13 million in 2008.  Staffing in NQAI, HETAC and FETAC has reduced from 110 to 80 over the same period.  As well as the more general savings arising from organisational efficiencies, specific savings relating to accommodation and staffing arise from the amalgamation.  The amalgamating agencies were located in four separate locations and this has been reduced to two.  This has realised annual rent savings of approximately &euro;400,000 in a full year.  In addition, the reduction in the number of CEOs has resulted in savings of approximately &euro;250,000 per year from 2011 onwards.  It is estimated that the costs arising from the amalgamation in 2012 will be approximately &euro;1.8 million, split evenly between accommodation costs and the integration of ICT infrastructure.

The deal has led Dawn Meats to invest &#8364;14.5 million in a new purpose built, state of the art, beef processing facility in Carroll&#8217;s Cross, County Waterford, creating 65 new jobs. This investment was also supported by Enterprise Ireland.  Other recent Enterprise Ireland initiatives include the fact that 12 companies have been approved for Graduate Placement, 5 Community Enterprise Centres have been approved for funding to appoint full-time business development managers and there has been a high take-up of the Enterprise Ireland Innovation Voucher scheme in Waterford.  Another recent Enterprise Ireland initiative has been the establishment of a <i>'New Frontiers Programme' <\/i>  in both Carlow and Waterford Institutes of Technology, designed to support entrepreneurs (primarily in the technology and export-focused sectors) in the development of their business plans.  There are 20 participants now on this programme.<\/p><p>  The two local County Enterprise boards, in the city and county, have created a significant number of new jobs and the South East Regional Authority has secured EU funding for a number of enterprise and innovation-focussed projects.<\/p><p>  FAS training services having provided training for over 5,000 people and that Agency is also undertaking a wide range of other training initiatives.  Several tourist initiatives are underway in the region and Science Foundation Ireland has funded 8 research awards to Waterford Institute of Technology.<\/p><p>  Other developments include the first phase of the &#8364;23 million Belview Strategic Water Supply Scheme which was officially opened earlier this year.  This will facilitate industrial development and job creation in Kilkenny and the South East.  The total investment for this phase of the scheme is &#8364;13m. <\/p><p>  I will continue to pursue ongoing co-operation and collaboration between all the various stakeholders across the South East region to pursue the Action Plan recommendations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Promotions","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRN01950"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[50979\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRN02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of promotions made in his Department to principal officer higher scale, principal officer standard scale, assistant principal officer higher scale, assistant principal officer standard scale, higher executive officer scale, executive office scale and staff officer scale; the total for all of his Department; if he will provide a breakdown for for 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":348,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy with regard to my Department is set out in tabular format.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Promotion Grade<\/div><\/th><th><div>2009<\/div><\/th><th><div>2010<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011<\/div><\/th><th><div>2012 to date<\/div><\/th><th><div>Total 2009-2012 to date<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Executive Officer<\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><td><div><\/div><\/td><td><div><\/div><\/td><td><div><\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officer<\/td><td><div><\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div><\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal, Standard Scale<\/td><td><div><\/div><\/td><td><div><\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Principal Officer, Standard Scale<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div><\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><td><div>21<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRN02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRN02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gender Recognition","counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRN02150"},{"type":"question","counter":350,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[50227\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to introduce gender recognition legislation in order to comply with obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":351,"content":"<p>The Gender Recognition Advisory Group (GRAG) was established in 2010 to advise the Government on the legislation required to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transgender persons.

Therefore, the Social Welfare and Pension Bill will not include any special provisions regarding public servants who took early retirement<\/p><p>  In relation to State pension which is within my remit, as the Deputy will be aware, the State pension is a very valuable benefit and therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. <\/p><p>  Recent changes to the rate bands payable for State Pension is one element of pension reform put in place to put State pension provision on a more sustainable footing. <\/p><p>  Prior to the rate band changes on 1 September 2012,  a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions.  This was not equitable.  On 1 September 2012, additional rates bands for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) were introduced and while the maximum rate  and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year remains unchanged, those who have fewer than 40 contributions per year will receive a lower rate of pension.  The change to State pension rate bands means that pension payments will be more closely related to PRSI payments made over a working life.  This ensures that those who contribute more during their working life will benefit more in retirement, thereby ensuring equity in the social welfare system.  These changes apply universally for claimants with an eligibility date post 1 September 2012. <\/p><p>  This change to rate bands moves somewhat closer to a total contribution approach, where benefits are paid in proportion to contributions made, i.e. those who pay more, benefit more.  It is proposed to adopt a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; to State pension to replace the current averaging system from 2020.  This will replace the current system and remove the associated anomalies whereby those who pay less could in fact receive a higher payment.  Under this system, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  <\/p><p>  If claimants have an income need they may, following a means test, qualify for a higher rate on the State pension (non-contributory). <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRP00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRP00550"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[50345\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of participants by county currently on community employment schemes; if she will consider creating extra placements for CE schemes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":392,"content":"<p><table><tr><th>County\/Area<\/th><th><div>12\/11\/2012<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 1<\/td><td><div>570<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 2<\/td><td><div>392<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 3<\/td><td><div>173<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 4<\/td><td><div>52<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 5<\/td><td><div>224<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 6<\/td><td><div>53<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 7<\/td><td><div>149<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 8<\/td><td><div>581<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 9<\/td><td><div>214<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 10<\/td><td><div>238<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 11<\/td><td><div>403<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 12<\/td><td><div>307<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 13<\/td><td><div>49<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 15<\/td><td><div>335<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 16<\/td><td><div>54<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 17<\/td><td><div>404<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 18<\/td><td><div>16<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 20<\/td><td><div>36<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 22<\/td><td><div>288<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 24<\/td><td><div>470<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin West<\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire\/Rathdown<\/td><td><div>359<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin North County\/Fingal<\/td><td><div>294<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td><div>626<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td><div>417<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td><div>646<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td><div>210<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td><div>762<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td><div>339<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td><div>319<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td><div>395<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary (South Riding)<\/td><td><div>550<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford City<\/td><td><div>431<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford County<\/td><td><div>273<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td><div>847<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td><div>299<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td><div>290<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td><div>357<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td><div>344<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td><div>534<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td><div>1,087<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County<\/td><td><div>1,017<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td><div>971<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td><div>571<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick City<\/td><td><div>623<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick County<\/td><td><div>535<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary (North Riding)<\/td><td><div>390<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway City<\/td><td><div>311<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway County<\/td><td><div>1,136<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td><div>741<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td><div>1,117<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td><div>181<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td><div>390<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL<\/td><td><div>22,384<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The Department is committed to reforming CE to ensure delivery of service, value for money and the progression of the individual.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children.  Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births.  While Budget 2012 maintained this additional monthly payment, the multiple births grant of &euro;635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age was discontinued.<\/p><p>  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty.  The Government is also conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment.  Bearing this in mind, any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to child benefit payment rates changes.<\/p><p>  The issue of the extra costs associated with multiple births and the additional assistance provided to these families was considered in the context of a Department of Social Protection value for money review on child income support payments, published in 2010.  The review found that there is an absence of current data regarding the actual difference in costs between families of multiple birth children and other families of equal size.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children.  In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.  The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area.  Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":448,"content":"<p>Question No. 176 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRR01950"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[50455\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRR02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 3","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":451,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 20th December 2011.

The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately &euro;1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.  The second Action Plan, approved by Government this week, provides a progress report on delivery of the national energy efficiency objectives and shows that Ireland is on track to deliver the 20% energy savings target by 2020.  The Plan will also set out a range of energy saving actions in the public sector, which will be prioritised between now and 2020.<\/p><p>  The public sector is estimated to spend more than &euro;500 million per annum on energy.  Achieving the 33% savings target for the public sector would save &euro;150 million each year in expenditure.  This Government remains firmly committed to meeting this target.  In order to underpin delivery of the national energy savings target, my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is working together to establish a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system whereby all energy usage in the Public Sector will be accounted for and progress will be systematically recorded.  I recently wrote to the head of each of the public bodies, reminding them of their obligation to report annually their energy usage to SEAI.  Enclosed with each letter was the SEAI report: &lsquo;Energy Use in the Public Sector&rsquo;, which outlines savings achieved to date across the public sector to end-2010 amount to 650 GWh.<\/p><p>  This year SEAI has targeted the top 135 public bodies, which account for over 95% of public sector energy consumption.  These organisations will submit detailed energy and activity data to SEAI.  From this data detailed progress scorecards will be produced for each organisation.  From 2013 on, an SEAI online energy data system will facilitate all public bodies and schools to report detailed energy data and allow SEAI to prepare detailed scorecards for all public bodies.<\/p><p>  Since 2009, my Department through SEAI has supported over 140 public sector retrofit projects.  This year the Better Energy Workplaces 2012 Fund has offered support to 145 projects &ndash; 44 of which are in the public sector.  This scheme has developed public sector and market competence and capacity for pay-as-you-save type models.  I recently approved the formation of an action group to develop a framework for energy performance contracting, which will stimulate mass scale retrofitting projects across the public sector.  This has been complemented by the Government decision to require all public sector bodies to go out to the market for energy services if their energy spend is more than &euro;500,000 per year.  The energy performance contracting framework will allow public bodies to implement projects whilst, most importantly, not relying on additional public expenditure to do so, thus not impacting on their capital budgets whilst also reducing their operating costs.<\/p><p>  Through all of the measures outlined including NEEAP, comprehensive monitoring and reporting of energy use in the public sector, Better Energy Workplaces and the energy performance contracting framework, the exemplary role of the public sector will   stimulate investment in energy efficient technologies and the development of a market for energy services and products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRT01100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Offshore Exploration","counter":492,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRT01150"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[50437\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 638 and 640, if he will detail all exploration and appraisal efforts that have been conducted in the geographical area known as the Corrib gas field; the proposals for further exploration in this area; if there are further finds or enhancements of oil or gas assets, will the Irish State find itself in the same revenue sharing position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":494,"content":"<p>The Corrib Gas field was discovered in 1996 under Frontier Exploration Licence 3\/94 which was granted in March 1994 and surrendered in June of this year.

The most significant benefits to be gained from a merger of the DHDA with DCC are the synergies created from a closer relationship between the DHDA and the range of disciplines and skills available within the DCC.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Government also announced further proposed mergers, which include provision for the Ordnance Survey of Ireland to merge with the Valuation Office and Property Registration Authority by the end of 2013.

Medium term savings are likely to be achievable in the areas of common back office functions such as HR, conventional (non-specialised) IT systems, Financial Management and Corporate Services.  There may also be potential savings in the areas of accommodation and software licences. In the longer term, more efficiencies\/synergies in delivery of the merged organisation&rsquo;s services may lead to further savings in operational areas.  Additional commercial revenues which would reduce the burden on the State may also be achievable in the medium to long term.

The LGMA also takes on the residual functions from An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, which has been dissolved as of 1 November 2012.   The Limerick Regeneration Agencies were dissolved on 31 July and their functions taken over by the Office for Regeneration which has been established in Limerick City. The Regeneration Office has been set up with administrative support from Limerick City Council and reports directly to the new City\/County Manager. The abolition of the two regeneration agencies, when combined with the merger of the two Limerick local authorities, resulted in three county manager level posts being replaced by one - the new Limerick City and County manager.

It rationalises the functions of the National Building Agency (NBA), the Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP) and the Centre for Housing Research (CHR). The AHP and the CHR have been closed down and the NBA ceased operating in June 2011.  Comhar (Sustainable Development Council) was discontinued at the end of 2011 and its sustainable development role has been integrated into the work of the National Economic and Social Council (NESC).

Details of the bodies involved are set out in Appendices IIa and IIb of the Plan which can be found at: http:\/\/reformplan.per.gov.ie\/files\/2012\/01\/Public-Service-Reform-28112011.pdf.<\/p><p>  On 31 October 2012, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, announced an update in relation to the programme of rationalisation of State bodies.<\/p><p>  While these rationalisations will deliver savings to the taxpayer, the real benefits lie in the simplification of the administrative landscape, thereby ensuring greater accountability, less duplication of effort and more transparent lines of responsibility of public servants. It is not possible at this time to specify anticipated savings on an individual State body basis. However, the Public Service Reform Plan indicated that across the public service as a whole, savings of 20 million euro in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money are envisaged from the rationalisation programme.<\/p><p>  With regard to State bodies under the aegis of my own Department, the bodies which are to be rationalised, amalgamated or abolished in 2012 are:<\/p><p>Equality Tribunal (Rationalise the industrial relations\/employee rights institutions - Labour Court, Labour Relations Commission, Employee Appeals Tribunal, National Employment Rights Authority and Equality Tribunal into single agency). This overall rationalisation of industrial relations institutions is being lead by my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The General Scheme of a Bill to provide for this measure has been approved by Government. Our two Departments have agreed that administrative responsibility for the Tribunal will transfer to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation from 1 January 2013.<\/p><p>Equality Authority, Human Rights Commission (Merge to form new Human Rights and Equality Commission). I published the General Scheme of a Bill to replace the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission with a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission on 5 June 2012. The Bill is currently being drafted and it is intended to have the legislation in place early next year. In parallel, arrangements are being made to select members of the new Commission. This is being handled by an independent Selection Panel set up for that purpose. Advertisements inviting applications were published last Sunday, with a deadline of 29 November for submission of applications. The successful applicants will be appointed to the two existing bodies, pending enactment of the necessary legislation to effect the merger. This will ensure that the two organisations can start to operate as a cohesive whole, with a transition programme being prepared and put in place, that the board(s) can commence preparing a Strategic Plan for the new body and that work can be taken forward rapidly on the staffing review envisaged in the Working Group report.<\/p><p>  With regard to those bodies under the aegis of my Department, subject to critical review, and which recommend proceeding with the measure (i.e. to be achieved by end 2013), these are as follows: <\/p><p>Forensic Science Laboratory: The Forensic Science Laboratory is to be brought within the ambit of the State Laboratory. No savings or costs are likely to arise in 2012. A working group is to be established to develop and work through areas of savings and future synergies.<\/p><p>Prison Visiting Committees (Reduce or merge Visiting Committees as there is now a Prison Inspectorate). The Government has approved the drafting of a General Scheme of an Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, which will include provisions to make Visiting Committees more effective, while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities. A link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons. As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the role of the Inspector of Prisons. Under the proposed arrangements, it is my intention that Visiting Committees would be able to report any urgent or major matter to the Inspector at any time. Subject to competing legislative priorities, it is expected that the General Scheme will be published by the end of the year. When work on preparation of the General Scheme has been completed, I will be seeking Government approval for its publication to facilitate a consultation process in advance of drafting and publication of the Bill.<\/p><p>Property Registration Authority (Merger the Valuation Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority). Following the Government approval of the recommendation of the Critical Review on this proposal that a merger should proceed, work is commencing to advance this proposal.<\/p><p>Reception and Integration Agency, Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and Refugee Appeals Tribunal (Rationalise various Refugee Structures). Consolidation of refugee structures will be addressed through the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill. The Bill will provide for the Office of the Refugee Applications Commission (ORAC) to be subsumed into INIS - the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.

The 2 Field Artillery Regiment based in McKee Barracks are also relocating as part of this process.<\/p><p>  Pending the full rollout of the reorganisation plan it is not possible to say how many personnel can be facilitated though the reassignment process.  However, there is no question of families being moved or being required to move arising from the reorganisation and this is a matter for each individual to decide.  The reality is that many Defence Forces personnel currently assigned to McKee barracks are not resident in Dublin and commute on a daily basis, which is a common feature across both the public and private sector of a modern, flexible and mobile working population in Ireland today. The reassignments have in fact offered the opportunity for many personnel currently based in McKee Barracks to move to locations which are more favourable to their personal circumstances. In this regard 42 personnel across all ranks up to Commandant are taking the opportunity to relocate on a voluntary basis. <\/p><p>  It is important to restate that the reassignment, promotion and appeals processes are still ongoing and that the numbers of personnel to be mandatorily reassigned remains fluid at this point making it impossible to give final definitive figures at this juncture. <\/p><p>  All members of the Defence Forces reassigned under the Defence Forces Reorganisation Plan 2012 are entitled to Change of Station Allowance in circumstances where they meet the qualifying criteria.  The Defence Forces Personnel Support Service has a representative in every Barrack or Installation to which personnel are being reassigned and these individuals are in a position, using both internal and external resources to provide the necessary supports to the redeploying personnel and their families if applicable, as was previously provided during recent Barrack closures and redeployments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRV02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[50536\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of bodies that have been abolished or amalgamated by his Department out of the list of bodies listed in the Public Service Reform document of 17 November 2011; the savings or cost of this in 2012; the projected savings or cost of this programme in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>The Civil Defence Board is the only body under the aegis of my Department which was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished.

I expect the abolition of quotas to facilitate an expansion in the sector and through the Food Harvest 2020 Report the industry has set itself an ambitious target for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020. For my part I have been working on a number of fronts to prepare the industry for the move to a quota free environment.<\/p><p>  More than 85% of Irish dairy production is exported, and the price of milk in Ireland is ultimately determined by global demand and supply. In that regard I have been endeavouring to  raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector in third country markets, for example through trade visits to the US and China, and also through ongoing engagement with potential purchasers of Irish dairy products, at both political and official level. <\/p><p>  A key element of this market strategy is to optimise the already positive green image of Ireland in order to create a point of differentiation for Irish dairy products on international markets. In this context, stakeholders are at present engaged, through Bord Bia, in technical discussions to establish a dairy sustainability and quality scheme, while at processing level, Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green Programme is providing a vehicle for industry to commit itself to sustainability targets by reducing energy inputs, minimising overall carbon footprint and mitigating the impact on the environment. This pro-active approach to environmental sustainability has a strong resonance with procurement strategists in the many multi-national food companies who are interested in using Ireland as a source of high quality food ingredients and processed products. <\/p><p>  Of course the industry itself has a responsibility to focus its efforts on market and product development.  Supported by Government, the Irish dairy sector has succeeded in positioning itself as a major international player, and in recent months we have seen industry announcements in relation to the development of supply arrangements between Irish companies and multi-national players in third countries, and the development of value added products which can maximise the value of our dairy output. <\/p><p>  At farm level my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has been working,  through research activities and through the Dairy Efficiency Programme, to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to reduce costs on farm and improve efficiency, in order to better equip farmers to deal with volatility in dairy markets. In this context I am confident that following quota abolition, co-ops and their members will develop the kind of robust contractual arrangements which will secure supply into the future. <\/p><p>  Underpinning all of this, I will continue to negotiate strongly to ensure that the post 2013 CAP continues to provide effective support for Irish farmers and that a market supports will remain in place to provide an adequate safety net to protect against the worst extremes of price volatility.  <\/p><p>  Taking all this into account, I am confident that the collaborative efforts of Government, the processing industry and the producers will ensure a thriving and sustainable dairy sector that can use the opportunity afforded by the abolition of quotas to fully leverage the natural advantage of Ireland&rsquo;s grass-based production system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRW01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commonage Division","counter":590,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRW01950"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[50445\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400073#WRW02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the assistance available from his Department to farmers with rights to commonage lands (details supplied) in County Kerry that are been over grazed and overstocked by other farmers with no rights.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":592,"content":"<p>It is the responsibility of each farmer who has commonage shares to ensure that these commonages are grazed in such a manner that they are kept in Good Agricultural Environmental Condition (GAEC).

This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to facilitate the use of mediation in family disputes in order to speed up the legal process, reduce costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings. On foot of the Government decision, the Family Support Agency established a transition project team to transfer 45 individuals, or 24.29 WTEs, in some 16 locations throughout the country and an annual allocation of almost &euro;3m to the Legal Aid Board.

In relation to the Opticians Board, a Working Group was established in 2010 to provide legislatively for the subsumation of the Opticians Board into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council. It is expected it will be end 2012 before the draft heads are available for Ministerial approval as part of the Health Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2012. With regard to the National Cancer Registry Board, with the ongoing changes to the structures of the HSE, I consider that it would not at this stage be appropriate to subsume the Registry into the National Cancer Control Programme. <\/p><p>  Progress on the candidates for critical review in the Public Health Reform document such as the Mental Health Commission and HIQA will be contingent on other factors such as the creation of a Patient Safety Authority and in the case of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and Health Insurance Authority, in the context of the move to Universal Health Insurance. I am considering the precise future role of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in light of the overall governance structures required for the effective running of the new children's hospital and the project to build it. With regard to PHECC, I have decided that it should continue to operate in its present form for a further period and the matter will be kept under review with a view to proceeding with the integration with CORU when it is operationally ready to assume the functions involved, which is expected to be 4 or 5 years.<\/p><p>  The extent of savings will vary between organisations and the majority of staff will be redeployed to other public service bodies, as was the case with the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery.

This was reflected in the report on Economic and Monetary Union prepared by the Presidents of the European Council, the Commission, the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank. A complete banking union is understood to combine a single supervisory structure, a single rulebook, a common deposit protection and a single bank resolution mechanism. The Interim report on the Future of the Economic and Monetary Union from the President of the Council was discussed at the European Council on 18\/19 October. Discussions are continuing in relation to proposals on a Single Supervisory Mechanism and the associated regulation amending the European Banking Authority Regulation, the Bank recovery and resolution proposal, the recast of the deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive and the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive (CRD IV).   The issues raised by the Deputy refer primarily to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive. I attended the ECOFIN Council meetings on 9 October and 13 November. At both of these meetings the Cypriot Presidency gave an update on the progress thus far in the negotiations with the European Parliament on the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive (CRD IV). The two proposals set out to amend and replace the existing capital requirement directives by two new legislative instruments: a regulation establishing prudential requirements that institutions need to respect, and a directive governing, amongst other things, access to deposit-taking activities.<\/p><p>  They are aimed at transposing into EU law an international agreement approved by the G-20 in November 2010. The Basel III agreement, concluded by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, aims to strengthen bank capital requirements, introduces a mandatory capital conservation buffer and a discretionary countercyclical buffer, and foresees a framework for new regulatory requirements on liquidity and leverage. While the proposed regulation and directive contain references to the issue of bank remuneration, the issue of bank bonuses was not discussed at the recent ECOFIN meetings. <\/p><p>  In tandem with this, the conclusions of the Heads of State or Government at the European Council on 18\/19 October called for the rapid conclusion of the single rule book, including agreement on the proposals on bank capital requirements (CRD IV) by the end of the year. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Liikanen Report was published on 2 October 2012 and my Department has received a copy of the Report and is carefully considering the Recommendations of the Liikanen Group, which includes a number of recommendations on banks&rsquo; remuneration schemes including bonuses. The European Commission is currently conducting a public consultation and a legislative initiative is not anticipated before spring of next year. A legislative initiative would likely be accompanied by a regulatory impact analysis and further consultation period. <\/p><p>  I look forward to seeing the results of the public consultation currently underway.  We will need to examine the outcome of this process and the impact of any forthcoming legislative proposals on our recovering banking system.  <\/p><p>  Ireland broadly supports the EU&rsquo;s regulatory initiatives to bring greater stability to the banking sector. We agree that the EU banking sector should be capable of meeting the needs of and supporting EU economies and societies. I hope that our efforts in this regard will convert a safe and stable banking system into one that also supports growth in the real economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400074#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":778,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400074#WRJ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":779,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[42653\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400074#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the recommendations of the Fiscal\u00a0Council should be implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":780,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[45673\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400074#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has received the recommendations of the Fiscal Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":781,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 96 together. <\/p><p>  In line with normal practice, the Fiscal Council forwarded its September 2012 Fiscal Assessment Report to me just before its publication. The Fiscal Council&rsquo;s analysis and recommendations were considered in my Department&rsquo;s preparation of its updated economic and fiscal projections, which will be published this month in the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement (MTFS).<\/p><p>  The Council believes that it would be prudent for the Government to implement more consolidation than currently planned so as to achieve a deficit of 1.9% of GDP in 2015. This would require &euro;1.9 billion in additional consolidation over what is set out in the SPU for the period 2014-2015 but would result in a significantly improved debt trajectory. The Fiscal Council suggested that there be no additional consolidation in 2012, but further consolidation of &euro;0.4 billion in 2014 and &euro;1.5 billion in 2015. The Council suggests that this could provide additional fiscal sustainability, by front-loading the consolidation necessary to meet the General Government Deficit target of 3% by 2015.<\/p><p>  While the Fiscal Council suggests that it would be prudent to undertake additional consolidation in 2014 and 2015, it states that the additional adjustment is not recommended lightly given the existing pressures on domestic demand and the high burden of unemployment. <\/p><p>  The Government is very conscious of the potential impact additional consolidation could have on economic activity. In striving to restore sustainability to the public finances, it is necessary to also be mindful of protecting the emerging economic recovery and seek to strike the right balance between the two. This balancing act is difficult but the Government view is that a reasonable balance has been achieved.

The maximum allowable pension fund at retirement for tax purposes (the Standard Fund Threshold) has already been significantly reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 from over &euro;5.4 million to &euro;2.3 million while the annual earnings cap which operates in conjunction with age-related percentage limits to determine the annual amount of tax-relievable contributions that can be made by an employee or individual to pension savings has been reduced from over &euro;275,000 in 2008 to its current level of &euro;115,000 per annum. The level and design of these thresholds and caps are, for example, among the range of issues for consideration relevant to achieving the commitment referred to.  The National Pensions Framework, which was published by the previous Government in March 2010, included among other things, proposals to introduce a new pension system involving auto-enrolment for employees without supplementary pension coverage. The system proposed in the Framework would be introduced when the prevailing economic circumstances allowed. The Framework proposed the introduction of a State contribution equivalent to 33% tax relief in respect of employees covered by auto-enrolment. This equivalent relief would also replace the current standard and marginal rates of tax relief for existing contributors to pension saving. I would expect that the report of the independent review of long term pension policy in Ireland, currently being conducted by the OECD on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, may also deal with the issue of an auto-enrolment pension system.<\/p><p>  The debate around the incentive regime for pension saving has tended to focus either on a further reduction in the maximum allowable pension fund for tax purposes at retirement or on a reduction in the rate of tax relief on pension contributions. These approaches are not, of course, mutually exclusive.  In my 2012 Budget speech in December last, I said that I did not propose to make changes to the existing marginal rate relief at that time but that the incentive regime for supplementary pension provision will have to be reformed to make the system sustainable and more equitable over the long term. I said that my Department and the Revenue Commissioners would work with the various stakeholders in the next year to develop workable solutions. On foot of this, a broad informal consultation was undertaken this year across a spectrum of stakeholders in the pensions sector to establish their views on further changes to the incentive regime for pension saving.<\/p><p>  I will give due consideration to the views of all interested parties in the pensions sector in the context of any proposals I may make to Government regarding the incentive regime for pension saving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400076#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Promotions","counter":820,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400076#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":821,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[50976\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400076#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of promotions made in his Department to principal officer higher scale, principal officer standard scale, assistant principal officer higher scale, assistant principal officer standard scale, higher executive officer scale, executive office scale and staff officer scale; the total for all of his Department; if he will provide a breakdown for for 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":822,"content":"<p>Since my appointment as Minister for Finance on 9 March 2011, 24 staff members who were serving as Administrative Officer (AO) and Higher Executive Officer (HEO) have been awarded promotions through an internal competitive process to Assistant Principal Higher level.  8 staff members, serving as Assistant Principal (AP) have been awarded promotions through an internal competitive process to Principal Higher (PO) level.<\/p><p>  6 staff members serving as Executive Officer (EO) have been awarded promotions through an internal competitive process to Higher Executive Officer.<\/p><p>  10 staff members serving as Staff Officer (SO) and Clerical Officer (CO) have been awarded promotions through an internal competitive process to Executive Officer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400076#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":824,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400076#WRL00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":823,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400076#WRL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":824,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[44959\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400076#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will intervene in the school bus service that is provided by CI&Eacute; and that has been withdrawn from the parents and school children from the Lucan area, County Dublin, who attend a school (details supplied), while at the same time the service remains in place for families from nearby Celbridge, County Kildare, and in view of the very close proximity of the Celbridge route to Lucan and the fact that so many Lucan families are being discommoded by losing this established school bus service, if he will engage with CI&Eacute; with a view to having the Lucan bus service re-established; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":825,"content":"<p>Under the terms of my Department's School Transport Scheme a minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus &Eacute;ireann, are required before consideration may be given to the retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits.<\/p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport schemes on behalf of my Department, has advised that as the above criteria was not met for the 2011\/12 school the service was withdrawn.

I wish to advise the Deputy that SNAs are not allocated to individual pupils.  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupils' disability categorisation.  SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<\/p><p>  As such, the specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of SNA hours allocated to children with autism in Co. Donegal is not quantifiable, as the level of SNA support provided per pupil is not designated on the basis of disability categorisation, nor is there a set limited allocation of hours per pupils, once an allocation has been made to a school, and where care needs can vary over time.<\/p><p>  I can advise the Deputy, however, that all schools have been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocations for the current school year. Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to each school, including schools in County Donegal, are available at www.ncse.ie and are detailed on a per County basis.<\/p><p>  In addition, in relation to the availability of placements, I wish to explain that my Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs.  In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism.  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports.  Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and\/or care assistance.  Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required.  Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs\/strengths\/abilities emerge.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 540 special classes for children with autism have been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.  Twenty five such special classes are provided in Donegal.  Thirteen new special schools for children with autism were also granted official recognition in 2010.  However, as children with autism may also attend mainstream classes in primary and post primary schools, there are not a set number of places specifically designated for children with autism in Co. Donegal. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400077#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Conservation","counter":861,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400077#WRM01050"},{"type":"question","counter":862,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[50425\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400077#WRM01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to require all schools in receipt of capitation funding to implement targeted energy efficiency programmes to cut wasteful usage of lighting, heating and electronic equipment, considering that existing voluntary and piecemeal projects show the potential to save 15 &ndash; 40% of schools&rsquo; energy costs within two years at most, using models and guidance provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland which are unknown to most schools; his views on whether such energy efficiencies could save up to &euro;15 million a year of the &euro;200 million cost of capitation funding, thereby making cuts that do not hurt in place of cuts to vital educational services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":863,"content":"<p>For the past 15 years the Planning and Building Unit of my Department have been using a process called the DART approach to develop sustainability and energy efficiency in educational buildings.

Staffing in NQAI, HETAC and FETAC has reduced from 110 to 80 over the same period.  As well as the more general savings arising from organisational efficiencies, specific savings relating to accommodation and staffing arise from the amalgamation.  The amalgamating agencies were located in four separate locations and this has been reduced to two.  This has realised annual rent savings of approximately &euro;400,000 in a full year.  In addition, the reduction in the number of CEOs has resulted in savings of approximately &euro;250,000 per year from 2011 onwards.  It is estimated that the costs arising from the amalgamation in 2012 will be approximately &euro;1.8 million, split evenly between accommodation costs and the integration of ICT infrastructure.

Therefore, the Social Welfare and Pension Bill will not include any special provisions regarding public servants who took early retirement<\/p><p>  In relation to State pension which is within my remit, as the Deputy will be aware, the State pension is a very valuable benefit and therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. <\/p><p>  Recent changes to the rate bands payable for State Pension is one element of pension reform put in place to put State pension provision on a more sustainable footing. <\/p><p>  Prior to the rate band changes on 1 September 2012,  a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions.  This was not equitable.  On 1 September 2012, additional rates bands for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) were introduced and while the maximum rate  and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year remains unchanged, those who have fewer than 40 contributions per year will receive a lower rate of pension.  The change to State pension rate bands means that pension payments will be more closely related to PRSI payments made over a working life.  This ensures that those who contribute more during their working life will benefit more in retirement, thereby ensuring equity in the social welfare system.  These changes apply universally for claimants with an eligibility date post 1 September 2012. <\/p><p>  This change to rate bands moves somewhat closer to a total contribution approach, where benefits are paid in proportion to contributions made, i.e. those who pay more, benefit more.  It is proposed to adopt a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; to State pension to replace the current averaging system from 2020.  This will replace the current system and remove the associated anomalies whereby those who pay less could in fact receive a higher payment.  Under this system, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  <\/p><p>  If claimants have an income need they may, following a means test, qualify for a higher rate on the State pension (non-contributory). <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400080#WRP00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes","counter":947,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400080#WRP00550"},{"type":"question","counter":948,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[50345\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400080#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of participants by county currently on community employment schemes; if she will consider creating extra placements for CE schemes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":949,"content":"<p><table><tr><th>County\/Area<\/th><th><div>12\/11\/2012<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 1<\/td><td><div>570<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 2<\/td><td><div>392<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 3<\/td><td><div>173<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 4<\/td><td><div>52<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 5<\/td><td><div>224<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 6<\/td><td><div>53<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 7<\/td><td><div>149<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 8<\/td><td><div>581<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 9<\/td><td><div>214<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 10<\/td><td><div>238<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 11<\/td><td><div>403<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 12<\/td><td><div>307<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 13<\/td><td><div>49<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 15<\/td><td><div>335<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 16<\/td><td><div>54<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 17<\/td><td><div>404<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 18<\/td><td><div>16<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 20<\/td><td><div>36<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 22<\/td><td><div>288<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin 24<\/td><td><div>470<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin West<\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire\/Rathdown<\/td><td><div>359<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin North County\/Fingal<\/td><td><div>294<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td><div>626<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td><div>417<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td><div>646<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td><div>210<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td><div>762<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td><div>339<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td><div>319<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td><div>395<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary (South Riding)<\/td><td><div>550<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford City<\/td><td><div>431<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford County<\/td><td><div>273<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td><div>847<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td><div>299<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td><div>290<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td><div>357<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td><div>344<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td><div>534<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td><div>1,087<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County<\/td><td><div>1,017<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td><div>971<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td><div>571<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick City<\/td><td><div>623<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick County<\/td><td><div>535<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary (North Riding)<\/td><td><div>390<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway City<\/td><td><div>311<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway County<\/td><td><div>1,136<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td><div>741<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td><div>1,117<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td><div>181<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td><div>390<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL<\/td><td><div>22,384<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The Department is committed to reforming CE to ensure delivery of service, value for money and the progression of the individual.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children.  Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births.  While Budget 2012 maintained this additional monthly payment, the multiple births grant of &euro;635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age was discontinued.<\/p><p>  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty.  The Government is also conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment.  Bearing this in mind, any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to child benefit payment rates changes.<\/p><p>  The issue of the extra costs associated with multiple births and the additional assistance provided to these families was considered in the context of a Department of Social Protection value for money review on child income support payments, published in 2010.  The review found that there is an absence of current data regarding the actual difference in costs between families of multiple birth children and other families of equal size.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children.  In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.  The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area.  Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400082#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1005,"content":"<p>Question No. 176 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":1006,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400082#WRR01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1007,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[50455\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400082#WRR02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 3","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1008,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 20th December 2011.

The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately &euro;1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.  The second Action Plan, approved by Government this week, provides a progress report on delivery of the national energy efficiency objectives and shows that Ireland is on track to deliver the 20% energy savings target by 2020.  The Plan will also set out a range of energy saving actions in the public sector, which will be prioritised between now and 2020.<\/p><p>  The public sector is estimated to spend more than &euro;500 million per annum on energy.  Achieving the 33% savings target for the public sector would save &euro;150 million each year in expenditure.  This Government remains firmly committed to meeting this target.  In order to underpin delivery of the national energy savings target, my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is working together to establish a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system whereby all energy usage in the Public Sector will be accounted for and progress will be systematically recorded.  I recently wrote to the head of each of the public bodies, reminding them of their obligation to report annually their energy usage to SEAI.  Enclosed with each letter was the SEAI report: &lsquo;Energy Use in the Public Sector&rsquo;, which outlines savings achieved to date across the public sector to end-2010 amount to 650 GWh.<\/p><p>  This year SEAI has targeted the top 135 public bodies, which account for over 95% of public sector energy consumption.  These organisations will submit detailed energy and activity data to SEAI.  From this data detailed progress scorecards will be produced for each organisation.  From 2013 on, an SEAI online energy data system will facilitate all public bodies and schools to report detailed energy data and allow SEAI to prepare detailed scorecards for all public bodies.<\/p><p>  Since 2009, my Department through SEAI has supported over 140 public sector retrofit projects.  This year the Better Energy Workplaces 2012 Fund has offered support to 145 projects &ndash; 44 of which are in the public sector.  This scheme has developed public sector and market competence and capacity for pay-as-you-save type models.  I recently approved the formation of an action group to develop a framework for energy performance contracting, which will stimulate mass scale retrofitting projects across the public sector.  This has been complemented by the Government decision to require all public sector bodies to go out to the market for energy services if their energy spend is more than &euro;500,000 per year.  The energy performance contracting framework will allow public bodies to implement projects whilst, most importantly, not relying on additional public expenditure to do so, thus not impacting on their capital budgets whilst also reducing their operating costs.<\/p><p>  Through all of the measures outlined including NEEAP, comprehensive monitoring and reporting of energy use in the public sector, Better Energy Workplaces and the energy performance contracting framework, the exemplary role of the public sector will   stimulate investment in energy efficient technologies and the development of a market for energy services and products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400084#WRT01100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Offshore Exploration","counter":1049,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400084#WRT01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1050,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[50437\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400084#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 638 and 640, if he will detail all exploration and appraisal efforts that have been conducted in the geographical area known as the Corrib gas field; the proposals for further exploration in this area; if there are further finds or enhancements of oil or gas assets, will the Irish State find itself in the same revenue sharing position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1051,"content":"<p>The Corrib Gas field was discovered in 1996 under Frontier Exploration Licence 3\/94 which was granted in March 1994 and surrendered in June of this year.

My Department has reviewed the rationalisation proposals for agencies under its aegis as set out in the Public Service Reform Plan.  The outcome of this review, which was recently published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is that the Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) will be merged (initially on an administrative basis) with Dublin City Council (DCC) by the end of 2012, pending enactment of legislation, which is expected to yield short term savings of approximately &euro;400k, which amounts to over 20% of the Exchequer current subvention.  The most significant benefits to be gained from a merger of the DHDA with DCC are the synergies created from a closer relationship between the DHDA and the range of disciplines and skills available within the DCC.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Government also announced further proposed mergers, which include provision for the Ordnance Survey of Ireland to merge with the Valuation Office and Property Registration Authority by the end of 2013.  The merger potentially provides an opportunity for more efficient and cost-effective delivery of land and property administration services.  Medium term savings are likely to be achievable in the areas of common back office functions such as HR, conventional (non-specialised) IT systems, Financial Management and Corporate Services.  There may also be potential savings in the areas of accommodation and software licences. In the longer term, more efficiencies\/synergies in delivery of the merged organisation&rsquo;s services may lead to further savings in operational areas.  Additional commercial revenues which would reduce the burden on the State may also be achievable in the medium to long term.  The lead Department in relation to this rationalisation is the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>  There is also provision for the back-office administrative functions of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) to be merged with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) by the end of 2013.  I would advise the Deputy that neither BAI nor ComReg are Exchequer funded and any savings achieved would not accrue to the Exchequer.  Future tangible back office savings derive mainly from the merging of the support systems and pooling of outsourced functions and external consultancies in the short to medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400084#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Promotions","counter":1055,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400084#WRT01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1056,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[50972\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400084#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of promotions made in his Department to principal officer higher scale, principal officer standard scale, assistant principal officer higher scale, assistant principal officer standard scale, higher executive officer scale, executive office scale and staff officer scale; the total for all of his Department; if he will provide a breakdown for for 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1057,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the following table:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Grade<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2009<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2010<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2011<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2012<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Principal Officer Standard Scale<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal Officer Standard Scale<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officer<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Executive Officer<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Staff Officer<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>My Department does not have posts at the grades of Principal Officer Higher (PO1) or Assistant Principal Officer (AP1).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400084#WRT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":1059,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400084#WRT01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nuclear Plants","counter":1058,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400084#WRT01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1059,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[50275\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111400084#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has been in contact with his counterpart in the UK in view of the British Government's National Audit Office complaints in relation to the risks to the public outlined in a recent examination of the management of 50 year old storage ponds at the British Nuclear Fuels Limited facility at Sellafield; the precise nature of the concerns he has raised; if he is satisfied that the improvements promised by management are sufficient to protect persons on the east coast of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1067","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1060,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of the Report by the UK&rsquo;s National Audit Office Nuclear Decommissioning Authority &ndash; Managing risk reduction at Sellafield.

The LGMA also takes on the residual functions from An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, which has been dissolved as of 1 November 2012.

It is not possible at this time to specify anticipated savings on an individual State body basis. However, the Public Service Reform Plan indicated that across the public service as a whole, savings of 20 million euro in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money are envisaged from the rationalisation programme.<\/p><p>  With regard to State bodies under the aegis of my own Department, the bodies which are to be rationalised, amalgamated or abolished in 2012 are:<\/p><p>Equality Tribunal (Rationalise the industrial relations\/employee rights institutions - Labour Court, Labour Relations Commission, Employee Appeals Tribunal, National Employment Rights Authority and Equality Tribunal into single agency). This overall rationalisation of industrial relations institutions is being lead by my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The General Scheme of a Bill to provide for this measure has been approved by Government. Our two Departments have agreed that administrative responsibility for the Tribunal will transfer to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation from 1 January 2013.<\/p><p>Equality Authority, Human Rights Commission (Merge to form new Human Rights and Equality Commission). I published the General Scheme of a Bill to replace the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission with a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission on 5 June 2012. The Bill is currently being drafted and it is intended to have the legislation in place early next year. In parallel, arrangements are being made to select members of the new Commission. This is being handled by an independent Selection Panel set up for that purpose. Advertisements inviting applications were published last Sunday, with a deadline of 29 November for submission of applications. The successful applicants will be appointed to the two existing bodies, pending enactment of the necessary legislation to effect the merger. This will ensure that the two organisations can start to operate as a cohesive whole, with a transition programme being prepared and put in place, that the board(s) can commence preparing a Strategic Plan for the new body and that work can be taken forward rapidly on the staffing review envisaged in the Working Group report.<\/p><p>  With regard to those bodies under the aegis of my Department, subject to critical review, and which recommend proceeding with the measure (i.e. to be achieved by end 2013), these are as follows: <\/p><p>Forensic Science Laboratory: The Forensic Science Laboratory is to be brought within the ambit of the State Laboratory. No savings or costs are likely to arise in 2012. A working group is to be established to develop and work through areas of savings and future synergies.<\/p><p>Prison Visiting Committees (Reduce or merge Visiting Committees as there is now a Prison Inspectorate). The Government has approved the drafting of a General Scheme of an Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, which will include provisions to make Visiting Committees more effective, while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities. A link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons. As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the role of the Inspector of Prisons. Under the proposed arrangements, it is my intention that Visiting Committees would be able to report any urgent or major matter to the Inspector at any time. Subject to competing legislative priorities, it is expected that the General Scheme will be published by the end of the year. When work on preparation of the General Scheme has been completed, I will be seeking Government approval for its publication to facilitate a consultation process in advance of drafting and publication of the Bill.<\/p><p>Property Registration Authority (Merger the Valuation Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority). Following the Government approval of the recommendation of the Critical Review on this proposal that a merger should proceed, work is commencing to advance this proposal.<\/p><p>Reception and Integration Agency, Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and Refugee Appeals Tribunal (Rationalise various Refugee Structures). Consolidation of refugee structures will be addressed through the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.

All options to avoid the need for personnel to relocate are being explored as part of this process.  Personnel are being offered the opportunity for reassignment within their current locations where this is feasible, together with opportunities for re-training and re-skilling.  In addition, a review system has been put in place whereby personnel who are unhappy with a proposed relocation can seek a review of a decision.  Inevitably, given the scale of the reorganisation, it will be necessary for some staff to move to new locations.  <\/p><p>  The creation of a new two Brigade structure for the Army under the reorganisation has resulted in Combat Support Units being reduced from nine units to six.  The Field Engineer companies based in McKee Barracks fall into this category, and the Headquarters element and Field Engineer Company are being relocated to Custume Barracks, Athlone. The 2 Field Artillery Regiment based in McKee Barracks are also relocating as part of this process.<\/p><p>  Pending the full rollout of the reorganisation plan it is not possible to say how many personnel can be facilitated though the reassignment process.  However, there is no question of families being moved or being required to move arising from the reorganisation and this is a matter for each individual to decide.  The reality is that many Defence Forces personnel currently assigned to McKee barracks are not resident in Dublin and commute on a daily basis, which is a common feature across both the public and private sector of a modern, flexible and mobile working population in Ireland today. The reassignments have in fact offered the opportunity for many personnel currently based in McKee Barracks to move to locations which are more favourable to their personal circumstances. In this regard 42 personnel across all ranks up to Commandant are taking the opportunity to relocate on a voluntary basis. <\/p><p>  It is important to restate that the reassignment, promotion and appeals processes are still ongoing and that the numbers of personnel to be mandatorily reassigned remains fluid at this point making it impossible to give final definitive figures at this juncture. <\/p><p>  All members of the Defence Forces reassigned under the Defence Forces Reorganisation Plan 2012 are entitled to Change of Station Allowance in circumstances where they meet the qualifying criteria.

I expect the abolition of quotas to facilitate an expansion in the sector and through the Food Harvest 2020 Report the industry has set itself an ambitious target for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020. For my part I have been working on a number of fronts to prepare the industry for the move to a quota free environment.<\/p><p>  More than 85% of Irish dairy production is exported, and the price of milk in Ireland is ultimately determined by global demand and supply. In that regard I have been endeavouring to  raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector in third country markets, for example through trade visits to the US and China, and also through ongoing engagement with potential purchasers of Irish dairy products, at both political and official level. <\/p><p>  A key element of this market strategy is to optimise the already positive green image of Ireland in order to create a point of differentiation for Irish dairy products on international markets. In this context, stakeholders are at present engaged, through Bord Bia, in technical discussions to establish a dairy sustainability and quality scheme, while at processing level, Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green Programme is providing a vehicle for industry to commit itself to sustainability targets by reducing energy inputs, minimising overall carbon footprint and mitigating the impact on the environment. This pro-active approach to environmental sustainability has a strong resonance with procurement strategists in the many multi-national food companies who are interested in using Ireland as a source of high quality food ingredients and processed products. <\/p><p>  Of course the industry itself has a responsibility to focus its efforts on market and product development.  Supported by Government, the Irish dairy sector has succeeded in positioning itself as a major international player, and in recent months we have seen industry announcements in relation to the development of supply arrangements between Irish companies and multi-national players in third countries, and the development of value added products which can maximise the value of our dairy output. <\/p><p>  At farm level my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has been working,  through research activities and through the Dairy Efficiency Programme, to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to reduce costs on farm and improve efficiency, in order to better equip farmers to deal with volatility in dairy markets.

In relation to the Opticians Board, a Working Group was established in 2010 to provide legislatively for the subsumation of the Opticians Board into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council. It is expected it will be end 2012 before the draft heads are available for Ministerial approval as part of the Health Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2012. With regard to the National Cancer Registry Board, with the ongoing changes to the structures of the HSE, I consider that it would not at this stage be appropriate to subsume the Registry into the National Cancer Control Programme. <\/p><p>  Progress on the candidates for critical review in the Public Health Reform document such as the Mental Health Commission and HIQA will be contingent on other factors such as the creation of a Patient Safety Authority and in the case of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and Health Insurance Authority, in the context of the move to Universal Health Insurance. I am considering the precise future role of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in light of the overall governance structures required for the effective running of the new children's hospital and the project to build it. With regard to PHECC, I have decided that it should continue to operate in its present form for a further period and the matter will be kept under review with a view to proceeding with the integration with CORU when it is operationally ready to assume the functions involved, which is expected to be 4 or 5 years.<\/p><p>  The extent of savings will vary between organisations and the majority of staff will be redeployed to other public service bodies, as was the case with the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery.
