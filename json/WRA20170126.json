These AFAs have been modelled, mapped and assessed for options to manage flood risk.  Public consultation events were held in Spring 2015 on the draft flood maps, in Spring 2016 on the preliminary options and Autumn 2016 on the draft plans.<\/p>  <p>  Following this public consultation process, the draft plans are being finalised taking on board the comments received.  The finalised plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, that can address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  Amongst the feasible measures that may form part of a flood defence scheme, as part of the implementation of the FRMPs will be; structural defences built through the OPW&rsquo;s Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995; Local Authorities own powers; and\/or the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme.  The plans, when finalised in Spring 2017, will be sent to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for approval. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in September 2015 announced details of a &euro;430 million 6 year programme of capital investment on flood defence measures as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall Capital Investment Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021.  During this time, the annual allocation for flood defence schemes will more than double to &euro;100m. <\/p>  <p>  The flood protection capital programme 2016 &ndash; 2021 will build on the very significant investment that has already been undertaken in flood relief works throughout the country over the last 20 years.

Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a minimum cost benefit ratio of 1.5:1.<\/p>  <p>  On a national level, close on &euro;38m has been approved for over 600 projects since the scheme was introduced in 2009, with over 400 projects already completed providing protection to 5,000 properties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600053#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":48,"content":"<p>Question No. 26 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600053#WRB00600"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[3264\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600053#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on the decision of the Education Procurement Service to issue a tender (details supplied) for the national supply of library books and audio visual material, which includes a requirement to use software currently not available here and thereby discriminated against Irish companies in the tender requirements.","asker":"1259","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>The provision of public\u00a0library\u00a0services, including the procurement of books, is a matter for each local authority in its capacity as a\u00a0library\u00a0authority under the Local Government Act 2001.

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.<\/p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to actually protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 7 December 2016. When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.<\/p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas. The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it takes for the Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement of the Deprivation of Liberty provisions, which will be included in the Committee Stage amendments, and of the the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600054#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600054#WRC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[3548\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600054#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of an application for naturalisation status in respect of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1342","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the processing of the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy is under consideration and has not yet reached a conclusion.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  <\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.

Work was carried out in my Department to assess the potential economic implications arising, including through the ESRI-Department of Finance research programme study published in November 2015 titled 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland'. <\/p>  <p>  Since the referendum, my Department has been closely monitoring developments at both the macro and sectoral level.  Early macroeconomic indicators suggest that the immediate impact from the UK decision is more muted then initially anticipated.  In particular, third quarter national accounts data provide clear evidence of continued momentum in the economy with GDP increasing by 6.9 per cent year-on-year. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the public finances, the recent end-year Exchequer data would also indicate that we remain on course to record a deficit of 0.9 per cent of GDP for 2016.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that the impact of the UK decision is likely to materialise with a lag.  As a result, my Department lowered its Budget 2017 GDP growth forecast for this year by approximately &frac12; percentage point reflecting the outcome of the referendum.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor developments and will publish updated macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts as part of the Stability Programme Update, in April this year.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department published detailed analysis of sectoral exposure to Brexit across the economy.  This showed that the sectors most impacted by Brexit are generally small scale indigenous enterprises, with high levels of regional employment, relatively low profit levels, that are highly linked to the rest of the economy. In terms of indigenous sectors Food and Beverage and Traditional Manufacturing are highly dependent on the UK both as a source of exports and for overall turnover. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's exposure to the UK is not isolated to the indigenous sectors, with, for example, pharmaceutical manufacturing, financial and ICT services having a substantial export relationship with the UK. Certain other services sectors such as the indigenous Tourism and Hospitality sector (which is heavily dependent on UK tourists) will be equally exposed to the competitiveness challenges posed by the recent appreciation of the euro-sterling bilateral rate. <\/p>  <p>  On the basis of all the analysis a number of measures were announced in Budget 2017 with a view to making Ireland Brexit ready. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to stress that the best and most immediate policy under the Government's\u00a0control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the\u00a0public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, Budget 2017 signalled a lower debt target of 45 per cent of GDP for the mid-to-late 2020s.  This will help to provide an additional fiscal 'shock absorber' capacity to the public finances to help withstand any shock including the impact of Brexit.  This will complement the contingency or 'rainy day' fund to be established following the achievement of a balanced budget in 2018 which will help provide a further counter-cyclical buffer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600055#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600055#WRD02600"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[3552\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600055#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is a statutory obligation on an insurance company to insist on the signature of a person who is in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease to a form in relation to the Finance Act 2016 even when the person is not in a situation to sign the form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>I understand that this question relates to aspects of section 14 of the Finance Act 2016, which made a number of amendments to the pension-related provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997.  I introduced these changes in order to close off certain tax-planning opportunities involving the use of Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs).<\/p><p>In providing very generous tax relief on contributions to private pension arrangements, the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>is that when benefits are paid from the arrangements they are, generally, taxed at the owner's marginal rate.  The tax planning that was taking place involved the RAC or PRSA owner never maturing or vesting the contracts involved so that the pension benefits were never paid out.  The RAC or PRSA could pass to the owner's spouse or civil partner on death in a tax-free\u00a0manner and, as no benefits had been drawn down, no benefit crystallisation event (BCE) arose which could give rise to a tax known as chargeable excess tax if the owner's overall retirement benefits exceeded the life-time Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) limit of &euro;2 million or a higher Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) limit if the individual had one.<\/p><p>The changes made in the Finance Act 2016 ensure that all RAC and PRSA contracts will, in future, be deemed to vest no later than the owner's 75th birthday.  The amendments also include transitional arrangements to provide that, in situations where the RAC or PRSA owner had attained the age of 75 years before the date on which the Finance Act 2016 passed into law i.e. 25 December 2016, their RAC or PRSA is deemed to vest on that date.<\/p><p>A key feature in ensuring that these anti-avoidance provisions work is that the administrator of the RAC or PRSA pension arrangement in question must have the necessary information to determine if the deemed vesting of the arrangement brings the value of the individual's lifetime pension benefits over the SFT or PFT limit, so that any chargeable excess tax arising can be determined and paid over to Revenue.  To that end, the legislation (section 787R(5A)(b) TCA 1997) requires all RAC or PRSA owners whose arrangements are deemed to vest on their 75 birthday or 25 December 2016, as appropriate, to provide a declaration to their\u00a0 pension fund administrator setting out the value of any prior pension benefits taken by the individual from other pension arrangements.  The declaration has to be provided within 30 days of the deemed vesting of the RAC or PRSA.  Where a declaration is not made, the legislation requires the administrator to assume that the individual has already &quot;used up&quot; their SFT or PFT limit, as appropriate, and to subject the entire value of the RAC or PRSA to chargeable excess tax at 40%.  It should be noted that the legislation provides that Revenue will make any necessary adjustments where it subsequently transpires that some or all of the value of the pension arrangement should not have been charged to tax.<\/p><p>While the onus is on the individual RAC or PRSA owner to provide the declaration to their pension fund administrator, regardless of whether the administrator requests them to do so, I understand that administrators have taken the initiative to identify and contact clients who may come within the deeming provisions of the legislation, requesting them to provide the necessary declaration.  It may be in this context, that the Deputy's constituent has been approached by the Insurance Company concerned seeking a signed declaration.<\/p><p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that officials from my Department and Revenue met with representatives of Insurance Ireland during the passage of Finance Act 2016 to consider aspects of the new legislation including concerns regarding older vulnerable clients who might not be in a position to meet their obligations due, for example, to ill health.

EFSI's ability to deliver in a particular Member State is dependent on there being suitable public and private projects under its two funding windows - the Infrastructure and Innovation Window (IIW) and the SME Window.<\/p>  <p>  EFSI provides an important additional funding mechanism to support investment in the pursuit of employment and growth.  It should be considered alongside the other suite of investment mechanisms including the (European Investment Bank) EIB's normal lending activities.  For the private sector there are also the commercially available financing options.  In the case of the public sector, the State's capital investment programme is sufficiently funded via the state's borrowings through the NTMA, while other mechanisms such as PPPs and off-balance sheet vehicles are additional potential options for funding investment. <\/p>  <p>  Since inception, Ireland has seen the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI as being in the private sector including entities such as PPP companies and I am pleased that the primary health care centres PPP has successfully drawn down EFSI funds.  It should be remembered that each EFSI loan entered into by the State pre-commits funding for the repayment of such loans, and has to be considered in the context of the expenditure benchmark under the EU's fiscal rules.    <\/p>  <p>  The European Union's Financial Instruments are important for the implementation of the Government's commitment to supporting the financing needs of SMEs and ensuring that there is an adequate supply of affordable and appropriate credit to meet their needs.  Such European Financial Instruments include the COSME and InnovFin Guarantee Programmes, both of which are made available under the EFSI SME Window.  In 2016, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) successfully applied for a &euro;100 million guarantee facility under the COSME programme, and will use this facility to support the delivery of the Agri Cash Flow Support Loan Fund for Farmers as announced in Budget 2017, on behalf of Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The SBCI has also submitted an application for the InnovFin counter guarantee to the European Investment Fund (EIF) and, if the application is successful, intends to use that counter guarantee to create a pilot program to offer a guaranteed loan product through partner bank(s). <\/p>  <p>  As indicated, EFSI represents an additional funding option open to Government Departments, Agencies and commercial semi-State companies.  As such, it is a matter for each of these entities to consider the potential eligibility of their projects for EFSI funding.  Generally, Departments would have existing relationships with the European Investment Bank, which has responsibility for the management and operation of EFSI.  Government Departments would, in the process of appraising their funding options for a particular project, engage with the EIB to consider the eligibility of their project for EFSI funding.  My officials are currently compiling a list, through the EIB, of projects that have been approved for EFSI support in the State and I will forward the list to the Deputy in due course.  However, this list may not be complete as it is possible that Irish private sector projects may receive funding from EFSI supported funds in other jurisdictions.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for capital expenditure and, in this context, engages with each line Department on an ongoing basis to consider and assess projects and the full range of available funding options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600056#WRE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Investment Bank Loans","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600057#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[3730\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600057#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total number of project applications entered by the State under the European Investment Bank for investment and infrastructural projects, per annum in each of the years 2010 to 2016, in tabular form; the number of successful agreements to date; the estimated total expected drawdown of funds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[3731\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600057#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total number of project applications entered by the State under the European Investment Bank for investment and infrastructural projects, in 2017 in tabular form; the estimated total expected drawdown of funds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":160,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.<\/p><p>The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the long-term financing institution of the European Union.

In this connection, the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 provides for the introduction of temporary fast- track planning arrangements, whereby planning applications for large-scale housing developments (100+ units), including student accommodation, can be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and determined within a specified time frame, with a view to facilitating the earlier provision of increased housing supply. Work is now progressing on the preparation of the regulations and guidance necessary to bring the new procedures into operation at an early date.<\/p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland also referred, in the context of an overall review of the planning system, to the introduction and integration of technological efficiencies such as e-planning ( i.e. online submission of planning applications and appeals) to facilitate a more modern and responsive planning system. The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which recently passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and which it is intended will be enacted by the Summer, includes enabling provision to facilitate the introduction of e-planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600059#WRH01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Repair and Leasing Scheme","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600059#WRH01150"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[3549\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600059#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"when the grant scheme announced in 2016 will be progressed (details supplied).","asker":"1250","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>The Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness the accommodation potential that exists in certain vacant properties across Ireland. The scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow in early October 2016, on a pilot basis, and it is my intention that the scheme will be available nationally by April 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB). This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years. The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.<\/p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead. Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties. <\/p>  <p>  A scheme of this nature will require both significant capital and current exchequer investment expenditure over the next 5 years and therefore must be properly analysed and assessed to ensure the best use of public money. The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is appropriately modelled from a financial perspective but also, and critically, that it is workable from local authorities&rsquo; and AHBs&rsquo; perspectives and delivers high quality social housing effectively.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency, who are assisting with implementation of the scheme, are in regular contact with the two pilot local authorities and I understand that the pilot is progressing well at a local level. In parallel, my Department is also in contact with other local authorities to assist them with necessary preparations for the roll-out of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Several AHBs are working together with the Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas and, as the scheme becomes available nationally, I expect that more AHBs will become involved in the roll out of the scheme. AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and being good landlords puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme and I have committed to making &euro;140m available over that period. While the current target for 2017 is 150 units, the interest expressed by property owners and stakeholders so far indicates that the 2017 targets will be achieved and could potentially be exceeded following national roll out. Taking account of this, the capacity of local authorities and AHBs to deliver under the scheme, as well as the necessary agreement on the financial considerations arising, I am exploring how delivery under the new scheme might be accelerated.<\/p>  <p>  I would encourage any local authorities that are eager to engage early with the scheme to liaise with the pilot local authorities and my Department, in order to be familiar with the requirements around participation and also the practical implementation issues that are being worked through with the pilot scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600059#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600059#WRH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[3557\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600059#WRH01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1 of 19 January 2017, the details of the 200 further direct construction and turnkey projects, representing some 3,600 new units that have been approved by his Department since he has become Minister; the date on which each project received approval; the stage each project is currently at; the estimated date of completion; and the details of the 100 AHB projects that have been approved in the same timeframe.","asker":"1217","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>At the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on Wednesday, 18 January 2017, my Department indicated that details of all approved social housing projects are being updated and would be published in conjunction with the next Rebuilding Ireland quarterly implementation report, which is due in the coming weeks.

This provides cover for self-employed people for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widows\/widowers pension (contributory). <\/p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation stipulates that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory), unless all outstanding self-employment contributions have been paid by him\/her in full.  Where contributions are paid subsequent to a claimant&rsquo;s 66th birthday, State pension (contributory) can only be awarded from the date on which the self-employment liability has been fully discharged.

If a blanket suite of social benefit clauses was attached to all public procurement opportunities it is likely that this would be ineffective and disproportionately favour larger enterprises and reduce competition in supplying goods and services to the State. <\/p>  <p>  In general, the inclusion of social clauses in a procurement process would appear to be most effective where the benefit could be considered a core requirement and can be directly linked to the contracting authority's policy or strategic plan.

In this regard the Deputy will be aware that I announced on Budget Day that my Department would, by the middle of 2017, complete a review of the Capital Investment Plan published in September 2015. The objective of the Capital Review will be to provide a focused analysis of capital spending and it will provide the Government with an opportunity to reaffirm priorities and, if necessary, recalibrate investment plans. The key task, however, will be to recommend how the remaining unallocated capital funding should be allocated over the period of the plan, having regard to the priority areas identified in the Government's Programme. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The effective management of expenditure has played a key role in ensuring Ireland met or exceeded its key\u00a0fiscal\u00a0targets over the past number of years. This continues to be the case, with the management of the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations being a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department. My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. The\u00a0drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles and\u00a0information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is now in a position to provide for sustainable levels of expenditure growth to support improvements in public services. The Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2017 sets out total gross voted expenditure of &euro;58.1 billion in 2017. This represents a year on year increase of over 3 per cent on the 2016 allocation and is\u00a0a prudent level of increase as we continue to repair the public finances. However, we have to be mindful of the considerable expenditure pressures facing the public finances and it is important that we continue to evaluate how we spend our money to ensure that limited resources provide much needed public services and social infrastructure. Given this context, I announced on Budget day that a spending review will be carried out in advance of Budget 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Given the many competing priorities and demands for resources, there is an ongoing requirement to implement reforms that improve how public services are delivered, and\u00a0that achieve savings which can be reinvested in frontline services.\u00a0 The Public Service has delivered significant productivity gains and service improvements over the last number of years, as set out in the Annual Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan (published April 2016).\u00a0 We must build on this progress, and it is essential that targeted recruitment and investment in public services is done in tandem with further public service reform measures. This includes, for example, more digital delivery of services, improved customer service and business processes, and greater use of shared services.\u00a0When Departments identify savings arising from such reform measures, such savings are in general made available to Departments to reinvest in the delivery of services.\u00a0 It is also very important to ensure that the public service workforce operates\u00a0in a manner which maximises the positive impact on public service provision of the increased staff numbers reflected in the budgetary allocations for 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600062#WRL01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600062#WRL01250"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[3700\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600062#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which he expects to be able to maintain compliance with the Lansdowne Road agreement or other pay agreements in the context of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation, having particular regard to the need to reward those affected by the downturn in the economy in the course of the ongoing recovery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This Initiative will initially focus on key specialties with high numbers of long-waiting patients, including in Ophthalmology.

Some 6,300 farmers received an allocation of entitlements under the 2015 National Reserve.  There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by claw-back derived following the sale of entitlements without land.  It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited.  The Regulations also provide for the application of a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements to replenish the National Reserve.

In addition, Section 6 also deems certain dismissal situations to be unfair as well as outlining certain criteria on which dismissals may be adjudicated as fair.  One type of dismissal situation deemed to be unfair is referred to in Section 6(2)(a) of the Act which indicates that a dismissal is unfair where it can be shown that the dismissal resulted wholly or mainly from an employee&rsquo;s trade union membership or activities, either where those activities take place outside working hours or at those times during working hours when permitted by the employer.  While, in general, an employee must have been in the same employment for at least a year in order to bring a claim for unfair dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, one of the exceptions to the one-year service requirement includes dismissals falling under section 6(2)(a) of the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Victimisation) (Declaration) Order 2004 provides that where there is a dispute in an employment where collective bargaining fails to take place and where negotiating arrangements are not in place, no person, be they union representative, individual employee or manager, should be victimised or suffer disadvantage as a consequence of their legitimate actions or affiliation arising from that dispute.  A procedure for addressing complaints of victimisation in such cases is set out the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  A complaint for breach of this legislation may be presented to the Workplace Relations Commission who can enforce rights breached.

Exchange rate fluctuations will pose real challenges for low margin exporting sectors reliant on the UK market.  The volatility of exchange rates is clearly evident from developments over the last few months. <\/p><p>Given Brexit is likely to represent a structural shift in the UK trading relations with partners, short medium and long term responses are needed.  These include market diversification, cost reduction, value-add, innovation and price repositioning.  My Department and agencies are putting in place measures to address these issues for client companies.<\/p><p>My Department, along with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), Enterprise Ireland (EI) and stakeholders (such as SFA, ISME, IBEC and Chambers) is in the process of conducting a structured engagement with industry.  The purpose of this engagement is to deliver an evidence base, on which Government appropriate, tailored and targeted responses can be based to meet real identified business needs.  Work on this is advanced and the outcome of this structured engagement may lead to further discussions on State Aid concerns. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that EU Regulation No 1407\/2013 (the <i>de minimis<\/i>Regulation) sets out the rules for granting small amounts of financial aid to enterprises which are unlikely to affect trade and distort competition (<i>de minimis<\/i>aid).  Generally, public bodies are allowed to grant aid to a single undertaking of up to &euro;200,000 over a 3 year fiscal period without prior notification or approval from DG Competition.  The Regulation requires that the aid is &lsquo;transparent&rsquo;. <\/p><p>Specific arrangements on <i>de minimis<\/i>aid apply in the following sectors:<\/p><p>- road freight transport sector<\/p><p>- primary production of agricultural products<\/p><p>- production, processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products.<\/p><p>As part of the revision of the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER) under the State Aid Modernisation Agenda, Member States and the Commission discussed a proposal to increase the <i>de minimis<\/i>threshold in 2013.  A number of Member States suggested increasing the <i>de minimis<\/i>threshold to &euro;500,000 over a three year fiscal period.  The European Commission rejected the proposal on the basis that the amount was substantial and could distort the competition in the Internal Market.

In response to that concern, I recently launched a public consultation on the issue together with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Tourism and Sport.  Though ticket resale has been the subject of considerable comment, there is a lack of reliable information about important aspects of the practice, including its extent, the sources of tickets put up for resale, and the prices achieved, as opposed to advertised, on the secondary ticket market.  The aim of the consultation is to provide us with a better understanding of the issue and to help us identify the practical measures that might be taken to give consumers fairer access to tickets in the future.  Those measures may include changes to the existing regulatory framework.  That will be determined following an assessment of the responses to the consultation and other relevant factors.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has overall responsibility for consumer protection.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Tourism and Sport have a role on the issue because of the wish to ensure that fans can access tickets for sporting events on fair terms and because of commitments given to UEFA in connection with the Euro 2020 Championship and to be given to World Rugby in connection with the bid for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.  Major concerts and sporting events also draw large numbers of visitors to Ireland and are important for the tourism sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600072#WRV01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Innovation Union Scoreboard","counter":619,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600072#WRV01450"},{"type":"question","counter":620,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[3733\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600072#WRV01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on Ireland&rsquo;s fall in the 2017 Bloomberg Innovation Index international rankings; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":621,"content":"<p>As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I am committed to improving Ireland&rsquo;s innovation performance.

I also accept that FDI can make an even bigger contribution, all over Ireland, than it is now.  However, I think it is quite clear that the impact of FDI on our economy and society has been &ndash; and continues to be &ndash; overwhelmingly positive. <\/p>  <p>  For a start, overseas investment has played a huge part in our country&rsquo;s economic recovery and continues to drive job creation across Ireland.  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s record results for 2016, which reflected our best ever job gains and levels of new investment, speak for themselves.  Those results show that in 2016 every regional location in Ireland saw net job increases, with 52% of all jobs created by the Agency&rsquo;s clients last year based outside of Dublin.  This reflects the intensive focus being placed on the best possible regional dispersal of FDI investments.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The level of employment in overseas companies is only part of this positive picture.  FDI companies generally offer excellent quality and well paid jobs which have significant direct and indirect impacts on communities across the country.  The average salary in IDA approved jobs was &euro;51,237 in 2016, up from &euro;49,118 in 2015.  This is above the national average annual earnings of &euro;45,075 in 2015.\u00a0  These salary levels are sustained by the high value jobs which we target in a diverse range of key sectors including international financial services, technology, life sciences and engineering. <\/p>  <p>  It is also the case that the jobs created by FDI drive other economic activity in the State.  It is estimated that every ten positions created by an IDA client company support a further seven jobs elsewhere in the economy.  When these jobs are included, the total employment impact of IDA Ireland clients extends to approximately 340,000 people.<\/p>  <p>  While there is always room for improvement, I believe our FDI led growth model has proven its worth in terms of attracting employment and investment.  I am confident that it will remain a key element of our national economic strategy for many years to come and that it will continue to yield benefits for people all over Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600072#WRV01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":626,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600072#WRV01900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naval Service Operations","counter":625,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600072#WRV01850"},{"type":"question","counter":626,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[3621\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012600072#WRV01900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"when members of the Naval Service who participated in the international rescue mission in the Mediterranean Sea will receive payment for their full overseas service.
