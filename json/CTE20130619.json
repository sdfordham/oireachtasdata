The making of the order and its laying before the Houses arises from the provisions of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and is designed to ensure that the rights and interests of colleges and schools with a Protestant ethos and the students of those schools are provided for.  <\/p><p>  The Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discrimination on a wide-range of grounds, including religion.  While the Act deals primarily with discrimination in employment it also extends to discrimination in vocational training.  Vocational training is defined as any system of instruction that enables a person to acquire the knowledge for the carrying of an occupational activity.  Teacher-training falls within this definition.  For many years, the Church of Ireland College of Education has provided training in primary school teaching only to students who come from the Church of Ireland and the broader Protestant tradition.  The purpose of this practise is to ensure that there is available to schools under Protestant ownership a sufficient number of teachers who themselves come from a Protestant background and are trained in an institution with a Protestant ethos.  <\/p><p>  Most primary schools in the State are privately owned, publicly funded denominational schools.  This system of denominational education is underpinned by the Constitution.  Central to the right of the religious denominations to conduct schools with a particular ethos is their need to ensure that they have available to them a body of staff belonging to and trained in the particular religious denomination of the school.  If such staff were not available, the constitutional right to free profession of religion and the conduct of denominational schools would be seriously impaired.  To avoid imposing what would in effect be unconstitutional restrictions on the rights of the religious denominations in this regard section 12 of the Employment Equality Act 1998, which prohibits discrimination in vocational training, makes two exceptions.  It provides that the prohibition of discrimination does not apply for the purpose of ensuring the availability of nurses and teachers to denominational hospitals and primary schools respectively.  <\/p><p>  In the case of primary schools the section provides that an educational or training body may apply to the Minister for Education and Skills for an order permitting the body to reserve places on the vocational training course.  The Minister for Education and Skills, with the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, may then make an order allowing the body to reserve such number of places to meet the need for teachers in primary schools as is considered appropriate.  The Church of Ireland College of Education has made an application on behalf of the college for the reservation of 32 places in the college for the academic years 2013-2014 up to 2017-2018 for students who are members of recognised churches in the Protestant tradition.  <\/p><p>  The college makes the case that the reservation of 32 places, which is currently the full complement of first year places in the college, should be made in order to provide sufficient teachers for Protestant schools over the next number of years.  The grounds for the request as put by the college are as follows: the necessity of providing a sufficient number of qualified primary teachers to maintain the distinctive ethos of Protestant schools remains the central concern and motivation for seeking the order; primary schools in the Protestant community depend almost exclusively on the college for the provision of an annual supply of well qualified teachers from a Protestant background; a reported continuing shortage of applicants for teaching positions in Protestant primary schools, particularly small schools in rural areas; some of those who enter the college will not complete their studies and of those who qualify some will not take up posts in schools with the Protestant ethos; also, a number of graduates go to live and work abroad while others engage in further studies.  <\/p><p>  I believe, in the circumstances set out by the college, the continuing reservation of 32 places in the college for students from the Protestant tradition appears reasonable to ensure that Protestant schools have available to them a sufficient number of teachers who share their value system and religious beliefs.  Apart from the constitutional requirements from which this order flows, the order is a necessary support for the maintenance of diversity of values, beliefs and culture in our education system and Irish society.  Given that schools with a Protestant ethos represent only a small minority of primary schools in the State, there is clearly a risk that that ethos could be diluted unless specific protections are provided.  This order puts in place a protection which the Oireachtas considered appropriate and which will guarantee Protestant schools that they can continue to provide education for their students in accordance with their particular values and beliefs.  <\/p><p>  I acknowledge that some aspects of the environment in which the Church of Ireland College of Education operates are changing.  I refer in this regard specifically to developments in relation to school patronage and the work underway on the restructuring of teacher education provision in Ireland.  However, there is a continuing need for this provision to be made.  The primary legislation governing the order provides that it may be revoked and any effects of these developments on the necessity for the order will be kept under review.  <\/p><p>  I thank the committee for its consideration of this important issue, which safeguards and supports the maintenance of diversity of values, beliefs and culture in our education system and Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900004#C00500","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1371643500,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

What has been the experience in recent years in terms of student in-take at the college, including the number of students from a Protestant background who took up a post in a primary school with a Protestant ethos?  Is there a precedent for this provision?  Is the Church of Ireland College of Education the only teacher training college with a Protestant ethos?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900004#C00700","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1371643500,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I would just like to make a few comments.  I understand the reason for the order and the constitutional framework under which it is being introduced.<\/p> <p>It is appropriate to say that the very basis around which we train teachers means that, in effect, it amounts to a sectarian head count throughout our teacher training colleges, and it is important for us to investigate this properly.  We still have far too heavy an influence from religious institutions over the education system.  It is the fundamental ethos that is in the training colleges and the vast bulk of primary and secondary schools.  Any progressive, forward-thinking and enlightened society would view what we are doing today - putting aside a number of training places in a college for people of a particular faith - as particularly weird.  Religious background should be of no relevance to anybody if a person wishes to become a teacher.  Unfortunately, we are still standing over a position where if a person is becoming a primary school teacher in this country, unless that person is willing to pay over the odds by using the Hibernia College online course, he or she must tick a box on religious faith.  Applicants to the majority of primary schools must also answer a pretty invasive question on faith and what religious ethos the person will stand over.<\/p><p> I have no difficulty with what is being introduced because it is, on the face of it, in line with the Constitution and without a constitutional change, our hands are tied.  Nevertheless, we should have a conversation about what we are asking of our young teachers and continually providing for in this State and Republic.  Effectively, the most important thing that seems to be asked of any individual is about religious background.  That relates to teachers, students and other practitioners in the educational field.  It sticks in my craw that we return to the issue repeatedly.<\/p><p> I respect the position in which we find ourselves but will the Minister of State comment on whether an amendment is in train with regard to the Employment Equality Act?  It would argue that State-funded religious institutions - either hospitals or schools - should not discriminate based on somebody's sexuality or private life if it could conflict with the ethos of the body.  How would that have an impact on training colleges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900004#C00800","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371644100,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's presentation this afternoon.  We have all had representations from parents and boards of management of Protestant schools with regard to this issue and there is a view among those on Protestant boards of management that there are more constitutional supports for some children than others.  It would be a very serious matter if that was the case.  That has been alleged in meetings and letters received from Protestant boards of management.  Are we proposing a different set of rights for Protestant and other denominations of children?  It is important that Protestant schools are treated equally, as claims are being made to Members in different constituencies that this is not the case.  I have received numerous letters from parents and boards of management across the midlands outlining concerns about a change in policy by the Government in the school system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900005#D00200","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1371644100,"counter":18,"content":"<p>As Deputy Bannon intimated, it seems to be more of a question of what type of education is being given to our children, as parents expect a certain quality.  They should not feel they need to go to a private school to get a better education or meet the right shakers and movers.  As a society, we should deliver an education for every child equally, and it must be of a high standard.<\/p><p>  If particular schools want to present a certain religious ethos, is there not space for them?  The Minister of State has indicated that under the Constitution this order must be made, which is fair enough.  If a school wants to promote a particular religion, it should have to fund the education of a teacher who comes in to practise a religious point, and other education should be given in a secular environment.  If parents or religious groups want to present a certain ethos to their children, the State should not have to support that.  It should be down to particular schools funding teachers who will educate the children in such religious matters.  It is bizarre to have to go through the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900005#D00300","speaker":"1032"},{"type":"speech","time":1371644100,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue's first question was about places and all 32 places have been taken and it has happened three times.  I did not really understand the third question and perhaps I misheard it.  There is a philosophical element in this, I suppose, and if I am reading the interventions by Deputies &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, Collins and Bannon correctly, there seems to be an issue with whether the State should provide wholly for education of primary and post-primary levels, or if there should be what could loosely be called a subvention for provision at schools where there is a particular religious ethos.  We are all aware of the particular provision proposed here, which is to ensure we can guarantee the teaching ethos through the Protestant tradition.  We would not necessarily disagree with that.<\/p><p>  Speaking personally, one could argue that religious formation for any citizen could take place through a Sunday school mechanism or outside normal teaching hours.  Nevertheless, the State provides for a number of hours, which is probably a vagary of our history of a strong Catholic ethos with other minority religions.  The education sector in Finland has 97% of schools within the state sector and religious formation is extraneous to the process.  The majority of the schools are within the public sphere.<\/p><p>  Ireland is a particular country with a specific history and traditions, so there is an historical narrative in that regard.  It is a question of where we are moving.  Are we looking to divest ourselves of any State intervention with schools of a particular ethos?  That is a particular philosophical question with which we must grapple.  I have a particular policy responsibility for science, technology, engineering and maths, and if members are asking me whether I believe we should spend more time in schools teaching in those areas than preparing for certain aspects of religious formation, I know I would prefer to invest the time in teaching core subjects.  That is a personal opinion.<\/p><p>  I sense from the committee that there is no difficulty with the provision being proposed.

When questioned about this recently, the college's representatives were delighted to be able to say that people could train to become teachers in whatever way they wanted, in the sense that if they wished to work in a Catholic, Islamic, Jewish or Protestant school one could avail of that tributary, as it were, within the education structure.

I am chief executive officer of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  In November 2012, SUSI management and I, as CEO, met the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and reported on the operation of SUSI at that time.  In January 2013 an update was issued to the joint committee following its request to have it for its meeting on 19 June 2013.<\/p><p>  I shall outline the present position.  The scheme for 2012-13 is now closed.  The scheme for 2013-14 has opened and a number of changes have been made to the application process for the coming year.  A dedicated website <i>susi.ie<\/i> is now in place and contains supporting information for all grant applicants.  <\/p><p>  Grant renewals is a responsibility for this year.  Renewal of grants for eligible applicants has commenced using the newly developed online renewal process and caters for existing SUSI students.<\/p><p>   An external review of the operation of SUSI was commissioned by CDVEC and carried out by Accenture.    The review was published and forms the basis for significant structural reform of the management and administration of SUSI.  The review's main recommendation is that the SUSI grants process be developed, on an agreed phased basis, over the coming years to be a fully web-based integrated automated grant application system.  The review found that SUSI had essentially a year to plan and implement its proposed new operating model for managing student grants at national level.  It identified a number of critical issues during the set-up phase that contributed to the operational issues experienced during the first few months.  It also acknowledged that SUSI had difficulty in securing all of the staff resources it required in the timeframe outlined in the agreed implementation plan.  Consequently, a significant amount of management time was spent addressing staff resourcing issues.<\/p><p>  There were communications and expectation difficulties that resulted in insufficient clarity and understanding provided to applicants regarding key dates, deadlines and documentary evidence required to support applications.  That complicated an already complex grants scheme for applicants, staff and other stakeholders.  It also contributed to different stakeholder expectations of what SUSI would deliver and when.  The resourcing and other issues experienced during set up and subsequently were largely resolved.<\/p><p>  With regard to information sharing, major processing development improvements have been achieved this year that includes the exchange of key data with Government and other agencies.  To date SUSI has agreed the following: direct transfer of data from Revenue Commissioners; direct access to appropriate Department of Social Protection or social welfare records; direct transfer of data from Central Applications Office; that course registration confirmation from individual universities and colleges will be confirmed as appropriate; that direct access to the Department of Education and Skill's pupil database records to establish and meet residency requirements will be available; and that the General Registration Office for confirmation of dates of birth and nationality will also be available.<\/p><p>  The ability to accommodate direct electronic communication with different public and private sector agencies is a core strength of SUSI.  It will greatly contribute to reducing the overall volume of paperwork from in excess of 1.8 million documents in 2012-2013.  This in turn will improve the experience of applicants in responding to document requests from SUSI and will greatly increase the efficiency of the grant awarding process in the coming year.<\/p><p>  We have examined communications in great detail.  A number of significant developments have been introduced to improve communication with applicants.  These improvements include: Publication of the <i>susi.ie<\/i> website for information and access to online applications; development of an online tracker system for applicants to monitor the progress of their applications; a structured email contact with existing students for the grant renewals process so that we can identify the existing students in receipt of grants and have been in direct contact with them; and a regular email contact with students through the CAO list.  The CAO asks students using its system to file an application whether they will lodge an application with SUSI.  Therefore, SUSI has had direct access to those students.  I will continue to list the improvements as follows:  Messaging of close by and return by dates for applicants; messaging of the need for self-employed and farmers to finalise their 2012 returns early; improved letter templates; an extensive use of social media; and a national campaign is taking place and this week there will also be local radio campaigns.<\/p><p>  By the end of June 2013, SUSI had received a total of 69,683 grant applications for the academic year 2012-13.  There are 118 cases outstanding that are complicated and difficult.  We awarded 39,524 grants and 30,041 people were ineligible.  The award category means that 39,524 students have been approved for either a full grant or a fees only grant, that the grant had been paid and that all activity regarding the grant application had been finalised.  The ineligible category includes all those who were refused because they did not meet the eligibility criteria.  It also includes those who cancelled or withdrew their application.  In many cases this happened because applicants realised, after making their application, that they did not meet the eligibility criteria.  Applications in the &quot;awaiting student documentation&quot; category includes a very small number of residual applications that are still under examination.<\/p><p>  By the end of 2012 grants processing was fully up to date for completed applications and the turnaround at that stage was 48 hours.  By the end of December 2012, almost 70% of the full year out-turn of awarded grants had already been awarded.  By the end of January 2013 the figure had risen to 85%.  The scheme for 2012-13 is now formally closed.  Approximately 12,000 applications were received after the formal closing date of 31 August.  <\/p><p>  SUSI has an internal review process that is followed by an independent internal and external appeals processes which ensures that all applicants are treated in a fair and consistent manner.  The total number of successful internal appeals for 2012-13 was 4,260 or 6% of the total of 69,693 applications received.<\/p><p>  The scheme for 2013-14 has been open since 20 May and SUSI has been processing new grant applications and grant renewals since that date.  The opening date is three weeks ahead of the equivalent date in 2012-13.  We have already received 30,428 applications for 2013-14 of which 13,841 are new applications and 16,587 are renewal applications.<\/p><p>  SUSI expected a total of around 26,000 applications for renewal.  By 13 June we had received 16,587 applications.  Grant renewal is a simple online process.  Students whose financial circumstances are unchanged are able to renew their grants by ticking four simple questions on an online form.  By building on the information that is already available to us we can process renewals in a timely and efficient manner.  SUSI does not expect that all 39,000 grantholders of 2012-13 will apply for grant renewal for a variety of reasons.  A number attend one year post leaving certificate or post-graduate courses, others will drop out and a number will not meet formal progression criteria for continuity on their chosen course.  I will give a breakdown of the status of the 16,587 renewal applications received as of 13 June.  Effectively, 12,701 renewal applications have been awarded, 86 are ineligible, 3,345 are awaiting initial assessment, 423 await student documentation and 32 await final assessment.  The closing date for renewals was Friday, 14 June 2013.  A number of current grantholders have yet to formally apply for grant renewal and SUSI will be contacting those students to generate their appropriate application form.  Some flexibility will be shown regarding the closing date for renewals.<\/p> <p>Renewing students whose circumstances have changed will be reassessed and may be required to submit evidence of the change so that a new assessment of grant eligibility can be made.  Grant renewal is subject to progression to the next year of the college course and confirmation will be obtained by SUSI directly from the college in question where possible.<\/p><p> The system of application will be much simpler for new applicants in 2013-14 than in 2012-13.  I mentioned the links with bodies such as the Revenue Commissioners, social welfare records at the Department of Social Protection, the CAO, universities and colleges, the Department of Education and Skills pupil database records and the General Registration Office, GRO.  This means the majority of applicants do not have to directly provide documents such as P60 or P21 forms, social welfare information and college information.  The capacity to engage directly at a macro level with other State bodies is a key strength of a single awarding body.  This capacity will provide accurate and certified information to SUSI and will significantly speed up the determination of grant eligibility for all applicants.<\/p><p> For some applicants, just two items of information will be required in order to make decisions on eligibility and payment.  These are the signed student declaration form and the student bank information details.  For the self-employed and farming community, a grant cannot be awarded until SUSI has received a notice of assessment issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  In order to get a notice of assessment, these applicants will need to file their end of year returns to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of their 2012 accounts as soon as possible.  A breakdown of the status of the 13,841 applications received as of 13 June is as follows.  Some 395 were awarded or provisionally awarded, 870 were ineligible, 3,858 are awaiting initial assessment, 7,618 are awaiting student documentation and 1,100 are awaiting final assessment.  We have developed strong partnership links with all stakeholders in the grant application process.  It recognises values and intends to build on those links.  By combining strong partnership with experienced external professional analysis and advice, we intend to deliver a better service to grant applicants in 2013-14 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900007#F00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacinta Stewart","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371645900,"counter":48,"content":"<p>The agreed format is that we take the spokespersons first, followed by members in order of indication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900008#G00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1371645900,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank the SUSI officials for coming in and for the briefings provided in the past.  The experience of the past year has been unfortunate, particularly for students.  It has been a difficult year for SUSI officials getting the agency up and running.  The Department of Education and Skills did not think it out in advance.  Much of the work done by SUSI in terms of preparing for next year and linking with Government agencies to reduce the volume of documentation that must be requested from students should have been dealt with in advance of the central grant authority being set up.  When I questioned the Minister on this point, on how the process was set in train and the central grant authority grant awarded, his response was that his Department had very little experience in the administration of student grants.  This lack of experience led to the awarding process.  He said expressions of interest were invited by those who may be interested in setting up a central grant authority.  It was up to those who came before the Department expressing interest to convince the Department how it should be done.  The Minister said that County Dublin VEC was the most convincing and that he went with them.  This led to the results in the past year, with difficulties and a lack of preparation in terms of how it might pan out.  Miscalculations were made in respect of SUSI and the requirements to meet the demand but there was also a serious miscalculation by the Department of Education and Skills in accepting projections and in not providing the expected staff, as highlighted by the Accenture report.<\/p><p>  The students in the country suffered because of last year's first years being a trial run for setting up the central grant awarding agency.  It did not work on the basis of timely administration.  What was the cost of SUSI last year compared to what it would have been under the old system, with 66 grant awarding bodies administering the grants?  The calculation may be difficult.  The upshot was that over half of the students awarded a grant did not receive a payment until after Christmas.  That meant many students eligible for the special rate of maintenance grant, over &euro;6,000, did not get paid until the new year.  Anyone eligible for the special rate comes from a family whose income is under the &euro;21,000 threshold.  That includes social welfare families, those with no income or families on minimum wage jobs.  Where a member of the family was in college and living in campus or rented accommodation, from September of last year until after Christmas the family was trying to keep the child in college when means were exceptionally strained already.  People living on minimum wage jobs or social welfare had to pay for running the family in the homestead, pay weekly or monthly rent for students away from home, maintain them and pay school costs.  It was unacceptable that the Government oversees the situation.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, suggested the move to a central grant awarding body was a demonstration of public service reform at its best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900008#G00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1371645900,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue has been speaking for seven minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900008#G00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1371645900,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I will try to conclude.

How many cases have been appealed or are being reviewed at present?  There is an issue of the applications in need of resolution being escalated.  The cases may be difficult at this stage but many can be resolved.  I and other Deputies received complaints from members of the public who are getting different stories.  A parent contacted me yesterday.  Her son was told he was due a special rate yet when he phoned back later he was told he was not entitled to it.  We need to have this resolved next year.  It should not be happening.  Those who have not been awarded grants have sat exams and cannot get exam results because the college will not give them out if they have not paid registration fees.  How many are in that category?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900008#G00500","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1371645900,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Stewart and her team.  Today is very different to the heated meeting we had in November.<\/p> <p>As a result of that meeting and the fact we got the opportunity to question the group, there was more focus on rectifying the existing problems as soon as possible.<\/p><p> One of the things said at the meeting was that we must get through the backlog of applicants and get as many students as possible their grants so they have their money and then we can review what went wrong.  We all know the whole system was a complete dog's dinner but it was not solely down to SUSI.  The Department also must take responsibility for much of what went wrong last year.  It is clear from the report that one of the biggest issues was that the staff promised to SUSI did not get there on time and, as a result, there was constant firefighting.<\/p><p> Having said that, it is clear from our own meetings with the team in recent weeks and from the briefings we have had that many of these issues have been rectified and should not reoccur this year.  We know the systems that have been put in place and the issues that arose last year.  In fairness to SUSI, I am more confident we will not see the same level of disorganisation and disarray that we saw last year which resulted in some students being forced to drop out of college.  The witnesses went through some of the systems that have been put in place to talk directly to the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection, and all of those will help.  There is a new website up and running and since the application process was opened for 2013-14.  We have had no correspondence to our office and no complaints about the new system.<\/p><p> There are some areas where the message could be better communicated, such as what people are actually entitled to.  There was a lot of confusion last year over what students, particularly those studying outside the State, were entitled to.  Perhaps the witnesses could put on record the entitlements, if they are fees, maintenance grants and so on.  In the Six Counties, not all colleges fall under the remit and even in the colleges that do, not all courses come under the remit.  It is an opportunity to put that on the record.<\/p><p> There was also a big issue last year where people were being told to appeal decisions when they should have just been reviewed.  If that had happened, those students could have been taken out of the system much earlier.  What process has been put in place to ensure we do not see a repeat of that this year?<\/p><p> The other major complaint was that even when students were approved for a maintenance grant and fees, payment was often delayed.  The provision of bank details was a major area of complaint and I know SUSI has rectified that.  How was that done?  It is important that the committee and the media communicate that fact.  There is a confidence issue still surrounding this, and going by the last 12 months, because of the failings within SUSI and the whole grant system, there will be an apprehension around whether that will be repeated this year.  I am confident we are not going to see the same level of problems, although things can pop up and we must react to them.  I am satisfied that the systems put in place for the coming year will address many of the major issues identified in the report that caused so many difficulties.  If SUSI can outline how it has dealt with those issues, perhaps the media will pick up on it and we can restore some of the confidence in the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900008#G00600","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371646500,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses from SUSI.

Are there enough staff to deal with that?  Are there figures for the number of students who had to drop out because they were unable to access payments early enough?

One of the mistakes we made in the initial stages was to put those who had been refused straight into the appeals process.  We should have provided for internal reviews in such cases.  This would have sorted out the issue relating to the adjacent rate and non-adjacent rate much more quickly.  Next year, we will use internal reviews to ascertain quickly whether it is possible that a mistake has been made.  The matter of adjacent and non-adjacent rates is an example of that.  These reviews will be done by a different VEC - the City of Cork VEC - on behalf of SUSI.  Students who have gone through that system will then be able to appeal to a national appeals board, which has a separate statutory basis.  It is actually independent of everybody.  I should also mention that SUSI has come under the ambit of the Ombudsman since 1 May last.  The concerns dealt with in that context largely relate to administration and the general functions of the Ombudsman's office.

Many of these cases have been referred to us by Members of the Oireachtas, including members of this committee, as well as by the applicants themselves.  We have two areas of difficulty, the first of which is proof of estrangement.  I might as well bring up the other issue - independent living - as part of this process.  The student grants scheme and, more importantly, the statutory instrument that supports it, do not leave SUSI with much room in how we interpret estrangement or independent living.  As part of our process of submitting an end-of-year return to the Department, when it is reviewing the scheme for next year, we will be lobbying for those two areas to be revisited.  We have encountered many cases of applicants in their late teens who are estranged from their families, where every other form of evidence available to us suggests there is a need.  We cannot take such cases across the line because the statutory instrument requires us to have specific types of evidence.  The 118 cases mentioned by Ms Stewart comprise the final tranche of cases we are trying to bring to the award stage.  I assure the committee that each of them must be considered by hand.  Unfortunately, we do not have the latitude under the scheme to make an arbitrary decision.  As I said earlier, we want to make improvements in this area.  We will seek the support of the Department in this regard.<\/p><p>  I do not propose to get into any specific cases of estrangement.  At least two members of the committee are familiar with cases that are outstanding.  Other cases relate to claims of independent living.  As the committee knows, one has to be over the age of 23 before one can fall into the independent living category.  We have dealt with a number of applicants who are renting the \"extra bedroom\" in a private house, but whose landlord is not registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  They do not have bank statements being sent to them at that address.  They do not have television licences in their own name at that address.  Large numbers of people do not seem to be in a position to give us the level of evidence associated with the many documents we accept.  In many cases, rather than simply telling people their applications have been refused, we have attempted to go back to them.  With the help of Members of the Oireachtas, in some cases, we have tried to get the individuals in question to identify a document somewhere - even a car insurance statement - that would serve as the necessary proof.  We have taken a great deal of flak over the last six months regarding what has happened in these two areas, and we will continue to take some flak.

I believe both speakers asked whether we had enough staff.  We have 99 staff at present.  That figure will increase to 116.  To put it in the terms we use, we had 65 whole-time equivalents and we have 88 whole-time equivalents this year.  There are times during the year, depending on SUSI's cycle, when we are very busy.  That is why our staff complement might reach 99 or 116 before we downsize at quieter times of the year.  We are employing the full number of staff that has been approved for this year.<\/p><p>  Deputy Collins asked what we are doing to help students avoid dropping out.  We are opening earlier for applications.  In an ideal world, we would like to open the applications process at the same time as the CAO applications process.  When people fill in their college applications, they should be able to fill in their grant applications at the same time.  In the initial stages of the process, applicants do not have to tell us what college they are planning to attend.  We want the message to students to be clearer.  We have to be as clear as we can.  We need to process applications more quickly.<\/p><p>  This brings us back to the issue of reducing the amount of paperwork.  The reduction from 66 to one in the number of agencies doing this work has enabled us to co-operate with bodies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the General Register Office.  They would not be able to provide information to 66 bodies but they are able to provide it to us.  Mr. Connolly has done a great deal of work to ensure that is happening.  We have online access to other State bodies.  As I said, that has been hugely beneficial.<\/p><p>  Mr. Conroy spoke about the issue of students getting stuck in the system.  There are some cases of estrangement, for example.<\/p><p>  We were asked whether the number of appeals is relatively high.  We hope to eliminate much of that at the internal review stage by identifying problems more quickly.  I do not think we are naive enough to expect not to encounter problems.  One of the challenges for us is to deal with these cases as quickly as possible.  We hope it will work much better if we can ensure people are not put through a long process at the internal review stage.  As members will be aware, there is a 30-day requirement and all kinds of things are involved.<\/p><p>  I think I have dealt with the cost and staffing issues that were raised by Senator O'Donnell.  The main reasons for ineligibility, which she also asked about, are non-qualification in respect of income and failure to submit documents or to do so on time.  I was surprised that we received so many applications after the closing date.  A large proportion of those cases related to changes in circumstances.  Nevertheless, they were deemed to be late applications.  That is a concern.<\/p><p>  We were also asked about SUSI's main problems.  I think communications have to be better and clearer.  Anybody who examines this system will learn that it is based on a statutory instrument.  It is a clear that a huge amount of information is involved.  We are seeking to reduce what the student has to give us by arranging for other State bodies to provide that information directly, obviously with the permission of the student.<\/p> <p>This should make the process faster and clarify some of the issues that are emerging - for instance, independent means and estrangement - thus allowing us to identify them to the Department.  These are clearly national issues which need to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900010#J01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacinta Stewart","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371647700,"counter":68,"content":"<p>SUSI receives &euro;7.1 million and has 88 whole-time staff.

While I am not a member of the joint committee, I am aware that SUSI has an ongoing relationship with the committee and Ms Stewart has appeared before it on a number of occasions.<\/p><p>  No other organisation has created a greater burden of work for my constituency office than SUSI.  We have found it virtually impossible to deal with the organisation, as have the students and parents who have had to interact with it.  I do not propose to focus this discussion on my office or any other office.  I will focus instead on the impact of the current problems on students.  I am still dealing with cases in which grant applications have not been processed.  Students have suffered the ignominy of being refused entry to the library of their college or having to make special arrangements to take examinations.  Some will not receive their examination results because their cases have not been concluded.  This has a major impact on their lives and those of their parents and causes great trauma.  There are people at their wits' end as a result of this mess.  While I may be concerned about the efforts being made by my staff or Ms Stewart's staff, that is not the main problem.  The issue here is the lives of young people who are trying to get an education that will enable them to enter the workforce.  Members who know me will agree that I do not engage in grandstanding.  It does not give me pleasure to raise these issues.<\/p> <p>It is the lives of young people that are hugely affected and hugely traumatised by the mistakes of the City of Dublin VEC for expressing an interest in something which, clearly, it was not ready for.  I am amazed it would have sought a contract for which it was ill-prepared.  That it should bring Accenture in half way through a process is mind-boggling.<\/p><p> One of my questions to Ms Jacinta Stewart is who is taking responsibility for making that expression of interest and being so poorly resourced, so poorly informed and so poorly structured to deliver that service?  I like the idea of the public service taking on more work.  I liked the idea that it did not fall into the hands of a private organisation because I believe in public service.  However, I have to say the respect for public service is eroded every day when an organisation such as this fails in such a monumental way to reach the standard it would have been expected to reach.  Is there a service level agreement in place between the CDVEC and the Department of Education and Skills?  Has any discussion taken place with the Minister and the Department in respect of the breaches of that service level agreement?  Has the organisation been penalised in terms of the payment from the Department, based on its failure to meet the service that would have been expected?  Does such an agreement exist?  Perhaps it does not.  I do not want to put all the blame on the organisation.  There is an equal burden of blame on the Minister and the Department of Education and Skills for accepting in good faith what it proposed to deliver.  It might be excusable if for some reason the organisation had no knowledge or history of dealing with grants but it did, therefore, it should have been able to put in place an appropriate model to meet the standard.  Will Ms Stewart please explain who will take responsibility?  I will be straight, has Ms Stewart considered her position as a result of the failure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900011#K01700","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371648300,"counter":85,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1371648300,"counter":86,"content":"<p>On a point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900012#L00300","speaker":"1013"},{"type":"speech","time":1371648300,"counter":87,"content":"<p>With respect, I have asked a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900012#L00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1371648300,"counter":88,"content":"<p>There is a point of order.

All of the questions and issues raised by Deputy Dooley were raised in the previous two committee meetings.  I commence by saying it was a crisis.  Once it gave the exact contact numbers for Deputies and Senators I saw a huge improvement.  I state categorically that Mr. John Conroy helped me with the most complex case that ever came before my office.  The family in question had been refused three times.  That was not right.  Once we got a lead-in to a person who looked at a very complex case, both grants for that family were granted at two different levels.  One was adjacent and one was non-adjacent.  I compliment him on that.  Communication was a huge issue.  I found it has improved and is no longer a huge issue.  I respectfully say to Deputy Dooley that, perhaps, because he is not a member of the committee he did not have the same information.  It is an issue for SUSI to ensure the information gets out to all Oireachtas representatives.<\/p><p>  Will SUSI clarify the maximum income a person can earn to qualify for the various grant levels?  I understand it is between &euro;39,800 and &euro;54,000.  I have encountered some incredibly complex cases, for example, a family where there is a PAYE income and a spouse in a business that is losing money.  Let us assume the PAYE person is on the maximum of &euro;54,000 or, for the sake of argument, &euro;75,000, and if, as Deputy Ray Butler said, the spouse is in a business that is losing money and has losses of, say, &euro;40,000, does that family still qualify for a grant, even though one income exceeds the threshold?  Is it the net family income that counts?  I would appreciate a clear answer to that question.  <\/p><p>  I have a son who is finishing his leaving certificate today.  Given that the dates are being brought how will that benefit students as the child or the family will not know which college the child will enter.  It could be Galway, Dublin, Limerick or Cork.  How can students apply for a grant without knowing where they will be?  How is that a genuine, authentic application?  Will it not mean double the work once the child accepts the offer of a college place?  <\/p><p>  I wish to refer to a matter raised by Deputy Dooley.  We got a commitment at one point, if I am correct, from universities and colleges around the country - certainly from Galway - that no student would be disadvantaged in terms of access to, say, the library if SUSI was slow.  Can the witnesses verify how many colleges gave that commitment to SUSI?<\/p><p>  The examination situation is very serious.  I understand from what Deputy Dooley has said that the students were allowed sit the examination but did not have the examination results presented to them because that information needs to go on the record.  Which colleges are we speaking about?  It would be a huge disadvantage, especially if they are final examinations.  If they are final examinations and as some colleges have wonderful internships available they could be dependent on examination results.  Therefore, we need accuracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900012#L02200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1371648300,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I can take more questions if that is what Members wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900012#L02300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1371648300,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee.

Accenture used the term \"KPI\", key performance indicators.  To answer Deputy Dooley's questions, we have been giving those returns to the Department on a weekly basis.  A total of 2,666 appeals were refused and it was because the original decisions were sound.  We expect 75,000 new applications and 25,000 renewals this year, so approximately 100,000 in total.  Deputies Butler and McConalogue asked about the possibility that people could provide returns going back two years.  That would have to be part of the statutory instrument that comes in each March or April.  There is processing that is currently taking place, along with IT development and business improvement.  We need to examine that in terms of business improvement and ask if there are implications there that we need to think out, not just for ourselves but also for the Department, and we must think of national implications.  For PAYE people one would be looking at 2012, whereas for farmers and the self-employed it would be 2011.  One of the questions would be whether that matters.  It must be examined and that would be part of our business improvement process.<\/p><p>  We had three staff in January 2012, 28 in April, 57 in June, 78 in September and 98 in December.

In its first year SUSI processed 70,000 applications in a situation in which 95% of our staff were new.  We provided full training and developed a range of quality assurance checks across different levels.  However, as in any people-based assessment system, human errors occurred.  The student grant scheme is complicated and, by its nature, strictly defined and does not allow for exceptions.  Almost 40,000 students have been awarded and paid grants for 2012-2013.  Eight out of ten of those were awarded by the beginning of the second term.  As the Accenture report states, regardless of the issues, both SUSI and our stakeholders rose to the challenge and tried to meet the targets.  Deputy Dooley asked who was to blame.  One of the things we tried to hold together in this is not to blame anybody.  We had a problem and we tried to deal with it and sort it out.

Our connections in particular with the CAO this year will make that process far more efficient than it was last year when they had to finish the final course acceptance forms.  As a result of the fact that one can make an application and subsequently not go to college, there are approximately 14,000 people we assessed who did not proceed to further education, for several reasons.  In some cases they did not get enough points, some could not afford it,even with the grants, or they were just over the income thresholds as it was.  We made 50,000 telephone calls between January and the end of March asking each of those 14,000 were they proceeding with their applications or whether they were cancelled or refused.

It is exceptionally important that they are dealt with quickly but also that they are shown consideration and if this statutory instrument is posing a problem I will ask the Chairman of this meeting to write to the Minister for Education and Skills about these people indicating that we learnt today there is a difficulty for them.<\/p> <p>I ask that we write to the Minister for Education and Skills, indicating that we were told today there is a difficulty.  Students have had enough trouble throughout the year and we should ask that the Minister engage with SUSI with a view to dealing specifically with them, ensure they get answers as quickly as possible and are dealt with sympathetically. <\/p><p> I understand 543 applications are currently under appeal.  That is a high number this late in the year.  Most students have finished their examinations.  Some students will not win their appeals, as one would expect.  I ask for clarification on the current situation.  We have evidence that colleges are not giving exam results to students in that category because they have not paid the registration fees.  That is a serious position in which to be and I have no doubt if one spoke to colleges they would probably tell one they are concerned that if they gave exam results to students, in particular those who have completed one year or diploma courses, that they will not get the fees owed. <\/p><p> It is an unfortunate that 543 students are in the appeals process awaiting an answer, some of whom will be successful while others will not.  We need to convey our views to the Minister and tell him he needs to engage with third level institutions to ensure students get their exam results.  As was said by Deputy Dooley, we cannot have a situation where people do not know whether they can go to college next year, cannot make plans for the future or decide whether to travel to the United States as they cannot get their exam results because they have not got answers on grant applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013061900014#N02200","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371650100,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions.

I remind members and witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.<\/p><p>  Before we commence, I wish to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular subject and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against an individual or an entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the chair to the effect members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>  I will set the stage in regard to what the committee is seeking in proposing to engage with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on a quarterly review of the 2013 public expenditure against profile.  This has two aspects: the revenue side, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, and the expenditure side, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The committee wants to get the view from altitude on both revenue and expenditure on a quarterly basis.  This concept arose in the committee at the latter end of the fourth quarter last year.  The expected revenue and expenditure in day-to-day operations and management of an annual budget are given a profile, and monthly, quarterly and half yearly reviews of both expenditure and review take place, and if there is any divergence, action can be taken.<\/p><p>  This engagement is only on a quarterly basis and it is the expectation of the committee that by getting a view from altitude, we can better manage public money and reduce or eliminate altogether the spectre we had last year of &euro;1.2 billion of Supplementary Estimates.  By reviewing the profiles of expenditure and review, action can be taken far earlier by rectifying shortfalls to cover both over and under-expenditure.<\/p><p>  In layman's language, if the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform determines a figure for a Department, and if that figure is exceeded by &euro;10 per week in quarter one, quarter two or quarter three, or if there is a reduction of &euro;10 per week and that reduction is not met in quarter one, two or three, that means there is a &euro;40 adjustment every week for the remainder of quarter four.  These difficulties create massive problems in the management of budgets and politically.  The difficulty of such an approach is that it leads to bad fiscal governance in that Departments who run over budget dip into the budgets of other Departments to acquire their funds and it creates a situation where budgetary targets in quarter one or two that are not being reached create problems where savings are not achievable or the implementation of the saving is not being appropriately managed.  It is on this basis the committee is looking at the Minister's budget.  It is an entirely different process from looking at the Estimates, which guess the sums that will be involved for the next year.  This is an examination of the operational budget of a Department in real time to ensure what was agreed in the budget is being achieved.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for engaging with this committee's proposal and commend him on doing so.  I welcome the Minister, who is here to discuss how this will actually happen.  This will be a long meeting because we are dealing with two items.  There has been a great deal of speculation about whether the disposal of State assets is happening.  Can the Minister tell us from the outset of his engagement with the committee today whether the Coillte assets are being disposed of?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900003#D00200","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371656100,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for inviting me to discuss these important issues.  I am accompanied by the officials he named and by Ms Eileen Fitzpatrick, the director of NewERA, which will soon have statutory responsibility for managing State assets, looking at a national State shareholding investment profile and getting good value for the State's shareholding in companies in the semi-state sector.  I would prefer to deliver my presentation in a structured way.  I will answer the question asked by the Chairman in the course of setting out the full position, as it now stands, regarding the sale of State assets.<\/p><p>  The committee is well aware of the position this Government inherited when it took office.  The economy was in crisis and the State was unable to fund itself.  We were completely dependent on funding from the EU and the IMF for our day-to-day spending under a programme negotiated by the previous Administration.  The original EU-IMF programme dealt with the issue of asset disposals, among other matters.  It required the Irish authorities to undertake an independent assessment of the electricity and gas sectors, building on the work of the review group on State assets and liabilities, and to then consult the Commission with a view to setting appropriate targets for the privatisation of State-owned assets.  The work of the review group on State assets and liabilities, which was chaired by Colm McCarthy and had been commissioned by the previous Government, was still in train at that time but was approaching finalisation.  When the group subsequently reported in April 2011, it concluded that the realisation of proceeds from the sale of State assets offered the potential to assist in tackling the fiscal crisis by reducing the debt burden on the State and by supporting economic recovery through enhanced productivity, efficiency and competitiveness.  It recommended that a planned programme of non-strategic asset sales should be undertaken.<\/p><p>  When the two Government parties negotiated a programme for Government in 2011, we recognised that a new approach to the management and use of State assets was required as part of the overall solution to the fiscal crisis.  In that context, we agreed that the NewERA concept would be developed as a new way of seeking to manage more effectively our commercial State companies in the key sectors of energy, telecommunications, forestry and water.  We also agreed to seek to release value from the State&rsquo;s portfolio of assets to free up badly needed resources which could be used for investment purposes to help to stimulate growth and employment.  A target of &euro;2 billion from the sale of non-strategic State assets was agreed in the programme for Government, drawing from the recommendations of the review group on State assets and liabilities, but with the assets only to be sold when market conditions were right and when adequate regulatory structures had been established to protect consumer rights.<\/p><p>  It is well established and well documented that during our negotiations with the EU-IMF troika, initially there was very little willingness on the part of the troika to allow us to retain any proceeds from our asset disposal programme.  They wanted us to use all of the proceeds for debt reduction.  They also wanted us to engage in an asset disposal programme on a much larger scale than had been agreed in the programme for Government.  Very tough negotiations over a protracted period of time were required before we finally got an acceptable deal on these matters.  I visited Brussels as part of the negotiation process, in addition to the negotiations that took place during the many troika missions to Ireland.  I believe we got a satisfactory deal in the end.  I secured an agreement that, in return for increasing the level of ambition of our asset disposal programme to a &euro;3 billion target, we could retain half of the proceeds to fund additional employment-enhancing projects of a commercial nature.  It was further agreed that the other half of the proceeds, while eventually destined to pay down debt, could also be retained and, in the first instance, constituted as a fund to underpin additional lending into Ireland in support of further investment in job creation initiatives.  If members are interested in the mechanics of that, I can explain them in some detail.<\/p><p>  Importantly, we agreed that there would be no fire sales, that assets would be sold on acceptable terms and at a price that achieved fair value for the Exchequer, and that key strategic assets, such as our electricity and gas transmission and distribution systems, were not for sale but would be retained in State ownership.  It was on that basis that the Government last year agreed the composition of a programme of asset disposals, with a target of realising proceeds of up to &euro;3 billion.  The programme involves four key elements.  First, we agreed the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s energy business, not including its gas transmission or distribution systems or the two gas interconnectors.  As I have said, they will always remain in State ownership.  Second, we agreed the sale of some of the ESB&rsquo;s non-strategic power generation capacity.  Third, we agreed the disposal of the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus when market conditions are favourable and on terms that are acceptable to the Government.  Fourth, after further consideration and after ruling out the sale of Coillte&rsquo;s land holdings, the Government determined that a concession for the harvesting rights of Coillte forests represented at that time the best option to release value from Coillte in the short to medium term.<\/p><p>  Interdepartmental steering groups were established to prepare for the disposal of each of these assets and, ultimately, to oversee the actual disposal transactions.  These steering groups comprised representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the relevant sectoral Departments, the Department of Finance and NewERA.  The steering groups have worked closely with the management of the individual companies to analyse the various financial, policy and technical issues that may arise in connection with the proposed transactions.  They also prepared detailed valuations in each case.  I will outline the latest position regarding each of the assets.  After months of planning, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann formally launched the sale process for its energy business, Bord G&aacute;is Energy, on 3 May last.  The closing date for initial bids under the first round of the sale process was 12 June.  The board of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, along with its advisers and assisted by NewERA, is handling the disposal process.  It is currently assessing the initial bids that have been received with a view to selecting the final bids to be brought forward for the second stage of the process.  The interdepartmental steering group is overseeing the process on behalf of the Government.  The transaction is expected to be concluded before the end of this year.<\/p><p>  The ESB made an announcement last October regarding the sale of some of its non-strategic generation capacity, involving a package of assets being brought to the market on a phased basis commencing in 2013.  In February, the ESB announced its intention to sell its 50% shareholding in each of its international tolling plants - Marchwood in the United Kingdom and Amorbieta in Spain.  The Marchwood transaction formally commenced on 28 May last and the Amorbieta transaction is expected to be formally launched this week.  Both transactions are expected to be completed before the end of this year.  Work is also continuing on planning for the further components of the ESB's disposal package that were announced by the company last October.  Details of these further components will be made public by the ESB, subject to commercial considerations, in due course.<\/p><p>  The European Commission recently completed its investigation of Ryanair&rsquo;s bid for Aer Lingus.  The UK Competition Commission's investigation is ongoing.  These investigations have been complicating factors in the disposal of this asset.  The UK Competition Commission has issued a provisional finding that Ryanair's shareholding gives it the ability to influence the commercial policy and strategy of Aer Lingus on routes between Britain and Ireland.  Its final findings are expected early next month.  These matters will continue to be taken into account in the Government&rsquo;s plans for how to proceed with the disposal of its stake in that company.<\/p> <p>However, it is the Government&rsquo;s view that optimal conditions do not currently exist for a sale of the Government&rsquo;s remaining shareholding.  Nevertheless, it remains open to considering opportunities to dispose of its shareholding and will, in the meantime, continue to manage the holding in a responsible manner to protect the State's interests, with the aim of maximising its value.<\/p><p> With regard to Coillte, a number of detailed financial, technical and other specialist reports were prepared for the company in late 2012 by external specialist consultancy bodies, in full consultation with the board of Coillte and its executive management.  These covered all of the issues that have been raised by various interest groups, and on which I answered questions in the House on many occasions, including replanting obligations to ensure the continued existence of our forests, harvesting policy, the supply of timber to sawmills and the implications for a post-transaction Coillte.  The reports concluded that a disposal of Coillte&rsquo;s harvesting rights, which comprise much of the current value in the company, would have major implications for the future viability of the remaining business, particularly given its significant capital requirements.<\/p><p> The reports have been considered by the interdepartmental steering group established to oversee the Coillte transaction process, which recently reported to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and me regarding its work to date.  The outcome of this work was considered by the Government at its meeting this afternoon.  The Government has agreed with the joint recommendation made by me and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that it is not an appropriate time to proceed with the sale of harvesting rights in Coillte.  Instead, the focus must be on the restructuring of Coillte as a company to address the issues that were identified in the reviews undertaken.  To this end, the company is to undergo a fundamental restructuring to be overseen by NewERA and the relevant stakeholder Departments, namely, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Public Expenditure and Reform, which will include operational streamlining, financial deleveraging and a critical examination of the disposal options for its non-core activities such as telecoms and wind.  A robust analysis will also be carried out to evaluate how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Coillte with Bord na M&oacute;na to create a streamlined and refocused commercial State company operating in the bio-energy and forestry sectors, as committed to in the programme for Government.  A priority in this regard will be the annual delivery by Coillte of a material financial dividend to the State.  We intend to fill the significant number of vacancies that will arise on the Coillte board this year by persons with relevant experience and commercial expertise to drive the restructuring process and merger with Bord na M&oacute;na if approved by Government.<\/p><p> I propose to comment on how we propose to use the proceeds generated from these asset disposals, as this is the reason we embarked on the process in the first instance.  As members will be aware, it has been the Government&rsquo;s consistent position that funds released from disposals should be used to support job creating initiatives in the economy.  As I outlined, the agreement reached with the troika was that all of the Government&rsquo;s proceeds from the State asset disposal programme will potentially be available, in one shape or another, for job creation.<\/p><p> The infrastructure stimulus plan I announced in July 2012 included an Exchequer element of &euro;850 million to be funded through some of the proceeds of the sale of State assets and the new licensing arrangements for the national lottery.  This money will be used as a project preparation facility for the new public private partnership programme and to fund additional Exchequer capital projects and other commercial and publicly needed projects.<\/p><p> The &euro;150 million Exchequer investment I announced on 5 June represents the first phase of this Exchequer stimulus to support further investment in schools, non-national roads and housing insulation and refit.  While this is a modest level of funding, it is additional to the &euro;3.4 billion capital programme for this year and will be augmented over time once proceeds come on stream and additional projects are identified by the Government.<\/p><p> My Department, in conjunction with relevant spending Departments, will assess what further projects we can invest in once the proceeds are realised later this year.  We will need to consider this issue carefully in the coming months.  Any potential further projects for investment must be aligned with Government priorities, must meet infrastructural deficits and must pass all of the appraisal and evaluation tests associated with capital projects, an issue that members have underlined repeatedly.<\/p><p> The policy pursued by the Government over the past two years, in terms of the approach taken to release value from some of our non-strategic State assets to realise additional funds to help fund a stimulus programme remains valid and appropriate in the current circumstances.  I am confident that the asset disposals we have outlined will be implemented in an efficient and effective manner and the proceeds generated will facilitate much needed additional investment in worthwhile projects in the months ahead in support of our common objective of economic recovery.  I will answer any questions members may wish to raise on these matters.<\/p><p> The joint committee is interested in considering the quarterly position as regards expenditure, having recently discussed the position as regards taxes and revenue with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  Obviously, a key feature of the expenditure management structure is that responsibility and accountability for each area of spending lies, in the first instance, with the relevant line Minister and his or her Department.  In addition, a range of Oireachtas committees have a remit in the various sectoral spending areas.  I will be pleased to explore with the committee how best to approach this matter, including the basis the Chairman outlined, while being mindful of the roles of spending Ministers, their Departments and other committees of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900004#E00200","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371656700,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

As we are beginning to exit the bailout programme and that target is on the horizon, given that the promissory note issue has been resolved and that other matters in regard to the long-term restructuring of the banking debt and other debts have been put in place, is it time the other 50%, rather than paring down debt, was targeted towards the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, in case of a rainy day?

First, there is what he classifies as the 50-50 split.  It is absolutely true that in my first engagement with the troika it was clearly of the view - this is sometimes contested - that the agreement was that the proceeds of the sale of any State assets would be used to retire debt.  It was adamant that would be the case.  It took some time for the troika to move to the agreement with me that 50% of the actual proceeds could be reinvested in commercially viable enterprises that would generate jobs in the economy.  It did not end there; I went back again to ask about the other 50%.  What led me to do that was the difficulties we had in getting the first public-private partnerships back on track because we did not have an AAA-rated bank to partner the European Investment Bank for PPP proposals, as required by the bank's own internal statutes.  I discovered that one of the things Greece was able to do was to use unspent structural funds as a backstop - a guarantee - and that was acceptable to the European Investment Bank.  We did not have any unspent structural funds as we spend every euro.  I thought we could use that money as a backstop, and that is one of the areas where we might be able to use the residual 50% before it eventually goes to pay down debt.<\/p><p>  I want to make a comment about the debt.  Although we have come a long way in the past two years in a very significant process, we have reprofiled the debt over a longer period.  We have reduced the interest payments, saving us some &euro;10 billion, and reduced the interest rate by 2.5%.  We have torn up the promissory note and rescheduled the repayments on the promissory note - rather than having bullet payments on an annual basis of just over &euro;3 billion - to a profile of 34 years on average, reducing the demand for money.  All of that is true and it has taken the pressure off, but it does not take away from the fact that our debt will peak this year at &euro;123% of GDP, which is still shockingly high.  We are determined that it will be on a path of decline from this year.  However, we cannot be negligent or blas&eacute; about the quantum of debt that still hangs over the Irish nation.  That is something we want to deal with.<\/p><p>  The third question was about the use of money to augment the NPRF.  The Minister for Finance and I announced last week that we are winding up the National Pensions Reserve Fund and transferring its &euro;6.4 billion into the new Irish Strategic Investment Fund.  The need of this economy is for investment now.  Our common view is that the best way to make provision for future pensions is to actually have a growing economy, because we pay for pensions on a yearly basis out of current Exchequer funds.  Therefore, we need to ensure we have a growing economy and we need to create jobs now.  The Chairman made a fair point that when we get back to something more normal in terms of economic growth we should look again to rebuilding a pension reserve fund into the future.  However, the immediate priority in the medium term is to have capital to invest in infrastructure and jobs in our economy right now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900006#G00500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1371657300,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The second part of today's engagement with the Minister concerns public expenditure.  Some of the more positive outcomes of the troika's arrival into Ireland have been the way in which budgetary management is scrutinised, the types of budgetary reform that have taken place and the fact that Departments must report on a quarterly basis and those figures must be shown to add up.  What the committee hopes for is that those budgetary and fiscal reforms will be reflected in how the committee deals with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance.  The Minister will recall that last year - it happens every quarter - some concerns arose in the area of health in quarter one and quarter two, and in quarter three we had a balloon payment, as I explained earlier.

However, the Minister has come in today to say that two of those four sales will not happen now.  The 25% share in Aer Lingus is not for sale now and we agree it should not be sold.

However, if anybody can show me any memorandum of understanding of the previous Government showing a figure for the sale of State assets, I would be pleased to see it, because no such memorandum exists and there was no such figure.  The first figure that went on the public record for the sale of State assets was the &euro;2 billion the Minister and Fine Gael included in their programme for Government.  The other figures were always related to the agreement with the IMF to undertake an independent assessment.  That is as far as it went.  The new Government has come up with the figure of &euro;2 billion.<\/p><p>  We have now seen a series of broken promises, but I welcome these because I did not agree with the sale of Coillte forests or Aer Lingus.  The Minister has said that the troika wanted to keep the full &euro;2 billion for debt reduction.  However, he has now said that if the sale of assets realises &euro;3 billion, Ireland will be permitted to keep half of it for job creation and stimulus measures while the other half goes to debt reduction.  Therefore, the troika insisted that &euro;1.5 billion should go for debt reduction.  How much will we now achieve of the &euro;3 billion target the Minister has set from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and ESB assets?  It is around this amount that the Minister has built the infrastructure stimulus plan he announced in July 2012.<\/p><p>  In his opening remarks today, the Minister said &euro;850 million of this was to be funded from the proceeds of sale of State assets.  Now that two of the four assets for sale are off the agenda, where stands that &euro;850 million?  Given the Minister announced the stimulus plan 12 months ago and given the big fanfare regarding the &euro;850 million, how much of that has been received so far?  The Minister got great mileage out of this &euro;850 million, which did not exist then.  How much of it exists as we speak?  The Minister announced another &euro;150 million part of that stimulus package recently, but how much has he realised from the &euro;850 million he has referred to so often over the past 12 months?<\/p><p>  In regard to NewERA, will the Minister clarify whether this comes under the remit of this Minister or of the Minister for Finance?  I welcome the people from NewERA here today, Ms Fitzpatrick and others.  Where does NewERA sit with regard to what was the National Development Finance Agency, which had a role in regard to public private partnerships and assessing their financial viability?  Has that agency been subsumed, is it gone or does it still exist?  How many staff are in the National Development Finance Agency and NewERA?  How many also are part of the NTMA, which as far as I understand falls under the remit of the Department of Finance?  Where is the demarcation line between this Minister's Department and NewERA?  I know the Minister will say they work closely together, but will he explain to us the actual situation?<\/p><p>  The only State asset on which there has been movement so far is Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, and the Minister has said he commenced the sale process on 12 June.  The only thing I know about Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann so far is that it has taken on approximately 300 or 400 staff to deal with Irish Water.  I do not see the Minister realising proceeds from the sale of assets, but see him spending money the people will have to pay in water charges when meters are installed after the local elections.

In the original documentation, the paragraph that has been quoted so often is predicated on the outcome of an bord snip.  The understanding the former Administration gave - the Deputy may or may not take my word on this, or he may take up the phone and talk to the Commission and Frank Stakely will tell him his understanding - was that &euro;5 billion from the bord snip portfolio would be available to retire debt.  It took us a fair job of work to dislodge that idea from the troika's perspective.<\/p><p>  It is true there is a figure of &euro;2 billion in the programme for Government.  Fine Gael came in with a much higher requirement to sell because it did its own due diligence and determined that when the economy was starved of cash, it wanted to create a new entity called NewERA to recycle money from older companies that were up and running that could stand on their own in the private sphere and create new State companies.  I thought that was not a bad idea, but believed the scale was too ambitious and we agreed to scale it back to &euro;2 billion.  After that, I then had the job in Government to convince the troika to allow us to use that &euro;2 billion, when we got it, to reinvest in the next phase of jobs, both in the private and in the public sphere.  That is what we are about and that is how the increase to &euro;3 billion came about.<\/p><p>  Deputy Fleming is correct that the increase was a brokered arrangement, arrived at over protracted discussion and months.

I believe the deal we made was a reasonable deal and I have outlined the initial step - the 50:50 step - to the deal and the advance on that, which in essence in the medium term allows us to use the full 100% stakeholding we get from the sale of State assets to invest in jobs.<\/p><p>  Deputy Fleming suggested the fact Coillte forests and the stake in Aer Lingus are not for sale now is a broken promise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900007#H00900","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1371658500,"counter":215,"content":"<p>It was a grand promise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900008#J00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1371658500,"counter":216,"content":"<p>The only promise I made and I will make it again, is that there will be no fire sale.  There will be due diligence.  We will sell nothing that does not get value.  If we do not get a fair price we will sell nothing.  I have said that from the beginning.  If the Deputies think that we should sell Aer Lingus at any price in any circumstances, under any conditions, they will be on their own.  The same applies to Coillte.  If, manifestly, the due diligence we have done said that the Government objective set out could be achieved then we would proceed with the sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte but I have said that our due diligence showed something else.  That underscores our consistency, the correctness of our view that we will proceed with an asset sale only if it makes economic and strategic sense for the Irish people and for our economy at this time.<\/p><p>  In answer to the points about the various stimulus programmes, of the stimulus plan that I announced last year, &euro;850 million will come from the proceeds of the sale of State assets.  That is a modest sum in the context of what will be realised from assets that are for sale now.  I will not breach confidentiality, mainly because I do not know and have asked not to be told what the bids are, but I know that there are robust bids for the assets that are for sale.  I have kept completely separate from the bidding process and the structure.  There is an absolutely sealed process for those interested in buying State assets that will have no contact with any member of the Government or any of our political advisers on these matters.  That is as it should be and I wish that was always the way.<\/p><p>  We are confident that we will realise very significant funding from the sale of State assets and that will become available to us this year.  Maybe I should explain how that will be dealt with for general Government debt purposes, GGDP, and general Government balance purposes, GGBP.  Deputy Donnelly has asked about this in the past.  The licensing arrangement following the sale of the national lottery will come onto our books as soon as the payment is made, while the others will come as a credit to the ESB when it is sold and to BGE when it is sold and will be brought back onto the State accounts by way of a dividend payment when the Government determines.  We can time that to the best benefit of the Exchequer and when we need the money.  There are 14 staff in NewERA, the National Development Finance Agency will be subsumed into the National Treasury Management Agency and other staff into the merged National Roads Authority and Rail Procurement Agency, which is will be a new procurement agency for the State.  That is one of the mergers that we announced in 2011.<\/p><p>  The final question was about water and the Deputy was being particularly mischievous there.  He knows full well that there is a clear Government commitment that Irish Water will be a wholly State-owned company, that it will not be for sale, is not for sale and we will not countenance its sale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900008#J00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1371658500,"counter":217,"content":"<p>May I speak briefly because I only got in once?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900008#J00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1371658500,"counter":218,"content":"<p>The Deputy has three or four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900008#J00500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1371658500,"counter":219,"content":"<p>The Minister had a target of &euro;2 billion for the sale of State assets, then he upped it to &euro;3 billion.

The Minister was able to talk about a figure of &euro;2 billion which went to &euro;3 billion but now that two of the assets are off the list by how much approximately will the Minister be short?  That is a significant reduction from the original target of &euro;3 billion so how much will the Minister need to have available for his infrastructure stimulus package that he announced in July 2012?  He very correctly said a few moments ago that he will sell nothing if he does not get a fair price.  That could happen and he has deemed it more prudent not to sell Coillte and Aer Lingus.  If he is not sure of the proceeds how could he last July announce expenditure of &euro;850 million before having received a red cent?

It is more like a sliver or splinter, in the terms of Coillte I suppose, than a sizeable chunk.  That is realistic.  The vast bulk of the money that will accrue to the State will come from the Bord G&aacute;is Energy division and the ESB energy sales.  I supported that not only because it was a good generator of revenue for the State, but because I think it will be good in the long term to have more competition in the energy sector.  I have always felt that the policy of the previous Administration, which created artificial competition between two State companies by not allowing the ESB to lower its prices while BGE took some of its market share, was crazy and bad for the domestic consumer and businesses.

As I indicated in my response to Deputy Sean Fleming, the entry of another player would be good for consumers, both domestic and commercial, in a context where energy prices in this economy are far too high.  We must ensure there is real competition in the market.  We have the prospect of a double benefit from the sale of the energy-generating capacity of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and some of the capacity of ESB, although, in the case of the latter, the first two power stations to be offered for sale are not on this island.

After selling off the profitable bits, what is left will invariably come under greater pressure further down the road.<\/p><p>  I have a final question.  The cost of energy is a major burden for consumers and the State as a whole.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy produces wind energy, has a considerable development portfolio and has wind energy assets currently under construction.  How can it be a good idea for the State to sell off the ability to produce energy?  Surely having the ability to produce our own energy is the way to exercise some degree of control over prices?

We have to ensure that the investments we make will be strategic in terms of creating jobs in the medium term but that they will not be short-term jobs.  The outcome has to be an important contribution to our recovery.  There would be different manifestations of this.  In the stimulus plan I introduced last year I announced what people would describe as traditional investments, for example, in roads, co-funded by the European Investment Bank and others, including the Council of Europe bank, health centres and justice facilities such as Garda stations.  The investments were used to build what is needed for a modern economy to operate but they were traditional investments.  The more recent &euro;150 million stimulus plan I announced last week will be invested in relatively traditional areas.  It provides an additional &euro;50 million for schools that were not on the list, &euro;50 million for non-national roads which will help rural Ireland to survive and thrive, and &euro;50 million for retrofitting local authority houses, which is a little novel.  That investment, which will allow 25,000 local authority houses to be insulated, will have a long-term impact on reducing energy costs.  We estimate it will be of the order of &euro;400 a year for those families in social housing.

The work of NewERA must be considered in three parts.  The first part is the financial oversight of the commercial semi-State sector.  That semi-sector generates approximately &euro;6 billion in revenue, has almost &euro;14 billion in capital employed and is a very important economic player.  We would assist the operating Departments in examining capital proposals coming out of the semi-State sector, proposals for borrowings and seeing how sensible they are in the context of Government, in other words, in the context of what financial return the shareholder will get.  That is very much in keeping with best international practice.  There are shareholder executives in most of the Scandinavian countries, in the UK and in France.  We have interacted with most of them and it is also recommended best practice from the OECD.  We have created in the past 12 to 18 months a protocol of operating with the commercial semi-State bodies.  We are reviewing their corporate plans and investment plans in the main.<\/p><p>  The second and equally critical part of the work is that we have been asked to ensure that Government investment plans in economic infrastructure are implemented and we have been asked to assist in the funding of those.  Irish Water is probably a good example of that.  If we can fit in infrastructure we can generate economic activity and have a competitive economy.  In the case of Irish Water, capital expenditure is running at a certain level with the setting up of this new Irish publicly-owned authority.  It will be capable of raising debt at some point in its future and increasing the level of capital in the State applied to water infrastructure, which is crucial in attracting certain key industries into Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900012#N01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1371660900,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I am interested in the reply to my question on the Heathrow slots, as a time limit applies for my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900012#N01500","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1371660900,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I have stopped the clock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900012#N01600","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speech","time":1371660900,"counter":392,"content":"<p>We will have the Acting Chairman at a meeting again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900012#N01700","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371660900,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I apologise if I have taken too long to reply to describe this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900012#N01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1371660900,"counter":394,"content":"<p>We are giving you considerable latitude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900012#N01900","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371660900,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman.

First, there is a big focus on construction because of the 250,000 private sector jobs this economy lost in the three years up to 2011, a big chunk were in the construction sector.  We have many long-term unemployed people who came from the construction sector.  If we can get some of those back to work it would be welcome but we are not going to build things for the sake of building things.  We are building things that were strategically important in the plan for building an appropriate infrastructure for Ireland into the future.  We need to meet the demographic pressures on schools, which is huge.  That is welcome, but we need to build the schools now to ensure that the children who are aged one and two now will have schools to attend in two or three years' time.<\/p><p>  Second, in terms of our health strategy to refocus the provision and delivery of health services away from the acute sector into the primary health sector, we need to build those primary care centres to do that, and hopefully save money, and have a more modern model of health delivery.  Obviously, we need to have an infrastructure that is complete because although most of the main highways were built, not all of the motorways were built.  For example, the N17 and N18 in the west is an important linkage across the west coast that needs to be advanced.  <\/p><p>  Those traditional construction projects are important strategically but we need to go beyond those, and I have an open mind to look at investment in other areas.  The Deputy mentioned the energy sector.  I had a meeting this morning with the vice president of the European Investment Bank, Jonathan Taylor, who has been here a few times.  We have very good relations with the European Investment Bank now.  Its president, Werner Hoyer, has been here on a few occasions also, and I have met him here and in Brussels.  It wants to spell out the programmes it is funding.  For example, the acronym JESSICA is for a city investment programme.  It invests in retrofitting of houses and insulation of local authority houses, and it has programmes across Europe.  One that I recommend the Deputy might examine is the Green London programme that it is funding, which funds the refurbishment of social housing in London.  I would like to see a green Dublin programme, and perhaps a green Limerick or a green Waterford programme as well.  That is in the JESSICA area.  The European Investment Bank also has a JEREMIE programme.  That is providing funding to the small and medium enterprises sector, which is also important.<\/p><p>  What I am saying is that we hope to leverage up the money we will get from State assets.

It looks at a discounted future cash flow and comes up with the best answer for the State.  A lot of commercial decisions get made on a comparison of net present value, NPV, calculations or a return on investment capital or whatever.  The economic analysis is broader than that.

While I could be wrong, that is what I have heard.  Are there criteria for something being strategic?  We all talk around this issue.

It was necessary to assign an economic value, if one was going to insist that certain woodlands would not be open for sale at all, that access had to be guaranteed or that there would be replanting.  As all these things were part of the process, it was not, as the Deputy has described, a financial analysis alone.  Were I on the other side of the House, I could easily get into an emotional argument about selling trees, as though I were selling the forests.  However, that never was intended and I believe Deputy Donnelly knows that.  Ideologically, I never had any great difficulty or understood a great difference between selling upfront the trees in advance or selling them <i>post facto<\/i>  when they are grown, which is what they are being grown for, as long as all the other bits of the equation are nailed down, that is, the public access, the amenity, the replanting and all that.  When the Government joined all the dots, it did not recommend itself as an economic prospect for the Government to advance and well and good.  No more than I have an ideological disposition towards not being opposed to the sale of trees, I do not have an ideological disposition towards thinking the Government must sell them even if it does not make sense.  It is purely pragmatic, based on what is in the best interests of the State right now, which needs money to invest in jobs.  The 350,000 or 400,000 people who seek jobs right now want answers and want the Government to be vigorous in its search for answers for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900015#Q00400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1371662700,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Sure, and I appreciate that for the Minister, it is not ideological.

I am glad the company is being reconfigured.  I learned a lot through the debate regarding what was and what was not working within Coillte, as well as that we did not appear to be getting much of a return from our trees.  When the reconfiguration is being considered, I wish to emphasise a point that is highly relevant to Wicklow, which is that the tourism and public value potential is massive.  I will provide a brief anecdote.  A few months ago, I picked up a load of Belgian tourists going over the Sally Gap.  They told me they had flown directly from Belgium, had got on a bus in Dublin airport and had gone straight out to walk a good portion of the Wicklow Way.  They told me that while they have walked all over the world, in Chile and all sorts of places, they had never encountered an area that was so spectacular for tourism and walking but which had such little infrastructure.  They observed that anywhere else one might go around the world, cabins and service sites are made available and such locations will be advertised.  The group only found out about Wicklow, Ireland, Coillte and all that by accident.  Consequently, I believe there is a huge opportunity to create an infrastructure.  This is partly the responsibility of Coillte and probably should be a joint venture with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and so on but certainly, much of the route goes through Coillte lands.  I emphasise I believe there is huge potential to build a tourism walking and cycling infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900015#Q00500","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371662700,"counter":436,"content":"<p>On that point and that of the Minister, while it is somewhat irrelevant to say it now, all those considerations are absolutely standard parts of international forestry deals.

I wish to be careful as to how I couch this but I cannot say we got best value from all our semi-State companies in the past.

I believe the decisions being made by the Government incrementally will move us in that direction but obviously, one cannot turn around the tanker in one instant movement.  As for pay rates and so on, the Government considered the top rates of pay immediately.  It has put in place a new Hay pay scale that has put a ceiling of &euro;250,000 on the salary of a chief executive officer of a commercial semi-State company.  As the Deputy is aware, some of them were getting significantly more than that and this must migrate down to other skill sets within companies.

That was simply money that was labelled PRSI originally that actually was universal social charge when one drilled down to it because it was not dis-aggregated by Revenue.  It looked as if there was more in PRSI income than there was and when that was taken out, it looked like a hole in the PRSI.  There was a hole in the Social Insurance Fund because of a re-labelling of money.  In true terms, if one looks at the overall increase in expenditure, that &euro;1.5 billion is approximately 2.5% of the total budget and that takes no account of the savings across other line Departments.  As I stated at the end of 2012, on an underlying basis, our spending was less than 0.4% above target for the year.  It is an important clarification that there being a shortfall in PRSI is not a mismanagement in terms of expenditure.  One had no control over that.  What happens on PRSI is a matter for the numbers employed, etc.  If there is an increase in unemployment, it has a double impact on social welfare.  It increases the cost of job-support payments and also diminishes the volume of PRSI receipts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013061900016#R01500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1371663300,"counter":465,"content":"<p>The issue that focused our minds on this is not ultimately the minute percentile at which the overall Department of Public Expenditure budget might be at the end of year, whether it is 1% or 2% under or over.

I am delighted members have taken their jackets off as this gives me the excuse to do the same.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to meet with the committee to consider the 2013 Estimates for my Department's group of Votes.  While I am obviously pleased that in gross terms the Estimate available for the justice Vote group in 2013 is more than &euro;2.2 billion, the unavoidable fact is that, as Minister for Justice and Equality, I have &euro;190 million less available to me in current expenditure for 2013 than for the corresponding Estimate in 2011.  The only consolation is that under plans published by our predecessors in Government and agreed with the troika in 2010, I would have had considerably less available to me for the justice Vote group for 2012 and 2013 had I not succeeded in having some of the proposed reductions restored.<\/p><p> We are now working with reduced numbers and budgets at a time when demand for services across the justice sector and others is increasing.  Thus, despite reducing our borrowing, we are still dependent on &euro;12 billion of bailout funding this year.  It is critical for our future sustainability that we show that we are moving in the right direction, further reducing our borrowing each year.  Any other approach would lead to a very difficult situation in relation to borrowing which, in turn, would lead inevitably to a very sharp-shock cut in public spending.  This would have severe consequences for the Irish people in general.  This means savings must be secured in every area of public expenditure, including the justice sector.  It is important that we do not allow ourselves or the public we serve to be overtaken by doom and gloom.  Much has been achieved in the past two years and this will continue under this Government.  <\/p><p> By far the largest part of the justice budget, almost &euro;1.4 billion in gross terms in 2013, goes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The pay and superannuation component amounts to 87% of the total allocation and reflects the central role that staffing resources, more than 13,000 full-time sworn members, more than 1,000 Garda Reserve members and more than 2,000 civilian staff, play in the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The key outputs in the Garda Estimate are based on the four strategic goals in the current policing plan of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, namely, securing our nation, proactive policing operations, ensuring safe communities and delivering a professional service.  At its heart is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's primary objective of preventing, detecting and disrupting crime and criminal activity and ensuring that people feel safe in their homes, on our roads and in our community.  <\/p><p> The effective work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is illustrated by the targeted programmes put in place to respond to particular types of crime.  Faced with an increase in burglary towards the end of 2011 and into 2012, the Commissioner put in place Operation Fiacla to confront this problem head-on.  Operation Fiacla is intelligence-led and relies on detailed analysis carried out by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service, of crime trends and other relevant data to ensure that the best use is being made of Garda resources.  Specific burglary related initiatives are being implemented in each Garda region in support of Operation Fiacla.  Their success and the success of the overall operation is clear. According to most recent figures, 5,233 persons have been arrested and 2,903 charged as at the end of May.  Furthermore, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Acer, which forms part of Operation Fiacla in the Dublin region, is having a positive impact on burglary rates in the Dublin area, with a reduction of burglaries by more than 10% since the operation's introduction.  These policing operations illustrate the point that freeing up garda&iacute; from desk jobs does in fact deliver more effective policing services for the public.  What really matters is results, not maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>just for the sake of it, and under the Commissioner's management, those results are being delivered.<\/p><p> There are pressures in the Garda Vote in 2013.  It is also clear, given that the bulk of expenditure in the Vote is in the area of payroll and superannuation, that these pressures are mainly centred in those areas.  As with every other Vote, the budgetary figures also reflect the financial impact of the proposed measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016, namely, the Haddington Road agreement.  Members will be all too aware that for the Government to meet its targets under the troika arrangement and regain our economic sovereignty reductions of &euro;300 million are required in the public sector pay bill in 2013 and overall savings of &euro;1 billion by 2015.  Unfortunately, no area of the public sector can be protected from this requirement.  Clearly, the numbers of serving Garda personnel and civilian staff impact on the payroll bill and any resumption of Garda recruitment would have financial implications that must be managed within the overall resources available to Government.  I believe that it is important for an organisation such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have some regular intakes of new recruits, even if on a modest scale.  I am currently engaged in discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to see how this aim can best be progressed.  <\/p><p> I can assure the committee that, despite the very significant financial constraints that the Government is working under, I will leave no stone unturned to provide the necessary resources for the Commissioner to carry out the work of the force.  In particular, I will continue to ensure that there is additional funding available for the Garda fleet - &euro;5 million in 2013 on top of &euro;3 million in additional funding in 2012.  Some &euro;4 million in total was made available in 2012.  While we are challenged by the number of Garda vehicles being decommissioned, the Government is well aware of the importance of garda&iacute; being able to respond effectively to criminal activity.  I will continue to press for additional funding for the fleet but this will be contingent on expenditure in other areas across and outside the justice sector between now and the end of the year.<\/p><p> Turning now to prisons,<b><\/b>a gross expenditure budget of &euro;328.5 million is being provided for the prisons Vote in 2013.  As can be seen from an examination of the key outputs in 2012, significant progress is being made in achieving the overarching objective of expenditure in the prisons Vote, namely, to provide safe and secure custody, dignity of care, and rehabilitation to prisoners for safer communities.  Despite less than satisfactory prison conditions in Cork and Limerick prisons, it was possible to reduce overcrowding in 2012, with reductions in average daily occupancy rates of 12% and 13% respectively.  This is only a temporary measure.  In all, a capital budget of &euro;23.1 million has been provided for prisons building projects in 2013.  In the current financial environment, securing that essential funding has been a major achievement.<\/p><p> A major capital project to provide an accommodation block providing 300 prisons spaces at the midlands prison was completed and opened in December 2012.  Construction of a new Cork prison, which will house 275 prisoners, is due to commence in October this year.  Members will be aware that a motion in relation to this was passed yesterday in the D&aacute;il.  I expect the necessary two-section Bill to formally authorise the construction of that prison to come before both Houses soon.  The construction of a new wing at Limerick prison, to replace the outdated A and B wings, also forms part of the Prisons Service 40-month capital plan.  The tender process for this project is expected to commence shortly.  In addition, the refurbishment project, including the installation of in-cell sanitation, in Mountjoy Prison is continuing.  The C and B wings were completed in 2012 and work on the A wing is due for completion in September.  I am pleased to say that slopping out in Mountjoy Prison will end later this year, when work on the final wing, the D wing, takes place.<\/p><p> A number of initiatives have been introduced by the Prison Service to ensure better outcomes for offenders.  These measures include increased participation in structured activities and the integrated sentence management system which involves some 1,100 prisoners.  A further effective development has been the introduction of an incentivised regimes policy in all prisons.  This policy provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour. The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce incentives for good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment for both prisoners and staff.  A further measure, the community return project, operated in conjunction with the Probation Service, provides for earned and structured temporary release to be offered to offenders who pose no threat to society in return for supervised community service.  During 2012, 299 prisoners participated in this scheme.  Also, communities benefited from the work undertaken pursuant to that scheme.<\/p><p> It is clear that the reform agenda is being well progressed in the Prison Service.  <\/p> <p>Joint task reviews are under way or already complete in a number of prisons and the prison service college and the implementation of the recommendations made in these reports has begun.  In addition, recruitment of prison administrative support officers is continuing.  These officers, who are being redeployed from elsewhere in the Civil Service, will carry out administrative tasks previously undertaken by prison officers.  This will allow us to release these fully trained prison clerks from administration tasks to essential front-line duties.  The introduction of this new grade will ultimately deliver &euro;3.5 million per annum in payroll savings.<\/p><p> The gross budget allocated to the courts Vote in 2013 is &euro;104.959 million.  There is also an appropriations-in-aid allocation of &euro;46.635 million, of which &euro;42.493 million relates to fees for various categories of courts transactions.  All expenditure in the courts Vote is directed towards one key programme entitled Managing the Courts and Supporting the Judiciary.<\/p><p> Like other Votes in the justice sector, the Courts Service is not immune from budgetary reductions.  Also in common with other areas in the sector, the Courts Service has embarked on a significant transformation programme in recent years.  While little used and, in some cases, inadequate court venues are being closed, I am pleased that seven court building projects are being progressed under the Government's infrastructure stimulus package.  These building projects will be progressed as public private partnerships, PPPs.  I remind members that in this context, the Courts Service led the way in an earlier round of PPPs, with the Criminal Courts of Justice building put in place under this arrangement.  <\/p><p> Infrastructural projects of this nature yield benefits and reduce the costs of the administration of justice.  Newer buildings can be equipped and fitted out with the latest technology and this enables more court business to be undertaken by video link with prisons.  This reduces costs, not alone for the Courts Service, but also for the prison service, with fewer officers away from their places of work while accompanying prisoners to court.  A number of changes are also under way in the operation of the Criminal Courts of Justice which will result in considerable efficiencies for the prison service.<\/p><p> A pilot project has also commenced for the centralisation of custodial cases at one court location in each of four District Court regions.  This is generating further savings for the prison service.  These cross-sectoral initiatives have not occurred by accident and great credit is due to the leadership and initiative shown by the board, management and staff of the Courts Service and other justice sector areas involved in these reforms.  <\/p><p> It is also appropriate at this point to make reference to the referendum planned for later this year on the establishment of a court of appeal.  The need for a court of appeal arises mainly from the ongoing significant backlog of cases before the Supreme Court and the consequent long delays in cases being dealt with by that court.  The new court of appeal will deal with most cases currently dealt with by the Supreme Court, thus reducing its workload and allowing it to focus on the development of the law.  The Supreme Court in Ireland, unlike in other common law jurisdictions, is the court of final appeal in all cases.  This means that, whereas in other countries the Supreme Court mainly deals with cases involving substantial points of law or issues of major public importance, in Ireland it is taken up with issues ranging from routine interlocutory orders to the major constitutional issues and everything in between.<\/p><p> As I have indicated previously, I intend to publish the proposed constitutional amendments as early as possible in order to give people time to reflect on what is proposed and allow for a rational and considered debate.  As was the case in previous referenda, my Department will make a budget available to the Referendum Commission for the necessary public information campaign associated with the referendum and the expenditure will ultimately be reflected in the justice Vote under the commissions and special inquiries subhead.<br \/><b><\/b>The Property Registration Authority, PRA, has a net budgetary provision of &euro;31.232 million in the current year.  The authority has driven many changes in recent years in the services it provides and the way it does its work.  For example, the digitisation of all its mapping records, together with other investment in its technology, has led to full roll-out of an on-line access facility to the land register for all citizens.  In addition, the authority continues to work with other public service organisations in order that they can also derive full value from the data held within the PRA database.  This is a further example of a joined-up public sector in action, involving with the PRA, the local authorities, the OPW, the Revenue Commissioners and other State agencies involved in developing property interest registers.<\/p><p> The final Vote in the justice group is the Department of Justice and Equality Vote which contains in the region of 60 subheads broken into six programmes.  This Vote, in essence, sums up the main functions of my Department which are to maintain a secure Ireland; work for safe communities; facilitate the provision and administration of justice; promote equality and integration; represent Ireland's interests abroad; and contribute to economic recovery.  I do not intend in these opening remarks to cover in detail all the individual programmes and in most cases the subheads in each programme are self-explanatory.  However, I wish to comment briefly on the programme dealing with economic recovery.  There is a budgetary provision of almost &euro;7.4 million and a sanctioned head count complement of 91 staff in the 2013 Estimates for the new Personal Insolvency Service.  As members will be aware, the Personal Insolvency Service is a completely new and vital service.  While it is never easy to get a new organisation off the ground, in this case I am very happy with the progress being made.  The service was officially established on 1 March, but a considerable amount of background work had already been taking place prior to that date.  The committee will be aware that the information campaign is well under way and, in accordance with the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, the service has already prepared and issued guidelines as to what constitutes reasonable standard of living expenses.  Further intensive work continues in a number of areas with a view to having a full service implemented at the earliest possible date.  I expect this week to sign the statutory instrument for the regulation of personal insolvency practitioners.<\/p><p> Members will note that a subhead has been introduced under programme seven with respect to the Magdalen fund.  This is to reflect the Government's decision that a fund should be established for those women who were in the Magadalen laundries and women who were is a similar position in the Stanhope Street laundry.  The financial allocation and a decision on the detailed operation of the fund will be made after careful consideration of the findings in Mr. Justice Quirke's report on how the Government might best provide supports for the women involved.  The report will be considered by the Government shortly and it is expected that both it and the Government's response to the recommendations will then be published.<\/p><p> There is a very broad spectrum of activity within the justice Vote area and despite the many competing priorities, it is very important, in so far as possible, that funding be maintained to front-line services.  This is particularly the case in relation to those areas which support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the ongoing fight against serious crime.  The Criminal Assets Bureau, the forensic science and State laboratories will have a combined budget of &euro;19 million in 2013.  In addition, I will ensure, through my Department's legislative programme, that the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau are further strengthened, where necessary.  This is entirely appropriate as the work of the bureau continues to highlight the effectiveness of a co-ordinated, multi-agency approach to targeting the proceeds of criminal conduct.<\/p><p> The total Estimate for the justice sector in 2013 is over &euro;2.2 billion in gross terms and almost &euro;2 billion in net terms.  As I have set out, it covers five Votes and a broad range of areas within the justice and equality sector.  The work of the sector is expanding and resources are contracting.  This constitutes a very significant challenge across all areas; hence, the crucial importance of the various reform programmes in place.  It is simply not an option to continue blindly with old models and ways of doing things.  Reform and more efficient ways of delivering services are crucial to the operation of the sector.  We will continue to work in this vein and while respecting the individual Vote structure, we will continue to monitor our budgets at Vote group level to ensure we get maximum value from the &euro;2 billion available to the sector in 2013.  <\/p><p> I am happy to address questions about the Estimates which members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013061900002#A00800","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371631200,"counter":495,"content":"<p>We will keep the question and answer session as brisk as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013061900004#C00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1371631200,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I refer to the Courts Service and the forthcoming referendum on the establishment of a court of civil appeal and the family law court.

It is intended that the referendum will coincide with the referendum on the Seanad.  I expect both referendums to take place in the early autumn.  It was originally anticipated that the referendums would take place somewhat later - in early November, rather than in early October as is now anticipated.<\/p><p>  In advance of the court of appeal referendum, my Department organised a very useful consultative seminar in the Law Society building some months ago.  Various branches of the legal profession and members of the Judiciary were invited to the seminar.  We also launched a request for submissions at that time.  The submissions we received have been of great help in deciding on the wording for the referendum and the composition of the back-up legislation that will be required in establishing the court.  Other groups and organisations were also represented at the seminar.<\/p><p>  A seminar on the proposed new family court structure will take place on the first Friday or Saturday of July.  I think it will happen on the Saturday.  I am anxious to provide for a similar lead-in period and consultative phase in this instance.  We want to draw up the heads of the Bill that will set up the new structure, as opposed to merely providing for the necessary constitutional amendment, in advance of the referendum on the family court.  As we are concerned that the timeframe to do so is too short, it is now envisaged that the family court referendum will take place in 2014 rather than in 2013.  The referendum on the court of appeal will take place in the early autumn, as I have said.<\/p><p>  I mentioned during the Seanad debate that the change in the jurisdiction of the High Court and the Circuit Court under the Courts Bill 2013 will have a number of impacts.  I appreciate that the Bill has not yet come before the D&aacute;il.  I understand it will be introduced there in early July, after it has been dealt with in the Seanad.  It is hoped that the Bill will complete its passage through both Houses before we go on vacation at the end of July.  There has been no change in court jurisdictions since 1991.  The low level of jurisdiction in the District Court means it deals with cases capped at a much lower value, in real terms, than would have been the case in 1991.  The Circuit Court is in a similar position.  Far too many cases are now in the High Court.  It has been estimated that at least 30% of the civil law work that currently goes into the Circuit Court will be dealt with in the District Court as a result of the extension of the jurisdiction of the District Court to &euro;15,000.  That will free up work in the Circuit Court and allow work to be taken out of the High Court and into the Circuit Court.<\/p><p>  One cannot predict the exact number of cases with absolute certainty because there will be an interregnum period when cases that were commenced before the jurisdictional change work their way through the courts system.  I have assured the Presidents of both courts, the Courts Service and the Chief Justice that we will keep a match on how things are going to ensure there are no difficulties in dealing with jurisdictional change.  Clearly, this measure will result in an increase in the number of cases being dealt with at District Court level.  The question of whether it will result in the Circuit Court having to deal with an increased number of cases in real terms, or will simply involve a change in the jurisdictional levels, is an open one.  We know it will reduce the number of cases going into the High Court for initial hearings.<\/p><p>  As the courts work their way through the backlog following the formation of the court of appeal, ultimately far fewer appeals will be made to the Supreme Court, which will be holding its sittings in a divisional manner with two groups of Supreme Court judges and will be able to work through its own backlog.  There will be a significant adjustment period as the court of appeal is put in place.  The manner in which that will work will become clear when the wording of the constitutional amendment is agreed by the Cabinet.  We hope there will be a more rational spread of the financial jurisdictions before the courts to reflect the change in inflation since 1991 and the additional area of appreciation.<\/p><p>  One cannot change the jurisdictions of the courts every couple of years.  A degree of stability is needed.  It is quite likely that ten years will pass after this Courts Bill is enacted before the financial jurisdictions are changed again.  That seems to be the pattern.  On this occasion, there was a gap of more than 20 years.  We will keep a watching brief on whether the additional pressures on any one of the courts arising from the change of jurisdiction require to be addressed.  I know the Courts Service, the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the other courts will rapidly inform us if difficulties arise.<\/p><p>  A number of those working for the Insolvency Service of Ireland were transferred from other parts of the public service.  As I said earlier, the Department of Public Expenditure sanctioned an overall staff complement of 91.  The insolvency service has been working with the Public Appointments Service to take staff from the civil and public service redeployment panel.  A circular seeking expressions of interest was circulated by the Public Appointments Service to all relevant Departments and agencies across the civil and public service in January.  Eighty of the 91 positions have been filled through this process.  New staff are being assigned on a phased basis with a view to the insolvency service being fully staffed by the end of this month.  I know from my own contacts that a small number of people with specialist knowledge may have to be acquired other than though the normal transfer process.  In these cases, advertisements seeking job applications will be published.<\/p><p>  We have gone a huge way.  Eighty of the 91 staff have been transferred in.  As I have said on a number of occasions, everything went online in March and I expect to bring the legislation into operation in early July.  The service will then be operating.  Information technology systems are being put in place to facilitate all of the necessary work, such as the processing of debt resolution proposals, being done online.  I understand an enormous amount of work has been done to ensure the dealings between the insolvency service and the courts will not involve a paper trail and will take place online, in so far as is possible.<\/p> <p>I understand all of this should be up and running by the end of the third week in July, but I envisage that the service will formally start earlier than that date because, clearly, there will be no applications to go through on day one.  The objective is that it will primarily be an online service.  Obviously, forms have to be filled in and signed in the normal way, but they will be processed in as modern a way as is possible to avoid unnecessary paperwork, expense and duplication.<\/p><p> On the fines collection rate, as Deputies know, I have said on a number of occasions that I hope the fines (amendment) Bill will be published shortly.  I had originally hoped we might have had it a little earlier this year.  I am advised that work between my Department and the Attorney General's office is being completed and that it will be a matter of weeks, as opposed to months, before the Bill is published.  The Bill will provide for improved mechanisms for the collection of fines, including attachment of earnings.  There were difficulties with the legislation enacted during the time of my predecessor which envisaged a new form of collection service, although a number of amendments were needed for that work to proceed.  The primary approach will be by way of attachment of earnings.  Where people do not pay their fines, there will be provision for periodical voluntary payment of fines by individuals who want to pay their fines over a period of months rather than in one fell swoop, where that is appropriate.  There will be provision to ensure prison for non-payment of fines will be very much a last resort.  We are introducing the possibility for those who fail to pay their fines of undertaking community service as an alternative where there is fine default.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013061900005#D00200","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371632400,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Will there be provision to attach social welfare payments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013061900006#E00200","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1371632400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>That is one of the areas that is still being dealt with in the development of the Bill.  It is an issue of some difficulty and I cannot give the Deputy a definitive answer as I do not want to mislead him.  With attachment of earnings, if people are employees, it works, but if someone is self-employed, the attachment mechanism is of no use because it is that individual who should be making the payments in the first place.  When one is dealing with social welfare payments, one of the issues one is addressing is how well this arrangement will work in practice.  If we take it that most social welfare payments are to provide for a minimum level of money for an individual or a family, when dealing with an attachment of earnings order - as some Deputies will know, this system has been in place since 1976 in family law terms - the portion of someone's earnings that can be attached is that portion that is not regarded as essential in meeting his or her basic needs; therefore, one can never attach the total amount.  Many social welfare payments are about meeting basic needs and there is not a huge differential between what people need and what can be attached.  However, I do consider it important, where people on social welfare are fined, that this issue be considered and addressed in the drafting of the Bill.<\/p><p>  One of the issues of which I was very conscious was that the previous legislation enacted by my predecessor, first, did not provide for attachment of earnings and, second, meant that if a fine could not be collected, the only penalty was imprisonment.  Introducing community service as an alternative saves taxpayer's money and means prison places are not occupied by individuals for what inevitably are very short periods.  It also saves the huge expense and resources involved in members of the Garda having to pick up people to bring them to the Prison Service and in having prison officers check them in for what are often very short stays in prison.  Instead, an individual will be supervised by the Probation Service while undertaking community service to the benefit of local communities, which I consider much more preferable to jail for non-payment of fines.  Clearly, jail has to be the ultimate sanction for individuals who do not co-operate in undertaking community service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013061900006#E00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1371632400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>When committee members visited New York recently, they came across the community courts service, which puts huge emphasis on community service and which seems to be extraordinarily effective.

As I have said on other occasions, the direct provision system provides a roof over the heads of those seeking asylum or those who have been refused asylum and make other applications for leave to remain in the country.  As my predecessors discovered, in the context of the expenditure involved, it is the most economical way of providing for those who are effectively in the country illegally but who are seeking permission to stay for a variety of reasons.  I personally do not regard it as the most ideal system and wish there was a better one.  In the current economic climate I do not see the current direct provision arrangements changing, but I am anxious to ensure the best possible standards are maintained for individuals in direct provision accommodation and also for their children.  For the time being, however, I see the system continuing.<\/p><p>  I hope that when we are finally able to both publish and enact the immigration and asylum legislation that has now been under preparation for a substantial period of time, it will provide us with a system that will facilitate, in all but very exceptional cases, applications from those who seek asylum in this country, leave to remain or other permission to remain, all being dealt with in one application, and that will result in appeals being dealt with appropriately and promptly.  Ultimately, my objective is to put in place a system under which an individual who comes to our borders to claim asylum can, except in exceptionally difficult circumstances, have that application determined within six months of making it.  That will reduce the need for direct provision accommodation and create a situation where, on the one hand, individuals who are here unlawfully and have no entitlement to remain will either leave voluntarily or be deported within six months of making the application and, on the other, where people who are properly seeking asylum are granted it, are not kept in direct provision accommodation for lengthy periods of time and can get on with their lives in the wider community.  However, I cannot move to that system until the new legislation is enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013061900006#E00600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1371632400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I have a number of themes to cover.  I want to deal, first, with the issue of prisons.  The committee has submitted to the Minister and his Department its report on penal reform which contains five key recommendations.  We had a chance to discuss it briefly yesterday during the debate on the Cork Prison motion.  I believe and know the members of the committee believe that not only would our five proposals, if implemented, lead to a better prison and criminal justice system, in that we would have genuine rehabilitation or certainly improved rehabilitation programmes across the board which obviously would be better for society, but they would also cost less.  We are calling for a decarceration strategy, a reduction in prison numbers of one third in the next ten years, the use of community service, the use of restorative justice as an option in dealing with minor criminal offences and improvements in regard to remission rates which the Minister mentioned.  A prisoner receives a 25% remission rate, essentially for keeping his or her head down.  We are arguing that it be genuinely incentivised through being linked with rehabilitation and training programmes and increased to 33%.  <\/p><p>  I want to get the Minister's thoughts on our report as a contribution to cost saving measures and introducing a more effective system in the next few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013061900006#E00700","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1371633000,"counter":506,"content":"<p>We will allow the Minister to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013061900007#F00100","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1371633000,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Yes, because it is a substantive question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013061900007#F00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1371633000,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I thank members of the committee for the report and the work that was done on it.  That report is feeding into a process in my Department, as part of which I set up a committee involving not just officials but a number of other individuals such as Liam Herrick from the Irish Penal Reform Trust and which I expect to report to me in October.  We are looking at what additional reforms can be implemented and how we go about it.  I have a number of different strands I must ensure I deal with correctly as Minister for Justice.  Where individuals are sentenced by our courts, it is important that the sentence is appropriate to the crime committed.  That is obviously a matter for the Judiciary.  All I can do as Minister is provide the Judiciary with a range of sentencing options.  The Judiciary must then choose from that range.  As a result of my concerns that the community service option was not being used to the extent it could be, we enacted the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011.  I remarked that in the context of information available for 2012, I was disappointed that it did not appear that the courts were utilising community service as much as they could.  As Minister for Justice, I am very conscious that I must ensure that the sentence fits the crime and that all the appropriate options are used.  Of course, there are circumstances where to protect the community and to express the wider community's revulsion at the nature of a crime, it is appropriate that individuals serve sentences of imprisonment.  Ultimately, where the Judiciary is given options, it is for its members to determine whether or not prison is appropriate.  It is very important that while the Minister for Justice of the day provides for the options and while I urge the use of community service where it is appropriate - and it is right that I do so - ultimately, it is a matter of independent judicial discretion as to what is appropriate in the context of sentencing.<\/p><p>  As we know, some work has been done with regard to consistency in sentencing.  A recent publication indicated again that sentences do not always appear to be consistent.  As a lawyer who practised in the courts, I am also very conscious that on occasions, what may appear inconsistent from a media report may be quite rational, logical, correct and consistent when one knows the total detail of a case that has been before our courts.  There are often particular details, issues or background information that influence a judge's decision and some of that information does not get reported or if it is reported, is not reported in a manner in which it is clear what occurred in court was understood.  I know the Courts Service and Judiciary are addressing these areas.  <\/p><p>  We are currently working on the judicial council legislation.  I very much welcome the fact that the Judiciary last year effectively put in place its own judicial council which is a non-statutory body.  It is very much in the public interest that the judicial council, independent of Government, addresses the issue of consistency of sentencing and that the Judiciary assists its members in being consistent.  <\/p><p>  To return to the particular issue, the area in which the Minister for Justice has a role is what happens once people are sent to prison.  As I already mentioned, we have the incentivised regime that is in place to encourage good conduct and participation in programmes that may assist an individual with difficulties or education programmes.  That is important.  The suggestion made by the committee that provision be made for a one-third remission as opposed to a one-quarter remission for those who, firstly, do not pose a risk to the community and, secondly, who have behaved well in prison is a very useful proposal, if I can put it that way.  It is something to which I have already given some consideration.  It would require changes, not in our statutory provisions but in our statutory instruments.  It is one of the issues we will address later in the year when the internal committee has finished its deliberations.<\/p><p>  Can we reduce the prison population to the numbers the committee mentioned?  Again, to an extent, that is not the decision of myself as Minister for Justice nor will it be the decision of any of my successors because, ultimately, it is a matter for the Judiciary.  We tend to lose sight of this.  The Judiciary has a range of options from simply dismissing a case under the Probation Act to imposing a fine to imposing a sentence or suspended, partially suspended or partial direct sentence to using a mixture of fines and sentencing.  One issue that arises that I know is being publicly discussed is the question of whether when a life sentence is imposed, it should be left to the discretion of the Executive, as now occurs, to ultimately determine the length of that life sentence or whether we should introduce, as has occurred in Great Britain, a provision where the Judiciary lays down the minimum period that must be served pursuant to a life sentence.  That is an interesting issue because there are differing arguments.  <\/p><p>  These are all really important issues.  I genuinely thank the committee for the work it has done.  I anticipate that I will publish the report that will come to me arising out of my own group's work, into which this committee has fed.  The report will come to this committee towards the end of the year and will substantially impact on where we go with policy issues.  Do I believe we could have fewer individuals in prison with a different approach to sentencing?  It remains my view that some individuals may be better served through community service.  However, with minor offences where an individual has committed a series of crimes, all of which have brought them on a repetitive basis before the District Court, one crime may on the face of it look to be a minor crime but there is a history of repetitive criminality.  In these circumstances, it would be quite reasonable for any judge to reach a conclusion that this individual should serve a sentence for the protection of the community and for them to understand the consequences of their actions if they have not done so by now, particularly in circumstances where they have in the past, to use a non-legal term, \"got off under the Probation Act\" and been fined or made to do community service.  I am sure members of the Judiciary take account of this.  Some states in the US have the \"three strikes\" rule where it does not matter how minor the crime is.  If people have been convicted on a third occasion, even if that occasion involved stealing dolly mixtures from a sweetshop, they may find themselves facing life imprisonment.  I do not want to see that system in this country but it is all based on getting across the message that individuals must recognise that they have a responsibility to the community in which they live and that there is no excuse for repetitive offending.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013061900007#F00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1371633000,"counter":509,"content":"<p>We would not disagree regarding repeat offenders and someone who is a repeated threat to their community.  If we could bring in legislation on a sentencing council and sentencing guidelines that is similar to what is in Great Britain, that would help.  We can give a framework to the Judiciary.  I appreciate the point that we are not in sole control of incarceration but I will throw it out there.  I am not looking for a detailed exchange.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust invited the Honourable Mr. Justice Colman Treacy over from Great Britain last year and he met the committee.  The system in Great Britain is very impressive.<\/p> <p>I looked at it again recently but I will leave that aside.  <\/p><p> We do not want to go below the 13,000 threshold and there is a period needed to train garda&iacute;.  I see that the travel budget has increased and I presume that reflects the closure of Garda stations and the need to have more mobile patrols moving around.  The Minister's and Commissioner's argument about going back to the days of the RIC and police officers on bicycles is a strong one but they need to replace the garda in the 750 stations, and the 140 that have been closed, with more mobile patrols and vehicles.  The feedback I get says that is not necessarily happening.  What are the Minister's views on that?<\/p><p> The Minister says he is considering an attachment of earnings or social welfare for the payment of fines.  I understand that the property tax legislation allows for a deduction from social welfare.  One of the things that angers the public is that when some people receive a fine they are happy to go to jail for a few days rather than pay the fine which makes a mockery of the legal system.  There is a saying \"pay no fine, do the time\".  Regardless of who the citizen is there has to be some mechanism of making him or her pay instead of going to jail unless that is absolutely necessary.<\/p><p> I welcome the court of appeal referendum later this year but the courts system is very clogged up, not just at the higher level in the Supreme Court.  There is a considerable backlog at the European Court of Justice too.  What are the Minister's thoughts on separating family law from civil law as he intends to do?  How do we ensure that we have separate court systems that run efficiently?  People face huge costs.  One can talk about the legal services regulation Bill but if the system makes people wait a long time, stress and resentment will build up, as will legal costs.

We have to remember, and I see this on a weekly basis, that unfortunately we have in this State, as every state has, individuals who engage in appalling violence and commit barbaric crimes, whether homicides or vicious and appalling assaults, which effectively destroy the lives of individuals who survive those assaults.  Women are raped, children are sexually assaulted.  There are individuals who are prepared both to threaten and to take life for financial gain.  When talking about the prison systems and reforms and changes needed we should never forget that there are groups of individuals for whom the only appropriate sentence is a very long prison sentence, both to reflect the revulsion of the community at what the person has done, to punish the person and to protect the community so that the person does not,  soon after a conviction, re-offend and commit a similar offence to destroy the life of another innocent member of the wider community.  We must always remember that.  There is a very serious balance to be achieved in these areas.  The judiciary is confronted with dealing with this type of issue daily and must approach them in a very considered and careful way and they do so.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Chief Justice's announcement that the Supreme Court will sit in September to deal with some of the outstanding appeal cases. That is a very welcome and important development.  I welcome the announcement of the President of the High Court that some additional members of the High Court will sit in September to deal with some outstanding cases.  It is important that our courts sit in a manner that is appropriate to a modern twenty-first century Ireland.  The court vacation periods reflect the way the courts operated 100 years ago.  These initiatives are very welcome.  I would very much like to see it become the norm that our Judiciary, who work very hard and who contribute and must have their appropriate holiday periods,  resume in full in September as opposed to the position until now when the higher courts were, at least in theory, on vacation until 1 October.  I should say, and it is only fair because when this is written about it is often not reported, that even though in theory the vacation period for the higher courts has been August and September, although the District Court comes back in September, the reality has always been across all the courts that there are judges available who sit and hold court hearings in August and September to deal with emergency cases and applications.  There have always been court sittings in August and September but it would be a very good development if the courts fully returned in September and I very much welcome the fact that we will have these additional sittings of the High and Supreme Courts in September.  That will contribute to reducing some of the backlog that exists.<\/p><p>  All Deputies know, and I do not want to bore them with this, that I have a particular interest in family law.  That is why I want us to hold the referendum to provide a separate integrated family court system.  I want to see the family court operating in Ireland in a manner similar to the way it operates in Australia where it sits separately.  There would be dedicated family court judges and we would not have family law and child care matters, which should fall within the family court, in a sort of fragmented jurisdictional basis where there are overlapping and partial jurisdictions vested in different courts.  We will have an opportunity to talk about how we will implement this as we head in to the discussion following the seminar that we will hold.  Any members of this committee who are free are very welcome to attend the seminar on family courts.  I will clarify whether it is to be a Friday or Saturday because I do not remember.  I know it is in the first week in July.  I will make sure that my private secretary sends a note to members about that.  It is a half-day seminar.  The president of the Australian family court is one of the speakers and that will be a particularly interesting speech.<\/p><p>  Resources are, of course, an issue.  If we were to have the most ideal family court system we would have family courts across the country with a back-up welfare assessment service attached to the court as they have in Australia.  We would have mediation facilities within each of the major buildings dealing with family matters.  That may mean that we would have to centralise family matters to a greater extent than we have done in particular appropriate court buildings.  Some of what I would like to see happen requires resources that we may not have and we may not be able to implement all of it in one fell swoop.  If we could deal with the creation of the structure and any referendum that may be necessary, then produce and enact the legislation, and if some of the legislation has provisions to give rise to new services that will require a commencement order at a later time when we have the funding, we will at least put in place the basic important foundations to provide an improved system.  That is very much my objective.<\/p><p>  I of course agree that if fines are imposed people should pay them.<\/p> <p>However, being sent to jail for non-payment of a fine is not something that people appreciate, but what has occurred is that the person does not serve any meaningful jail time.  That is why a meaningful community service order, which requires one to do community service, will be a greater incentive for people who can afford to pay to do so.  If some people would prefer to do community service, so be it, the community will benefit.  I want to move away from any possible public perception that if a fine is imposed and one does not pay it, not a whole heap will happen.  I want to ensure that the courts are respected and that where orders are made that are not complied with, there is a meaningful system in place to address that.  Community service has a particular role in that context. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013061900008#G00200","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371634200,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I particularly welcome the information given by the Minister on the family law courts and on the seminar, which I will attend and I look forward to receiving details of it.  It is an area in which I am very interested.  We all hear anecdotal evidence from time to time about how families find it difficult to appear in court.  The mediation services are not great - one could be sitting on a stool next to the person one would be up against.  In that context, Wicklow Deputies received a notification from the Courts Service last week advising that the Circuit Court in Wicklow town will continue to be closed.  It has been closed temporarily and the court service has been moved to Bray.  The Courthouse in Baltinglass is to close also and all services will be concentrated in Bray.  As Deputy Mac Lochlainn mentioned, family law cases are often delayed because a criminal case is taken or for some such reason and there is a fear that family law cases will be further delayed.  I welcome the Minister's announcement of his intentions to hold a referendum on the family law area.  I know it cannot all be done on the same day, as it were, and that it will take time and resources but such a referendum will be very welcome.  I know of the Minister's interest in this area but it is one that has been ignored to some extent.<\/p><p>  Regarding the Votes, there has been a decrease in the provision for consultancy services in a number of areas, for example, for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service and under the administration heading, but there has been a large increase in the Estimate provision for the consultancy services for the prisons and for the Property Registration Authority.

There is a reduction in the provision for office premises expenses and an increase in the provision for consultancy services.  Where the provision for other areas has decreased, the Estimate provision for the Property Registration Authority has increased.  Is there a particular reason for such increased provision?

The Estimates are actually down for this year - there is not an increase.  There may be some confusion about the figures.  I will give the Deputy an opportunity to check that and I will be happy to clarify it further but I believe that is where the confusion lies.<\/p><p>  On the family law issue, it is of huge importance that people who have family problems can feel their problems can be resolved where they require court hearings with reasonable speed.  It remains the position that all our courts are not ideal for dealing with family law.  They do not all have the necessary consultation facilities.  We still only have mediation facilities within the court structures in a very small number of courts.  Essentially, the main pilot mediation process - it was called a pilot process but we have continued it -  was in Dolphin House in Dublin.  The ideal would be that we would have a mediation structure, for example, within each of the Circuit Court areas, but we do not have that.  We have the mediation service, which is available and operates under the aegis of the Legal Aid Board.<\/p><p>  One of the issues with family law is that far too many family difficulties are still dealt with through court hearings.  It was my experience during my years as a family law solicitor that when one is dealing with disputes between parents over the parenting of children - where one parent, to use the technical phrase, has custody and the other has access - all sorts of difficulties and issues can arise which can be better resolved through mediation, if both parents would be reasonable with each other, even when there is a dispute as to who should be the primary caring parent.  There are many court orders where both parents are effectively given joint custody but there is always a parent with whom a child or children primarily reside.  Unfortunately and tragically, all too frequently, the dispute between estranged parents or estranged spouses turns into a war over children and children are used as the weapons in the war without one or both parents - frequently it is only one parent - understanding the damage they are doing to their children, both in the short- and in the long-term, by the manner in which they deal with these issues.  It is of huge importance that spouses estranged from each other - former partners living with each other outside marriage who have children - realise that no matter what the enmity is between them that they should do everything possible to protect their children from it and to encourage their children to maintain good relationships with both of them.  Mediation can play a very substantial role in that.  Many judges in our courts, from the District Court up to the High Court, who when confronted with disputes between parents in this area encourage them to co-operate with each other and to resolve their disputes by agreement rather than by court order.  However, unfortunately, there is a group of individuals whose relationships break up who see their children as a means of taking revenge on their partner and they do terrible damage.  They create difficulties for the children in coming to terms not merely with the break up but in their later lives in forming relationships.  I have seen that in my 30 years as a family lawyer.  Having represented an estranged spouse in my younger days, I have ended up representing one of their adult children who has had all sorts of difficulties which I could trace back to the war that took place between the parents at an early stage in that person's life.  <\/p><p>  There is a good deal in this area that could be dealt with differently but a portion of it is dependent on individuals whose marriages break down realising that, regardless of the stress of the breakdown or who they regard as responsible for it, their children should not become the casualties and that they have a responsibility to behave well as parents with regard to their children and maintain relationships.  Of course there are exceptions to that.  There are parents who are violent towards their children and parents who abuse their children.  Obviously children must be protected from that but also, all too frequently,  those allegations are untruthfully made as a weapon in the marital breakdown war and that is a matter of difficulty.  I would like to see a situation develop in cases of disputes between parents over children that it was automatically understood that the dispute would be resolved through mediation and that only in exceptional cases should the courts have to be engaged.  <\/p> <p>What does not work is making people compulsorily attend mediation.  People must understand its benefits and volunteer to engage.  Compulsory attendance would result in engagement by individuals who have no intention of resolving matters and seeking to delay others genuine in their approach.  That is a particular issue.<\/p><p> In the context of the Legal Aid Board, strong emphasis has been placed on reducing the family mediation service waiting lists nationally to ensure that the service complements the board's law centre.  It is important people wishing to resolve matters through mediation do not have to wait longer than two to three months for an appointment at mediation.  The objective was generally maintained in 2012.  Where necessary a panel of private mediators has been used to supplement the work of the mediation service, the objective being to reduce the numbers going through the courts system unnecessarily.  This is, of course, only in the context of those who require legal aid as they are unable to afford lawyers in private practice.  Our legislation provides that lawyers must always advise people of mediation as an alternative to litigation.  Unfortunately, not everybody listens to the advice of their lawyers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2013061900009#H00500","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371634800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister.

It is hoped the emigration Bill will be published in the autumn.

The same drafters are dealing with particular measures on behalf of my Department.  The first measure that had to be completed was the insolvency measure.  The legal services Bill was delayed because of the focus and priority of the personal insolvency legislation.  The Attorney General and staff at that office do extraordinary work in meeting the demands of all Departments.  I am very conscious of that.  Unfortunately, because of all of that and the need to meet the troika's timeframes, the emigration Bill was delayed.  A substantial amount of work has been done on it by my Department and the Attorney General's office but we have not yet reached the point of having a full draft of the final Bill.  We have moved away from publishing amendments to the third Bill in this area, published by the previous Government, and are publishing a new Bill incorporating all of the necessary changes required to be made because of reservations expressed by a number of Members, including myself, on Committee Stage of the previous Government's Bill.

In 2004, the criteria for receiving the back to education allowance was six months - 156 days - notwithstanding that it was a time of high employment.  The former position suggests there is flexibility with regard to the length of time an individual should be unemployed to qualify for the allowance.  On Wednesday, 12 May 2010, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, a representative of the Department of Social Protection stated, \"The imposition of a waiting period serves to minimise the deadweight element\".  The inference was that undertaking a third level course might be easier than being unemployed and in receipt of jobseeker's benefit.  Time spent on a community employment scheme or JobBridge internship is reckonable for eligibility for the back to education allowance.  An individual who is unemployed can participate on these courses and qualify for the allowance.  In effect, he or she can be in receipt of welfare payments for a year longer than an individual who is unemployed for three months and is refused the back to education allowance.  Is this the best use of scarce resources?  Is it not an anomaly that time spent in prison is reckonable for qualification for the back to education allowance whereas an individual who is unemployed for three months does not qualify?<\/p><p>  I suggest that an individual with a third level degree is better equipped to return to the labour market.  Instead of claiming welfare payments, he or she would be contributing by paying PRSI and income tax.

The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed sees the back to education allowance as an important support for unemployed people to re-educate and retrain, in particular in the current economic climate when so much employment has been lost and so many need to upskill.  The allowance is important also for those the education system failed the first time.  Their initial education may have been a poor or unfruitful experience.<\/p><p>  The issues we raise in our written submission to the committee reflect very much some of the issues which were raised in the review the Department recently conducted of a whole range of employment supports.  One of the things that struck us from that review was that certain assumptions appeared to have been drawn on the allowance which might be unfair given that it often plays a role for those for whom second-chance education is of critical importance.  In many respects, the allowance has been criticised for poor outcomes in the way the community employment schemes have been criticised when in fact it is addressing issues the mainstream education has not.  It would be interesting to see if initiatives like Pathways to Work and the introduction of the Intreo model help with some of the data gaps which clearly exist.  The allowance must be reviewed in terms of overall education outcomes.  It is a point the Minister for Social Protection picked up on herself at the stakeholders' forum which was held around the review.<\/p><p>  The OECD has raised concerns about the lock-in effect.  We take issue with that, in particular - building on Mr. Walshe's point - as requiring a job search first, while well and good, is not an option for many given the need for longer-term engagement and the opportunity to get a degree, which is critical in the evolving labour market and in the context of scarce employment opportunities.  The back to education allowance plays a very important role in people's re-education and retraining.  Short-term courses can be very useful for those who already have significant education or experience.  It allows them to redirect their experience and education into areas in which there are opportunities.  Unfortunately, this is not an option for many who require longer-term intervention.  We have concerns also about the proposal to increase the age limit from 21 to 23 years.  In many respects, this change presents particular challenges to the State if the Youth Guarantee is rolled out.  The back to education allowance is currently the most significant activation measure.  The age limit change reduces its availability.<\/p><p>  Cuts to supports have, unfortunately, already taken place in last year's budget.  This has thrown up considerable issues for people, in particular in relation to the abolition of the cost-of-education allowance, which was important to many.  Eligibility issues represent a range of challenges.  It will be interesting to see over time if the case management approach which is being rolled out through Intreo will help to address these.  It is important that the model is rolled out not just to jobseekers but beyond.  That will require that frontline staff have a strong grasp of the education and training options available to people and can offer people useful advice and guidance on access to courses of relevance to them and which assist them to progress to work.<\/p> <p>That is particularly important if we are to get better outcomes from the back to education allowance.  A number of anomalies exist in the system, particularly in respect of those progressing on from other payments who may benefit from the back to education allowance.  If an individual transferring from jobseeker's benefit to jobseeker's allowance ends up on the supplementary allowance, he or she may need to apply for the back to education allowance to avail of educational opportunities.  The nature of the academic year also creates problems on that front.<\/p><p> The issue of choice arose at our recent annual delegate conference.  An unemployed delegate made the interesting observation that a person is an expert on his or her own life.  That tends to get lost in the debate on activation schemes and the back to education allowance.  If this scheme changes in the same way as many others have, in terms of people being directed into schemes, provision should be made for constructive dialogue with the unemployed person so that his or her concerns are taken on board and he or she is supported in making an informed and appropriate choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013061900003#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Br&iacute;d O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371654600,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Oliver Egan, assistant secretary in the Department of Social Protection, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013061900004#D00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371654600,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to address it.  I will outline the background the schemes and the issues which we are currently addressing before considering Mr. Walshe's case and the general issues arising.<\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection provides a broad range of training and education schemes to assist jobseekers in their efforts to return to employment.  While the Department of Education and Skills has the lead role in supporting learners, the Department of Social Protection supports individuals returning to education primarily through the back to education programme, which consists of the back to education allowance, the part-time education option and the education, training and development option.  The back to education allowance is a broadly targeted non-statutory second chance education opportunity scheme for eligible individuals on certain social welfare payments who desire to participate in full-time education.  In 2012 we conducted a high level review of employment supports, followed by a stakeholders' conference earlier this year to consider a number of recommendations.  The report produced at that time included an analysis of the relevant back to education data of those originating from live register payments which indicated that 60% of those who completed or dropped out of a course under the allowance at the end of the 2010-11 academic year had returned to the live register by September 2012.  In preparing for this meeting we calculated that the figure for the previous two years was approximately 58%. <\/p><p>  Like many other schemes, the back to education allowance is undergoing a process of reform, as is evident in the changes introduced in recent budgets and the recommendations we are now making.  Ms Rogers touched on some of the salient recommendations from the review.  While the three month eligibility period for second level courses should be retained, we recommended that it should apply to those pursuing second chance education leading to a qualification at leaving certificate level or lower.  Post-leaving certificate and further education courses should remain subject to the nine month eligibility period.  We suggest that the general minimum age requirement for entry to the back to education allowance should be raised from 21 years to 23 years.  For those pursuing second chance education leading to a qualification at leaving certificate level or lower, the age requirement should remain at 21 years.  In line with other activation schemes,  the back to education jobseeker's participants should establish an underlying entitlement to jobseeker's allowance prior to qualification.  Those who complete a course and wish to progress to a higher level course should be required to qualify for the back to education by establishing an entitlement to social welfare payments.  The practice of freezing jobseeker's benefit for those on the back to education allowance should be discontinued.  The practice of maximising payments for participants on means reduced payments should be discontinued and only the underlying social welfare entitlements should be paid to participants where an entitlement exists.  As case management and client profiling are developed, the Department should actively exercise discretion on what clients can access under the back to education allowance.  This would involve assessing the likely contribution courses would make to clients' employment chances given their backgrounds and local and national labour market conditions.  In this context and with a view to moving to more targeted schemes, attendance on shorter term, accelerated and conversion courses, which are more suitable to certain cohorts, could be delivered.<\/p><p>  In respect of Mr. Walshe's case, currently the period for which a person is required to be on a qualifying social welfare payment such as jobseeker's payment before accessing a second level option is three months, or 78 days, or nine months, or 234 days, in the case of third level options.  The latter was reduced from 12 months in 2010.  Mr. Walshe was refused a back to education allowance on 25 August.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013061900004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1371654600,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting Mr. Egan but he may have misunderstood the reason for this meeting.

In essence, they allow for greater targeting of activation places and opportunities.  This is consistent with the policy set out in pathways to work and is part of the reason we are considering these issues.<\/p><p>  The live register is constantly changing, with large numbers joining and exiting it in any given period.  The average exit rates in 2013 at the three, six, nine and 12 month durations are 25%, 46%, 59% and 69%, respectively.  This means that an average of 25% of those who join the live register in any given month will leave within three months, 46% within six months, 59% within nine months and 69% within 12 months.  Given that the scheme confers an entitlement to extend certain social welfare payments for a considerable period of time, it is necessary to enforce an appropriate eligibility period.<\/p><p>  Persons on the live register for one year or longer, who are known as the long-term unemployed, now account for 45% of all persons on the live register.  This rate has increased slowly in recent months.  Pathways to work targets these long-term unemployed persons to assist them in gaining access to the labour market and further education.<\/p><p>  The numbers availing of the back to education allowance and the associated cost of the scheme have increased dramatically in recent years.  As of the end of September 2012, 25,961 individuals were availing of the current 2012-13 academic year, which represents an increase of 192% on the figure for 2007-08.  Expenditure on the scheme also increased dramatically, from &euro;64 million in 2007 to more than &euro;200 million in 2012.  In addition to these increases, bespoke versions of back to education schemes support new initiatives from the Department of Education and Skills, such as Momentum and ICT.  These two initiatives offer a combined 7,000 places, many of which are on full courses which may be supported under the back to education allowance.  This creates further pressure on expenditure.  At the end of April 2013, 27,830 people were engaged in back to education schemes, 91% of whom originated from unemployment payments.<\/p><p>  In regard to future policy development, the report outlines where we think resources should be targeted and how clear entitlement periods could be established to benefit the greater majority of people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013061900004#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1371654600,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I apologise for the confusion.

There is something illogical in the way it operates at present.<\/p> <p>With a back to education scheme as rigid as the current one if, for example, one signs on in February, it will be 20 months before one is eligible to begin a university course, not nine months.  One might be eligible to apply for the back to education allowance.  That is one of the key issues.  Anybody signing on early in the year for a university course, most of which begin at the end of September or October, will be excluded because he or she will not have the nine required months.<\/p><p> Earlier this year the length of time one was allocated jobseeker's benefit was reduced from 12 months to nine months.  There was no change in the eligibility requirements for the likes of back to education down to six months to reflect that change of three months.<\/p><p> Mr. Egan mentioned that the Department will increase the minimum age for the back to education scheme from 21 to 23.  I am trying to figure out the justification for that.  With this change, young people who have completed their leaving certificate and want to go to university could be six years out of formal education, because some people complete their leaving certificates at the age of 17.  In a time of crisis the Department is reducing their options.  Besides the fact that social welfare payments have been cut for young people under the age of 25, the Department is now saying the educational options are also going to be restricted, and in many ways that is why we are seeing so many young people emigrating.  The Department is sending out another message that if there is no work there, there is no education at the level some of these people would require.  People may have completed their leaving certificate and may have got good results, and decided not to go to university, but they might want to go later.  There are other options such as the Springboard programme and the like but many people need a back to education allowance and it is not an option to hang around waiting to qualify by age or by the number of months they have been on the live register.  That is why we are seeing people emigrating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013061900004#D00900","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371655200,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I should have explained that, predictably, many of the questions will be for Mr. Egan, but if Ms O'Brien or Mr. Walshe want to respond to a question they should feel free to indicate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013061900005#E00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371655200,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I am conscious of what the Deputy said but we look at back to education as one of a range of programmes.

Within the portfolio of the moneys we spend we are trying to see how to target this to get the best outcomes, bearing in mind that we have Momentum, internships and a range of other programmes that come into the same sphere.  We are trying to fit in that overall context and working within the progression in terms of ensuring within the range of FETAC-type qualifications that progression route is there.

Perhaps I am reading it in too simplistic a fashion but I am trying to bring this down to the fact that certain people in the system are entitled to claim &euro;188 per week on jobseeker's benefit but they are not entitled to attend college while in receipt of that payment and are not eligible for the back to education allowance, which is the same monetary value per week and would enable them to do a course.  The policy framework is much more complicated but it does not seem to make sense that we are keeping people out of education and leaving them on the dole when they have access to courses.  Is it purely a policy issue?  Could it be changed in a policy scenario and could we re-examine this so those people are not just left sitting on the dole?  If they want to better themselves, as Mr. Walshe highlighted, could that be open to them?  Are we biting off our noses to spite our faces?  Are we getting caught up in red tape?  That is why we were interested in this scenario.<\/p><p>  We need to do everything we can to help people in this scenario, whether long-term or short-term unemployed, trying to get back to work, better themselves and retrain themselves.  Can the guidelines be tweaked, without any extra expense to the Exchequer, so that we can facilitate people who find themselves in this situation?

The issue of the back to education scheme is the lock-in effect, and that is why I mentioned the figures in terms of the normal turnover in the labour market.  One wants to design a programme that is most effective.  We are conscious that if we put the intervention in too early the lock-in effect could go on for a number of years, increase the cost and distort the market.  That is a complicated way of saying we want to ensure the people who use the programme can really benefit from it.  Other people may have moved off the labour market already and have secured jobs.  We do not want to put the appropriate package in too early.<\/p><p>  As our service and the role of case officers is developing, we must evaluate this because we want the case officers to work with the clients in a way which gives them the intervention at the best possible time.  In doing that, there will be an element of what is our role in the Department of Social Protection <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> the Department of Education and Skills.  Our role is within the labour market, how that is performing, and to help people back into jobs.  That is our primary concern.  There will always be eligibility criteria.

We must carefully work on the parameters of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013061900006#F01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371656400,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kevin Walshe for his petition and for coming before the committee today because it is important.  For decades many members of the public have faced a disconnect when they have had a difficulty in seeking or gaining a benefit or entitlement.  It is great Mr. Walshe is here today, and that Ms Br&iacute;d O'Brien and Mr. Lynch from the INOU and the officials from the Department are also before the committee.  This is democracy at its best whereby a person who has an issue can appear before a committee and engage.  Politicians and Departments have a role to fulfil and a job to do and, as the departmental officials know, I very much respect their role.  We must work together to come to a solution which is agreeable to everybody.<\/p><p>  I was struck by a line in Mr. Walshe's presentation which summarises the entire issue.  He suggested an individual with a third level degree is better equipped to return to the labour market, and instead of claiming welfare payments would be contributing by paying PRSI and income tax.  This summarises the issue.  All most people are trying to do is better themselves so they are able to contribute to society rather than having to seek payments.  Of course some people find themselves in impossible situations, and because of personal problems find it difficult to better themselves, but as a rule people want to better themselves at all times.  Our job, and the job of the departmental officials, is to assist people in getting to this place, wherever this place is and whatever it takes it should be done.<\/p><p>  I believe 100% in the bona fides of the departmental officials here today and I believe they want to engage.  At the same time, and this must be publicly acknowledged, people working at the Department of Social Protection are under tremendous pressure because of budgetary constraints, and I acknowledge this.  It is not as though they go around with a big bag of money which they can unlock and let out.  They cannot do so because they are not in this position.  I ask them to read the common sense paragraph at the end of Mr Walshe's submission which answers it all.  Getting people to a better place takes them from simply looking for something from the State to contributing to the State.  Education and further betterment of a person is what it is all about.  This is what will save the country, and get us from where we are to being a better place for everybody to live.  There is nothing corny about stating Mr. Walshe is making history today.  He may not think so, but he is.  I hope he will be the first of many people who will be welcomed to Leinster House.  This is not our house, it is Mr. Walshe's house and he is very welcome to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013061900007#G00200","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1371656400,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I join with previous speakers in welcoming Mr. Kevin Walshe and I commend him for his work and initiative in submitting his petition and getting it to this stage.  It is great to see the Oireachtas being open to average citizens to come here and have an audience with legislators and those who set policy and with departmental officials who are responsible for overseeing it, and suggesting reforms and taking on board the issues of what is working well and what is not.  I also welcome Ms O'Brien and Mr. Lynch and the departmental officials, Mr. Spellman, Mr. Fleming and Mr. Egan.<\/p><p>  Most Oireachtas Members have come across cases such as the one Mr. Walshe has brought before us.  A genuine person has lost his job and is trying to engage as best he can to better himself, get back into the workforce and retrain, but he is told he must be on unemployment benefit for at least nine months before he can avail of the back to education allowance.  It is an exceptionally difficult situation to be in and unbelievably frustrating.  Many people who have found themselves in the position have spoken to me.  At the same time, I see the rationale for it.  Availing of an education course is expensive and can be very difficult.  It is very difficult for someone to keep up with work while completing an education course.  If the benefit were immediately available how would we deal with cases whereby people may give up their jobs?  This is the flipside.  If it were immediately available people would look at the option.  This is the difficult scenario.  I have no doubt this is the reason behind the nine month condition.<\/p><p>  In recent years many people have ended up on the dole queues and find themselves in a very difficult scenario.  At the very beginning, with no immediate job options available and no immediate prospects, it is very clear they need to retrain to find opportunities.  At the first engagement with the system they are told they must be unemployed for nine months before they can receive many of the benefits, which it is understood and known they need and that they are genuine.  We must address this.<\/p><p>  Several speakers spoke about ensuring we tailor the offers made to each person who becomes unemployed, and the State is weak in this regard.  People undoubtedly feel very alone when they end up on the dole queue and look to see where to go next.  The services we provide to them are quite limited.  I know the departmental officials are very stretched, but we have never properly engaged with people on an individual basis to assess their needs and as a State give them the best opportunity suitable to them and help and manage them along the way.<\/p><p>  The establishment of Intreo is an opportunity, but I have not yet seen any evidence it is what is required.  The concept is a recognition of the general need for such a service, but whether it operates in this way is another issue.  Unemployment benefit can be given as a payment to a family comprising a man, woman and three children as a substantial weekly payment over a significant length of time, but our engagement with them is to ensure they are seeking work, and as long as a letter arrives every now and again stating they are seeking work they can be left there and this can drag on.  They may end up being sent on a course which does not address their needs but which is thought will suit them, but only gives them something to do without necessarily leading them down the path which best suits them.  It is a real pity we do not have a tailored system because it is what we need.  We need everybody to be considered on their own merits and helped by the State with people qualified and trained to assist them.  What Mr. Walshe has brought before us today is the crunch point, and an example of the first frustration many people face.  It is a very sharp manifestation of our failure in how we work with people who are unemployed and how we help them back to the workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013061900007#G00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371656400,"counter":575,"content":"<p>There is an issue with regard to the submission we made on the back to education allowance and people on jobseeker's payments.  We have identified an anomaly between where a person finishes on jobseeker's benefit and seeks to claim jobseeker's allowance.  The time spent on supplementary welfare allowance is virtually a no man's land where a person cannot apply or qualify for the back to education allowance.  At present there is an intervention by the Department with regard to the jobseeker's benefit.  A number of weeks in advance of a person exhausting or running out of a jobseeker's benefit claim the Department makes contact to advise him or her the claim is likely to run out and that he or she may be able to qualify for jobseeker's allowance.  This would provide the Department with an ideal opportunity to highlight and flag the possibility of the back to education allowance as an option, and for the person to indicate whether it is something in which he or she would be interested.<\/p> <p>At that point, the person could indicate whether he or she was interested in it.  The Department could engage with the person in overcoming the barrier or no man's land of completing his or her jobseeker's benefit claim and applying for jobseeker's allowance without access to the back to education allowance.  If the person was able to flag in advance an interest in pursuing the back to education allowance, the Department would be able to examine his or her claim in a different light and engage with him or her or examine the means testing or qualification criteria sooner.  In this way, the person's transition to jobseeker's allowance could be smoother, shorter and easier and would avoid the no man's land of being unable to apply.<\/p><p> The Department has been practical and helpful in terms of developing services, automation and finding easy solutions to problems.  This solution has been presented through the contacts with the Department.  If followed up on, it could be particularly useful to individuals seeking the back to education allowance.<\/p><p> We would also consider the issue of genuinely seeking work, in that a person's indication of an interest in the back to education allowance would not be seen as a negative in respect of his or her genuinely seeking work.  The allowance would be seen as part of the amount and people would not be excluded from a payment simply because they wanted to pursue education in addition to looking for work.  Nor would there be a perception that they had chosen education over work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013061900007#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371657000,"counter":577,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Egan wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013061900008#H00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371657000,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I listened carefully to comments and do not find myself disagreeing with them.

On each of the three previous occasions I appeared before this committee I complained bitterly about the fact that while Members were protected by privilege, citizens were not.<\/p> <p>On the previous occasions on which I appeared before the committee, we, the citizens, had no privilege, whereas members did.  I complained bitterly about this on each occasion.  I congratulate whoever decided to extend privilege.  It is only right that all citizens are treated equally.<\/p><p> I turn to our opening address.  The Olympic Council of Ireland, OCI, is the organising committee charged with the authority to enter and send a team to each summer and winter Olympic Games.  The OCI is the national Olympic committee governing the island of Ireland and recognised by the International Olympic Committee, IOC, as such.  The OCI is a democratically elected body encompassing all Olympic sports and elected every four years by its member federations.<\/p><p> Preparation for every Olympic Games begins early in the four year cycle.  The OCI appointed Sonia O'Sullivan, one of our greatest ever athletes, as the <i>chef de mission<\/i>of the Irish team for the London games.  This decision was received enthusiastically by all parties and Sonia immediately began work, supported by our full-time professional administration team and sports director, with the federations and the athletes in preparation for the London games.  It was significant to have the experience of such a leader and of great benefit and assistance to all our athletes to have a person of the stature of Sonia O'Sullivan living in the Olympic village with them to assist and advise the team.<\/p><p> It is a rule of the IOC that the torch relay will only travel within the territory of the Olympic committee of the host country.  In the case of the London games, this raised a problem in the case of Ireland.  The North of Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and a problem arose in relation to the torch relay travelling outside Northern Ireland.  After successful lobbying with the IOC and the London organising committee and having regard to the current situation in Ireland, the goodwill between Ireland and the United Kingdom and the success of the Queen's visit to Ireland, permission was granted to bring the torch relay across the Border.  It was a unique day - 6 June 2012 - when the torch crossed the Border carried by Wayne McCullough from Belfast - a boxing silver medallist at the Barcelona 1992 Olympic Games - and Michael Carruth from Dublin - a boxing gold medallist at the same games - together with several hundred schoolchildren from the national schools of Newry and Dundalk.  The torch then came to Dublin and was received at the headquarters of the OCI in Howth by President Michael D. Higgins.  It then went on a relay through Dublin city and was greeted by the Taoiseach at Government Buildings before ending its journey at a concert in St. Stephen's Green attended by thousands of people.  It was a unique day in the country and truly showed how the power of sport could unite.<\/p><p> During the preparatory period for the games the OCI worked in very close collaboration with the Irish Sports Council, ISC, in completing an early stage working agreement which provided for our representation on the high performance advisory and technical committees.  In tandem with a representative on the ISC board, this provided the two organisations with a regular communication strand from the top down.  This joint approach paid great dividends.  I acknowledge the great help and support we received from the ISC and commend the way it is continuing in the current preparations for the next Olympic Games.  These are the Winter Olympic Games at Sochi, Russia, in February 2014 and the Summer Olympic Games at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016.<\/p><p> When the qualification process finished, the team consisted of 66 athletes, covering 14 sports, including athletics, badminton, boxing, canoeing, cycling, equestrian, gymnastics, judo, modern pentathlon, rowing, sailing, shooting, swimming and triathlon.  The athletes were supported by a team of dedicated coaches and support staff to ensure they had all the assistance they required.  A top-class medical team was put in place to ensure medical support for the athletes was second to none.  On the advice of our <i>chef de mission<\/i>, Sonia O'Sullivan, it was decided to have a holding, or pre-training, camp.  On foot of her great experience, she did not want the young athletes going directly into the Olympic village, which could have had a negative effect on them.  She recommended a holding camp be adopted where the athletes were settled in and from which they were gradually moved into the Olympic village.  We secured an arrangement with Lensbury, Teddington, and the initiative proved to be a gigantic success.  The athletes were extremely happy with the arrangement.  There was a significant Irish connection in the use of training grounds at St. Mary's University College, Twickenham, also known as Strawberry Hill, which, during the years, has trained many Irish physical education teachers.  We were honoured to receive a visit from the Taoiseach to athletes at the holding camp.  He also attended the opening and closing ceremonies, which was a great boost for the team.  I reiterate the excellent support received from the ISC in the preparation phase and its financial contribution towards the camp.  The Olympic village was top class and the Irish delegation received a great welcome from the officials there.  Many volunteers at the village were from Ireland or had Irish heritage, which made it very pleasant for the athletes.<\/p><p> The opening ceremony took place on 27 July 2012 and competition started the same day.  The competition finished with the closing ceremony on the evening of Sunday, 12 August 2012.  We are happy to inform the committee that the results for Ireland were as follows; Katie Taylor, boxing gold; John Joe Nevin, boxing silver; Paddy Barnes, boxing bronze; Michael Conlan, boxing bronze; Cian O'Connor, equestrian bronze; Rob Heffernan, fourth place, 50 km walking race; Annalise Murphy, fourth place, laser radial sailing; eventing team, fifth place, equestrian; Aoife Clarke, seventh place, individual eventing, equestrian; Natayla Coyle, ninth place, modern pentathlon; Andrez Jezierski, ninth place, C1 200 m, canoeing; Hannah Craig, tenth place, canoe slalom; and David Burrows and Peter O'Leary, tenth place in the star category.  In addition, the 4 x 400 women's relay team was ranked 13th, Sanita Puspure was placed 13th in single scull rowing and Martyn Irvine was placed 13th in men's omnium cycling.  Further results included Olive Loughnane, 13th, 20 km walk; Joseph Murphy, 14th place, individual eventing, and Matt McGovern and Ryan Seaton, 14th place in the 49er sailing category.  Canoeist Eoin Rheinisch and Derval O'Rourke made their respective semi finals and were ranked 14th and 15th, respectively.  This was the best ever performance of any Olympic team since Ireland first entered the Olympic Games at Paris in 1924.<\/p><p> We congratulate the London organising committee under Lord Sebastian Coe who is a great friend of Ireland and helped us in every way possible.  The organisation of the games was top class and it was one of the best Olympic Games ever.  The competition was helped considerably by the great support of the British public as volunteers and fans of sport who thronged to all venues ensuring athletes from around the world received tremendous support.  <\/p><p> That concludes the brief presentation from the OCI.  We will be very happy to answer questions members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900003#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Hickey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371630900,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for giving us the opportunity to address them.  As Mr. Hickey has indicated, I address the committee following a very successful Olympic Games for Ireland and its athletes.  This has been our first opportunity to address the committee since the end of the last Olympic and Paralympic Games.<\/p><p>  The Irish Sports Council was established in 1999.  One of its statutory obligations was the development of high performance sport in Ireland.  Among the critical mechanisms for the review of our performance are the outcomes of Olympic Games and other international championships.  Following previous competitions, the council completed, for example, the Sydney review, the Athens review and the Beijing review, respectively.  Each of the review documents, while distinct, shares the traits of being honest, collaborative and ambitious.<\/p> <p>They set out ambitious targets for our planning period.  This is done in co-operation with the national governing bodies, the Olympic Council of Ireland and the Paralympic Council.  I should also mention the director of the Institute of Sport, Mr. Gary Keegan, who is with us this morning, and Mr. Paul McDermott, who will be taking over as director of high performance sport.  Regrettably, we lost our high performance director, Finbarr Kirwan, since the Olympics.  He was poached by the US Olympic Council, which is evidence of the high calibre and performance of the Irish Sports Council and its staff.  I pay particular tribute to Mr. Kirwan and wish Mr. McDermot success in his new role.  Mr. Kirwan's departure is another country's advantage.<\/p><p> The key metric in high performance is the number of medals or podium places achieved across all supported programmes.  In the four years up to Athens, Ireland achieved 54 medals, in the Beijing cycle we achieved 70 medals and in the London cycle we achieved an extraordinary 163 medals.  These included 61 medals in 2012 at European, World, Olympic and Paralympic level.  Our success has continued into 2013, particularly in boxing, equestrian sports and sailing.  I hope we will also enjoy success in athletics in Moscow.  Our swimmers will be competing later in July and we hope to see new talent emerge in that context.  These successes are due to the performance of extraordinary Irish athletes in a multiplicity of disciplines.<\/p><p> Prior to the Olympic Games, the council set a target of nine finalists or the equivalent thereof and three medals for the Olympic team.  The final outcome for Irish athletes in London was five medals and 14 top ten finishes.  This equals Ireland's best ever medal total and was a significant improvement on previous Olympic Games.  Ireland placed 41st on the medal table rankings, compared to 61st in Beijing.  Overall, Team Ireland produced 27 top 16 performances in London, compared to 19 in Beijing.  This, however, was eclipsed by the extraordinary performance of our Paralympic athletes in London.  The council set a target of five medals for the Paralympic team, with a possibility of three golds.  The final outcome for Irish athletes in London was 16 medals, of which eight were gold.  Ireland finished 19th on the medal table rankings. <\/p><p> This performance represents an excellent return on the taxpayer's investment in Irish sport, which investment was made at considerable cost given the difficulties with the public finances during the period in question.  As chairman of the Sports Council, I am very conscious of the need for governance in accounting for public moneys.  Since becoming chairman, I have insisted on publishing all the council's spending in every discipline and activity annually so that the public is fully aware who gets how much and for what purpose and taxpayers can be fully conversant with our bang for their euro.  <\/p><p> Over the past several years a relative peace has descended on the sporting community.  We now have a collaborative community.  I am always conscious in making such statements that a row may break out somewhere tomorrow to disprove what I say but I hope peace will continue to reign.  We have an extraordinarily positive relationship with our colleagues on the Olympic Council of Ireland.  I would like to take this opportunity to note the other success we enjoyed in London in Mr. Pat Hickey's election to the executive committee of the International Olympics Council.  He follows in the steps of Lord Killanin and I wish him every success.  I thank Senator Eamonn Coghlan for his work with the council and as chair of the high performance committee.  He agreed to continue chairing the committee after his election to the Seanad to facilitate a smooth transition into 2012.<\/p><p> We also have a good working relationship with our political masters, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ring.  Both individuals have taken to their portfolios with enthusiasm and learned new things about new games, as I have as chairman.  We could not have a more enthusiastic supporter of everything Irish on the international stage than the Minister of State, who is an inspirational figure wherever he addresses our athletes and sportspeople.  I thank the Government and the people of Ireland for recognising the success of Irish sportspeople in the various receptions given in Farmleigh.  Our President has acted likewise in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  Even though the sports budget has suffered some cutbacks in the past several years in line with all agencies and Departments, we appreciate that the Government and the Oireachtas has kept to a minimum the cuts to the sports budget.  We can manage with this level of funding and while we would obviously like more, we will have to wait for better times.<\/p><p> That the value we offer for the taxpayer's money is reflected on the international stage does not mean national and local sports are ignored.  Sometimes, however, the benchmark is based on international competitions.  We all feel pride when the tricolour is raised for our athletes on the podium.  With a bit of luck, we could have achieved an additional two or three medals but that was not to be.  I am glad to say the athletes have decided to prepare for the Rio Olympics and we have decided to continue funding them.<\/p><p> I will now hand over to Mr. John Treacy, a silver Olympian and chief executive of the council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900004#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Mulvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371631500,"counter":594,"content":"<p>The high performance system is delivering improved results due to a number of factors.  Our identified or targeted sports national governing bodies are capable of delivering sustained and repeated success at international level.  Each sport has a dedicated high performance function which is led by a performance director.  The Irish Sports Council's high performance unit provides support to the sport.  Funding is in two major blocks, performance planning and international carding scheme.  The Institute of Sport, which is an operational unit of the council, provides high quality services to sports and athletes.<\/p><p>  There is an all-island dimension to this in that we work closely with our counterparts in Sport Northern Ireland the Sports Institute of Northern Ireland.  A number of our sports are pursued on an all-island basis and Olympians who compete for Ireland can receive dual funding from both bodies.  We have also established operational agreements and functioning working groups with the Olympic Council of Ireland and Paralympics Ireland.<\/p><p>  A high performance committee provides strategic overview of this system.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan chaired this committee throughout the London cycle and I thank him for his outstanding contribution.  Funding decisions are taken by the board of the Irish Sports Council. <\/p><p>  The council uses four key mechanisms to improve the system.<\/p> <p>All investment and activity in high-performance sport is based on the fundamental ethical foundation of clean sport.  The Irish Sports Council operates the Irish sport anti-doping programme and is very proud that it is acknowledged as one of the best in the world.  This reputation is hard-earned and should give reassurance to the sports family and wider community of the integrity of Irish athletes.<\/p><p> The first mechanism is the performance planning system.  The designated high-performance sports, such as athletics, boxing and sailing, receive funding to implement their performance plans.  These plans, devised and implemented by each sport's performance director, are agreed with the Irish Sports Council and the Irish Institute of Sport and, if it applies, with Sport Northern Ireland.  They are detailed and technical documents which set out the full range of activities in the area of high performance in a given year across all disciplines and age ranges.  To date, 16 sports bodies have been allocated &euro;5.5 million to support their performance plans in 2013.<\/p><p> The second mechanism is the international carding scheme, which is the mechanism of direct funding to athletes.  Funding is allocated across a number of sports under various categories based on agreed performance criteria.  This direct funding allows athletes train and compete at the highest level required on the international stage.  In 2013, 86 athletes will receive funding totalling &euro;1.7 million.<\/p><p> Third, the Irish Institute of Sport provides sports science and medicine services to high-performance athletes and sports.  Based at the National Sports Campus in Abbotstown, the institute develops performance systems, provides science and medical support and is actively engaged in the development of the people engaged in high-performance sport in Ireland.  This is critical to ensuring Irish athletes do not have to leave the country but can get the best services here in Ireland.  We believe the institute made a major contribution in the last four years and will continue to drive improvements in the Irish system.  In 2012 the institute delivered more than 2,000 hours of direct service to 166 athletes from 18 sports and provided more than 10,000 hours in the field working with athletes, coaches and national governing bodies.<\/p><p> Fourth, the council supports the work of the Olympic Council of Ireland and Paralympics Ireland.  In 2013 the two bodies receive grants of &euro;412,000 and &euro;910,000 respectively.  Above and beyond that, the working relationship between the agencies, as Mr. Mulvey and Mr. Hickey said, has never been better.  Paralympics Ireland is not present today, but I acknowledge the excellence of its work in the preparation of its athletes for London 2012.  It has been observed that the London games brought Paralympic sport into the mainstream and it has taken up a permanent place in the affections of the Irish public.  We hope and believe that is true.  Paralympics Ireland, both administrators and athletes, make a major contribution to the development of the global movement and we are very proud of that achievement.<\/p><p> London 2012 was the culmination of many years' work.  The team exceeded the long-term targets set for Ireland.  Everyone involved was delighted at the standard of performance, not just by the outstanding medal winners but by all the team.  It was the best organised Olympic team and that was apparent before, during and after the games.  One of the most important issues impacting athletes is how they handle the transition to a regular lifestyle after competing at a high level.  This has emerged as major issue for athletes in Ireland, and elsewhere, and has an impact on their performance in sport and, importantly, on their well being in life after sport.  The athlete performance transition programme was a major initiative developed by the institute that was launched before the London Games.  It was designed to support athletes through the process of qualification, competing and returning from the games.  The programme provided post-games support to over 70 Olympic and Paralympic athletes.  This included individual and group debriefing, workshops, medical checks and referrals, performance planning and, very importantly, career planning.  Many athletes benefitted from the programme and, in our view, it represents a significant advance on what was available in the past.<\/p><p> We are keenly aware of the risks of operating in a four year cycle.  Work commenced in 2011 on planning for 2016 so that there would be a seamless transition into the next cycle.  There were three key components to that project.  First, a new performance planning template was devised.  Second, a fundamental review of the international scheme was undertaken.  Third, there was a wide-ranging debrief of all the sports that participated in London 2012.<\/p><p> The new performance planning system is in place.  It is robust and looks to the medium and long term.  The new system sets out plans up to Rio 2016 which has many benefits.  Not least, the sports are not involved in a constant exercise of annual planning but can instead look to the long term.  By its nature high-performance sport is highly selective and must be which can deliver success.  However, it is also open to sports that can devise a compelling plan that can demonstrate potential to compete at Olympic level.  The Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, plan for women's sevens is an example, and we are working with them in an interesting project to qualify for Rio.<\/p><p> A fundamental root and branch review of the international carding scheme took place.  Publication of the review took place in the autumn.  The council is committed to the full implementation of the recommendations of the review and that process has commenced.  The 2013 scheme was considerably changed from previous editions.  The concept of direct athlete funding is retained.  However, it will be a more targeted scheme.  Crucially, and consistent with the philosophy of a sport-led, performance director-led system, the scheme will transfer to the direct management of the individual sports over time.<\/p><p> The official Debrief from 2012 Olympic Games was published earlier this year.  It was prepared by UK consultants on behalf of the Irish Sports Council.  It carried out individual debriefs for each of the 15 national governing bodies involved.  Some 122 people across the 15 sports were interviewed in the process.  It was a very elaborate consultation process.  The Olympic Council of Ireland was included in the consultation.  Paralympics Ireland carried out its own debrief.<\/p><p> The debrief states that the overall performance in London by the key Irish team was a marked improvement on recent Olympic Games.  There is a broad consensus that the development and management of performance sport has improved substantially in recent years and in particular since the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.  Of particular note were greater sophistication in planning, increased quality of service support and stronger relationships between all the agencies.  It was also highlighted that pre-games preparation work improved substantially.  Athletes consistently identified the pre-games training camp as having a direct and positive impact on performance.  I congratulate the Olympic Council of Ireland for organising that because it was a splendid camp.<\/p><p> The debriefs provide a series of recommendations, both generic for the system and individually for each sport.  Again, there is a commitment to the implementation of those recommendations which serve as an operational plan for the next cycle.  Clearly, there is a lot of change under way.  The system is moving away from an individual athlete and coach funding system.  The focus is on a performance director-led system.  There has been no rest since London and everyone in the system is working hard to continue to build a sport system that delivers sustainable and repeatable success for Ireland.<\/p><p> Since London 2012 we have witnessed a series of outstanding performances.  Many good things are happening in Irish sport.  The work requires substantial investment.  The support of the committee in securing that investment is greatly appreciated.  As we can see, Irish sport delivers a big return on taxpayers' money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900005#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Treacy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371632100,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for a comprehensive report.

I am pleased both groups are here together and, as Mr. Mulvey said, there is peace and harmony across the sporting organisations.  Mr. Hickey referred to the note that privilege was in place.  There was a time when I would have loved if privilege had been in place because I would have loved to have heard some of the undercurrents that existed.  That time has passed and it is good that we can almost look back in a jocose way and recognise the tremendous changes that have taken place, the positive impact that prevails and the success.  We can congratulate both groups for their input into the most recent success at the London Olympic Games and wish them well in their continued endeavours.  This committee covers so much, concentrating on matters of transport, tourism, communications and natural resources, and often our role in sporting activity and endeavour is put to the side to some extent.<\/p> <p>With Senator Eamonn Coghlan on the committee, we have been dragged back to focus on it because sport has such a positive impact - which the representatives know well from their work but which is often lost on us and on society generally - on individual participants, entertainment and health promotion.  Our role is about how we can continue to support the various bodies as opposed to telling them what to do.  I am not qualified to do that.  What more as legislators can we do to assist them in the work they undertake to encourage greater participation, enhance sporting activity and ensure the various federations succeed in attracting more participants?<\/p><p> At the end of the day, Mr. Mulvey referred to value for taxpayers' money and the work done in this regard and he stated the cuts have not been as deep.  This is right because of the impact of sport on people's lives.  What are the representatives views on sponsorship and advertising by the drinks industry?  We are preparing a report on this issue and it is timely that they are before us.  I am interested in their views on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900006#H00300","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371632700,"counter":599,"content":"<p>With regard to what legislators can do, it is vitally important, as the Deputy said, that they take an active interest in this area because sometimes those who are involved suffer from feeling they are unique and there is something special about it; there is not.  Ireland participates in a multiplicity of sports at many levels internationally.  We have our own sports, which are part of our history, but, internationally, we are required as a country to put out teams and individual athletes and they have to be fully prepared.  That requires facilities, training, resources and the capacity to achieve that.  The ISC, OCI and Paralympics Ireland are attempting to achieve that by co-operation internationally and I am delighted that we are working in that regard, which is vitally important.<\/p><p>  Legislators can be of particular assistance in ensuring as best they can that our budgets are protected.  I would love to ask them to increase them but I am as realistic as the next person to know that will not be a possibility for the next two or three years but at least they should be protected at the current level because we are close to critical mass.  We have been able over the past number of years to retain the funding for the NGBs, particularly the smaller bodies, but that means we have had to cut the larger ones substantially, including Special Olympics Ireland, the FAI, IRFU and GAA.  The large field sports have taken a substantive hit to protect them.  We have managed to work that out with them by engaging directly in extensive discussions rather than announcing the cuts.  They are living with that but any further cut would begin to eat into these organisations and, therefore, we ask members to become advocates on behalf of sport.<\/p><p>  The initiative Senator Coghlan has taken regarding physical education in schools is vital.  I hear everybody talking about essential parts of the curriculum but if the youth are not captured by sport, they are lost forever.  As we are aware from other social problems in our society, we have to ensure, given young people are captive audiences for nine to ten months of the year at all levels of the education system, the curriculum on physical education is promoted and is transferred across other curricular issues.<\/p><p>  The other issue in the context of legislation is the protection of sports.  As Mr. Treacy said and Mr. Hickey emphasised, we have to have clean sport.  It must be free of any attempt to influence it by any form of drug taking.  Second, that position must be represented internationally, as Ministers do at WADA and, third, it must be ensured minority sports are protected and supported because of traditions in this country.  We have to ensure that not only individual athletes, but team sports are protected to sustain a hockey or a women's rugby team, for example, to ensure we achieve more team sports in international competition.  The big challenge for us at the moment is to sustain 11, 15 or 20 people in participation over three or four years through whatever funding is made available.  We just narrowly lost in both men's and women's hockey this year.  It was terrible to watch the last puck of the game in Belfield.  We need teams sports at the Olympics.  It creates a team spirit and atmosphere around participation.<\/p><p>  I do not wish to pass a slippery ball but on drinks I will offer a personal view, as we are only in initial discussions about this.  I said at the launch of our annual report last year that there has to be a mature, reasonable debate around the drinks industry sponsorship of sport.  Ireland is in a precarious situation.  We do not have the same high level participation, budgets or private or philanthropic endowment that other larger nations can obtain.  If we withdraw drinks sponsorship immediately without a transition, we will destroy some of our international teams.  I am not being over dramatic about it and I am not making an issue of it.  My office is on Haddington Road and the Aviva stadium and the RDS are beside it.  There has been no trouble as a result of alcohol consumption after any of the matches I have attended in Croke Park or other stadia.  However, I have witnessed people lingering long after concerts in the RDS.  Why separate one element of our national activity from another?  We have to be cautious about this.  Alcoholism in this country is not about sport or sports sponsorship; it is a deeper societal issue.  It affects our young people in primary, secondary school and universities.  It is also an issue relating to communities.  This has been an issue for this country for 200 years since we first brewed or distilled alcohol.  It should not all be laid on sport.  If we withdraw drinks sponsorship of sports in one fell swoop, the State will not replace the money lost by the IRFU, FAI and other sporting organisations unless it doubles or trebles the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900007#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Mulvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1371632700,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I would like to intervene because I would like everyone to have the opportunity to air their opinions.

It is fantastic for us to have people like the Chairman and Senator Coghlan, who knows his sport inside out, on the committee who can help in every way behind the scenes.  We have a very good record in general with all politicians and the previous Minister with responsibility for sport, Mr. John O'Donoghue, was excellent, as are the current Minister and Minister of State.  We only have a problem every now and again when a Minister comes along who does not respect independent and democratically elected bodies which are separate from the Ministry.  They were the old days.  Mr. John O'Donoghue was a superb Minister with responsibility for sport and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, are doing a superb job and have helped us in a thorough way in the preparation for London.  It was incredible.  Two weeks ago in Brussels I had the great honour of being at a luncheon with the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p>  With regard to alcohol, I agree with what Mr. Mulvey and Mr. Treacy stated.  The committee may not know the International Olympic Committee is the only sports organisation in the world which does not have an alcohol sponsor.  We do not take wine, beer or hard liquor.  Not one sponsor at any Olympic Games has anything to do with alcohol.<\/p><p>  I wish to make a personal remark which is important for the politicians here.  It was an absolute disgrace to read a report last week of an international multinational company, Diageo, attacking the Irish Government and the Irish State regarding how it should conduct its business and investment.  It is not the role of a multinational to direct elected Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and tell them what to do.  This multinational has no interest whatsoever in Ireland, except that it happens to have a product beginning with \"G\" which is promoted in Irish pubs throughout the world to get bigger profits.  The Government should not accept this type of carry on from a multinational.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900008#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Hickey"},{"type":"speech","time":1371633300,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  It is unusual for me to be sitting on the other side of the fence as a Member of the Oireachtas, which I am very honoured to be, as opposed to being invited before the committee.  Mr. Tracey and Mr. Mulvey alluded to the fact I was chair of the high performance committee in the Irish Sports Council for the Olympic cycle leading up to London.  In recent years, long since I retired from sport, the transformation in support for Irish sport has been incredible, with funds available for all athletes since 1999 when the Irish Sports Council became a statutory body, the support mechanism for athletes and the development of the Irish Institute of Sport under the leadership of Mr. Gary Keegan.  The transformation has been amazing.<\/p><p>  Having been chair of the high-performance committee it is awkward for me to raise issues regarding the Olympic Games, because today we are reviewing them and not necessarily discussing alcohol in sport.  Ireland certainly punches above its weight when it comes not only to Olympic sports but also sports such as golf and rugby.  We are all very proud of what our sports men and women achieve.  Looking back at the London Olympic Games now, numerous people have said to me that if we strip out the gold, silver and two bronze medals we won in boxing and the bronze medal won by Cian O'Connor, who only came in at the last minute, the performance of the Irish Olympic team was poor for the amount of money spent during the four-year cycle leading up to the London Olympic Games.  What are the views of the witnesses on such comments, which have been put to me since the London Olympic Games when everybody was saying how great the performance was?  I know how hard it is to make the Olympic Games and how difficult it is to get it right on the one particular day.<\/p><p>  I would also like to investigate whether we are considered a Third World nation when it comes to sport and the Olympic Games?  If so why did some athletes who qualified and were taken care of financially for a four-year period and were either injured or sick go to the Olympic Games where they performed very poorly?  Some of the injured athletes could have been replaced because others had qualified.  Why was this not taken care of leading into the London Olympic Games?<\/p><p>  Another area, which is a bone of contention between Mr. Hickey and myself, is regarding B standard athletes who are not selected.  If we are a Third World nation with regard to Olympic sports, and other such nations throughout the world are allowed to send athletes who do not get an A or even a B standard, why did we not send three young athletes who were seven hundredths of a second out?  Perhaps had they been selected with the B standard they would have performed better than those who competed with A standard qualifications.  If the mission of the Olympic Council of Ireland is to develop the Olympic movement in Ireland and to encourage the development of high-performance sports why are these young athletes, who are on the threshold of breaking through, not considered for the Olympic Games?<\/p><p>  My final question is directed to Mr. Hickey.  The Chairman made reference to accountability.  The Irish Sport Council accounts for every penny spent.  What funding does the Olympic Council of Ireland receive from the Irish taxpayer and what percentage is this of the overall budget?  What is the breakdown of the funding it receives from the taxpayer and how is it spent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900008#K00300","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371633300,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I will answer the questions on performance.  Boxing is part of Team Ireland when it comes to the Olympic Games and considerable investment has been made in it.  We certainly have had a fantastic return from our boxers.  In athletics we had a fourth place finish, and Senator Coghlan and myself realise more than anyone else that track and field events are truly global sports and extremely difficult.  A total of 220 countries compete in track and field events and if we come out with finalists we are doing extremely well from an Irish perspective.  We had two fourth place finishes and six other top ten finishes.  Robbie Heffernan finished fourth in athletics.  In equestrian sport, Cian O'Connor received a fantastic medal in individual show-jumping.  I am delighted to say the show-jumping team has gone from strength to strength and competed extremely well in the Nations Cup this year.<\/p> <p>The eventing team was placed fifth overall, which is an outstanding achievement.  It is a world class team.  Ms Aoife Clark finished seventh in the Olympic Games.  Ms Lisa Kearney, a young judo fighter, got into the last 16 in the world.  It was a world class performance.<\/p><p> The modern pentathlon was not on the radar four years ago.  We work closely with those involved.  They have a good performance manager.  Ms Natalya Coyle finished ninth in the modern pentathlon in London, which was a truly outstanding performance.<\/p><p> Everyone was on the edge of the seat throughout the first week of the Olympic Games because of sailing.  Ms Annalise Murphy did an outstanding job winning races.  Sailing is a marathon event, in that one's 12 best races are taken into account.  The only thing that stopped Ms Murphy from getting a medal was a little bit of inexperience.  Another couple of boats were in the top ten.<\/p><p> These were some of our outstanding results.  Without a shadow of a doubt, the tide is lifting in terms of high performance sport in Ireland.  We are getting a good return on our investment.  We are coming along in leaps and bounds as regards Olympic sports.  The review agreed that there had been outstanding achievements since Beijing.  Senator Coghlan has been playing the devil's advocate to a large degree.  Compared with four years ago, though, we have broadened our sporting horizons considerably.<\/p><p> Golf will be included in the next Olympics.  I hope that Ireland will have some world class golfers at the games.  I also hope that we will have a women's sevens team and a women's hockey team.  Sometimes, just qualifying for the Olympics is a fantastic achievement.  Whenever we have someone in the top 15 or 16 in the world, it is a magnificent achievement for a country with a population of 4.5 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900008#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Treacy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371633900,"counter":607,"content":"<p>The public asks me about the millions of euro invested in the Irish sports people who compete at the highest level of the Olympic Games.

We must look after our athletes at international, developmental and junior levels so that they can make the transition.  First time out, one can make the top 16.

Often, my peers abroad are amazed at our success.  Mr. Treacy answered the questions on performance comprehensively.<\/p><p>  I wish to address the question on B standards.  For those members who do not know, there is a qualification standard for the Olympic Games.  Of the 28 sports, track and field and swimming athletes can qualify the easiest.  All other sports have a brutal, draconian qualification process.  The wonderful Judo fighter about whom Mr. Treacy referred only had two chances to qualify - she needed to win a medal at the European or world championship.  It is even worse for gymnasts.  They must win silver or gold medals at the world championships.<\/p><p>  We decided that B standards were not good enough for the Olympic Games.  I did not make it.  Rather, the greatest athlete in Ireland, Ms Sonia O'Sullivan, made it in conjunction with silver medalist, Mr. Treacy.  These are our two supreme Olympic athletes.  Having examined the situation, they decided that the place for B athletes was at the world track and field championships and the European championships.  The Olympic Games are the real deal.  It is not for youth or for people who might do well the next time.  Let them go to the world championships.  We were happy to receive the full support of the Irish Sports Council and Athletics Ireland, the federation that runs the sport, for our decision.<\/p><p>  Regarding accountability and finances, we are a company limited by a company guarantee.

I do not have a set of accounts with me, but I will send one to the Chairman for distribution.

It was during one of last summer's bad days, but 60,000 or 70,000 people were in attendance.  There was a boxing match in the afternoon and a few large screens were located about the place.  We did not need an announcement over the PA system.  Just before the match was about to start, silence descended.  It was uncanny.

Is there any particular country to which we should be looking in terms of management of sporting organisations and athletes?  Is there a gold standard nation in this regard?  I am speaking in this regard not about investment per athlete, but about structural supports and so on.  Is there a gold standard nation to which we should aspire?

While we would welcome more funding, significant funding is currently being provided.  The revitalisation of the capital programme this year made a big difference.  If that were to become an annual rather than tri-annual or quadruple event, it would be good because our facilities need to be maintained.  Tremendous developments are taking place at Sports Campus Ireland in Abbotstown.  It is hoped this will result in the development of world-class facilities.  The indoor track at the facility in Athlone was also recently developed.  The development and provision of facilities is an area on which ourselves and our Northern Ireland counterparts can co-operate.  There is no point in our developing a velodrome if one is being developed in the North and in our replicating its development of international standard indoor facilities.  It is easier to travel to the North of Ireland than it is to the UK, Spain, Portugal and so on.  To a large degree, our co-operation is very cemented.  I was recently on the interview board in Northern Ireland in regard to the appointment of the new chief executive.  There is good dynamic with Northern Ireland in terms of co-operation.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to gold standard nations.  Years ago, Australia, which won everything but has since fallen behind, was considered a gold standard nation.  Ireland is now being viewed as a gold standard nation in terms of the level of participation by Irish athletes and the number of medals being won.  As I said earlier, our director was, unfortunately, poached by the US, which is a tribute in its own right to the standards we are achieving.  Part of the Olympic debrief was to consider what other countries were doing and achieving.  <\/p><p>  One area in which we have a major lacuna in terms of high performance is talent identification.  We need to look at how to identify the young sixth class student or second level first year student who is a potentially good performing individual rather than a collective athlete such as those mentioned earlier who are individual extraordinary achievers in the own sports.  We must ensure we have sufficient funding to target exceptional talent in our schools.  These students could be identified by our physical education teachers or national governing bodies.  We must identify, mentor, protect and encourage talent.  We do not yet have a system in place to do this.  <\/p><p>  As chairman of the Irish Sports Council I believe indigenous Irish companies should be funding the council.  They should be willing to provide &euro;50,000 to &euro;100,000, which are not unreasonable amounts, to fund sports.  Reference was made earlier to Diageo.  I am speaking of indigenous Irish companies who are multinationals that are making huge profits.  It is hoped that with tax reliefs they might give &euro;100,000 to &euro;250,000 to the Irish Sports Council for talent identification.  When these companies are successful they should identify with our success.  We need to be able to bring athletes forward, cocoon them and provide them with the best performance opportunities and good facilities.  We must also meet the needs of individual's requiring the attention of high performance directors or coaches.  This costs money and requires long-term commitment.  It is what we need to do.  Currently, we are only identifying talent at 14 or 15 years of age, which is almost too late.  I call on Irish companies that are successful internationally and have no baggage to fund sports development.  I am speaking in this regard of clean industries such as the agrifood, services and financial industries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900010#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Mulvey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371634500,"counter":614,"content":"<p>A number of sports operate on an all-Ireland basis.  We agree one plan for the Sports Council of Northern Ireland and the Irish Sports Council.  This means there is one funding stream.  There is real co-operation in terms of some of our high performance athletes on a North-South basis.<\/p><p>  The gold standard was mentioned.  The council constantly looks to what other countries are doing, from which it takes the best ideas.  The gold standard is around the people involved in high performance.  We have excellent performance directors and coaches who are funded by the system.  Also, the institute of sport is constantly developing.  The council's high performance unit is also developing.  Gold standard status is about people and what is happening in terms of coaching in Ireland.  This is about investment in people and then trying to keep them in the country.  Other countries have in the past tried to steal our best coaches.  However, we have managed to retain them in the country.<\/p><p>  With regard to school sports, the big issue is philosophy around PE in primary schools.  While the current PE curriculum is good, sufficient time is not being provided for it.  One hour per week is not enough.  Children need to engage in PE at least three or four times a week.  Demand for this must come from parents.  Physical education is an investment in children's health and well-being for life.  We need to ensure this is underlined.

I want to know that we are really supporting all these boxing clubs throughout Ireland.  They have a social inclusion policy and there is a large number of teenage girls in the club in Paulstown, County Kilkenny.  It does marvellous work and I am sure there must be much talent there for future Olympic Games; if we are spotting talent, I invite anybody to see what we have.<\/p><p>  How high on the agenda is social inclusion policy or is it just a paper exercise for many clubs in order to draw grant assistance?

I have a bit of an inside track as I have been a sports journalist for most of my working life.  I have been at an Olympics, and I saw John Treacy at the 1980 games.  That resonated yesterday with the passing of Mr. Tim O'Connor, a former head of television sport who was very instrumental in getting RTE to focus on many sports during his period there.  God rest him.  As a former voluntary coach in the community games, I am intimately knowledgeable of the sacrifices that people make at all ages and levels, and I do not want my remarks to in any way be disrespectful to those who have tried and continue to strive for greatness.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless, I share Senator Coghlan's view and Mr. Hickey put that in context.  Irish people want to see medals and flags and they do not really care from what sport that comes.  People would see me, Mr. Treacy and others identified with sport and we might attract comments that the athletics level of performance at the Olympics left much to be desired.  I do not know why that is because it receives massive funding and support.  There seems to be something inherently wrong, so is it related to a lack of proper coaching?  I am asking the question because I do not know the answer.<\/p><p>  There is commentary suggesting that because of our small size and limited resources, we are punching way above our weight in so-called minority sports.  Mr. Hickey comes from a judo background and he quite rightly noted the outstanding achievement of that young girl in the sport.  I remember covering the sport at the Olympics when I worked in the area and along with the modern pentathlon it was a minority sport.  People brought an amount of commitment, energy and enthusiasm to the sport even before these achievements.  Is there a case to be made for the Irish Sports Council and the Olympic Council of Ireland rebalancing and refocusing their view, giving more support to the so-called minority sports?  We can break down where we won and made other achievements while stripping the gloss from the process; the witnesses are coming here to put the best possible spin on the Olympic achievements.  Senator Coghlan indicated we should \"strip it down\" and it is clear that it is primarily in minority sports that we have seen success and are achieving world standards.  We are not doing it in track and field.<\/p><p>  Do the witnesses believe there is a need to rebalance and focus more on the minority sports where we seem to be getting a greater return?  The excitement was not just about Katie Taylor and I will always remember the achievement of Annalise Murphy.  It symbolised the potential of a small country in a minority sport and it captured the spirit of the Olympics.  I knew nothing about sailing and most people watching did not know about it either.  That was an extraordinary television experience.<\/p><p>  I also want to ask about boxing.  It seems unacceptable that one of the best boxing coaches in the world did not have a contract with his own governing body.  Is his future still uncertain or has the matter been resolved?  There are recommendations in the debriefing arguing that there seems to be allegations of interference.  For example, the review indicates that staff appointed to the high performance programme, HPP, are engaged by, accountable and report to the performance director, and this process is not subject to interference or overrule by Irish Amateur Boxing Association, IABA, members or committees.  That is an extraordinary indictment of the IABA administration as this is one of our most successful sports in our Olympic participation and yet that line must go into a debriefing report.  I would be grateful for the comments of the witnesses in that regard and if it has not been sorted, is there a role for them in getting it sorted so that we do not have uncertainty surrounding the achievement of the boxers, which has continued in the recent European championships?<\/p><p>  Mr. Treacy made a point about co-operation between North and South.  How long will the position continue of the Northern Ireland Sports Council providing high-performance money along with the body from the Republic of Ireland?  The maximum is the same, at &euro;40,000, for both areas but an athlete based in the North can get &euro;80,000 but one based in the South only gets &euro;40,000.  That is unfair so is there a way of sorting it out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900011#N00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1371635100,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I echo the welcome given to the witnesses and officials.  It was a strong presentation and I congratulate everybody on the success achieved, particularly in increasing the medal count at the London Olympics.  It is an account of the public money spent in the process, and there is a clear correlation between investment and results that cannot be ignored.<\/p><p>  The question has been asked as to what this committee and politicians can do.  Over millennia, governments, emperors and other rulers have all recognised the value that sport has and linked it to political successes in many cases.  That has gone on in modern times behind the Iron Curtain, and there has even been government interference in the selection of some athletes.  There is anecdotal evidence of such links between government and sport.<\/p><p>  The model we have is quite effective, as we take an \"active interest\", to use Mr. Mulvey's phrase, but we do not intervene.  We let those who know what they are doing work away and we support them.  We are obliged to scrutinise the performance of athletes that have been publicly funded, and that is a role of this committee.  It is satisfying to see an increase in medals and better positions being achieved in major championships and the Olympics in particular.<\/p> <p>However, not once have I heard anything about the personal bests that athletes really hold onto as an identifiable way of measuring progress.  When I watch athletes perform and see a PB appear after their name when they achieve a result, that is deeply satisfying, but we have no measure here of how many personal bests were achieved over the last cycle by athletes, particularly those in track and field.  We can be dazzled by medals, but, as Senator Coghlan mentioned, when one strips away the boxing it is a little more modest.  The real measure of how athletes progress - certainly my measure - or of the effectiveness of the funding is the attainment of personal bests and progression in that regard.  That applies to other sports.  It shows how athletes are improving, and I do not get an idea of that in the witnesses' testimony to the committee this morning.  How can we get those figures as part of our scrutiny?<\/p><p> Finally, I will mention something equally important.  The investment the taxpayer puts into sport could be greater, in my opinion, and it would be great if we could get better results.  Is there a way to measure this internationally?  Is there a country with a federation or committee that does similar work or has a similar structure or template to ours which could define, to over-simplify it, a cost per medal, cost per win or cost per progression or PB?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900011#N00600","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371635700,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but I must attend a vote in the Seanad.

What are some of the difficulties and challenges the witnesses are facing?  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, appeared before the committee some time ago and I asked him a question about Swim Ireland and the governance of Irish sport.  I thank John Treacy for replying to me about that.  I wish to expand a little and follow up on Senator Mooney's question regarding governance of sport in Ireland.  Is Mr. Treacy happy with it?  He mentioned the boxing situation.  I presume this is part of the brief of the Irish Sports Council and that he is aware of the tensions within the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, IABA.  The success is fantastic and we cannot afford to let it slip, but there appear to be issues there.  Have they been resolved?  The director of boxing sacked the ladies' coaching team that was put in place recently.  I think that happened with youth teams as well.  Obviously there are very strict lines defining people's roles.  Have those issues been resolved?<\/p><p>  To move on to some of the other issues, are there any rowers or coaches of international standard in Rowing Ireland at present?  As a follow-up to the question on Swim Ireland - sometimes these matters are highlighted in the media, so this is a welcome opportunity for the witnesses to deal with them once and for all - I understand that Swim Ireland sacked its Limerick coach without any type of post-Olympic review or without speaking to the coach or the athletes he coached after the Olympics.

Everybody knows I have been speaking on the minority sports theme for 20 years.  We must identify the sports in which we can win medals and in which there is the least competition at the Olympic Games.  That is how one wins medals.  I have been advocating for years that we should be considering judo, wrestling and modern pentathlon.  That is starting to happen.  The results in modern pentathlon and judo in London were superb, and the Sports Council now has the same thinking as us on that.  On the boxing, that is to do with contractual relationships with the Irish Sports Council.<\/p><p>  Deputy Harrington spoke strongly about the need for public scrutiny once taxpayers' money is involved.  It is important for everybody here to know that there are only two volunteers in this room, myself and William O'Brien.  We do not receive any salary from the OCI, the taxpayer or any other source.  We are volunteers, as is every member of the Olympic Council of Ireland, and we do not take a cent of taxpayers' money for salaries or the like.

We have raised with Sport Northern Ireland the issue of cementing our discussions.  Sport Northern Ireland also has a remit for capital programmes, which we do not.  This situation may be addressed in the new legislation.  We need to have a discussion about the duplication and sharing of facilities.  As Mr. Treacy indicated, perhaps large projects could have matching funding arrangements for shared facilities, as is the case in other circumstances under the Good Friday Agreement.  That would be important.<\/p><p>  Swim Ireland undertook its own debrief and extensive review.  We must compliment its chief executive, Ms Sarah Keane, on doing an excellent job in bringing Swim Ireland from where it was &ndash; racked with scandal and controversy &ndash; to where it is now, a more fit for purpose organisation.  As Mr. Treacy stated, there was a particular problem with a swimmer in London stemming from the late development of an illness.  Perhaps a more sensible decision should have been taken, but everyone is back in shape now.<\/p><p>  Rowing Ireland has a national rowing facility in Cork.  Irish rowers earned an international reputation 20 years ago.  How do we further develop the sport?  Britain has identified rowing as a sport where it can win almost all of the medals.  Ireland has a strong tradition in rowing and rowing clubs affiliated to Rowing Ireland will help us to develop it further.<\/p><p>  I shall comment on boxing.  Perhaps it stems from my earlier working life but I am always conscious of third party interference in contracts or agreed contracts.  The Irish Sports Council plays an oversight role in terms of sports governance.  Therefore, it must ensure that everything is done properly and that performance directors are appointed properly, protected when appointed and allowed to get on with his or her job.  Sometimes, this requires sensitive and delicate handling with national governing bodies, NGBs.  This takes more time in some organisations, a number of which have been mentioned at this meeting.<\/p><p>  We must be careful, we must show sensitivity when working with these bodies.  However, if we are unhappy about governance issues then the bodies must address them because we provide funding.  The Oireachtas has delegated responsibility to the Irish Sports Council to ensure that happens.  As chairman of the council, I have taken a strong line with all of the national governing bodies.  I have urged them to take proper account of contracts, appointments, dispersal of moneys and the accompanying accountability.  All of the governing bodies then can interact when it comes to operational issues.<\/p><p>  I share Deputy Ann Phelan's view about social inclusion, particularly for boxing.  Social inclusion is an issue that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have in common.  <\/p> <p>Obviously, the funding we have for women in sport must be addressed.  In light of Katie Taylor's excellent success and the inspiration she has given, there is no point in encouraging women to come into the sport of amateur boxing and not allowing funding for them.  At the moment, we just fund the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, IABA, but there is no separate fund for women in sport unless it is targeted within the grant.  It is an area that can be explored.  Other issues have been occupying our minds in regard to the IABA and ensuring Billy Walsh is given the appropriate authority, independence and freedom to ensure our best boxers represent us internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900013#P01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Mulvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1371636900,"counter":642,"content":"<p>The Olympic Council of Ireland funds a number of athletes directly.  We do so in consultation with the Irish Sports Council to ensure there is no overlap.  We do it from our resources, mainly in minority sports to ensure they are assisted.  We must also think of other young Irish athletes, our winter sports athletes.  The mandate of the Olympic Council of Ireland is to represent all athletes, irrespective of their sport.  We will have a team of six to ten young athletes going to compete in the Olympic Winter Games in Sochi in Russia next February.  In the committee's deliberations, it should not forget our winter athletes.  They are as important as our summer athletes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013061900014#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Hickey"},{"type":"speech","time":1371636900,"counter":643,"content":"<p>Before we wind up, I ask Mr. Hickey for a comment on the homecoming in the aftermath of the Olympics last year, when there were wonderful performances.

The item was generated by a section of the media.  Sometime sections of the media are unhappy if we have success and they were looking for a story, but the story went out of control.  Our chef de mission, Sonia O'Sullivan, consulted a group of athletes and their families.  When they arrive at Dublin Airport, most athletes want to disappear into the bosom of the family.  There was already a big celebration planned in Bray for Katie Taylor and she did not want to hang around Dublin Airport or the city centre.  John Joe Nevin had a function organised in Mullingar and the two Belfast boxers were rushing back to Belfast to attend a function.  We thought we should let the boxing medal winners and non-medal winners disappear and have their celebrations..  They had been away for a long period.  Before we travel anywhere in the future, we will say what will happen and everyone will know in advance.<\/p><p>  There was only good news, no bad news, at the Olympic Games from the Irish team's point of view, so some story had to emerge.  Members of the D&aacute;il also suffer from bad publicity.  That is the way it goes and we must take it on the chin.  Sonia O'Sullivan did her best as our chef de mission and we supported her.
