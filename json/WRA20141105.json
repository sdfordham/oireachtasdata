This exemption applies only where the security is in the beneficial ownership of a person or persons who is, or are, not resident in the State. Up to 3 February 2010, this exemption applied where the security was held in the beneficial ownership of a person or persons who were not ordinarily resident in the State. <\/p><p>  The functions of the Minister for Finance relating to borrowing and debt management were delegated to the NTMA by order of the Government made under the NTMA Act 1990.<\/p><p>  The exemption does not apply to securities acquired by a company after 29 January, 1992, regardless of when such securities were issued, where the securities are held by or for an Irish branch or agency of the company and the trade or business being carried on through that branch or agency is a financial trade or business.\u00a0The securities must be held by or for the Irish branch or agency. If they are held by the foreign company separately from its Irish branch or agency, the exemption continues.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The provision is meant to incentivise persons abroad to invest in Irish securities. If the bonds were taxed at source, non-resident investors would almost certainly make it more expensive and adjust the price they are willing to pay to reflect the tax, so the tax gained would largely be offset by higher funding costs for the State. The exemption avoids persons that are not resident in this State and holding a beneficial ownership in securities issued by the NTMA on behalf of the Minister for Finance, being liable to taxation\u00a0in both their home State and in Ireland. In the absence of the provision - which has been on the statute book in one form or another almost since the foundation of the State - such persons would be liable to be taxed in their own jurisdiction and in Ireland on the capital and\/or the interest. <\/p><p>  While the percentage of Irish Bonds held by non-residents declined during the financial crisis, the fact that the State's sovereign borrowings increased substantially in the period resulted in an increase in the tax foregone figure from &euro;240.8 million in 2007 to an estimated &euro;615.9 million in 2012. This is borne out by the CSO published figures on national debt interest payments to non-residents which increased from &euro;1,347 million in 2007 to &euro;4,635 million in 2013, an increase of 244% over 2007. It is of course important to remember the benefits of this exemption in terms of incentivising foreign investors to invest in Irish securities.<\/p><p>  The register of holders of Irish Government bonds is maintained at the Central Bank of Ireland. The register is almost entirely made up of Euroclear Bank, the clearing and settlement platform. Due to the nominee account structure in Euroclear Bank it is not possible to identify the number of beneficiaries under the exemption provided for by section 43 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500068#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corporation Tax Regime","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500068#WRA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[41753\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500068#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he expects a knowledge development box to be in place; if he is concerned that delays in its introduction will disadvantage Ireland in seeking mobile investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>In recognition of the fact that investment and growth in OECD economies is increasingly driven by knowledge-based investment which is related to research and development and intellectual property, putting in place an attractive tax offering for intangible assets is key for Ireland's success in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).\u00a0 This is why as part of my Budget announcement I made a clear statement of my intention to introduce a competitive income-based regime for intangible assets in Ireland, in what will be known as a \"Knowledge Development Box\" or \"KDB\".\u00a0 <\/p><p>  I view this as a positive measure for Ireland and I will ensure the Irish KDB will be among the best in class on offer internationally.\u00a0 The design of this measure will be along the lines of patent boxes which have existed for many years in countries that compete with us for FDI. <\/p><p>  At present, the measures that are in place in our competitor\u00a0locations are the subject of on-going discussions at the OECD and EU level, as regards to their compatibility with the international rules around fair tax competition.\u00a0 Until these discussions have been concluded, it is clear that it is not possible to guarantee that any of the measures in our competitor jurisdictions are sustainable and that they won't be changed in the very near future.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, we have always been clear on the need for certainty in the Irish corporation tax offering.\u00a0 For this reason, we will await the outcome of these international discussions before we will legislate for the KDB and therefore make sure that the Irish provisions will be sustainable in the long-term.\u00a0 The timeline for this process is not set in stone, but I intend to legislate for implementation in Finance Bill 2015. <\/p><p>  In the meantime, later this year, I will launch a public consultation on how the Irish KDB should operate.\u00a0 This will gather views from as broad a spectrum as possible on what this measure should entail, and ensure that the process of introducing and implementing the KDB will be well advanced by the time the international negotiations are concluded.<\/p><p>  As a small country with a stable annual Budget and Finance Bill process, Ireland has a strong track record for being a fast-follower and for implementing timely tax legislation once international rules have been agreed.\u00a0 This will also be the case for the Knowledge Development Box and along with the recent enhancements to Ireland's existing regime for intangible assets, it should give confidence to companies who wish to put their knowledge-based capital in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500068#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500068#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[41740\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500068#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to ensure all workers receive equality under any tax credit-relief for water charges.

The Accountant of the Courts of Justice is in ongoing discussions with both the Setanta Liquidator and his legal advisors to put in place appropriate mechanisms to commence making applications to the High Court in accordance with the Insurance Act 1964. In tandem with this he is also working to acquire the necessary skilled resources to enable applications to the ICF to be processed effectively and efficiently. Due to the unprecedented nature and scale of the Setanta insolvency\u00a0the Accountant is not yet in a position to provide a timetable for applications to be made to the Fund,\u00a0but it is hoped that applications by the Accountant to the High Court can begin sooner rather than later.\u00a0<\/p><p>  Current estimates indicate that the shortfall\u00a0for most\u00a0Setanta claimants will be relatively small once they have received\u00a0the 65% compensation\u00a0available from the ICF\u00a0as well as\u00a0their distribution from the Liquidation.

Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes on-going analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.<\/p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved by Revenue through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p><p>  Revenue cooperates extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the on-going programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.<\/p><p>  Revenue's action against the illegal trade has resulted in significant seizures of illicit products, and in a large number of convictions of persons involved in the smuggling or sale of illicit products. To the end of September 2014 49.6 million cigarettes were seized in 4,535 separate seizures, while 9,320 kilogrammes of tobacco were seized in 760 separate seizures. \u00a0This includes a major seizure in Drogheda in June 2014 in which officers from Revenue's Customs Service, supported by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, seized over 32 million cigarettes and 4,500 kilogrammes of water pipe tobacco. \u00a0<\/p><p>  I have taken legislative action over recent years to further strengthen the Revenue Commissioner's powers to respond to the problem of the illegal tobacco trade.<\/p><p>  - The Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excise products.<\/p><p>  - The Finance Act 2013 introduced new offences and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences of involvement with illicit tobacco production, knowingly dealing in or delivering any illicit tobacco product and keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit production. Provision was made also for the forfeiture of any equipment or materials, including unmanufactured tobacco, used for illicit production. That Act also strengthened the offence provisions relating to the sale or delivery of unstamped tobacco products.<\/p><p>  - The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provided that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and may be required to present any tobacco product concerned for examination, and makes provision for search by a Revenue Officer or Garda of any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.<\/p><p>  In relation to the allocation of human resources, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are fully integrated tax and customs administration and that it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on action against the illicit trade in tobacco products. Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance. There front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection. <\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009. Revenues overall staff levels have decreased from a total of 6,581 full-time equivalents at the end of 2008 to the current level of 5,680. Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000, so that they now represent a larger proportion of Revenue's staff. The Revenue Commissioners have accorded a very high priority to the tackling of the illicit tobacco trade and they are committed to ensuring that, despite the staffing reductions, this enforcement work will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.<\/p><p>  Finally, I would point out that the annual survey conducted for the Health Services Executive and the Revenue Commissioners by Ipsos MRBI indicates that 11% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2013 were illicit. The survey results for 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 indicate a level of illicit cigarettes of 15%, 14%, 14% and 13% respectively. I can assure the House that the Revenue Commissioners will continue to make tackling the trade in illicit tobacco products a key objective, and Government will ensure that all legislative action necessary to combat the illicit tobacco trade is taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500068#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500068#WRA01850"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[41747\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500068#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in view of the increase in property prices in many parts of the country, his views that capital acquisitions tax thresholds should be reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) is the overall title for both Gift and Inheritance Tax.

They would apply to all mortgage lending in Ireland by regulated firms. The Central Bank has indicated that the primary objective of these measures is to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to the property market and to try to reduce the risk of bank credit and housing price spirals from developing in future. <\/p><p>  The specific measures proposed for principal dwelling houses are to:<\/p><p>  - restrict new lending\u00a0to a limit of\u00a080% of the value of the property;<\/p><p>  - restrict new lending\u00a0to\u00a0a maximum of 3.5 times\u00a0gross income.   \u00a0<\/p><p>  However, the Central Bank has also stated that banks will be able to lend, in some instances, above these threshold limits.

Of particular interest would be the means\u00a0by which such schemes can support greater levels of investment in new housing, with the associated benefits for the construction sector and ultimately for the consumer.

In formulating policies to meet these goals my Department has a number of procedures in place to\u00a0assess the distributional impact of tax measures which help ensure their fairness.<\/p><p>  These procedures include a distributional analysis of direct taxation measures across a range of income levels, family types, and case studies. This analysis was published in the Budget book and show gains to all household types.\u00a0For example the analysis\u00a0shows that a single earner on an annual income of\u00a0&euro;25,000 will gain\u00a0&euro;174\u00a0per annum;\u00a0a married one earner couple on &euro;35,000\u00a0will gain\u00a0&euro;174;\u00a0while\u00a0a married one earner couple with two children on &euro;55,000\u00a0will gain\u00a0&euro;626\u00a0per year. These gains reflect the Government's commitment to helping those on lower and middle incomes.<\/p><p>  Analysis of the taxation measures in the budget based on\u00a0the ESRI\u00a0SWITCH\u00a0tax-benefit\u00a0model indicates that all household deciles\u00a0will gain from the income tax measures\u00a0in Budget 2015. Some of these\u00a0gains arise from the increase in the\u00a0exemption threshold for the USC which had the effect of removing lower income\u00a0people from the liability to pay USC (the second time the Government has done this).\u00a0This means that all individuals\u00a0with income below &euro;12,012 will be entirely exempt from the USC. The Government also reduced the lower\u00a0USC\u00a0rates and increased their thresholds delivering further benefits to those on lower incomes and ensuring fairness.<\/p><p>  At the same time, the benefits for any individual from the income tax package were capped by introducing a new higher rate of USC for high income\u00a0individuals\u00a0thus maintaining\u00a0the progressivity of the system and ensuring that those on high incomes did not benefit over and above what is fair.<\/p><p>  These changes occur against the backdrop of Ireland having one of the most progressive income tax systems in the OECD.<\/p><p>  With regard to indirect policy changes my\u00a0Department is cognisant of the effect of these types of taxes on those lower down the income distribution. However the number of\u00a0indirect tax policy\u00a0changes\u00a0affecting households in this budget was\u00a0limited. The increase in excise on cigarettes was\u00a0motivated by the negative health outcomes of smoking, while the main increase in indirect tax revenue resulted\u00a0from a technical\u00a0change where VAT is charged for cross-border EU telecommunications, broadcasting and electronically supplied services.<\/p><p>   The tax measures outlined above are not only designed to extend the recovery\u00a0across economy but also aim to strengthen the recovery for the future. These reductions in tax have the effect of increasing the reward from\u00a0employment. They\u00a0lower the cost of employing people\u00a0which will help\u00a0create jobs.\u00a0Indications from the ESRI HERMES\u00a0macroeconomic model shows there could be up to 15,000 jobs created from the reductions in labour taxation when the full effect of the tax reforms that will be introduced over the next three years take effect.<\/p><p>   Finally, I believe that creation of jobs for the unemployed remains a key element of promoting a fair and inclusive\u00a0society. The measures I have implemented\u00a0will go a long way towards achieving this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500069#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Banking Sector","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500069#WRB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[41741\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500069#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the EU Commission will make a decision on the restructuring package for Permanent TSB and his plans for the bank following the ECB stress tests.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>The Permanent\u00a0TSB\u00a0restructuring\u00a0plan submitted in Autumn 2013 is now\u00a0outdated and is in the process of being\u00a0updated for both recent positive financial and operational performance in 2014\u00a0and the\u00a0results of the Comprehensive Assessment.\u00a0My officials\u00a0have been in discussions with the European Commission over recent\u00a0weeks and they expect Permanent TSB to formally lodge an updated restructuring\u00a0plan shortly.<\/p><p>  Separately Permanent TSB will submit a Capital Plan to the ECB by 9 November 2014 detailing how they propose to meet the capital shortfall arising in the Adverse Stress Test scenario of the Comprehensive Assessment.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware Permanent TSB is an important bank in a highly concentrated Irish market\u00a0and has 13% market share of both retail deposits and mortgage lending.<\/p><p>  While no restructuring\u00a0plan has been approved, Permanent TSB has made significant progress in delivering key elements of the Restructuring Plan submitted over the last year and the business is being managed structurally in the way envisaged in the plan.

Profits or gains from these activities that are not attributable to a relevant planning decision are taxed in the normal way. In Budget 2015, I announced the abolition of the windfall tax provisions from 1 January next and this is being provided for in the Finance Bill published last month.<br\/><br\/>The &quot;Construction 2020 - a Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector&quot; Report published in May 2014 focuses on the steps that can be taken in the immediate future to ensure that necessary and sensible development can take place in the construction sector and that such development is not held back by unnecessary obstructions. One of the action points in the Report requires consideration of the tax code as it applies to the construction and property sector to establish if they are fit for purpose and otherwise\u00a0to improve, abolish or replace them.<br\/><br\/>In that context, my Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners undertook a review of the windfall tax provisions as part of this year's Budget and Finance Bill process. In the course of that examination, the views of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and of the National Asset Management Agency were sought on the provisions and the views on the windfall tax as expressed by bodies such as the Housing Finance and Sustainable Communities Agency were also considered. Arguments for the significant amendment or abolition of the windfall tax provisions were made in a number of pre-Budget submissions sent to me by various bodies, including the Construction Industry Federation, Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the Society of Chartered Surveyors, Property Industry Ireland and Chambers Ireland.<br\/><br\/>There are a number of reasons why, on foot of the review by my Department and the arguments made by others, I decided to abolish the windfall tax provisions. No gains or profits to which the current provisions apply have been returned since their introduction in 2009. While this is due largely to the lack of activity in the property market over much of this time, there is considerable doubt that the provisions would operate in an effective way on the ground or could be amended to operate effectively.<b><\/b>More significantly, however,<b><\/b>the views which I have seen expressed by various parties in both the private and public sector with an interest in the proper development of the housing market, and with which I agree, is that the windfall tax provisions are acting and will act as an impediment to land rezoning, land development and redevelopment and to land sales for development.<br\/><br\/>The abolition of the windfall tax provisions should be seen in the context of other decisions and proposals announced recently, including those by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, which are focussed on encouraging increased activity in the residential construction sector to meet increasing demand for housing. I indicated in my Budget speech, however, that while the Government is doing its part to remove impediments to a fully functioning property market, there will be no return to the past where tax incentives for developers drove supply. I also announced in the Budget that there will be a consultation in the coming months on taxation measures that might be introduced to address the issue of land owners who do not develop zoned and serviced land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500069#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Resolution Processes","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500070#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[41739\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500070#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the purchase of loan books by unregulated third parties is having a negative effect on mortgage resolution with particular reference to the tendency for some lenders to pursue the last option first, voluntary sale-repossession, as opposed to restructuring; if cognisance is taken of the need to ensure that the family home is protected and that restructuring is applied for at least a period of four years, and that borrowers in respect of the family are given the benefit of the policy pursued nationally in the context of the bailout; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>As Minister for Finance, I\u00a0am committed to bringing forward legislation that protects consumers and whose loans are sold to unregulated entities. I have informed the House previously that the Government intends to bring forward legislation to ensure that, where a regulated financial entity sells its loan book to an unregulated entity, the protections afforded under the Central Bank codes will continue to apply. The Government has reiterated this commitment on several occasions.<br\/><br\/>In July and August of this year, my Department ran a public consultation seeking views on its proposed legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities.\u00a0 The Department of Finance received 19 submissions from a range of respondents from the financial services industry, consumer groups, public representatives and individuals and other stakeholders. These have been published on the Department's website at .  Officials in my Department have carefully considered the submissions and are working with the Office of the Attorney General to progress this legislation. It is anticipated that it will be published by the end of this year.<br\/><br\/>The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out requirements for mortgage lenders when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears.\u00a0 The CCMA applies to the mortgage lending activities of all regulated entities, except credit unions, operating in the State, and provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up repayments on a mortgage loan which is secured on a primary residence are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers in genuine mortgage difficulty.\u00a0 The Deputy will be aware that the CCMA places an onus on the banks, in respect of a co-operating borrower, to explore all the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender to address a primary dwelling mortgage difficulty before any legal action is considered.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>The CCMA also provides that lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where they have already made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative arrangement with a cooperating borrower.\u00a0 Any bank proceeding to legal recourse with co-operating borrowers, in circumstances where an alternative sustainable arrangement is feasible and can be agreed, is not acting in a manner consistent with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) process, or with the CCMA.\u00a0 Of course, the CCMA and MARP can only achieve positive\u00a0results\u00a0in circumstances where the borrower cooperates with the lender and engages with the process.\u00a0 Where this does not happen, the lender may have no other option but to go down the legal route to deal with an arrears case.\u00a0 However, if that course of action leads the borrower to commence a constructive engagement, this can lead to a more favourable conclusion for the respective parties. It should also be noted however, that even if the MARP process has concluded and where legal proceedings have commenced, the CCMA requires that a lender must continue to maintain contact with the borrower (and\/or his nominated representative) periodically to see if an alternative repayment arrangement can be agreed even at that late stage.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will be aware that even if a repossession case has commenced in the legal system, the Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2013 now provides a power to the Court to adjourn a repossession proceeding in relation to a principal private residence to enable the borrower to consult a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) and, where appropriate, to instruct the PIP to make a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) proposal.\u00a0 In formulating a proposal for a PIA, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 places an onus on a PIP to do so on terms that shall not insofar as reasonably practicable, require the borrower to dispose of an interest or cease to occupy a principal private residence.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>The Central Bank has informed me that it has communicated to firms its preference that the outcome of any sale of mortgage books by regulated entities would ensure continuity of borrower protections under the relevant Codes and also that the purchaser would have relevant policies and procedures, systems and control checks to appropriately manage a mortgage loan book.\u00a0 It is in the best interests of unregulated firms that acquire loans to have the residential mortgage books serviced in compliance with the CCMA, as following the CCMA is in the ultimate best interests of both their business and their customers.<br\/><br\/>The strong view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the MARP, repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as a last resort. Every effort should be made to agree an acceptable arrangement as an alternative to repossession. Regretfully, however, it must also be accepted that due to the individual circumstances, not all mortgages can be made sustainable and that in these limited circumstances, it will be in the best interests of both parties to resolve the situation in a fair manner.<br\/><br\/>Indeed I was pleased to note in the mortgage restructures publication for August published by my Department\u00a0that there was a significant\u00a0increase of almost 5% in the number of permanent mortgage restructures over the July data.\u00a0 This is, in my view, a clear indication that cognisance is being taken by lenders\u00a0of the need to ensure that the family home is protected in accordance with the terms of the CCMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500070#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Budget Contribution","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500070#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[41757\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500070#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the discussions his Department has had with the EU on Ireland&rsquo;s budget contribution; if the additional contribution that is being asked of Ireland is based on consistent calculations across all EU states; the extent to which the additional contribution reflects a restatement of gross national income to reflect the value of research and development and certain previously excluded illegal activities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>Ireland's contribution to the EU Budget is\u00a0an obligation of EU membership and is a charge on the Central Fund under national legislation.

and &quot;conclude&quot; sustainable solutions with their borrowers in arrears.\u00a0 The Central Bank has now set quarterly targets to the end of 2014 by which time the relevant banks will be required to &quot;propose&quot; sustainable solutions to 85% of customers over 90 days in mortgage arrears and for &quot;concluded&quot; solutions to reach 45%.<br\/><br\/>A sustainable solution has been clearly defined in the Central Bank's published MART document and the Central Bank has informed me that a range of sustainable solutions have been utilised by each of the lenders to date.

I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it as soon as it was prudent to do so. The measures announced in the Budget are the first stage of a reform plan, to be undertaken over a number of years, to address this issue, particularly for middle-income earners who have borne the greater share of the cost of the economic downturn.<\/p><p>  In Budget 2015 I\u00a0announced a reduction in\u00a0the top rate of income tax from 41% to 40%. \u00a0I\u00a0also extended the standard rate band on which income tax is chargeable at the lower 20% rate by &euro;1,000. <\/p><p>  In addition I have reduced the two lower rates of\u00a0USC\u00a0from 2% and 4% to 1.5% and 3.5%, respectively. Furthermore, I have also increased\u00a0the threshold before which the 7% rate of USC becomes payable to &euro;17,576, so that those on the minimum wage will now only be liable to a maximum 3.5% rate of USC.<\/p><p>  The Budget also provides for the retention of the exemption from the top rates of USC for medical card holders with incomes that do not exceed &euro;60,000. These individuals will now only be liable to pay a USC rate of 3.5%, down from 4%. This reduced rate will also apply to the over 70s, with incomes that do not exceed &euro;60,000, again down from 4%.<\/p><p>  Ireland already has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the developed world. To preserve that progressivity, the Budget also contains USC measures which have the effect of limiting the maximum benefit from this package of tax measures to approximately &euro;14 per week for any individual taxpayer, which means that those with very high incomes will only benefit to the same extent, as those with more modest incomes.<\/p><p>  While the benefits from the changes introduced in Budget 2015 are broadly proportionate to the level of income earned for those on low and middle incomes, the reality is that because of the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system those on lower incomes pay very low levels of tax, particularly when compared to their counterparts in Europe.\u00a0<\/p><p>  Currently, a single individual employed on the standard minimum wage of &euro;17,542 per annum pays income tax of &euro;4.01\u00a0and USC of &euro;10.51 per week. Furthermore, someone on the standard minimum wage is also exempt from paying PRSI. As a result of the changes introduced in Budget 2015\u00a0the weekly USC charge of &euro;10.51 per week will fall to &euro;7.19 per week. This means their tax bill will be\u00a0reduced by just over\u00a020%.<\/p><p>  In contrast a single individual earning &euro;70,000 per annum currently pays &euro;25,531 per annum or &euro;490.98 per week in income tax, USC and PRSI. After Budget 2015, this individual's tax bill will be reduced by about 3%. Contrasting these two examples, I cannot agree that the income tax budget measures disproportionately favour those on higher incomes. In fact, the\u00a0highest proportionate benefit as a percentage of net income from the Budget tax changes\u00a0occurs at an income level of just over &euro;12,000. This is a result of my decision to extend the USC exemption threshold from &euro;10,036 to &euro;12,012, which also has the effect of removing 80,000 low earning individuals from the charge entirely.<\/p><p>  The changes announced in the Budget will ensure that all those currently paying income tax and\/or USC will see a reduction in their tax bill in 2015. I propose to continue this reform in future Budgets, subject to the required economic growth and the consequent fiscal space available to the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500071#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pyrite Remediation Programme Implementation","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500072#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[41718\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500072#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views in relation to the promised changes to the statutory instruments for the pyrite exemption from the local property tax, in the context of cases (details supplied), and his proposals to resolve this clear anomaly.","asker":"1192","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>As I previously advised the Deputy in response to Parliamentary Questions no. 14 (37016\/14) and no. 31 (37015\/14) on 2\/10\/14 officials of my Department, with officials of the Department of Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government, are examining the alternatives\u00a0other than testing that may be available in order to confirm entitlement to a Local Property Tax (LPT) exemption.<\/p><p>  While I am conscious of the anomaly to which the Deputy refers, it is important that any changes that may be made do not go beyond the objectives of providing a temporary exemption for homes with &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; only.

The Pensions Act was amended in 2009 to broaden the options available to the trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme in any consideration of a restructure of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Act to include the benefits of deferred scheme members and post retirement increases in pension benefits.  Prior to the 2009 Act, only the benefits of active scheme members could be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits.<\/p><p>  The provisions in section 50 of the Act treats both active and deferred scheme members the same.  Both of these categories of scheme members participate in a scheme in a period where pension benefits are being accumulated and it is considered that in the context of the provisions of section 50 of the Pensions Act it is appropriate that they are treated in a similar manner.  Pensioner benefits are treated differently than the benefits of active and deferred scheme members though these benefits can also be adjusted following the change included in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013.

A 10% rate is charged on self-assessed income above this level, which compares with a 7% rate which is charged on PAYE incomes above that level.<\/p><p>  When USC was first introduced in 2011 the PRSI ceiling on income over &euro;75,000 was also removed for all PAYE employees. This meant that those on PAYE incomes of over &euro;75,000 would now be liable to an additional 4% charge on that portion of their income.  At the same time PRSI for self-assessed income earners was increased by 1% from 3% to 4%.<\/p><p>  In order to maintain the differential it was decided to introduce an additional USC rate of 10% on self-assessed income over &euro;100,000.  The alternative would have seen self-assessed income earners on high incomes benefit hugely at a time when their PAYE counterparts were losing from the tax changes introduced in 2011.  On the basis of fairness, this could not have been countenanced at the time.<\/p><p>  Similarly, it was necessary to increase this 10% rate to 11% in Budget 2015 in order to ensure that the self-assessed on high incomes do not benefit disproportionately and that the maximum benefit from the income tax package is capped for all tax payers.  Thus from 2015, self-assessed income in excess of &euro;100,000 will be subject to an 11% rate of USC in comparison to an 8% rate that will apply to PAYE income in excess of that level.<\/p><p>  It is worth pointing out that the self-assessed\u00a0benefit to the same extent from the Budget measures as their PAYE counterparts.  They benefit from the cut in the top rate of income tax from 41% to 40% and from the increase in the standard rate bands.  In addition, the changes to the USC will also be beneficial to them on incomes up to &euro;70,000.  This year, the self-assessed on incomes in excess of &euro;100,000 face a marginal rate of income tax of 55% including USC and PRSI.  That marginal rate will be unchanged for this cohort in 2015.  However, the marginal rate that applies on incomes below &euro;70,000 will be reduced by 1% for all taxpayers currently paying the higher rate of income tax, as a result of the Budget changes.<\/p><p>  There are other aspects to how the self-assessed are taxed which can be beneficial to them.  For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers.  In addition, the expenses regime for self-assessed taxpayers remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500075#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Application","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500075#WRH00750"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[42304\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500075#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will introduce a tax credit scheme in the Finance Bill to cover the significant costs\u00a0of child care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>Tax relief is not available\u00a0to parents in respect\u00a0of cr&egrave;che fees or childcare costs.\u00a0 However, I would like to assure the\u00a0Deputy that the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children.

The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b><\/b>increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.<b><\/b>To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.<br\/><br\/>In relation to exempting childcare costs from tax when the service is provided by an employer, a\u00a0relief did exist in the form of\u00a0a benefit-in-kind exemption, where\u00a0childcare\u00a0facilities were provided by the employer.  However, this relief was abolished in Finance Act 2011.  The Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition of this exemption, citing equity issues in relation to those parents whose employers did not provide such facilities.<br\/><br\/>I\u00a0have no plans to introduce a tax relief for parents to assist with childcare costs.  To provide such a tax relief could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who stay at home and look after their children. <br\/><br\/>While wanting to\u00a0encourage female participation in the workforce, equally we cannot say to individuals who stay at home that they are making a less\u00a0valuable contribution to society. <br\/><br\/>In addition, tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2014, 39% of income earners will be exempt from income tax.  It could also be argued that any tax relief\u00a0would most likely be absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy will\u00a0appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones.\u00a0In considering these,\u00a0I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500075#WRH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges Introduction","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500075#WRH00950"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[42311\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500075#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason he will not introduce tax relief at source for water charges for all domestic users; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>A\u00a0number of measures were announced on Budget day to improve the overall affordability of water charges.

Profits or gains from these activities that are not attributable to a relevant planning decision are taxed in the normal way.  In Budget 2015, I announced the abolition of the windfall tax provisions from 1 January next and this is being provided for in the Finance Bill published last month.<br\/><br\/>The &quot;Construction 2020 - a Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector&quot; Report published in May 2014 focuses on the steps that can be taken in the immediate future to ensure that necessary and sensible development can take place in the construction sector and that such development is not held back by unnecessary obstructions. One of the action points in the Report requires consideration of the tax code as it applies to the construction and property sector to establish if they are fit for purpose and otherwise\u00a0 to improve, abolish or replace them.<br\/><br\/>In that context, my Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners undertook a review of the windfall tax provisions as part of this year's Budget and Finance Bill process. In the course of that examination, the views of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and of the National Asset Management Agency were sought on the provisions and the views on the windfall tax as expressed by bodies such as the Housing Finance and Sustainable Communities Agency were also considered. Arguments for the significant amendment or abolition of the windfall tax provisions were made in a number of pre-Budget submissions sent to me by various bodies, including the Construction Industry Federation, Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the Society of Chartered Surveyors, Property Industry Ireland and Chambers Ireland.<br\/><br\/>There are a number of reasons why, on foot of the review by my Department and the arguments made by others, that I decided to abolish the windfall tax provisions. No gains or profits to which the current provisions apply have been returned since their introduction in 2009.  While this is due largely to the lack of activity in the property market over much of this time, there is considerable doubt that the provisions would operate in an effective way on the ground or could be amended to operate effectively.<b><\/b>More significantly, however,<b><\/b>the views which I have seen expressed by various parties in both the private and public sector with an interest in the proper development of the housing market, and with which I agree, is that the windfall tax provisions are acting and will act as an impediment to land rezoning, land development and redevelopment and to land sales for development. <br\/><br\/>The abolition of the windfall tax provisions should be seen in the context of other decisions and proposals announced recently, including those by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, which are focussed on encouraging increased activity in the residential construction sector to meet increasing demand for housing.  I indicated in my Budget speech, however, that while the Government is doing its part to remove impediments to a fully functioning property market, there will be no return to the past where tax incentives for developers drove supply.  I also announced in the Budget that there will be a consultation in the coming months on taxation measures that might be introduced to address the issue of land owners who do not develop zoned and serviced land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500076#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500076#WRJ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[42346\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500076#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he expects the economic and fiscal position to improve or fluctuate over the next 12 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[42348\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500076#WRJ00450","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the fundamental economic and fiscal indicators are now in positive mode; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[42373\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500076#WRJ00475","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the economy here remains competitive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 65 and 72 together.<\/p><p>  Following successful implementation of the EU-IMF programme, the Irish economy has emerged from the crisis and there are clears signs that\u00a0the economic recovery is gathering momentum.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  First estimates of economic activity for the second quarter of this year were very strong and were well ahead of consensus expectations with GDP growing by 1.5 per cent over the quarter and by 7.7 per cent year-on-year.  Taken in conjunction with first quarter data, GDP grew by 5.8 per cent in the first half of this year.  The increase in economic activity is broadly-based with both domestic sectors and exporting sectors performing strongly.<\/p><p>  Exports rose by 13 per cent in the year to the second quarter of this year. \u00a0This was the fastest rate of expansion since 2001 and there is growing evidence that the impact of the patent expiry issue in the pharmaceutical sector appears to have passed. <\/p><p>  On the domestic front, personal consumption was up by 1.8 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter and investment increased by 18.5 per cent.\u00a0\u00a0Consumer spending has been strong in the first eight months of the year.\u00a0 Retail sales in the period January to September were up 6 per cent when compared with the same period in 2013.\u00a0 Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up 3 per cent over the same period.\u00a0 Investment is also growing with both building and construction and machinery and equipment spending on a rising path.\u00a0<\/p><p>  Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market with employment increasing in each of the last seven quarters representing an increase of over 70,000 jobs since the low-point in mid-2012. \u00a0In line with this, the standardised unemployment rate stood at 11.1 per cent in September, having fallen from a peak of 15.1 per cent in early 2012. \u00a0<\/p><p>  In terms of outlook, my Department is forecasting GDP growth of 4.7 per cent this year and 3.9 per cent in 2015.  This is driven by a positive contribution from net exports on the back of economic growth in Ireland's trading partners.\u00a0 Domestic demand is set to contribute to growth as well, with growing employment and rising household incomes resulting in an increase in private consumption.\u00a0 Over the medium term, GDP growth of about 3&frac12; per cent a year is anticipated.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the current improvement, risks to the outlook remain for Ireland.\u00a0 These relate to the low inflation observed in many advanced economics, geo-political tensions as well as the underperformance of the euro area economy.<\/p><p>  In terms of the public finances, policy measures implemented by the Government have resulted in a decline in the deficit in recent years.\u00a0 This decline has been in a phased manner, consistent with the dual needs of supporting domestic activity as well as repairing the public finances.\u00a0 All of Ireland's interim deficit ceilings under the Excessive Deficit Procedure have been met and Ireland is firmly on track to achieve a deficit of below 3 per cent in 2015.\u00a0 This has been important in restoring Ireland's credibility in the international markets - bond yields have fallen substantially since the high rates of mid-2011.\u00a0 The debt ratio has peaked and is now on a downward path.\u00a0 After 2015, fiscal policy will be set in line with the requirement to move towards Ireland's medium-term budgetary objective, which is for a balanced budget in structural terms.<\/p><p>  Ireland's competitiveness has significantly improved in recent years.\u00a0 Relatively low consumer price inflation over the last five years has meant that Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to the euro area. \u00a0The Government remains focused on the need to continue to improve our competitiveness, including through up skilling of the workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500076#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Data","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500076#WRJ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[42347\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500076#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he or his Department have continued to monitor policy pursued by the financial institutions that have purchased loan books from various lenders;

Loan agreements with the international funders, KfW and the European Investment Bank, to the value of &euro;550m have been signed to fund the SBCI during its initial period of operations. <\/p><p>  The SBCI is funded to the value of &euro;800m of which &euro;150m is from KfW, &euro;400m from the European Investment Bank and &euro;250 from the National Pension Reserve Fund.<\/p><p>  A key benefit of the\u00a0SBCI will be its\u00a0ability to facilitate loans with initial capital repayment breaks or the\u00a0offering of loans with\u00a0longer durations than are typically available currently.  In such cases, SMEs would have greater capacity to make investments on the basis of improved cash flow matching, which makes growth more likely.\u00a0 Additionally, the expanded pool of lending products could serve the needs of a wider cohort of SME customers than is presently served by lenders in the market.  Improved credit products\u00a0are expected to incentivise demand from SMEs for finance for the growth of their companies.<\/p><p>  The SBCI will fund and design product programmes to be distributed through a range of channels of finance companies including traditional banking institutions.\u00a0 The SBCI will focus on\u00a0facilitating the funding of new entrants to this market.\u00a0 By reducing barriers to entry in the SME finance market for new entrants, the SBCI will relentlessly encourage competition\u00a0thereby improving the quality and range of SME finance available.<\/p><p>  Credit is the lifeblood of all businesses and SMEs need to be able to access loans of greater duration, with enhanced terms and potentially at a lower cost facilitated by a state financial institution. KfW and the EIB have provided lower cost funding to the SBCI for up to a 10-year term.  Locking in funds at a lower cost for a 10-year period is both a major benefit and a risk mitigant for the SMEs.  Bank funding costs could increase for a whole host of reasons and to lock in lower cost funding would be a major benefit in protecting employment in the SME sector in such circumstances.  This should provide increased confidence to the SME sector as it increases the certainty around the availability of funding to that sector even in adverse financial market conditions.\u00a0  This will protect existing employment in the SME sector as well as boosting employment as SMEs will be able to finance investments using new types of lending products that are not available at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500077#WRK00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500077#WRK00900"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[42372\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500077#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to attract FDI in the wake of recent taxation charges announced in the budget 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":188,"content":"<p>In last month's Budget I announced several changes to Ireland's corporation tax regime, as part of an overall strategy to &quot;play fair and play to win&quot;.<br\/><br\/>This strategy was underpinned by extensive research undertaken and commissioned by my Department over the course of 2014 which has now been published. \u00a0One of the key findings of the research is that the FDI sector is very important for economic growth and employment in Ireland and that Ireland needs a competitive corporate tax offering to attract FDI.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>As a result, I published a &quot;Road Map for Ireland's Tax Competitiveness&quot; which updates last year's International Tax Strategy and sets out a comprehensive package of competitive tax measures designed to provide the foundations for Ireland to maintain and expand as a thriving hub for Foreign Direct Investment for years to come.<br\/><br\/>The Road Map includes:<br\/><br\/>- confirmation of the Government's continued commitment to maintaining the 12.5% corporation tax rate;<br\/><br\/>- an amendment to company residence rules to\u00a0 provide that all companies that are incorporated in Ireland will be automatically tax resident here and thereby bring an end to the 'Double Irish'; and<br\/><br\/>- enhancements to the Irish tax regime, such as the tax offering for intellectual property, Research and Development, income tax (including SARP) and tax administration. <br\/><br\/>The Road Map has been well received both domestically and internationally, and further details may be found in the document which is published on the Budget website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500077#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":189,"content":"<p>Question No. 72 answered with Question No. 63.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Portfolio","counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500077#WRK01250"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[42442\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500077#WRK01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide data in tabular form of the number of houses and apartments that are in the possession of National Asset Management Agency that have been sold in the past 18 months, being rented, otherwise occupied and vacant; the total rental income on the units being rented or otherwise occupied.","asker":"1197","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":192,"content":"<p>The detail sought by the Deputy is set out below.<br\/><br\/><b>Table: Completed residential stock held by NAMA debtors and receivers (Republic of Ireland)<\/b><table><tr><th>Residential units securing NAMA loans sold within the past 18 months<\/th><th>4,000<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Residual residential portfolio* <\/td><td>14,000 (10,000 apartments\/4,000 houses)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Of which, total rented properties<\/td><td>9,400<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total annual\u00a0rental income<\/td><td>&euro;95m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/><b>Note:<\/b>Completed properties that are not currently let are available on the open market for sale or rent through NAMA debtors or receivers or have been made available for social housing and are currently subject to transactions with local authorities\/approved housing bodies.

Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing, if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require. <br\/><br\/>Expenditure on criminal legal aid in 2013 was &euro;50.8 million.

Persons availing of civil legal aid pay a contribution towards the service, with some exceptions, so it is not a free service <i>per se<\/i>. Exchequer funding is provided by way of a grant-in-aid to the Board. In 2013, this grant amounted  to &euro;33.759 million in the year. The service is primarily provided through the Board's law centre network and by its own solicitors, although private practitioners on the Board's panels are engaged to provide a complementary service by the Board, mainly in District Court family law matters. In addition to this the Board may engage the services of Barristers in cases where it is considered necessary. Members of the panels for private practitioners and barristers may provide services in a number of counties. It is not possible to give a breakdown of costs by county. <br\/><br\/>Due to the large amount of data involved, the information sought by the Deputy regarding payments to solicitors and barristers does not lend itself to inclusion here.

The Scheme is set out in the Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations S.I. 124 of 2014 and, generally, applies to all public servants, including staff of the Irish Prison Service. The new Sick Leave Scheme was introduced, following the enactment of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments)(Amendment) Act 2013 by the Oireachtas. <br\/><br\/>The new provisions allow staff access to the following paid sick leave:<br\/><br\/>-  a maximum of 92 days on full pay in a rolling one year period;<br\/><br\/>-  followed by a maximum of 91 days on half pay in a rolling one year period;<br\/><br\/>-  subject to a maximum of 183 days paid sick leave in a rolling four year period.<br\/><br\/>With regard to self-certified sick leave, the Scheme allows for:<br\/><br\/>-  no more than 7 days of self-certified sick leave in a rolling 2 year period, counting backwards from the day before the latest date of absence;<br\/><br\/>-  the duration of the absence on self-certified sick leave shall not be longer than 2 days in any instance.<br\/><br\/>There was a 38.3% decrease in the amount of self-certified sick leave taken by Irish Prison Service staff in 2013 compared to 2012.  There has been a further reduction of almost 2% in the amount of such sick leave taken between January and August of this year compared to the same period last year.  The figures requested by the Deputy in relation to self-certified sick leave are as follows:<table><tr><th><b>Period<\/b><\/th><th><b>Number of staff<\/b><\/th><th><b>Number of days<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>2013<\/b><\/td><td>2685<\/td><td>5485<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Jan to Aug 2014<\/b><\/td><td>2311<\/td><td>3722<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>The figures requested by the Deputy in relation to overall sick leave in the Irish Prison Service are contained in the following table.  In conjunction with the implementation of the revised sick leave regulations for civil servants, the Irish Prison Service has introduced a number of measures to manage sick leave, including; twice yearly sick leave review meetings in all prisons, a new attendance management policy, a new accommodations policy which aims to facilitate a return to work at the earliest opportunity, a focus on sick leave at monthly HR Governor meetings and greater monitoring of the application of the sick leave regulations across the prison estate.<br\/><br\/>There has been a 13.7% decrease in the amount of sick leave taken by staff of the Irish Prison between January and August of this year compared to the same period last year.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that they are now at an advanced stage in planning the proposed refurbishment of Mullingar Courthouse which is part of the Government's infrastructure stimulus package.<\/p><p>  The proposed refurbishment of Mullingar Courthouse is one of seven projects included in a Courts Bundle which is to be delivered by way of Public Private Partnership (PPP). The Courts Bundle is currently in a procurement process which is being managed by the National Development Finance Agency. The funding of these projects will be by way of a unitary charge payment to the successful PPP company which is a monthly payment over the life of the project to cover the design, construction, financing and service provision and will commence on completion of the project, which is expected to be in 2017. These payments will be provided for in the Courts Service multi-annual capital provisions.<\/p><p>  It is expected that the contract for the Courts PPP Bundle will be signed in the final quarter of 2015 and that construction will commence soon afterwards with the work to be completed during 2017.<\/p><p>  The Courts Service is currently looking at possible alternative locations for court sittings in Mullingar once construction work commences on the courthouse. One possible location being considered is the use of accommodation within the Columb Barracks site in Mullingar and the Courts Service is in discussions with the Office of Public Works and the Department of Defence on this matter. The Courts Service has a limited budget for any works that might be necessary to make an alternative venue suitable for court use and is looking to achieve a solution which is effective and economic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500084#WRS00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500084#WRS00700"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[42465\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500084#WRS00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there is a list of applicants for positions on boards of State bodies in her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Programme is aimed at those school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It involves 124 locally managed school completion projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools. It provides targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people. The programme's project model gives local communities the autonomy to devise innovative approaches to address the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving. <\/p><p>  The School Completion Programme budget allocation for 2014 is &euro;24.756 million. It is estimated by the Child and Family Agency that approximately 75% of this is expended on employment costs associated with projects. <\/p><p>  The School Completion Programme interventions are focussed on children and young people at risk of early school leaving rather than on their parents. In the case of each local projects the interventions provided form the basis of the annual School Retention Plan which is the basis for the funding provided to the projects. Projects are required to submit annual reports to the Agency, based on reviews of activity and interventions, including information on the participation levels of at risk pupils. <\/p><p>  Typically, projects offer homework clubs; breakfast clubs; mentoring programmes; learning support; social and personal development programmes. Support for out of school children in any project is an important objective of the programme.  I am advised by the Agency that approximately 2% of children who are targeted under the School Completion Programme are out of school. In the 2012\/2013 school year, some such 595 children were supported under the Programme. <\/p><p>  The Home School Community Liaison Scheme is a school-based preventative scheme. It aims to promote and develop partnership between parents, teachers and community in order to enhance pupils&rsquo; learning opportunities and assist their retention and participation in the educational system.  Under the scheme, 402 local coordinators, who are serving teachers, serve 605 schools and organise locally based activities to encourage greater contact between parents and families and the school to tackle issues which impinge on participation in school and, ultimately, on the quality of learning. <\/p><p>  I have been advised by the Child and Family Agency that overall information relating to the numbers of parents of children that are out of school who participate in the diverse range of Home School Community Liaison Scheme activities and supports is not readily available. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500084#WRS01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Costs","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500085#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[42305\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500085#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will introduce a tax credit scheme in the Finance Bill to cover the significant costs\u00a0of child care; his plans to keep child care costs as low as possible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>The introduction of a tax credit scheme in the Finance Bill is a matter for Government and the Minister for Finance in the first instance.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the relatively high cost of childcare in this country and of the difficulties that this presents, particularly where both parents are in employment outside of the home.  To help address the issue, funding of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to support the implementation of a number of targeted childcare support programmes that assist parents in accessing quality and affordable childcare.  More than 100,000 children benefit from these programmes each year.<\/p><p>  The question of tax allowances for working parents who incur childcare costs was considered prior to the introduction of the targeted childcare supports which are now in place.  A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of tax relief for childcare.  This approach would not benefit parents working in the home and could, therefore, be seen by some as discriminatory.  Tax reliefs would favour the higher-paid, and those on the minimum wage or in part-time work would not be in a position to benefit to the same extent.  Many parents use childminders or relatives to meet their childcare requirements and may not be in a position to obtain receipts, making it impossible for them to establish their entitlement to tax relief.  There is also a view that the introduction of tax credits could lead to increased prices and therefore have limited impact in terms of savings to parents.<\/p><p>  I consider that the childcare programmes implemented by my Department, which include the universal free pre-school year, the Community Childcare Subvention programme and the Training and Employment Childcare programmes, are a fairer way of supporting parents who require childcare support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500085#WRT00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Funding","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500085#WRT00350"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[42345\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500085#WRT00400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding future funding for a child and family centre (details supplied) in County Dublin, in view of the fact that the funding from Atlantic Philanthropies is coming to an end; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1011","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>Balgaddy Child and Family Centre has sought to be included within the Family Resource Centre Programme operated by the Child and Family Agency.

As at the end of December 2013, the recruitment process was complete for 205 or 43% of these posts.  The continued implementation of the 2012 investment of &euro;35 million ensured that, at the end of 2013, the recruitment process was complete for 391.5 WTEs or 94% of the posts allocated in 2012.<br\/><br\/>The delay in the recruitment of 2013 posts was due to a number of factors.  There was no specific cost containment initiative but overall budgetary pressures within the HSE and the need to establish the type and number of posts required by each Community Mental Health Team both contributed to the delay in recruitment.  In addition, there were a number of posts for which there were difficulties in identifying suitable candidates due to factors including availability of qualified candidates and geographic location.  To help address these issues the HSE Service Plan 2014 committed to the streamlining of the recruitment process to allow for more local control and specialisation in respect of future appointments.  In addition, a comprehensive workforce analysis was carried out, together with priorities identified by Area Mental Health Management Teams, to inform decisions as to how best to target the 2014 investment in posts.<br\/><br\/>While no study or report was specifically commissioned into the impact of the delay of the full utilisation of the &euro;35 million in 2013, the HSE mental health management team continuously monitored and reported to me on the challenges around the recruitment process and actively managed this as part of the ongoing reconfiguration of mental health services, in line with the key multi-annual priorities in the 2014 National Service Plan.  Therefore, notwithstanding the delay in achieving recruitment, progress was made during 2013 in further developing our mental health services in line with <i>A Vision for Change<\/i>, including the strengthening the Community Mental Health Teams, new clinical pathways for mental health in intellectual disability teams; delivery of 7,000 counselling sessions under the new Counselling in Primary Care initiative to 1,916 individuals, and a new e-learning suicide prevention programme for GPs.<br\/><br\/>In relation to 2014, while &euro;20 million was provided for mental health services, the HSE National Service Plan outlined that this expenditure would be phased-in, in order for the HSE to live within the overall available resource in 2014.  Accordingly, it was decided that the recruitment of 2014 posts would be commenced to provide for posts to come on stream during Q4.  To this end, and informed by the analysis carried out, some 200 posts have now been identified from the 2014 allocation and the recruitment process has now commenced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500087#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500087#WRV00750"},{"type":"question","counter":350,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[42403\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500087#WRV00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a hospital appointment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"984","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":351,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular patient query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly.

This will be applied across community and residential services to improve Placement List waiting times and to relieve the pressure in acute hospitals resulting from beds being taken up by those who no longer require acute care.<\/p><p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which will be completed in the coming months, will include consideration of the future balance between community and residential services and the longer-term sustainability of the Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500088#WRW01500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Dementia Strategy Publication","counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500088#WRW01600"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[42423\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500088#WRW01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when it is envisaged that the national dementia strategy will be published; his views on the planned implementation of the strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":373,"content":"<p>It is estimated that there are currently approximately 47,000 people with dementia in Ireland and that number is expected to increase threefold to approximately 132,000 by 2041.

It has been delivering on the structural reform agenda for the health service in line with the course set out in &ldquo;<i>Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &ndash; 2014<\/i>&rdquo; as well as a number of other policy papers which focused on specific areas of the health service including acute hospitals and primary care.  In developing these plans, my Department and the HSE examined approaches that have been successful in other jurisdictions, such as Kaiser Permanente, in order to identify initiatives that could work in an Irish setting.  This research has helped to inform the changes that are now being implemented.  Our reform proposals place an emphasis on the need for integrated care, frequently cited as one of the key benefits of the Kaiser model.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to report that significant progress has been made in relation to this reform programme.  For instance, the HSE recently launched the <i>&quot;Community Healthcare Organisations Report<\/i>&quot;.  This Report sets out plans for a comprehensive reorganisation of health services outside the acute hospital system.  It will involve the present 17 Integrated Service Areas being replaced by nine Community Healthcare Organisations, which will be part of the HSE.  The primary focus is to provide the maximum proportion of care to people in the communities where they live and to achieve joined-up, integrated services.  The new structures will have a strong focus on building good linkages with the acute hospital system so that people&rsquo;s care pathways are appropriately planned and their needs met in the right setting.  <br\/><br\/>A new structure is also being implemented for acute hospitals through the establishment of seven Hospital Groups.  Under the new model, Hospital Groups will be given greater leadership roles and more operational freedom.  They in turn will be responsible for the delivery of hospital services within a performance and accountability framework relating to specific legal, corporate, clinical, financial governance and performance requirements.  This new model combines the advantages of devolved decision making, such as flexibility, innovation, and local responsiveness. These seven Hospital Groups will see the retention of a commitment to centrally prescribed national objectives and standards, offering enormous potential to enhance the quality and safety of the care provided in a more cost effective manner. <br\/><br\/>In addition to implementing the above, my Department is also currently developing a detailed policy in relation to the new health structures that will replace the HSE and meet our key objectives of greatly improving the delivery of services for patients and the introduction of Universal Health Insurance.  <br\/><br\/>Collectively, these new structures represent a comprehensive reorganisation of the health services, with a focus on providing high-quality, cost-effective and integrated care across the system as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500089#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Data","counter":384,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500089#WRX00750"},{"type":"question","counter":385,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[42449\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500089#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an organisation structure chart for two organisations (details supplied); his views on the various layers of management therein; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":386,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on this matter.

The National Vehicle and Driver File, under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, issues renewal notices at the beginning of the final month to remind motorists that a vehicle must be either taxed or declared off the road for a further period.<br\/><br\/>Where a declaration of non-use is not made in the final month of a tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use, a vehicle must be taxed for the minimum period provided for in motor tax legislation, which is three months in the case a car and twelve months in the case of a motorcycle. A new declaration can then be made at any stage during the final month of the new motor tax disc if the vehicle is thereafter not going to be in use in a public place.<br\/><br\/>Exemptions are not provided for in individual cases. This is to protect the new arrangements; allowing an owner to declare a vehicle off the road after the expiry of a current declaration of non-use could potentially be a move back to the system of retrospective declarations, thereby undermining the overall objective of the legislative change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500097#WRFF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Funding","counter":512,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500097#WRFF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":513,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[42445\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500097#WRFF00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will respond to representations from Louth Leader Partnership (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":514,"content":"<p>As detailed in the EU regulatory framework, a maximum of 20% of the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) can be spent on administration by the Local Action Group contracted to deliver the Programme in their area.

The &lsquo;Eircode&rsquo; brand was launched for the National Postcode System on 28 April. The project is currently in the implementation phase and is scheduled to be rolled out nationwide by the middle of 2015. Every Irish address will be receiving a unique Eircode by post.<br\/><br\/>The public awareness campaign began last April with the launch of the website . This website has information on Eircodes for both residents and businesses. The Postcode Management Licence Holder has briefed businesses in the interim through a series of seminars and plans further business events before the end of the year.<br\/><br\/>A comprehensive public information campaign will commence before the planned postcode launch in mid 2015. A key part of the campaign will involve outreach activities to ensure that all members of the general public receive information on Eircodes in an effective way.<br\/><br\/>The cost to the Exchequer of the National Postcode System over the 10 year cycle of the contract is expected to be &euro;26m (ex VAT) with costs covering design, database upgrades, media and postcode distribution. The cost of the contract will be &euro;16m over the first two years and this funding has been ring fenced in my Department&rsquo;s 2015 budget.<br\/><br\/>One of the main benefits of the design chosen which allocates a unique identifier to each address is that it helps resolve the issue of non-unique addresses which represent 35% of addresses in Ireland. <br\/><br\/>The Freight Transport Association of Ireland and other bodies have expressed concerns over the non-sequenced nature of the Eircode. The postcode design chosen will work to meet the needs of a wide range of public and private users, including logistics and delivery providers and the emergency services. A sequential design has a number of drawbacks, including the potential to lead to inability to assign a sequential Eircode to new build and to cope with the expansion in the number of addresses in the future. <br\/><br\/>The Eircode postcode will provide a geo location, sourced from Ordnance Survey Ireland, for postal address points that will assist with navigation and will link with online maps. When an Eircode for an address is entered into such systems, it will be possible to find relevant location and routing information. The introduction of Eircodes will be an important and effective strategic addition to our national infrastructure.<br\/><br\/>Privacy and data protection issues have been part of the debate on postcodes since the establishment of a National Postcodes Board in 2005 to examine the introduction of postcodes in Ireland. There has been engagement with the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner on the issue of postcodes generally at various points since then. <br\/><br\/>The necessary protections will operate around the use of Eircodes to ensure that data protection legislation is complied with. Holders of personal data are bound by Data Protection legislation on how they store and use this data, and the introduction of Eircodes will not alter this obligation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500097#WRFF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Infrastructure","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500098#WRGG00125"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[42380\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500098#WRGG00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the function retained by his Department in respect of the encouragement of investment in mobile telephone infrastructure here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":528,"content":"<p>As Minister for Communications, one of my key objectives is to ensure that Ireland is best placed to avail of the emerging opportunities provided by the commercial telecommunications sector through the promotion of investment in state of the art infrastructure and the provision of a supportive legislative and regulatory environment.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband services, and are facilitating the rollout of 3G and 4G mobile services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of mobile voice and data services throughout the country.<br\/><br\/>While investment in communications infrastructure and services is primarily a matter for the private sector, Government recognises that it has a role in ensuring that barriers to investment are removed where possible.  The National Broadband Plan commits to a range of actions that will facilitate the more efficient<font color=\"#1F497D\"> <\/font>investment in the rollout of communications infrastru<font color=\"#1F497D\">c<\/font>ture. These include addressing planning and road opening challenges, assisting in getting citizens and businesses online, measures relating to spectrum policy and maximising the use of State assets where possible.<br\/><br\/>Since publication of the Plan in 2012, a working group has been established to address infrastructure issues which were identified by industry as creating barriers to deployment of services. The group is chaired by the Department of Transport and includes representatives from my Department, the Local Government Management Agency, the National Roads Authority (NRA) and Local Authorities.  The Group is currently reviewing issues relating to the location of telecommunications infrastructure on public roads, particularly motorways, with a view to reducing blackspots and enhancing services.  Consultation between the NRA and industry is ongoing on a range of issues relating to the citing of telecommunications infrastructure.  Local Authorities also have an important role in assisting the rollout of supporting infrastructure.  My Department has worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to raise awareness of the role of the planning process in facilitating the delivery of telecommunications infrastructure and services. <br\/><br\/>My Department is also in the process of reviewing national spectrum policy and is currently considering the outcome of a recent public consultation on spectrum policy.  Current spectrum policy needs to be revisited as a matter of course and in light of the rapid technological changes and the increased demands on this limited and valuable resource.  An important element of this review is to ensure that our legal and regulatory environment supports continued investment in mobile telecommunication infrastructure, which is dependent on access to radio spectrum. It is expected that this review will be completed in the first quarter of next year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500098#WRGG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":529,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500098#WRGG00350"},{"type":"question","counter":530,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[42457\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110500098#WRGG00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if there is a list of applicants for positions on boards of State bodies in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
