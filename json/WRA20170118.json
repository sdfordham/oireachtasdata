The HEA has been closely monitoring the financial position of all of the IoTs and in particular is working closely with those Institutes operating in deficit to ensure appropriate mechanisms are put in place to eliminate the deficit as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  The Financial Review of the Institutes, published last year by the HEA,\u00a0was carried out in order to provide an overview of the financial health of the sector, to consider capacity issues and to examine the challenges for the institutions given their respective plans for the future.  It was based on the assumption that static Exchequer funding coupled with continuing growth in student numbers could make a number of Institutes unsustainable.  The Report recognised the need to examine the underlying sustainability issues that existed across the sector and highlighted the need for a review of how funding is being allocated given the significant changes that are occurring in the higher education sector.  It makes a number of recommendations on how some of the issues which contribute to\u00a0funding problems in the IOT sector\u00a0can be addressed.  My Department is working closely with the HEA in relation to those recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  For example, the report clearly identifies the need for a review of the present funding model and work is under way in the HEA to undertake this task as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Funding overall for the higher education sector is a key concern for me, particularly in light of the additional pressure that will fall on the system over the next decade or so &ndash; an issue which is clearly set out in the Report of the Expert Group on the Future Funding for Higher Education, which is currently with the Joint Oireachtas Committee for consideration.  However, in seeking\u00a0to address the issue in the short term,\u00a0I have for the first time in nine years secured\u00a0additional funding for the sector with &euro;36.5m additional being made available this year and &euro;160m additional overall over the next three years. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, in Budget 2017 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.  The review will be undertaken as part of the overall response to meeting the anticipated skills needs in the economy over the coming years, in line with the policy framework set out in the National Skills Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  It\u00a0will include\u00a0an analysis of the business case for enhanced investment in the higher and further education and training sectors.  In this context it\u00a0will\u00a0identify key elements of the new funding model\u00a0and of\u00a0the expected impacts including those\u00a0on employers.  The review will include consultation with stakeholders.  It is expected that the policy review will be published by the end of April 2017, and will complement the ongoing work\u00a0by the Oireachtas Committee\u00a0in relation to the Cassells report.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800069#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":11,"content":"<p>Question No. 40 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800069#WRB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[1896\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800069#WRB00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the disparity between primary and secondary level education in the number of school places for children with autism; and the measures his Department is taking to improve access to appropriate places in mainstream secondary schools for children with autism.","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>The National Council for Special Education is responsible for organising and planning provision for children with Special Educational Needs, including establishing special classes in mainstream primary and post primary schools. <\/p>  <p>  Progress in developing the network of Special Classes has been significant. <\/p>  <p>  In 2011 there were 548 special classes, of which 224 were primary ASD classes, 72 were post-primary ASD classes and 34 were early intervention classes.  The remaining 218 were special classes service children with mild to moderate\/severe general learning difficulties and specific learning difficulties, including speech and language difficulties. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 1,153 special classes, which is an increase of over 100% on the number available in 2011.  Of these, 127 are ASD early intervention classes, 525 are primary ASD classes and 237 are post-primary ASD classes.  The remainder are non-ASD special classes.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised that there are almost 18,000 students with ASD attending schools nationally.  Of these 3,484 are attending primary ASD classes and 1,118 are attending post-primary ASD classes. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE continues to review special class placement requirements nationally and has informed the Department that, in general, it is satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand.<\/p>  <p>  The continued growth in post-primary special class numbers is a natural consequence of the earlier growth in primary special class numbers.  However, it should not be assumed that the same levels of growth in post-primary class numbers should apply.  This is because, for children with Autism, transferring from a special class in a primary school to a special class in a post-primary school may not always be the optimal choice.  Many children can progress to mainstream post-primary with the support of SNA and Resource Teaching hours, while more may transfer from primary to a special school depending on their presentation and needs.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there is a proportionally larger enrolment at Primary level due to the higher number of standard years.

The recent Budget contained measures to deliver on this. <\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.  The pay increases for new teachers are now also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members will be balloting on shortly. <\/p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally.  For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods.  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. <\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that once a pupil referral to NEPS is agreed an assessment is normally undertaken and a formal report submitted to parents and school authorities within an average of 9 weeks.

An inspection was undertaken by the Central Bank from 3-10 October 2007. Upon investigation, the Bank was satisfied that the breach did not suggest a wider or more systematic erosion of overall liquidity. The bank was back in compliance with the limits within twenty four hours of the breach. The breach was not connected to any other bank operating in Ireland. <\/p><p>Following additional claims made in the media in 2010\u00a0that numerous breaches had taken\u00a0place in the months following the introduction of the Requirements in 2007, a further investigation was undertaken at the instruction of the Central Bank. An independent third party firm was engaged in order to check compliance with the liquidity requirements. This investigation did not highlight any further breaches.<\/p><p>The Central Bank also requested that any individual who had information they wished to share with the Central Bank regarding potential regulatory breaches, to write in confidence to the Public Contact Unit or the Deputy Governor, Financial Regulation. Following contact from a third party at that time, the Central Bank held a meeting with that person to discuss the matter. <\/p><p>The Central Bank has undertaken significant investigations around the\u00a0issues raised and is satisfied that this matter is now closed.<\/p><p>On the issue of\u00a0the Central Bank's approach to whistleblowers, new protections for persons making protected disclosures to the Central Bank came into force on 1 August 2013. This also included new obligations on certain categories of persons in regulated firms to disclose breaches of financial services legislation to the Central Bank. The Central Bank has established a whistleblower desk and put in place policies and procedures to ensure such disclosures are dealt with appropriately.<\/p><p>In broad terms, where a person makes a disclosure in good faith to the Central Bank or one of its employees, and the person making the disclosure has reasonable grounds for believing that the disclosure will show that there has been a breach of, or offence under, financial services legislation or the concealment or destruction of evidence relating to such an offence or breach and provides their name, the disclosure is a protected disclosure. Any correspondence received by the Central Bank through its protected disclosure channel is treated seriously and examined thoroughly.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the EU Regulation establishing the Single Supervisory Mechanism, which formally commenced on 4 November 2014, includes a provision in respect of reporting of breaches, i.e. whistleblower reports, which relate to those banks directly supervised by the European Central Bank.\u00a0Persons with information on potential breaches of EU law by banks and\/or by competent authorities, including the Central Bank of Ireland, can report such breaches to the ECB.\u00a0<\/p><p>Another issue which was raised in the interview was around attendance at the Banking Inquiry. The Joint Oireachtas Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis was formally established in November 2014 under the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013. The purpose of the Inquiry was to inquire into the reasons Ireland experienced a systemic banking crisis. It was a matter for the Joint Committee to decide on whom it would call\u00a0as a witness or who would be consulted as part of the Inquiry. The Joint Committee's full report can be found via the link .<\/p><p>Finally, some opinions were expressed during the interview around\u00a0AIB's solvency. I want to take this opportunity to reassure the House that AIB is now in a healthy financial position, generating good profitability and levels of capital. I've indicated many times before, that our strategy in recent years was to hold onto our investment in the bank until its value had recovered substantially from its lows to the point where it accurately reflected the true value of the franchise. Six years on from when the State last had to put capital into AIB, we are now at a point where funds have already started to come back to the taxpayer, and we see a genuine possibility of being able to sell a portion of our shareholding on the markets in the next 12-18 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800074#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Costs","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800074#WRG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[2195\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800074#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of claims made by companies for correlative\u00a0adjustments for each of the years 2005 to 2016; the number of claims for correlative\u00a0adjustments\u00a0conceded by the Revenue Commissioners; the total value of the tax involved in those claims; if, in respect of the total number of claims made in these years, he will provide a breakdown by industry and the other country involved; the amount of tax involved in each of the three largest cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[2196\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800074#WRG02750","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost of refunds arising from correlative adjustments made in 2016 and likely to be made in 2017.","asker":"1222","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.<\/p><p>It is worth noting that a similar question was raised in 2012 (Ref No: 12336\/12).

In addition, a new national anti-bullying website, www.tacklebuyying.ie, was launched in November 2015 as a single point of information and support for young people, parents and teachers affected by bullying. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the \"Action Plan for Education 2016-2019&rdquo;, my Department is committed to continuing implementation of the Anti-Bullying Action Plan through continued support for the development of anti-bullying training materials and awareness-raising initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800077#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800077#WRK00750"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[2210\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800077#WRK00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which the pupil-teacher ratio at primary and second level throughout the country is a matter of concern; the extent to which he expects to be in a position to improve the situation in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[2211\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800077#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which the pupil-teacher ratio at primary and second level throughout County Kildare is a matter of concern; the extent to which he expects to be in a position to improve the situation in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.<\/p><p>The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on the Department's website. <font color=\"#444444\"> The Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR) is determined by the overall number of posts and enrolments as of the 30<\/font><sup><font color=\"#444444\">th<\/font><\/sup><font color=\"#444444\"> September of the previous year.<\/font><\/p><p>The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.

Budget 2016 provided for an improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools by one point, from 1 teacher for every 28 pupils to 1 teacher for every 27 pupils for the 2016\/17 school year.  The Programme for Government has a commitment to reduce class sizes at primary level and it is my intention to make further improvements to class sizes over the life of the Government. <\/p><p>My focus in Budget 2017 was on obtaining additional funding to provide for demographic growth, additional special education and school leadership resources for our schools.<\/p><p>Budget 2017 sets out the resources available for schools for the 2017\/18 school year.  This Budget represents the start of a major reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade.  The budget provides for over 2,400 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools next year.

The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.<\/p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all housing authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  Most payments received from the Department of Social Protection are assessable, including Family Income Supplement.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and housing authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off.<\/p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. I am satisfied that the current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this and that they provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources. These income limits will continue to be kept under review by my Department, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda set out in the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>.<\/p><p>I am aware of the difficulties experienced by some households in purchasing their own home where they are not eligible for social housing support on income grounds.  It may be possible for such households to avail of a mortgage from a local authority which is targeted at lower income first-time buyers who can demonstrate that they are unable to get a loan from a building society or bank. A loan can be up to 97% of the price of the property, subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.  The relevant terms and conditions applying to local authority housing loans are set out in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012 which prescribe a maximum annual gross income threshold of &euro;50,000 for a single person household or a combined annual gross income of &euro;75,000 for a two person household.  The Regulations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012<font color=\"#0000FF\">.<\/font><\/p><p>Another option is the Home Choice Loan, a Government backed mortgage for first time buyers.  The Home Choice Loan is available through authorised mortgage brokers and can be used to provide up to 92% of the market value of the property being purchased, up to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000. A new or second hand property may be purchased under the scheme.

In addition to this a number of specific measures have also been taken in relation to pay that will support the recruitment and retention of Irish nursing and midwifery graduates.  Measures to date include additional pay in return for taking on some duties from doctors and an increase in the rate of pay for the student nursing placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse pay scale.  In the last quarter of 2016 the Government approved restoration of incremental credit for 2011 to 2015 graduate nurses in respect of the 36 week clinical placement undertaken by fourth year student nurses in the context of the 2017 Estimates.  All nurses and midwives are now eligible for incremental credit for the 36 week placement.  There has been an increase of 1,702 nurses employed in the public health service (34,093 to 35,795) from November 2013 to November 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Government announced plans to increase those on annualised salaries by &euro;1,000 for the period April to August 2017 for those on salaries up to &euro;65,000 to address anomalies arising from the Labour Court Recommendations in respect of the Garda Associations.  A benefit of this decision is that it will make jobs in nursing more attractive.<\/p>  <p>  There are many initiatives currently under way to improve staffing levels throughout the country, the HSE is offering permanent posts to 2016 degree programme graduates, and full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts.  The HSE is also focused on converting agency staffing to permanent posts, while also accepting that there is still the need to have some element of agency.  The HSE's National Recruitment Service is actively operating rolling nursing recruitment campaigns.  The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives.  In addition, a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 continues to be available to nurses who return from overseas.  The HSE ran a three-day open recruitment event over the Christmas holiday period in Dr Steevens&rsquo; Hospital for nurses and midwives from all disciplines who are interested in working in the Irish Public Health Service. 220 attended the event.  115 nursing and midwifery candidates were deemed successful and panelled following interview.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2016 the HSE set up a Project Group to review nursing workforce planning, recruitment and retention.  The main objectives of this Project Group include identifying current recruitment black spots in a coordinated way and developing measures to incentivise and attract nurses to these essential posts.<\/p>  <p>  Given recognised difficulties in filling psychiatric nursing vacancies, an additional 60 undergraduate places were put in place last autumn with a further 70 additional places to be provided this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800083#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Beds Data","counter":373,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800083#WRQ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":374,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[2044\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800083#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of long stay beds that have been closed in the past six years on a county basis, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":375,"content":"<p>Officials from my Department have been in contact with the Deputy's Office requesting clarification regarding what is intended by the use of the term 'Long Stay Beds'.

The Strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and well being so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural and family life in their own communities for as long as possible, thereby representing a vision for an age-friendly society.  The Strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and well-being of our ageing citizens.  The Department of Health has an overall coordinating and collating role for the Strategy and a more direct role for the health-related objectives.<\/p>  <p>  At the launch of the Strategy, a commitment was made to publish an Implementation Plan to facilitate the translation of the Goals and Objectives of the Strategy into action on the ground.  The approach to implementation originally included in the Strategy would have worked where a finite number of discrete and concrete steps could be taken after which the implementation could be deemed complete.  However, many of the objectives included in this Strategy are quite broad, and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future, rather than concrete objectives that can be delivered in the short term.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has therefore formulated new arrangements to implement and monitor the implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  The new proposals will see mechanisms established that will give stakeholder groups effective and on-going access to Government Departments and  State Agencies relevant to older people.  Structures will be established for engagement between relevant Government Departments and State Agencies and relevant stakeholders on how the Strategy&rsquo;s principles are being implemented.  An Annual Forum for stakeholders will be established which will seek to identify what stakeholders consider to be their key priorities for Government for the coming year and the next three years.  Issues will be considered on a thematic basis and will include Health, Social Protection, Transport, Security, Community Housing and Local Government, etc.  Clear channels of communications will be established with relevant Government Departments assigning a named senior official to engage with stakeholder representatives on  issues relevant to their remit.<\/p>  <p>  The revised arrangements were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 27 October 2016.  In advance of this, I held a meeting with organisations representing the needs and views of older people at which the organisations were informed of the plans for the revised implementation arrangements, including plans for an annual stakeholder forum.  These plans were well received by the organisations, and it was agreed that an annual forum could be a useful tool in moving the implementation of the NPAS forward.  Details of the new arrangements will be communicated to these stakeholders shortly and arrangements made to commence implementation.  It is anticipated that the inaugural forum will take place in early 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800083#WRQ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800083#WRQ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[2057\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017011800083#WRQ02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be provided a date for hip replacement surgery in St James's Hospital.","asker":"1305","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment in Broadband through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area.<\/p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  Investment decisions by the telecommunications networks providers in these areas are taken on commercial grounds by each network operator.<\/p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>The area referred to by the Deputy falls within an AMBER area and\u00a0will therefore be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by\u00a0accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The Department will also shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised and potential other new investments. <\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the\u00a0 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home\u00a0solution\u00a0means that householders and businesses may\u00a0get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July,\u00a0I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys\u00a0to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.
