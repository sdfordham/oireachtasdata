The Construction Industry Federation is the representative body for employers in the construction industry.  We represent contractors and members throughout all sectors of the industry, including general contracting, specialist sub-contracting, civil engineering contracting, mechanical and electrical contracting, and house-building.  We have 13 branches throughout the country representing the interests of our members and we have offices in Dublin, Cork and Galway.<\/p><p>  We welcome the publication of this Bill.  The Supreme Court judgement in 2013 left a vacuum in the industry, which has caused huge difficulties for our members.  There have been difficulties in tendering and trying to resolve disputes that arise, and we have been left without any kind of certainty in the industry with regard to labour costs.  We are hopeful that the industry is emerging from recession and that over the coming year and into the future the industry will be capable of creating jobs.  Since the recession hit, approximately seven years ago, over 180,000 construction workers have lost their jobs, which is a huge number of people left without work.  We are hopeful that when we emerge from recession we will be capable of creating jobs.<\/p><p>  What we need in the industry is certainty about labour costs.  We need a level playing field for contractors when they are tendering for work and we need a robust and vigorous disputes resolution procedure to enable us to resolve the disputes that will inevitably arise.  The construction industry is characterised by its competitive nature.  Contractors are in competition with one another for jobs, both within the State and outside the State, and it is essential that they can compete for work on a level playing field with regard to costs.  Labour costs account for over 50% of any tender and when our members are trying to compete we need certainty about labour costs.  We also need a vigorous disputes resolution procedure.  The industry is labour-intensive.  A worker in the construction industry can expect to have a job for the duration of a contract.  If that contract is finished, the employer may transfer the worker to another site if another site is available.  If that is not the case, that worker could be made redundant.  Construction workers, therefore, are constantly moving from employer to employer and from site to site, so the industry is transient in nature and because it is labour-intensive it is prone to volatility.  That is why a vigorous disputes resolution procedure is essential to us.<\/p><p>  Part II of the heads of Bill provides a legislative framework to allow individual employers and trade unions to come to an employment agreement and to register that agreement.  Registered employment agreements, REAs, are binding only on the parties to the agreement and therefore we believe that REAs will not really be of benefit to the construction industry in general.  The industry is competitive by nature and we must ensure that there are universally applicable rates of pay for all employers and workers in the industry, regardless of whether they have been a party to the agreement or not.  We are therefore concentrating in particular on Part III, which deals with registered employment orders.  These are sectoral agreements or provision for sectoral orders, which we believe are more applicable to the construction industry.<\/p> <p>There are a number of issues in connection with the registered employment agreements which we would like to address.  I will go through some of the heads on which we would like to comment.<\/p><p> Head 13 deals with non-application of the Act.  It sets out the various family members, generally speaking, to whom the Act would not apply.  The reason we are looking for this legislation to be enacted in the industry is that it would apply to all employers and all workers of a certain category, class or type.  Therefore, we would look to have head 13 omitted from the Act because it would not apply to, say, a family firm.  The construction industry is characterised by small- to medium-sized enterprises.  There are family firms throughout the country.  If a family firm was exempt from this part of the legislation purely because the owner employed family members, that would place the firm at a competitive advantage in comparison to other contractors.  We believe this would defy the basic principle of the legislation and therefore we would look to have the head omitted.<\/p><p>Our comments on heads 14 and 16 are similar.  The wording in the heads states that an organisation representing workers, on its own behalf or jointly with an organisation representing employers, can apply to the Labour Court for it to carry out a review and make a recommendation to the Minister.  It does not specify that an organisation representing employers can apply to the Labour Court for a review on its own or jointly with an organisation representing workers.  We have been assured by the Department that the intention is that any organisation representing either employers or workers may make an application to the Labour Court, but we would like clarity on that issue.  The framework document that was issued in February in connection with this legislation and the briefing document issued by the Department in July would lead us to believe that any organisation could apply to the Labour Court.  These comments apply to heads 14 and 16.<\/p><p> Head 21 looks at the recommendation of the Labour Court and sets out the principles and policies that the Labour Court must take into consideration when making its recommendation.  One of those is that it must take the general level of wages applying into account.  We would like that extended to include the general level of wages applying to workers of a similar class, group or type, not just in Ireland but also in other EU member states.  This would be to ensure that Irish construction workers' rates of pay are not out of line with those that apply in other EU member states.  In particular, we would be thinking of contractors in the North, because Irish contractors have traditionally been in competition with contractors from Northern Ireland and we would like to make sure that the Irish construction workers' rates of pay are not out of line with other jurisdictions.<\/p><p> Head 22, on the dispute settling provisions,  is of particular importance to us.  The wording in the heads of Bill provides that, in general, if a dispute occurs between a worker and his employer in relation to something that is in the order, a strike or lockout cannot occur until the dispute has been put forward for resolution by the LRC or the Labour Court.  We would like the dispute resolution procedure to be strengthened, and for the Bill to state that if a dispute occurs between a worker and an employer to whom the order relates, a strike or lockout will not occur until the dispute has been put forward.  In other words, the dispute resolution procedures should not apply just to a dispute that may occur about an issue in the order.  The disputes resolution procedure should apply to any dispute that may arise between workers and employers.  The only issues that would be covered by the order would be rates of pay and conditions of employment and pensions and sick pay.  There may be disputes.  <\/p> <p>The only issues that will be covered by the order will be rates of pay, conditions of employment, pensions and sick pay.  There may be disputes.  As I said, the industry is a labour-intensive one.  It is transient in nature and, therefore, prone to volatility, which is why the dispute resolution procedure is very important to us.  We would like a strengthened dispute resolution procedure that would help to resolve any disputes that may arise in the industry.<\/p><p> Head 26 deals with exemptions and derogations.  While we accept that the conditions set out in the Bill attaching to exemptions are quite strict, which is good, we believe the basic principle of an order is that there is a level playing field in regard to tendering on labour costs from an employer's perspective and that there are fair, sustainable and reasonable rates of pay from an employee's perspective.  We would prefer to see the derogations omitted from the legislation because, again, we believe that defies the basic principles of the order in the first place.<\/p><p> Lastly, but of huge importance to us, are the compliance and enforcement provisions.  The Bill states quite rightly that the compliance and enforcement provisions would be consistent with those set out in the Workplace Relations Bill, but the importance of compliance and enforcement cannot be overstated from our perspective.  In the past, when we had registered employment agreements, the issue of compliance with, and enforcement of, those agreements was hugely important.  As I said, many of our members and contractors in the Republic would be in competition with contractors from the North.  It is essential that there is provision there for those who will carry out compliance and enforcement and that they have the necessary authority and powers to ensure that all contractors, regardless of origin, will be forced to comply with the provisions of the order.  It is our view that the National Employment Rights Agency is the appropriate body to carry out compliance in the industry and that it should have adequate resources to ensure that it is capable of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the order.<\/p><p> We believe NERA should have a unit dedicated purely to the construction industry, because of the size of the industry, the number of workers involved in it and the transient nature of it, and that it would have the necessary authority and powers to ensure that contractors, not only those based in the State but those based outside it, comply with legislation.  If that necessitates provision being made for contractors outside the State having bases or offices in the State to enable NERA carry out its functions in compliance and enforcement, that should be done.  Those are our views and observations on the legislation.<\/p><p> As I said, the important aspects of it are that it would bring certainty to the industry.  We had that certainty until May 2013 when the Supreme Court struck down REAs.  We need certainty in regard to labour costs because the industry is emerging from recession.  We believe we are capable of creating employment.  Currently, 106,000 construction workers are employed in the industry and we are only emerging from recession, so we hope we will be in position to create more employment.  That is the reason we need certainty in regard to labour costs, stability and a proper dispute resolution procedure and to ensure that whatever order is put in place can be enforced and complied with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014111800005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jean Winters","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416318600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Winters and invite Ms McElwee to make her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014111800007#F00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416318600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  IBEC thanks the joint committee for the opportunity to provide a written submission to it on the heads of the industrial relations (amendment) Bill 2014.<\/p> <p>IBEC is slightly different from the CIF is that it is representative of member companies across all sectors and all industries and therefore has a different view in respect of the heads of the Bill that have been produced.  IBEC has a number of key observations and recommendations that it would like to draw to the attention of the committee.<br\/>IBEC welcomes the introduction of a proposed wage setting mechanism that would have some statutory force but would like to see it balanced with a mechanism that is both appropriate and sustainable.  In the first instance I will deal with the heads in Part 2 of the Bill.  I have a couple of small issues with the heads of the Bill and make the following proposals.<br\/>In regard to head 5, IBEC is concerned about the lack of requirement to specify when a registered employment agreement would cease to have effect.  I respectfully submit that this head should be amended to provide that the court shall not register an employment agreement unless it contains a provision that specifies when it will come to an end.  Employers would be unlikely to enter into an REA where it felt there was no end date.  Given the potential that an REA could be varied without the consent of an employer, again that would be an important factor in coming towards an REA in a positive way.  IBEC believes that every REA should have a termination provision in order that it would be drawn to a conclusion at a particular point in time.<br\/>The issue with head 6 is that no consent is required to vary an REA.  This head would give the Labour Court the power to vary an REA which has already been made, even where the employer and the union concerned are not agreeable to that variation.  IBEC respectfully submits that the agreement of the parties should be required before REAs could be varied, except in cases of <i>force majeure<\/i>, such as a major economic crisis.  IBEC proposes that, in Part 2, the court could not vary a termination provision to ensure that an REA would last forever and that the head would be amended to preclude that as a possibility.<br\/>In Part 3 of the Bill, the definition of &quot;remuneration&quot; is set out in head 12 and it creates a material difference between the registered employment order, REO, and the joint labour committee-employment regulation order, JLC-ERO, systems.  IBEC would be concerned about the likelihood of forum shopping, something it has seen in other areas of employment law and industrial relations.  This head proposes to define remuneration to include matters such as basic pay, piece work, overtime, Sunday premium and travel time.  We have concerns that a definition would extend the scope of registered employment orders beyond the scope of what is already contained in JLC-EROs and bring about the danger of forum shopping.  Joint labour committees, JLCs, are not empowered to make recommendations in respect of Sunday premium and we submit this head should be amended to reflect the same provisions.<br\/>In head 14, the registered employment order application mechanism does not require the agreement of those to whom it applies.  The proposed absence of a requirement for agreement is a radical departure from the former REA mechanism.  The issue arises that this may give greater rise to challenge on constitutional grounds than the former system.<br\/>One of the failings of the former system was that some relevant employers could have an REA imposed on them.  Under this new proposal, all relevant employers could have an REO imposed on them, as no agreement is required from either the employer side or the employee-trade union side for any level of agreement on what is proposed in an REO.  IBEC is concerned that significant constitutional issues may arise.  I have some proposals to address that and I will do under head 21.<br\/>In head 18, there is a lack of clarity about evidence the court would require to establish substantial representation.  The head proposes to permit the court to specify documentation which tends to confirm whether an applicant for an REO can establish that it is &quot;substantially representative&quot; of the workers or employers in question.<\/p> <p>A provision might need to be made in relation to the provision of that evidence.  We submit that such provision could extend to requiring applicants to swear to statutory declarations about the relevant numbers of members or workers, as the case may be, who fall into the relevant categories.  Provision for statutory declarations of this type is already included in the proposed amendment to the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001.<\/p><p> Head 21 relates to recommendations to the Labour Court.  As I have said, IBEC's fundamental concern about the heads of this Bill is that they would facilitate the imposition of a registered employment order even if most or all of the affected employers opposed the order.  We suggest that head 21 should be amended to provide that \"the Court shall not make a recommendation if it is satisfied that trade unions representing, or the employers employing, a substantial number of the affected workers do not support the proposed recommendation\".  This fundamental protection would prevent the court from making a recommendation unless there is substantial agreement from relevant trade unions and employers.  However, it would not mandate that a recommendation would be agreed simply because there is agreement.  Other principles and policies would still have to be considered in the normal way to ensure any registered employment order that eventually came out adhered to those principles and policies.  In the absence of such a protection, the court would have unduly broad powers to set wages in all sectors of the economy.<\/p><p> We have an issue with the adequacy of the principles and policies under head 21 in regard to the proposing of a registered employment order.  One of the fundamental reasons the two former wage-setting mechanisms were struck down was the absence of sufficient policies and procedures to guide the court in making subordinate decisions.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012, which restored the joint labour committee and employment regulation order system, provided detailed principles and policies for joint labour committees.  Eleven policies and procedures were provided for to guide the committees in making their decisions.  We believe it would be reasonable to expect the new legislation governing registered employment orders to contain similar provisions.  However, the new legislation that is proposed includes just four of the 11 policies and procedures set out in the 2012 Act.  For that reason we are concerned that the new proposals significantly dilute the principles and policies in question.<\/p><p> This dilution occurs in the context of the proposed new registered employment order mechanism, which will place an extraordinary level of decision-making in the hands of the Labour Court.  The court will not have the constraints that apply under the joint labour committee and employment regulation order system.  Under that system, proposals for an employment regulation order must be formulated by the joint labour committee.  The court may accept or reject the committee's proposals - it might make recommendations to the committee about the content of the proposals &ndash; but it may not substitute its own views for those of the joint labour committee.  We are suggesting that where the court has these broad powers, it is extremely important for them to be guided by further policies and principles.  There is no requirement for agreement to be reached in the setting of a registered employment order.<\/p><p> We believe it is particularly important for the guiding principle in relation to competition between enterprises in the member state and enterprises in other member states to be reinstated in the consideration of a registered employment order.  The court should have regard to the general level of wages in enterprises in any other member state and take account of the cost of living in the member state as set out.  A wage-setting proposal is a very draconian measure.  Given the broad scope of a registered employment order in any industry or sector, we think it is important for the competition consideration to be set out.  It will not always be the case in every sector of industry that other legislation will be in a position to amend or contain that, as it would be for posted workers in the construction sector, for example.  We need to take cognisance of the competitive markets that are in force in that sector and other sectors that are in operation in the Border counties.<\/p><p> We believe the court should not make a recommendation unless it is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so.  The court should always have a wider view of the public interest when it is making a wage-setting recommendation.  It would not be sufficient for it to confine its consideration to the sector involved.<\/p> <p>The potential imposition of pension schemes that are not in line with public policy is a key issue to be brought to the attention of the committee under this head.  In the past, the wage-setting mechanisms under the Industrial Relations Acts included pension provisions that would certainly not meet modern-day standards.  We suggest that the court not make a recommendation in respect of a pension scheme unless it is first satisfied that the request is in a form that is in compliance with national pensions policy.<br\/>On head 24, pertaining to a decision by the Minister, the lack of ministerial discretion to decline to register an REA is a matter of concern.  We respectfully submit that such a provision would unduly<b><\/b>fetter the power of the Minister and would amount to undue delegation of legislative power to the court.  We suggest that the head be amended so the Minister would be obliged to make an order only in certain circumstances.  As it stands, the Minister would be required to make the order even if it were contrary to public policy, if it would create an unacceptable cost to the State, if it had the effect of causing indirect discrimination or if it caused Ireland to be in breach of international treaty obligations.  The Minister should have unfettered discretion to decline to make an order.  Furthermore, Ibec believes the Minister should have a positive obligation to be satisfied that making the order is in the public interest before he or she makes any such order.<br\/>Head 27 concerns compliance and enforcement provisions.  Our submission indicates there are excessive measures being proposed to enforce compliance with REOs.  This head proposes that compliance with REOs is to be addressed through the adjudication process, compliance notices and fixed-payment notices, as provided for in the Workplace Relations Bill.  We have already raised this in the context of that Bill.  However, we submit that employment law is not an appropriate area of law for fixed-payment notices to be introduced, and that the criminal element of the compliance notice regime is not an appropriate system for employment enactments.  We propose that provisions for compliance and enforcement notices be removed from both the Workplace Relations Bill and head 27 as there are already sufficiently rigorous provisions within the workplace relations structure to deal with any such issues that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014111800007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416319500,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for their contributions.

I have several questions, some of which overlap.  A frustration under the old system, experienced in particular by smaller companies, was that the bigger companies could sustain the cost associated with implementation.  They could take the cost on board because of their size and economies of scale.   Particularly in the CIF presentation, the delegates seemed, wittingly or otherwise, to emphasise that.  They seem to be trying to take out of the Bill whatever supports exist for small business.  There are not many.  They seem to be against the proposal.  Head 13, pertaining to family business, specifically small local businesses and not big family businesses, was specifically mentioned.  Head 26, on the inability-to-pay mechanism, which is incredibly restrictive, is opposed by the delegates also.  How do they respond to the argument that their stance is to protect the big companies?  The majority of the federation's members are big companies, but there are some small building companies also.  The federation's proposals would take away whatever few supports exist at the expense of SMEs or small companies and to the benefit of larger companies.<\/p><p>  The CIF delegates stated Part 2 of the Bill is not appropriate to the industry.  Have they any alternative structure?  On head 27, on compliance, has the delegation come across any comparisons we could use in terms of outer jurisdiction enforcement - for example, in Europe where borders are shared?  I refer to circumstances where we have similar issues.  This is a major problem, particularly where outer jurisdiction construction tendering uses different cost bases and methods.  Have the delegates come across any models in their work that we could use as a guide in framing this legislation?<\/p> <p>In the IBEC presentation, the area of substantial representation was mentioned in relation to head 18.  This is a big issue.  The witness was vague about how we define what is substantial representation.  Representatives of CIF can come in on this.  What test would the witnesses suggest, both in terms of employer organisations and unions?  This is an area I am interested in pursuing because it is a major flaw in the system.  Will the witnesses comment on the cross-Border issue and how we manage shared borders in terms of implementing tendering and cost aspects?  On point 3, what model would IBEC use for labour measurement?  Would it use an EU, OECD or UN model?  This applies to CIF too.  There are so many different models for measuring labour rates.  Is there a preference?  <\/p><p> Both submissions have much food for thought in them.  I am just picking up on those issues, but I may come back to the representatives of CIF and IBEC separately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014111800010#J00300","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416319800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>With regard to Deputy Calleary's point about protection for the larger employers, I apologise if it has come across like that, but that is certainly not the intention of our submission.  We represent contractors of all sizes across all sectors, and in fact the majority of our membership is made up of small and medium enterprises.  Many of these small and medium enterprises employ the largest number of workers in the industry.  We are certainly not about trying to protect large contractors.  I believe, and the federation believes, that having a registered employment order in place in the industry that covers all workers regardless of the size of their employer is the best way to ensure protection for large, medium and small enterprises.  That is why we would prefer to see heads 13 and 27 omitted from the legislation.<\/p><p>  Head 13 is about the non-application of the Act to family members.  In some parts of the country, there could be, for example, a plumbing contractor who employs his sons and they compete for work in their particular town or village in the country.  If a registered employment order does not apply to that small firm, it is at an advantage when tendering for work against another firm that might employ the same number of workers - one or two plumbers - if these workers are not family members.  The registered employment order will protect small and medium enterprises in exactly the same way it will protect larger contractors because, regardless of the size of the firm, it must still go out and compete for work.  That is the nature of the construction industry - contractors must go out there and compete for work.  As labour takes up a huge portion of any tender, regardless of the size of the firm, rates and terms and conditions should be universally applicable and should not depend on the size of enterprise.<\/p><p>  On Part II, which deals with registered employment agreements, the reason we believe REAs will not be applicable to the industry in general is that they will only be binding on the parties to these agreements.  For example, if CIF, representing employers, reached an employment agreement with all the unions involved in the construction industry and registers the agreement, that is fine if contractors who are members of CIF are a party to that agreement.  It is binding on them.  However, contractors from the North, for example, or contractors who are not members of the federation would have a competitive advantage.<\/p> <p>We believe that the registered employment agreements are not applicable to the construction industry, because they are binding on the parties to the agreement only.  The alternative, as we see it, and the better system for the industry, is the registered employment orders because they have universal applicability and are not confined purely to the parties to the agreement.  <\/p><p> With regard to compliance and whether there are models in other countries, the difficulty we have had in the industry over the years, and particularly during the busy years, was with contractors from the North who might come down to the Republic, carry out their business and then go back to the North.  These contractors would not have an office in which the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, could inspect the records and ensure workers were being paid the appropriate rates and so on.  The posting of workers directive was introduced in most other EU member states several years ago.  I cannot remember exactly what the date was but it was a number of years ago.  I believe there are difficulties in transposing that directive in Ireland.  It is not an Act in its own right.  We had a difficulty with our Constitution, and with the issue of enforcement, in ensuring that workers from other jurisdictions would get the same terms and conditions.  If a worker found that he was not getting the proper rate of pay in the construction industry, where did he bring a case?  Did he bring it to the Labour Court here in Ireland, or, if he was, say, a Northern Irish worker, did he go to the equivalent Labour Court in the North?  If he came to the Labour Court here and it issued a determination, how could that be enforced if the worker's employer or ex-employer was based in a different jurisdiction?  Other European countries have not had this difficulty with the posting of workers directive.  I understand the issue is to do with our Constitution.  One way around it is that, if contractors working here in the Republic were required to have a base or an office here while they were carrying out work, then NERA, with the proper statutory powers, could visit that office and look to inspect the records to ensure that all workers working in the industry here received the same terms and conditions.  That might be a way of sorting that issue out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014111800011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jean Winters","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416320100,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Regarding the question of representation posed on head 18, the matter of \"substantially representative of any particular group\" is always considerable.  Looking at it from the point of view of how it could be defined, rather than what would actually constitute substantial representation, is one of the issues.  We suggest there should be a standard mechanism by which \"substantially representative\" can be measured and verified.  Defining \"substantially representative\" comes first, being conscious that we are looking across all sectors and industries where a registered employment order in particular, or a registered employment agreement, might be in place.  It does not necessarily need to define what exactly \"substantially representative\" is within each sector and industry.  The Labour Court, having received a standardised set of information, could probably take a view as to the representativeness of any particular party to an application for an registered employment order.  There will always be fluctuations and differences in the level of representation in any individual sector and it might be impossible to capture one way or the other.  A very low number might actually be representative in some circumstances.<\/p><p>  The other question posed was on labour costs.  I do not have a specific model that should be in place and that we could necessarily use, but at a very basic level we should be cognisant of the wages that are being paid in our nearest competitor markets, as should the Labour Court in its principles and policies.<\/p> <p>When contracting in and out of Ireland and Northern Ireland, for instance, those contracting rates will necessarily apply.  Other sectors and industries will have a problem with labour costs potentially rising where in some instances there is a business across the road that will not be subject to the same inflation in labour costs because it will not be subject to a registered employment order.  The court needs to have taken into account where the sector is operating and its direct competitor market.  It may be a case in retail or in the hospitality industry, in pubs, restaurants and clubs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014111800012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416320400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I did not hear the consumer mentioned.

In the Senator&rsquo;s retail business he might have own brands and large multinational brands.  In construction one has to tender for a particular job.  Having a registered employment agreement or an REO would give better service to the customer because as soon as the REA disappeared and there was a major decline in the industry, the tendering became so intense that in many cases it was below cost.  Some projects were not finished and some, unfortunately, were finished to a poor standard.  In attempting to keep their business alive through gaining cashflow some people went in below cost and then attempted to cut their wage bills and ended up not paying people.  We feel the absence of an REA.  When we had it we went regularly to the Labour Court, met our counterparts in the unions and negotiated.  The rates went up steadily until 2009, when we got a 7% reduction, which did not represent the nosedive the industry took.  Apart from that we thought it was good for our workers.<\/p><p>  We have a pension scheme for construction workers and as Ms Winters said, it is very transient work.  If one gets a job worth &euro;20 million and takes on 100 guys, they will have to disperse and seek work elsewhere unless one gets another, similar contract immediately.  The pension scheme is voluntary.  It is not really referred to in this legislation but we hope it will become part of it.  That is a good support for construction workers.<\/p> <p>It might be easier in later life to work in a shop.  While I am not saying it is, construction sites are not the place for people facing retirement .  They would certainly appreciate the pension.<\/p><p> If one looks at low-cost retailers, one would be hard set to find a person working in some of the large foreign stores.  Everything is stacked high and one finds a person at the cash desk, so the labour element would be very low.

Variations to rates of pay in the past using the analog system have been cumbersome, difficult to handle and difficult to achieve agreement.  I think other methods for varying the rates up or down should be examined.  The analog system is very difficult to handle.<br\/>Head 7 relates to cancellation of a registration, be it of a REO or a REA.  We have found it very difficult to get a REA cancelled.  We are seeking an easier method of trying to agree changes to the registered employment agreement or to get it cancelled.  A case went to the Supreme Court.  We feel that it should be easier to bring people together when all agree that the system is not working.<br\/>Head 8 deals with the adaptation of worker's contracts.  When the REA was in place, a contract of employment for the employees simply followed the lines of the agreement.  We suggest that the employment contract will follow the format of the agreement.<br\/>Head 9 refers to the publication of particulars in relation to employment agreements and right to obtain copies thereof.  We suggest that the publication of new employment agreement could be carried out by employer associations and trades unions; using the websites; and through the national newspapers.<br\/>Head 10 deals with breaches of a registered employment agreement.  We have a question on whether the Labour Court will be the means by which breaches of agreements will be heard.<br\/>Head 12 refers to definitions for the purposes of Part 11 of sectoral minimum rates of remuneration and other terms and conditions.  With regard to remuneration our members will have major difficulties agreeing to the proposals on travel time.  This has been a bone of contention for a long time, particularly where roads have improved.  It will take far less time to get to Monasterevin now than it took many years ago.  We have no problems with regard to subsistence and long distance travel.<br\/>We also think it is very important to state in the terms of the contract that 21 days are the agreed number of holidays in our industry.  The reason is that if companies are coming from other countries they may have only ten paid days holiday.  That would make a very big difference in the costing of a job.<br\/>Head 14 refers to submission to request terms and conditions relating to remuneration.<b><\/b>The term &quot;substantially representative of workers&quot; comes up time and time again.  We always have a great difficulty in trying to find where we lie on this and how it is achieved.  We would like to look at this issue deeply and have it clarified completely before this term can be fully expressed.<br\/>Head 15 refers to Labour Court recommendation.  AECI see three rates of pay applying to three different sectors in our electrical contracting industry.  We have played around with this many times because we feel there is a &quot;domestic&quot; &quot;commercial&quot; and an &quot;industrial&quot; market.  There may be something that we could consider.  We are convinced that one rate does not fit all. <br\/>Head 16<b><\/b>refers to the terms and conditions relating to sick pay, pension and mortality schemes.  This provision was included in the old REA, however more thought and time is required in this area to form a decision because it is a very heavy area and we need a great deal of time to consider it. <br\/>We will now jump to head 22, which relates to dispute settling provisions.  With regard to dispute procedure, we believe the recommendation should read &quot;any dispute at all&quot;.  I acknowledge that it singles out various way that a dispute should be handled but we believe that any dispute should go through the procedures as set out in head 22.<br\/>Head 25 refers to a review of order.  As mentioned in the head, we concur with the provision for a three year review.<br\/>Our final comment relates to head 27 compliance and enforcement provisions.<b><\/b>This is one of the most important elements of the proposed legislation.  We think the policing and enforcement of the legislation needs to be convincing as many efforts in the past have failed and we would like to know whether the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, or a similar body would carry this out.<\/p> <p>Whatever is put together with agreements is going to fall at this head if it is not enforced and policed properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014111800015#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Lundy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416321600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lundy and invite Mr. Smith to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014111800017#R00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416321600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I am the CEO of the National Electrical Contractors Ireland, NECI.  I thank the committee for affording us this important opportunity to make it aware of the opinions of our members regarding the proposed Bill.<br\/>NECI was founded in 2008 and we represent mostly smaller electrical contractors. Our members were significantly and negatively impacted by the previous registered employment agreement, REA. Despite the fact that we had no input into the 1990 agreement, and in fact were largely unaware of its very existence, large numbers of our members were brought before the Labour Court and forced to pay substantial back moneys to the construction workers pension scheme, CWPS, under its terms.  The demands for these back moneys, some of which sums were in excess of &euro;300,000, put many small contractors out of business.  The strain of dealing with the Labour Court led to ill health for many others, and in fact we know of two contractors who took their own lives following enforcement of the 1990 electrical REA by the Labour Court.<br\/>All this was happening when there were no complaints from the contractors' employees.  In fact it sometimes seemed to us that the sole purpose of the REA was to ensure compulsory membership of the CWPS.  When NECI set up a competing pension scheme, every attempt was made to discourage membership and undermine an alternate pension scheme.  It is a fact that nothing has changed in the 1990 electrical REA except upward pay rises in the 23 years of its existence. <br\/>NECI was at the forefront of the McGowan and others <i>v. <\/i>the Labour Court case which ultimately led to the Supreme Court declaring Part III of the 1946 Industrial Relations Act unconstitutional in its entirety.  We welcomed the decision of the Supreme Court.  We have been happily agreeing terms and conditions with our own employees on a one-to-one basis since 9 May 2013.  Despite scaremongering by the unions, the industry has not descended into chaos and we have not seen mass exploitation of electricians.  In fact contractors have, as was necessary, become more competitive and have used the flexibility they now have to streamline their operation.<br\/>Registered employment agreements by their very nature are inflexible and strangle companies when they need to adjust to meet demanding trading conditions.  It is our opinion that the REA system is anti-competition and borders on cartelism.  In an industry as diverse as the electrical contracting industry, it is universally accepted that a one size fits all agreement does not work.  NECI is of the opinion that the 1946 Industrial Relations Act in its entirety should be consigned to the industrial relations bin.  It has been amended a number of times, the last being in 2012, and is clearly not fit for purpose. The 1946 Act cannot deal with issues which exist in the Ireland of 2014.  The industrial relations landscape today includes issues which were inconceivable to the legislators in 1946.  If new legislation is required, and it is our opinion that it is not, it should be drawn up from scratch.<br\/>It is also our opinion that, while these global legally binding agreements might suit the large contractors who are forced to deal with unions, they are incompatible with small businesses which, in the main, employ non-union labour.  NECI reserves the right to agree terms and conditions with our own employees on a one-to-one basis.

We are also disappointed that the heads of the Bill do not refer to mandatory education of all employers and employees of any sector into which any global agreement is introduced.  The lack of education on the previous REA led to contractors being criminalised under the terms of an agreement of which they were unaware.<\/p><p>  We note that, once again, the proposals contain no provision for parties which are bound by an agreement into which they were allowed no input to apply to vary the terms of that agreement.

Apologies.<\/p><p>  Omitting names, the debate is on universal application.  The examples given were primarily on the basis that with the REAs in place we discovered breaches of not just the registered employment agreements, but of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997; the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 to 1993; the REA for the Electrical Contracting Industry; the Payment of Wages Act, 1991; the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994; and the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000.  The mechanism delivered by the registered employment agreements allowed us to address those.  While they are not directly covered by the registered employment agreement, the existence of this agreement allowed us to access these workers, uncover their story and remedy the situation.

I referred to R&uuml;ffert and Laval as two examples and Laval could highlight that there is a recognition of the right to collective bargaining, but in Ireland we hold the firm view that Supreme Court judgements have been detrimental and created a deficit in the recognition of collective bargaining rights.  That is why the union has taken the case.  The TEEU, in the absence of legislation supporting REAs, welcomes the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill as a means to at least restore some elements of workers' rights to an appropriate level of remuneration, sick pay and pension commensurate with their knowledge, skill and experience.<\/p><p>  We have highlighted some of the heads of Bill with minor alterations but our major concern is the significant deficiency in the Bill relating to the enforcement of the terms of the order.

The impact of the legislation would not be felt, and that would be detrimental to employers, workers, and all involved in the industries.<\/p> <p>We seek confirmation that the legislation or orders will apply to agency workers.

We primarily represent non-union and unemployed construction workers.  We have had dealings with some contractors and suppliers in the industry.  We believe the legislation is seriously flawed and will explain why.<br\/>Head 3 implies a representative group or groups will enter into a deal to create a registered agreement.  The previous legislation described those groups as comprising the unions and the employers.  This description is being removed in the Bill.  We are concerned that any <i>ad hoc<\/i>group could come together and describe itself as substantive in the industry and, therefore, together with some group on the employee side negotiate an agreement detrimental to the rights of construction workers.  We are concerned that many of the unions in the construction industry would find it very difficult to describe themselves as substantive because of the lack of membership in reality.  This can be challenged in court.  I will return to this.<br\/>Section 5 implies there is no longer to be a sectoral agreement.  The previous REA was a sectoral agreement that was legally binding on every employer in the industry, yet there was never any more than 20% or 25% of construction workers covered by it.  The new proposal is not as inclusive so the figure for coverage will be lower than 20% or 25%.<br\/>The Government decided to impose the relevant contracts tax at a sectoral level for the construction industry.  This is the scourge of all sections of the industry.  At present, there are 46,000 workers in the industry subject to relevant contracts and some 26,000 of them are on a tax rate of zero.  These people get their entire earnings paid to them at the end of every week but the Revenue Commissioners will chase them down after a couple of years.  However, they have mortgages, etc.  When chased down, they will have spent all the money and will have kept none to pay the tax.  This drives them into the black economy.<br\/>The Oireachtas made a change to the relevant contracts tax approximately ten years ago to the effect that before a worker became subject to it, he would have to sign a declaration stating he was self-employed and was to lose various rights.  The Revenue Commissioners, off their own bat, cancelled that arrangement so an employer can now register an individual online as self-employed without his permission.<\/p> <p>Revenue will write to an individual to outline the facts, such as who his or her employer is and how much the contracted rate is.  It will provide the names, etc.  It will give the person 30 days to make an objection if there is a problem with any of that information.  The individual is no longer expected to sign a declaration at the beginning.  We believe construction workers would not sign a declaration if they were allowed to choose whether to do so.  The Oireachtas introduced that choice, but Revenue off its own back decided to reverse it.  We met a group of unions in October of last year at a meeting organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  We were there as a consultative group for unemployed and non-union workers.  We questioned Revenue officials on this.  We asked them when this happened.  None of the unions could understand when this happened and neither could the Revenue officials.  They said they would get back to us but 12 months later, they have yet to do so.  We believe any agreement should be sectoral and should be industry-wide.  If an industry-wide agreement is not reached, this legislation will end up being nothing more than a fix-up.<\/p><p> We would call head 26 of the Bill the opt-out head.  A minimum wage is introduced as a minimum wage, but it always becomes the actual norm.  Under the registered employment agreement, before it went down, the rate of pay for a craft worker was reduced to &euro;17.21 an hour.  That was supposed to be a minimum wage, but it became the norm.  The rate of pay was &euro;17.21.  If there is an opt-out in legislation, it will become the norm regardless of any regulations that are provided for.  This is one of our concerns.  We are calling on the Oireachtas to set up a commission to look into the reality of what is going on in construction, as opposed to the fantasy that is being explained by the unions and the employers.  It is a fantasy.  The commission should look at below-cost tendering, relevant contract tax, sphere of influence agreements, the non-payment of contractors, workers and suppliers in the industry, and the effect on the industry of agency workers.<\/p><p> We have a problem with the question of what constitutes a representative group.  I have listened to what the Chairman said, so I will not name names here.  I would like to refer to a document that was handed to us by an employer in the industry.  It had been handed to him.  If one were to google the name of the company in question, one would find this material on the front page of its website.  I have a copy of that page with me.  An agency that is recruiting for work is giving this information to builders.  Among the claims listed on the website are that having \"No PRSI to pay\" saves 10.7%, \"No holiday pay to pay\" saves 8% and \"No Pension to pay\" saves 10% to 12%.  Reference is made to having \"No Bank holidays to pay\", \"No Sick Leave to pay\", \"No Redundancy payments to pay\" and \"No administration cost\".  It is claimed at the bottom of this list that the agency in question has the ability to engage and disengage workers anywhere in the country at one hour's notice.  I wonder whether a group of agencies could join together, claim to be a representative group and ask to be allowed to go to the Labour Court to organise such terms of employment as a registered employment agreement.  I suggest that could be done under the legislation being proposed because it is not between unions and that.  No one in this committee can say it could not be done.  They could represent themselves as a representative group.  While I am referring to an agency in Ireland, I believe agencies outside the State could join employers outside the State - they might be from eastern Europe or somewhere else - in coming to the Labour Court to register a registered employment agreement on similar terms.  That could legally happen under this legislation because it does not define what a substantive group is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014111800019#T00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned Costigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416323100,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Costigan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014111800020#U00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1416323100,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank all the groups for their presentations.

The previous 1946 legislation described a group of unions and the employer organisations as substantive.  We still believe that is basically true but there would have to be a change for this legislation.  On the employee side, the group of unions would have to come together with other groups outside the group of unions and come to a body which represents the employers, which includes other groups outside the employer organisations, and form a substantive group.  In other words, there would have to be pre-talks among both sides for them to establish that they are substantive.  I refer to the group of unions together with people outside the unions.  The vast majority of construction workers are members of our union.  There are 95,000 on the live register.  I have been unemployed for the past 12 months.  Who would represent me?  I am 54 years of age.  I have worked for 50 employers in the industry since I started my apprenticeship when I was 17 years old.  Who represents me in this respect?  In the absence of anybody else, I would represent myself in this respect, but I would insist that unemployed construction workers and non-union construction workers would have to be facilitated.  A mechanism to facilitate that would have to be put forward.<\/p><p>  It is up to the group of unions, which are the leaders on the workers' side to establish a body.  We have written to the Construction Industry Council on many occasions to be recognised at least as an observer group, but we have been continuously blanked on that request.  In terms of providing for that in this legislation, it will come down to the group of unions to say that they are substantive because they take account of the opinions of others and the same will apply to those on the employers' side.  Any employers who say they are a substantive group would have to take into consideration what I have read about the agencies, as they are employers too.  They would have to say that they are in their representative group, they have spoken to bodies such as agencies and they are now in a position to negotiate.  That is the only way in this industry one could envisage forming a grouping that would have any legal basis that would not be open to challenge and that would come under the proposed definition.  In our submission we are saying that such a definition was not put forward.  The members are asking other people for a definition and such a definition would have to involve the broadest possible group of people on both sides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014111800021#V00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned Costigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1416323700,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Calleary, I am concerned about the notion of substantial representation.

At the time, if I am not mistaken, there was a particular initiative relating to restaurants and NERA carried out a covert operation which required a lot of focus.  Construction goes on all day, every day and breaches have the potential to happen at any point in time.  Having people with a little knowledge of everything is not enough.  We need people who have their feet on the ground and who are able to engage with workers.  They must have a relationship with the order or the agreement to which an order might be attached, which is important.<\/p><p>  Previously, with registered employment agreements, we had a mechanism where union members, regardless of the particular union, could very easily revert back to whichever union they were in to question whether their entitlements were being breached.  The authors of the agreements on the one hand were the unions on behalf of workers, so they were in the best position to advise and then pursue the non-compliant contractors.  Our view on how to fix the situation might differ from other people but at least one other employer said at the meeting that NERA might not be the fix that is required because it does not have the capacity in terms of manpower and that it is not close enough as it cannot focus all the time on this one industry.

We asked Revenue about it and we were told that nobody could remember who did what.  We also put the same question to Deputies and they cannot remember either.

Six weeks into the project, I made a complaint to Contractors Administration Service, CAS which was appointed by the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, to monitor school building projects.  CAS sorted out the problem within five weeks and I received my full, backdated pay for the 11 weeks work I had done.  Had I gone to NERA, I would be sitting here today saying that I am still waiting for the issue to be sorted out by that authority.  It would never have happened.  <\/p><p> NERA has no role in construction because as an industry it is too fluid and the majority of employment in the sector is too short-term.   NERA does not even have a view on Relevant Contracts Tax, RCT, for example.  If representatives of NERA enter a site and find a worker there who is in the black economy, in other words, a worker who is working and signing on, it will not even inform the Department of Social Welfare.  It will do nothing about it because it has no role in that regard.  NERA has no role in the construction industry although it can be of assistance to workers in other sectors.  <\/p><p> The CAS model in the context of the school buildings programme in the Department of Education and Skills could be hardened up.

On 22 January when Dublin City Council last appeared before the committee regarding the Dublin waste-to-energy project, I made a detailed submission on the project's background and developments up to that date.  I do not propose to cover this material in my opening statement today.  I also advised the committee that the project could not proceed until the following issues had been successfully dealt with: the negotiation of a revised project agreement; a resolution in favour of the city council of the complaint to the European Commission on state aid grounds; a resolution in favour of the city council of the complaints to the European Commission on procurement grounds; and an assessment of the project by the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the issuing by same of a value for money letter in respect of it.  I also indicated that I would not sign the revised project agreement on behalf of Dublin City Council without first briefing elected members and considering their views on the project.<\/p><p>  I will address the issues in turn.  A revised project agreement negotiated between Dublin City Council and Dublin Waste to Energy Limited, the public-private partnership, PPP, company, was finalised in September 2014.  DG Competition of the European Commission issued a formal decision on the state aid complaint on 7 May 2014, concluding, \"The European Commission has found that a series of measures by the Dublin local authorities to participate in the Waste-to-Energy project in Poolbeg, Dublin, are in line with the EU state aid rules\".  The basis for the Commission's decision was that the project would be carried out on terms that would be acceptable to a private investor operating in a market economy.  The city council has also been advised by the European Commission that the latter is no longer pursuing any of the complaints that have been made against the Dublin waste-to-energy project on public procurement grounds.<\/p> <p>In line with the Department of Finance PPP guidelines, Dublin City Council engaged with the NDFA to enable it to assess the value for money associated with proceeding with the Dublin Waste to Energy project.  The NDFA in its capacity as adviser on the value for money associated with PPP projects issued a value for money letter in respect of the proposed Dublin Waste to Energy project on 4 September 2014. <\/p><p> A detailed briefing note on the Dublin Waste to Energy project was circulated to the elected members of the four Dublin local authorities.  It covered the revised project agreement, which is covered in my submission to the committee in Appendix 1; the Dublin Waste to Energy project in the context of EU and national waste management policy, which is dealt with in Appendix 2; projections for municipal solid waste in Ireland and the Dublin Waste to Energy gate fee, which is dealt with in Appendix 3; the economic benefits of the project, as set out in Appendix 4; and it presented the results of a cost benefit analysis of the Dublin Waste to Energy project, which is covered in Appendix 5.<\/p><p> The Dublin Waste to Energy project was considered by the elected members at a special meeting of the City Council on Monday 8 September 2014.  The project was also considered at meetings of other Dublin local authorities.  The project board met on 26 August 2014 and agreed to recommend the project.  The four Dublin local authority chief executives met on 17 September 2014 and agreed unanimously that the Dublin Waste to Energy project should proceed.  The revised project agreement and related documentation were signed on 19 September 2014. <\/p><p> Essentially there were two options facing the chief executives.  The first option was to abandon the project.  Under this option, the Dublin local authorities, DLAs, would have had to accept the loss of the expenditure that has already been incurred on the project, that is, &euro;97.4 million gross or &euro;85.3 million net after State aid.  In addition, the Dublin local authorities would be liable for significant compensation payments to Dublin Waste to Energy Limited in respect of the considerable costs it has incurred on the project.  The current market value of the site has been estimated at &euro;6 million.  Even after disposing of the site the overall net cost of option one to the Dublin local authorities is likely to be in the region of over &euro;100 million when the need to compensate Dublin Waste to Energy Limited has been taken into account.  In my report I have outlined the share accruing to the four Dublin local authorities.  We have estimated a total net cost of &euro;105 million and this would fall to be divided between the four local authorities.<\/p><p> The second option was to proceed with the project.  If the project proceeds then under the revised project agreement the full cost of constructing the Dublin Waste to Energy facility, estimated at about &euro;500 million, will fall to Dublin Waste to Energy Limited.  The project agreement contains an authority contingent obligation, ACO, clause under which the Dublin local authorities will provide partial revenue support for the first 15 years of operation of the plant in return for which they will share in the waste revenue stream, over a certain threshold, for 15 years.  The Dublin local authorities will also share in the energy revenue stream for the 45 year life of the project above a certain threshold. <\/p><p> The arguments that convinced the four Dublin local authority chief executives that they should proceed with the project are as follows.  The proposed facility has always been and remains entirely consistent with regional, national and EU waste management policy.  Current national waste policy is strongly supportive of the provision of the facility.  In addition to its importance in meeting waste management objectives for the new eastern and midlands waste region, the Dublin Waste to Energy project is crucial if the State is to meet landfill diversion targets, without being dependent on the export of municipal waste to overseas facilities.  It is also essential if Ireland is to meet the objectives of self-sufficiency and proximity, which are enshrined in the EU waste framework directive.  It it was clear from the RPS report, Dublin Waste to Energy Waste Market Assessment, which was circulated to the elected members and put in the public domain, that there should be more than sufficient residual municipal solid waste available for the facility to operate at its contracted capacity of 550,000 tonnes per annum, even after demanding EU mandatory recycling and landfill diversion targets are met.  The RPS analysis also provided a degree of confidence that the gate fee that will be achieved by the facility will ensure the threshold waste revenue figure is realised with the result that the authority contingent obligation mechanism will not operate and the Dublin local authorities will receive a share of both the waste and energy revenue of the facility over the first 15 years of its operation and will share in the energy revenue over the remaining 30 years.<\/p><p> The Dublin Waste to Energy facility has the support of major operators in the waste industry.  The project will generate significant employment, including 300 direct construction jobs and 100 direct jobs at the facility once it is operational.  It will make a major contribution to economic activity and generate significant tax revenue during both the construction and operating phases.  Aside from these economic benefits, the project will provide renewable energy and generate electricity sufficient to meet the equivalent needs of more than 80,000 homes annually, thereby helping to achieve the country&rsquo;s renewable energy goals.  The project will also finance a substantial community gain fund of more than &euro;10 million during the construction period and of up to &euro;0.6 million or &euro;600,000 per annum during the operation phase. <\/p><p> A cost benefit analysis of the two options facing the Dublin local authorities was undertaken by PwC.  This was circulated to the elected members and put in the public domain.   PwC estimated that the discounted value of the net benefits to the Dublin local authorities of selecting the second option, which is to proceed with the project, ranged between &euro;155 million and &euro;30 million depending on the assumptions used.  This compares with a certain loss associated with the first option, to abandon the project, of more than &euro;100 million.  The PwC analysis did not take account of the benefits associated with either the community gain fund or the payment of rates on the facility to the City Council which are substantial.  PwC concluded its analysis as follows: \"The potential financial returns the Dublin local authorities can expect to realise are high and the estimated financial risks of entering the Project Agreement are low. Thus, it seems to be rational for the Dublin Authorities to proceed to complete the renegotiated Project Agreement\".<\/p><p> The NDFA is the statutory agency charged with assessing the value for money associated with PPP projects such as the Dublin Waste to Energy project.  Following a detailed assessment, the NDFA issued a value for money letter in respect of the project on 4 September 2014.  The European Commission in its determination of the State aid complaint confirmed that the participation by the Dublin local authorities in the Dublin Waste to Energy project is on terms that would be acceptable to a private investor operating in a market economy.<\/p><p> Dublin City Council has selected a preferred bidder for the client&rsquo;s representative for construction and commissioning phases of the facility and has appointed CDM Smith on a fixed price lump sum fee of &euro;2.13 million for the 49 month construction and commissioning period.  I wish to correct an error in one of the appendices that estimates that cost at &euro;4 million; the actual price negotiated was &euro;2.13 million.  Dublin Waste to Energy Limited via its subcontractors mobilised to site on 22 September 2014 and construction of the facility commenced on 20 October 2014.  Facility construction is expected to take approximately three years, with commencement of operations targeted for late 2017.<\/p><p> Compared with the position I presented in December, significant progress has been made.  This project is now under construction and will meet a major need in terms of waste management infrastructure.  It will comply fully with the process laid down by the Oireachtas and the Department of Finance.  The project is under construction and I am very happy that is the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014111800003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Owen Keegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416320100,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Owen Keegan and the senior officials who are appearing before the committee.  The issue of the waste energy facility at Poolbeg is very important.  In his opening remarks Mr.  Keegan said that the meetings of the Dublin local authorities considered this matter.  I suggest to him that they could not have considered it because he went in and told them what he was going to do.  One cannot consider anything unless one has options such as to run with something or not to run with it.  The democratically elected councillors on the four Dublin local authorities were not given that option.  I ask Mr. Keegan to explain what he means by the word \"consider\".<\/p><p>  In respect of the project Mr. Keegan said it was substantial and that progress is being made.  I contend that progress is being made down the wrong road.  Household recycling rates are at an all-time high, having increased by 8% in the past few years up to 65%.  That is before one begins to talk about a reduction, which should be the first issue.  <\/p><p>  In regard to Covanta, the company involved with the project, perhaps Mr. Keegan would explain its safety record and whether he is satisfied with it, given the long list of transgressions by the company.  I have selected a few of these, for example, in respect of nickel emissions in Chester involving excessive toxic nickel and related compound emissions in November 2006.<\/p> <p>In September 2008, emission rates for dioxins and furins in Pittsfield exceeded by 250% the amount allowed.  In another case in 2008, the position was similar.  There were excessive dioxin emissions in Wellington in July 2007.  Newark fined Covanta excessive emissions in August 2008.  This violation included illegal carbon monoxide emissions.  In April 2009, the company was fined in West Wareham.  I am concerned that on the edge of the capital city, between the capital city and the sea, there is a company with such an appalling track record operating.  Despite all of these black marks on its book and serious breaches of regulations in the United States, Mr. Keegan might explain why he is happy with it.<br\/>Mr. Keegan stated that construction has started and there was a digger or JCBs on site, eventually, on 20 October.  There is almost &euro;100 million spent.  I have never heard a satisfactory explanation as to how one can spend &euro;100 million on a project without sticking a spade into the ground.  I have asked professionals in the construction sector about this and about projects of this scale, and how one would spend &euro;100 million without getting to the point where one had a machine on site.<br\/>My next concern relates to the volume of waste.  I note the terms of the contract set out for this project and I would have concerns about it.  I wonder has Mr. Keegan concerns.  In trying to come up with this 600,000 tonnes per annum, how many local authorities will it take to feed this large beast planned at Poolbeg?  From how far will the waste need to be drawn?  I try to get in and out of this city every day and I am aware of the difficulties, for traffic alone.  There will be heavy goods vehicles crisscrossing the city trying to deliver this waste unless it is flown in by helicopter and dropped in Poolbeg.  How will that traffic be managed?  How many local authorities will be involved, from how far afield will this waste be drawn and what traffic will be caused by this?<br\/>Given the volumes of waste and that companies will move more towards reduction of waste produced, coupled with the increasing rates of reuse and recycling, is Mr. Keegan certain that he will have the waste to feed this Poolbeg incinerator?  I note the penalties.  If one falls below the amount, the Dublin local authorities, DLAs, that is, rate payers and taxpayers in the Dublin region, will have to stump up to make up the shortfall.  The officials will put it into their annual budgets, but it is the DLAs where the charge on this will fall.  Has Keegan any concerns in that regard?<br\/>Mr. Keegan is steaming ahead with the project.  We live in a small country which supports promoting the food sector.  For example, Kerry Group is building a major plant not too far from here.  The volume of processed food being exported has increased.  We are trying to generate added value.  Surely it would be a good sales pitch to be able to state that such food is grown on an island that does not have municipal waste incinerators to dispose of waste.  Should we be moving more towards reduction, reuse and recycling, the same as they are doing in New Zealand which is a similar-sized country to ours with many similarities in terms of industry and the economy?  Should that not be the way to go instead of going headlong down this road?  Mr. Keegan might address that for me.<br\/>The Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in the early 2000s gave the managers the power to do this.  They provided for clusters of managers to come together and come up with these waste plans, and to push democratically elected councillors to one side.  In local elections in May last year the people elected councillors to the four local authorities.  The councillors were elected to the local authorities by their peers to do their best and their views have been completely marginalised.  I am at a loss to understand how Mr. Keegan can state that these councillors considered it.  They could not consider anything.  They have no power to consider anything.  Mr. Keegan and the other county managers merely put down a <i>fait accompli<\/i>in front of them.  He might explain that to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014111800004#C00200","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416320700,"counter":97,"content":"<p>We will get a few answers now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014111800005#D00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416320700,"counter":98,"content":"<p>On the first point, the reality is that I brought a report to the local authority members and I gave them a lot of information, particularly on the waste market.

It is fair to say a motion was put down, which was carried, advising me not to go ahead but that does not mean the matter was not considered.<\/p><p>  It was a decision of the Oireachtas, not of me as chief executive, that the power should be mine and other managers'.

In terms of Covanta's ability to operate the facility, it was assessed by both ourselves in the procurement process and the EPA for its ability to hold a licence.<\/p><p>  In terms of the volume of waste, the latest report from the EPA is that we landfill 1 million tonnes.  Mention was made of the waste hierarchy.  We are looking to move away from disposal.  The national policy is that we start to move up the hierarchy.  There has been a significant decoupling of waste generation from economic activity over the past number of years which is a positive development.  It is the first step on the hierarchy.  In the eastern-midlands region, according to the latest report, we landfill 650,000 tonnes per year.  In terms of the size of the facility and from where the volumes will come, it will be predominately from the eastern-midlands region.  The information shows that the waste volumes are there.  To date this year, the EPA has identified that we have exported probably 400,000 tonnes of waste.  The national policy is that we utilise waste as a resource and it is seen as the exporting of jobs.<\/p><p>  In terms of traffic, as mentioned by Deputy Stanley, predominantly the traffic will be through the strategic road network.

Since 2000 there has been quite a dramatic change in people's behaviour in the context of waste management.  Some of this has to do with the introduction of green bins, composting, etc.  It is clear that there has been a change since the notion of the incinerator was first mooted.  The first contract that was drawn up contained a guarantee in respect of the disposal of 600,000 tonnes per annum.  Does the new contract contain a similar number and, if so, what is it?  The first contract contained an obligation to pay if the amount of waste disposed of did not reach 600,000.  This is quite an important matter.  A new waste target was adopted by the EU in July in order to boost reuse and recycling levels in respect of municipal waste to a maximum of 70% by 2030.  The new Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, commented on this in September when he addressed the Environment Ireland conference and indicated that he endorsed the drive towards zero waste.  This would imply that Ireland will be moving towards achieving the 70% target by 2030.  Does the new contract sidestep the change that has been brought about in terms of recycling behaviour?  It appears to assume a rate of 50%, which would ensure that the disposal rate would remain above 600,000 tonnes.  I do not know what is the exact figure but I am sure our guests will supply it.  If the disposal rate moved towards 70%, then the other rate would be approximately 184,000 tonnes.  The latter would be substantially different from 600,000 tonnes.  Have our guests factored this in to their proposal?<\/p><p>  Have they also factored in the position regarding the new mechanical and biological treatment plant proposed for my constituency?  I do not believe people are ever happy to see such plants being built, regardless of where they are located.  However, it is proposed that the facility will dispose of approximately 100,000 tonnes of waste per year.  It appears that as waste is going to be transported into Dublin for disposal, other waste will be transported out of it to facilities invarious counties.  This was the case with the Kill landfill facility, the waste deposited in which predominately originated in Dublin.  Will what I have outlined have an impact upon the financial viability of the project we are discussing?<\/p><p>  Mr. Keegan was county manager of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council at one point.  Was he party to the combined approach adopted when the first proposal was put forward?  It seems that the approach could be abandoned or that it could be proceeded with.  Obviously, a great deal of consideration had to be given to this matter in view of the fact that a sizeable amount of money has already been spent.  Some of the money involved would have been spent on consultants and it may be that a portion of the information provided by the latter remains valid but that much of it is no longer up to date and not capable of being used.  Will Mr. Keegan comment on that matter?  If our guests were to start with a clean sheet and if they were not obliged to consider whether to proceed with or abandon the project, would they propose this particular initiative?  If so, why are they of the view that it is the best solution available in the context of dealing with waste?<\/p><p>  People are composting material and the amount of packaging, etc., relating to products is being reduced.  We are, therefore, moving into different territory.  If the 70% target to which I refer is attained, how much waste will be disposed of at the new facility?<\/p><p>  A large amount of money was given to RPS, the main consultancy firm.  I accept that a different consultancy is currently being used.  Is the &euro;2.13 million the entire amount of money that will be spent on consultants or will further expenditure be required?  It was originally envisaged that the total cost relating to RPS would be &euro;8.1 million.  However, the final figure exceeded this amount by some way.  Is a cap in place with regard to the amount of money to be spent on consultants?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014111800006#E01300","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1416321300,"counter":113,"content":"<p>We will obtain a few answers for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014111800006#E01400","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1416321300,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I have one more question.

One of these is that we are no longer active in the household waste collection market.  It was considered, therefore, that allowing the put-or-pay clause to remain in place would be inappropriate.  As a result, this was renegotiated into an authority contingent obligation whereby we underpin the waste market revenue of the facility and guarantee - or partly guarantee - it up to a certain level.

O'Sullivan, is now guaranteeing that this incinerator can cater for up to 600,000 tonnes per annum of waste, with householders and taxpayers in the four local authority areas in Dublin having to make up the shortfall and pay any penalties arising in respect of the ACO.  Are the witnesses not concerned about this?  Perhaps they would comment on the initial proposal to have eight incinerators, one of which was to be located in Laois-Offaly-north Tipperary which has a population of in the region of 200,000 to 250,000 people.

We are also delighted to see the others in the Public Gallery.  I remind members and our guests to switch off their mobile telephones.  It is not sufficient to put them on silent mode; they must be switched off completely.  Otherwise, they can interfere with the recording equipment.  Today's proceedings are being broadcast live on the Internet and we do not want interference with that.<br\/>On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Noelle O'Connell of European Movement Ireland, EMI.  She is joined by Councillor Neale Richmond, also of EMI.  Ms O'Connell will address the committee on EMI's 2013 accountability report.  As members know, EMI is an independent, not-for-profit, membership-based organisation that works to develop the connection between Ireland and Europe.  It has published a number of accountability reports previously, tracking Ireland's engagement with the EU at a number of levels, and each year suggests areas in which improvements can be made.  The report has been described as a score card on key areas of Ireland's engagement and I welcome an opportunity to discuss it.  I am particularly interested in a discussion of this committee's engagement.  The report examines the number of meetings that we have every year, attendance at same, whether Ministers appear before us at pre-General Affairs Council meetings, etc.  The report is a useful summary of the committee's work and I look forward to discussing it.<br\/>Before commencing, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise, comment on or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  If they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular subject and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br\/>I invite Ms O'Connell to address the committee on EMI's latest accountability report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111800004#C00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416319800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs for the opportunity to present to it.  I have had the pleasure of appearing before it a number of times previously and am pleased to be invited to discuss EMI's fourth accountability report, which tracked the 2013 calendar period.<\/p><p>  As the Chairman pointed out, EMI is Ireland's longest established not-for-profit, voluntary membership-based organisation dealing with Irish-European affairs, having been founded in 1954.  We celebrated our 60th birthday this year.  For more than 60 years, we have strived to provide a robust, fair and reasoned voice on European matters in Ireland through increasing awareness and understanding of European issues.  In keeping with our founding aims, we are committed to increasing engagement by Irish people with the EU and the promotion of transparency and accountability at Irish and European levels.<\/p><p>  Our accountability campaign is one of our organisation's flagship advocacy programmes.  Through it, we aim to measure Ireland's engagement with Europe at a number of levels, offering a comparison between Ireland's performance with that of our European counterparts and providing context in which to base the findings and evaluate the results.  It is a report card on how our Government, national politicians and MEPs engage in EU affairs.  It is an evolving, living project that is continually updated, as we have incorporated feedback and input from readers of the report on an ongoing basis since its inception in 2010.<\/p> <p> Throughout 2013 we tracked 18 key indicators in four areas to measure accurately Irish engagement with the EU.  Building on the previous three editions of the report, this year we utilised our growing database to expand by providing a comparative analysis of Ireland's performance in a European context over the course of four consecutive years.  Time constraints today prevent me from going through in detail every finding in the 70 page report, but we will send members an updated report in due course following an internal reclassification of some of the figures.<\/p><p> As part of our methodology a key aspect of these 18 indicators, about which I will speak in greater detail, is that they have a statistically verifiable character.  To add a caveat to the interpretation of such data, and in recognising our accountability report is not without its limitations, I will recall the words of Albert Einstein, \"not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts\".  Through the accountability report we measure work which is on the record and publicly available, and which can be statistically verified and tracked in as timely a manner as possible.  That said, much work done is not quantifiable and therefore cannot be included in our analysis, which we recognise throughout the report.  In addition, as I am sure I do not have to remind distinguished members of the committee, our accountability report took place against the backdrop of an incredibly busy and productive 2013, as Ireland held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU for the seventh time as well as 2013 being designated European year of citizens.  As the report relies solely on data in the public domain, applying this health warning is a useful precaution in interpreting parliamentary and institutional statistics of the type under review, but it is not a reason to refrain from observing and commenting on the available data.<\/p><p> Ireland's engagement with the EU is deep, complex and multifaceted.  European Movement Ireland believes strongly that our accountability work, which continues to evolve over the years, is important in shedding light on and working to explain Irish engagement at EU level.  We look forward next year to presenting a five-year benchmarking fact on our accountability report findings over the five years we have tracked and measured this engagement since 2010.<\/p><p> For the purpose of my presentation this afternoon, our 2013 report focuses on the following four pillars which form the key chapters of the report: pre-legislative input, where we look at European commission consultations; the European Parliament; the Oireachtas; and the European Council and councils of the EU.<\/p><p> A total of 99 Commission consultations were initiated by the various Directorates General of the Commission, which had a closing date for submission during the 2013 calendar year.  European Movement Ireland tracked all 99 and analysed the geographical origin of the submissions to establish the rate and number of Irish submissions and evaluate Irish input at the pre-legislative stage of EU policy formation.  Of the 99 Commission consultations, 60 were suitable for evaluation and inclusion in the report.  This is due to the fact only 60 of the 99 consultations provided information regarding the geographical origin of submissions and thus we were in a position to analyse and establish the rate of Irish submissions.  In the 60 consultations we reviewed for our accountability report, the percentage of the total submissions originating in Ireland during 2013 ranged from 0% to 6.25% with an average of 1.1%.  This average of 1.1% represents a decrease of 0.3% from the 2012 average of 1.4%.  I apologise for the many statistics I will give to committee members this afternoon.<\/p><p> European Movement Ireland recommends a consistent methodology be employed throughout all Commission Directorates General for the purposes of tracking and classifying these consultation submissions and their geographical origin.<\/p> <p>We believe this would have a significant impact on the accountability and transparency of the Commission consultation system.  In fact, more accessible and thorough knowledge of the origins of these submissions might also help to increase the number of submissions by creating awareness among member states regarding their national contribution levels.  With Commission consultations ranging from state aids to reforming the structure of the EU banking sector to a 2030 framework Green Paper on climate and energy policies, from an Irish perspective there is a clear opportunity to have a stronger input at this stage of the European legislative procedure.  EM Ireland looks forward to playing a leading role in facilitating this enhanced engagement.<br\/>Turning to the European Parliament, complete attendance records for all MEPs is available from documentation published on the website of the European Parliament, whose records we use to measure the attendance of Irish MEPs at European Parliament plenary sessions.  The individual websites of Irish MEPs and <i>votewatch.eu<\/i>were also consulted for, first, information regarding MEP roles within their political groupings and within the parliament; second, attendance at European Parliament plenary sessions; third, parliamentary questions asked; and, fourth, speeches made.  However, for calculation purposes, we relied solely on information that was made public by the European Parliament.<br\/>We found that average Irish MEP attendance at plenary sessions of the European Parliament during 2013 was 93%, which represents an increase of 10% on the 2012 attendance rate of 83%.  Indeed, it is the highest since we began tracking this.  Irish MEPs asked a total of 384 parliamentary questions in 2013, which is a 15.6% reduction from the 455 questions raised in 2012.  During 2013, Irish MEPs made a total of 890 speeches in plenary sessions of the European Parliament, an increase of 143.8% compared to the 2012 figure of 365.  During 2013 there was Irish representation on 14 of the European Parliament's 20 standing committees and on the parliament's special committee.  Average Irish MEP attendance at the meetings of their designated committees in 2013 was 42%, a drop from the 2012 figure of 76%.<br\/>With regard to Oireachtas engagement, throughout 2013 European Movement Ireland attended every public meeting, not private, of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  Attendance at these meetings was tracked by the EM Ireland staff member in attendance, who also drafted a summary report of the committee's discussion for circulation.  Official committee reports available from the Oireachtas website were also reviewed.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs met 35 times in public during 2013, with the average attendance rate of committee members at 56%.  This represents a decrease of 8% from the 2012 attendance rate of 64%.  Obviously, committee attendance is calculated on a composite average basis, which tends to skew the figures somewhat in terms of some members' attendance at this committee.  I thank and pay tribute to the members for attending this meeting today.<br\/>According to the programme for Government, Ministers are obliged to appear before their respective committees or before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs prior to travelling to Brussels for meetings of the Council of the EU, where decisions are made.  For the 2013 accountability report, we examined the minutes of all Oireachtas committee meetings that took place in 2013 to establish whether and when pre and post-Council briefings took place.  Pre or post-Council briefings took place in respect of eight of the ten General Affairs Council, GAC, meetings that took place in 2013, which represents a total of 80% and an increase of 16% on the 2012 rate of 64%.  Of the 71 Council meetings that took place during 2013, some 33 or 46% had pre or post-Council briefings before the relevant Oireachtas committee.<\/p> <p> Attendance by Irish representatives and by representatives of other EU member states at 2013 meetings of the European Council and the various formations of the Council of the European Union, was tracked using the official attendance lists of each of these Council meetings.  These lists are made available as part of the Council press release and are published online following the conclusion of these meetings.  This information is also regularly released on the website of the Council of the European Union.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, attended all the European Council meetings which took place throughout 2013 and this 100% attendance rate has been consistent since the first European Movement Ireland accountability report in 2010.  The average Irish ministerial attendance rate at 2013 meetings of the Council of the European Union was 99% which is an increase of 2% on 2012, where the Irish ministerial attendance was 97%.  Last year is the highest Irish ministerial attendance rate since European Movement Ireland began tracking this engagement in its inaugural 2010 accountability report.  Ireland ranked joint first alongside Greece and Lithuania in terms of average ministerial attendance at meetings of the EU Council in 2013.  While we cannot speculate too deeply into the reasons behind some of the comparative shifts in the indicators, it is worth noting that in the first half of 2013, as I mentioned previously, Ireland held the rotating Presidency of the EU Council, which may have played a part in Ireland having overall best attendance record at meetings of the European Council and Councils of the EU throughout 3013, alongside our fellow Presidency partners of Greece and Lithuania.<\/p><p> One of the principal aims of European Movement Ireland is to facilitate debate and to provide information on the Irish EU relationship.  This report does this by analysing the level of transparency and accountability at both national and European level so that Irish citizens have an opportunity to see how we are being represented in Europe by our elected officials.<\/p><p> As we publish this report during 2014 it would be remiss of me not to mention briefly the recent May 2014 European Parliament elections.  As the distinguished members of this committee will no doubt be aware, voter turnout in those European Parliament elections was 52.4%, down from 58.6% in 2009.  This means that for whatever reason approximately 1.5 million voters here did not give a mandate to our elected representatives in Europe.  This is not a surprise but we should be worried about it.  Membership of the European Union, while not without its faults, has generally been positive for Ireland.  Social progress such as the ending of the marriage bar and the decriminalisation of homosexuality, along with far-reaching protections for consumers and the right for us as EU citizens to travel, study, live and work freely in other member states, can sometimes pale in recollection.<\/p><p> European Movement Ireland believes that our society needs a broad and dynamic discussion about our place in the European Union, one which recognises that we can and should be the authors of our own destiny in Europe.  European Movement Ireland's accountability report, which we are very pleased to present before this committee, offers a way of scrutinising some of the dimensions of this crucial relationship, now and in the future.  <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for inviting us to present our 2013 report.  We look forward to dealing with comments and questions from members of the committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111800004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416320700,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Connell for a very comprehensive introduction to the annual report.  I agree with her that we need a discussion about Ireland's role within Europe.  It was very disturbing to see the turnout rate for the European elections dropping to just over 50% and the election was held on the same day as the local elections.  I note that the turnout rate across Europe was lower still and below 20% in some countries. Therefore, the problem is not unique to Ireland but we need to have a debate about how to ensure a greater level of involvement by citizens in European affairs.<\/p><p>  The UCC European Society will be joining the committee in private session after this meeting.  We hope to discuss the issue of engagement and involvement in Europe by young people in particular.<\/p> <p>We have been a member of the European Union for 40 years and many of us - many of the new generation - take for granted the benefits that have emanated from our membership.  Freedom of movement is seen as something that was always there, but it was not.  It only became available through our membership of the European Union.  It would be useful to talk later to our guests about that.<\/p><p> Is this accountability report an exercise done by the European Movement in other European countries?  If not, why not?

I always find it rather interesting.  I hope I do not repeat my questions of last year.  It is noteworthy that European Movement Ireland is an independent organisation.  I will play devil's advocate.  How do we know it is independent?  It has a private membership system.  We do not know who the members are or how many there are.  Ms O'Connell could be speaking to us on behalf of an organisation that has a grand sounding name but might have ten members.<\/p><p>  I applaud Ms O'Connell on saying that European Movement Ireland looks forward to playing a leading role in facilitating this enhanced engagement with NGOs, unions, parliamentarians, etc.  As a parliamentarian, I have been intimately involved in trying to research a trade agreement involving the EU, Colombia and Peru.  It involves considerable research with much mystery over how we, as parliamentarians, engage with the issues that are being initiated by the Commission and on which we, as a nation, must ultimately sign off.  I have a particular interest in the Colombian end of the thing; we do not know anything about Peru.  We are waiting for Ireland to ratify it, but before ratifying it I have many questions to ask.<\/p><p>  This committee has debated with professionals the very important issue of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership.  I remember being rather surprised that the presentation we got was being presented to us as wonderfully exciting and progressive and that Ireland should support it.  The report we were presented with, however, was produced by the London School of Economics, if my memory serves me right.  I would never castigate that institution - my daughter went to the London School of Economics and it is a wonderful college - and I would not question its figures.  However, does Ms O'Connell believe it is right to present to parliaments a singular opinion on the benefits of TTIP?  Does European Movement Ireland play a role in facilitating the debate on such trade agreements?<\/p><p>  The figures are fantastically exciting.  We emigrate so much and travel so much - our Ministers love to travel - and hence the 99% attendance record.  If those figures are analysed, however, there is one bold boy who basically drags down the status of the other Ministers.  I note the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government only has a 75% attendance whereas every other Minister were in attendance for 100% of the time.  Rather than saying that the average attendance was 99%, which denigrates the Ministers who were there 100% of the time, it might have been important to state that one Minister let the side down by not being in attendance 100% of the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111800008#G00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1416321000,"counter":169,"content":"<p>In the same manner, rather than cite the attendance at this committee as being 54% - I am looking at familiar faces today - it might be useful to cite the attendance rates of individuals, which might help to encourage attendance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111800008#G00300","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1416321300,"counter":170,"content":"<p>That is the problem with you in the Chair and me on the side lines.

It is not the same as it is in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>It would be helpful to include an explanation regarding the procedures because it is not the case that one can ask a question every week and it would be helpful to clarify that.<\/p><p> As for the second issue regarding attendance at meetings and as someone who served on three or four different joint committees, one thing one must do - this is the record of the European Parliament - is physically to sign the book each time one attends a committee meeting.  In any one day, it would not be unusual to have anything up to ten to 15 different meetings during the course of the day from 9 a.m. onwards.  Moreover, when the parliament is sitting in Strasbourg, it sits until midnight.  This is not simple and incidentally, if one does not have a set number of attendances at committee meetings, one is not entitled to speaking time in parliament, that is, to be listed as one of the speakers in parliament on a particular topic.  Consequently, one must keep a record of committee attendances.  While Ms Noelle O'Connell will be able to give the joint committee more details on how this works, it is an issue.  There are repercussions arising from not having attendances at meetings and it is important to clarify this point.<\/p><p> As for the 56% attendance at meetings, the big problem members have from a European point of view is the number of committees that exist and one should remember there are sub-committees within committees.  For instance, in the case of foreign affairs, there also is the human rights sub-committee.  Another issue that is not included concerns the number of motions that members can put down.  That figure is not included but it is useful information as it is an effective method.  On the human rights sub-committee, for instance, one can table emergency motions.  I remember the very first motion I signed back in 2007 was about the opening up of the entire government procedure in Burma or Myanmar, as it is now.  Little did I think that within five years, the very motion we had put to the parliament in 2007 would actually come true in real terms.  Such motions had and continue to have fairly substantial consequences internationally.  Likewise, I was involved in a number of motions pertaining to Gaza and similar areas.<\/p><p> I refer to one issue on which the report is interesting and on which it contains much useful information.  I am unsure whether European Movement Ireland wishes to consider the issue regarding European Union directives, about which I have a major concern.  Once they are passed and signed off at European level, the timescale given to Oireachtas Members to implement them is 30 months from that point.  Has Ireland's record in respect of transposing them and putting them into operation here ever been considered?  For instance, I am concerned about one such directive, in which I was directly involved, pertaining to cross-border health care.  It finally was signed off in February 2011 but it now is 2014 and my understanding is that it still has not been processed through the system here.  We are leaving ourselves open in this regard.  To explain to the Chairman, this pertains to cross-border health care, that is, the right to travel to another member state for health care if such health care is not available in one's own country or if there is undue delay.  It is an extremely important directive and is about making sure that people have access to health care right across Europe.  While it is an important directive, this is about the monitoring of Ireland's own performance with regard to following through on directives and that also would be useful from this committee's perspective.  What is Ireland's record in this regard?  What is the timescale for the average directive or regulation to come through the Irish system?  This is a subject that members might consider in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111800009#H00600","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416321600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>First, I thank the witnesses for their report and I am glad that at its very outset they made the distinction between a quantitative analysis, of that which can be quantified, rather than a qualitative analysis.  For example, I was struck by the high level of attendance at 93%.  Did the witnesses ever track how many people went into a meeting and remained there for its entirety, as opposed to going in, registering their attendance and then leaving?  That would be my concern.  This obviously is something the European Movement has been doing for four years.<\/p> <p>To what extent are people playing the witnesses' game, so to speak, by registering their presence?<\/p><p> The witnesses referred to attendance.  Is that attendance and voting because I understand voting takes place in a bloc?  Do they track the voting records as well as the attendance records?<\/p><p> Regarding speeches, if I understand correctly, the average European Union parliamentary speech is one minute.  We need to be clear about what we are talking about when it comes to quantity and quality.<\/p><p> I was more interested in some of the other figures.  The number of Irish rapporteurs, for example, is quite good at six in comparison with one in 2010.  The number of opinions by Irish rapporteurs went from nine in 2010 down to three, and has been consistently low for the past number of years.  What is the reason for that?<\/p><p> My colleague, Senator Burke, raised what I would call the dramatic drop in attendance at parliamentary committees from 76% to 42%.  That is more a qualitative indicator.  My memory of the European Parliament and parliamentary committees is that parliamentary committees take more engagement than plenary sessions.  Have the witnesses examined the reason that would have been the case in terms of the drop in attendance at the parliamentary committees?<\/p><p> In terms of a qualitative-quantitative approach, have the witnesses done what I would call more soft data analysis of the statistics?  For example, regarding the performance of MEPs, do they track their engagement with media?  Do they track, in so far as they can, their engagement with the public, in other words, any public meetings they may hold?  Do they give them the facility to give them that type of information?  Do they invite them to give them that type of information?  It would be very interesting to know not the 93% of them who can come in and press a button and register their attendance but how they are engaging with their electorate, and the methods they are using to engage with their electorate.  For example, to what extent has the use of social media changed since the witnesses started tracking these data?<\/p><p> Taking a more broad-based approach, as the witnesses did towards the end of their presentation, about the values of Europe to the citizen, to what extent do they believe there may be a certain disenchantment with the slow progress we are making on social Europe and in particular the extent to which people are fatigued by austerity?<\/p><p> The witnesses are commenting on the drop in the number of people voting in EU elections.  Again, to what extent is that to do with the rapid pace of enlargement and the fact that people cannot, for the sake of argument, name all 28 members of the Union?  Also, to what extent do the witnesses think the growth of, say, euroscepticism in the United Kingdom and the wider debate on whether the UK will remain a member of the Union is having an effect on the broader enthusiasm for the European project in Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111800010#J00200","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416321900,"counter":179,"content":"<p>To follow up on the input from other members, the witnesses said the accountability campaign is one of their flagship advocacy programmes.  If we look at any statistics on that we could balance them either way.  The difficulty with all of this is that people become defensive and say they have a reason they were not there and so on.  I am probably one of the worst attenders at these meetings but I can look at myself in the mirror and justify where I am in that regard.  I am not swanning off somewhere else.  I may be at another meeting or whatever but when I do come along to the meetings, I try to have an input into them.

The Government represents the consensus within Parliament rather than the views of one party or another.  Part of the process involves engagement with the Leader of the Opposition and other spokespersons.  We do not have the same engagement in the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in terms of the Taoiseach and members exchanging views on before and after the Council meetings.  Perhaps that is something that could be considered.  In other parliaments throughout the European Union one has such engagement and in some cases even direction coming from the committees on European affairs or foreign affairs.  I accept the systems are different but the mechanism should involve much more engagement.  It is important for us to beef up the engagement that takes place.  I do not say we do not have any interaction but it could be broadened.<\/p><p>  The election of European Union Commissioners must be transparent.  People perceive there to be a democratic deficit and are disillusioned with the system.  The manner in which we select the Commissioner could be examined.  The European Parliament brings Commissioners in and questions them, but we do not have such a mechanism.  One could argue that even if the issue were put to a vote, given the Government&rsquo;s majority the outcome would be a foregone conclusion.  However, there should be a mechanism involving engagement with the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs or the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  That would promote accountability and transparency and be a much more inclusive process.<\/p><p>  Those are some of the impressions I got from reading the report.  There is much that we can do.  In terms of accountability we always fall back on the position that we are not happy with the scrutiny of matters coming from Europe.  That is something we tried to improve in terms of this committee and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  However, we would all accept that we can improve on it.  I would welcome much more engagement from groups and others who attend such meetings and who have a view on how we could improve our system of accountability in terms of how the system operates.<\/p><p>  I can envisage journalists already writing that so-and-so does not attend certain meetings.  It does not make much difference.  When we were councillors there was criticism about people attending conferences.  People turned up for the day and signed in.  They were at the meeting, mar dhea.  What is important is the quality of input at meetings.  In fairness, no one of whom I am aware who is a member of a committee does not make an input.  There is engagement from everyone.  One could criticise Parliament for lack of engagement but people have their own style in terms of how they engage or operate.<\/p> <p>There has been talk with regard to public relations and other elements.

I thank our guests for coming before us and giving us their usual report on the respective activities.  There are a number of points we need to keep in mind in the context of this country's situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>many of our European colleagues.  We probably have the most tested democratic system of voting of an any European country.  Only Australia has a more intricate voting system of proportional representation, which is the ultimate in terms of democracy because everybody has an opportunity to voice their opinion and their second, third, fourth, fifth and tenth opinion, if necessary.  That does not apply in other countries where they have varying lists of systems to which they refer as time goes by.<br\/>In terms of how we manage the time available, I have no experience of the European Parliament but I am sure it probably organises its schedule of meetings in such as way as to ensure that three or four of them are not scheduled at the same time, which, unfortunately can occur in the scheduling of committees of these Houses, which results in our being expected to be in three or four places at the same time.  Two consequences emanate from that.  One is that it is impossible to give adequate consideration to the subject matter under discussion and the second is that Members find it intensely frustrating to have to move in two or three directions at the same time.  As in the case of the European Parliament, it is not unusual for these Houses to have 15 or 20 meetings scheduled in the course of a day, which Members are supposed to attend but they find themselves being dragged in varying directions and it distorts their interests at a  particular time.  <br\/>We can talk ourselves to death in the context of debate but we need to ask ourselves are we making progress and achieving a result in line with our objectives.  There are more opportunities now for discussion in national parliaments throughout Europe through the various committees that there has ever been in the history of Europe and yet there is a growing degree of Euroscepticism.  During the course of Ms O'Connell's examination has she identified what might be a contributory  factor to the growing degree of Eurospecticism?  My colleague prompted an interesting question when he referred to the European fiscal stability treaty referendum, which our people supported, thereby giving a mandate to the country to adopt a particular stance which subsequently has often been questioned.  That prompts the question: of what are we in favour?  Do we create confusion, are we an enigma in the sense that we decide one thing today and maybe something different tomorrow or, to what extent, has Ms O'Connell been able to identify a lack of connectivity and continuity in our thinking and theory as a nation with respect to the European institutions?<br\/>Different countries have different systems but I believe our system is the best.  I firmly believe ours is the most democratic system; it cannot be beaten.  It is counterbalanced all the way along the line by proportional representation.  The question that arises is: how do we view other national committees and their influence on the European Parliament?  We had a visit of the Swedish parliamentary delegation and Swedes direct their delegations and Ministers.  The is the way their system works.  They are entitled to have that system but I do not agree with it and I believe ours is a better one.<\/p> <p>We charge our Ministers and elected representatives to the House of Parliament with the responsibility of pursuing a particular programme.  They are accountable afterwards if they do not do what they said they would do in that context.  To what extent have comparisons been made of the extent to which EU member states relate to the European institutions and <i>vice versa<\/i>and how does Ireland compare in terms of public perception of those institutions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111800013#M00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416322800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for the report, which is extraordinarily positive.  Chapter 3 is particularly relevant in an Irish context.  It should be highlighted and emphasised that the average Irish ministerial attendance at 2013 meetings of the Council of the European Union was 99%.  Ireland is joint first with Greece and Lithuania in this regard.  Also, 39 out of ten Council configurations had an Irish ministerial attendance rate of 100%.  The Taoiseach attended all of the meetings of the European Council which took place in 2013.  That is an extraordinary result, with which we should be very happy and proud of.  As a Government Deputy, I am very happy that our commitment in this regard has been delivered.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Durkan's comments in regard to our system being preferable to that of other countries representatives of which are confined by parliamentary or committee decisions.  While they should take cognisance of those decisions they should not be conclusively bound by them.  The performance of our MEPs is very heartening.  The average attendance of our MEPs, who represent all political groupings, at plenary sessions of the European Parliament during 2013 was 93%, and during 2013 they asked 384 parliamentary questions.  While that is a slight decrease in the number of questions asked in 2012 it is still a substantive number.  There was also a 143% increase in the number of speeches made by Irish MEPs.  The cynical interpretation might be that an election was imminent.  Despite this and cynicism aside, performance levels, measured against any objective criteria, are high.  That is good.  <\/p><p>  Oireachtas input is also good.  The less than stellar attendance at this committee can be reflected in the fact that responsibility for European scrutiny has transferred to the sectoral committees.  This means that where issues arising out of directives or European legislation impact on one's constituency or a particular sector of the economy one is more likely to go to the sectoral committee to have it addressed.  This tends to have a more abstract quality now, albeit very relevant.<\/p><p>  Like Deputy Durkan I will have to leave the meeting soon.  While I hope to return later I will also read the transcript of today's committee proceedings in terms of witnesses' responses.  I was taken by the comment that we do not have enough popular engagement around the country in terms of public meetings.  A mutual friend of Councillor Richmond and I, who is a particular opponent of this process and who achieves much in his sphere of influence, regularly holds meetings about Europe, including meetings to commemorate European Day etc.  I am interested in hearing how the witnesses think we could popularise Europe, including through the use of the town hall meeting concept and so on.  Getting people at local level engaged is a challenge.  I suspect it is a challenge in every European country.  That is the only critique of the report which I believe is worth looking at.<\/p> <p>Otherwise, I see the report as great news.  I prefer a situation where we have a PR system in Ireland and a multi-seat constituency, albeit with its own difficulties.  Senator Reilly and I compete - it is friendly competition - in one of those situations.  However, that is preferable to a list system where some great mandarins and some centralist bureaucracy in Dublin decide who will represent the constituencies.  It is much better that it is organic and generic, that it comes up from the people and that the people decide, albeit with the limitations of our system.  Deputy Durkan is right.  We have the best democratic system in Europe.  <\/p><p> I am delighted with the performance of our Ministers and our Taoiseach.  The performances of our MEPs across the board - of all parties - are stellar also and we should be proud of them.  I am also happy with the make-up of our committee given the limitation I pointed out and given the other limitations.  I do take the criticism as valid and I am interested in direction, assistance and advice on how we might address the issue of town hall involvement and public meetings discussing European issues. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111800014#N00200","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416323100,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy O'Reilly.

We are very proud of the accountability report and we are continuing to develop it as I mentioned as we benchmark it next year for five years' work and research.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputy Byrne for his questions.  He mentioned our membership in terms of our organisation and this is an excellent question.  The organisation was founded in 1954.  We have members who are students.  I wish to pay special tribute to the Europa Society from UCC.  I was a very active member, back in the day, as a UCC student.  I wish to congratulate the society on its excellent conference in UCC last week.  We were delighted to be involved in it.  We are not secretive about our membership.  It ranges from individuals, students, NGOs, public representatives, SMEs, and corporates to multinationals - people who believe we need a robust debate about Ireland's place in Europe and that we as an organisation serve an important role in that.  I am pleased to confirm that we have, thankfully, more than ten members.  If one looks at our website, we list and go through this in our accounts and our annual report goes into this in greater detail. <\/p><p>  The transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, and the trade agreements Deputy Byrne mentioned are a key focus and aspect of our work programme for this year.  We have organised two conferences on TTIP.  The trade agreements that the EU is engaged in are hugely important.  We see our role very much as facilitating debate and engagement at these events.  For example, Deputy Breen spoke at one of the events.  The former US Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade also spoke at one of those events.  Catherine Day, Secretary General of the European Commission, spoke as well.  It is correct that we need to have more debate and dialogue and we are very strongly of the view that needs to take place.<\/p> <p>We are working very hard to promote and encourage it.<\/p><p> Deputy Byrne referred to the ministerial attendance rate and it was picked up by some of the other speakers and by Deputy McHugh.  We mention in the report that the particular environmental Council meeting clashed with the day of the budget but that Council meeting was attended by senior officials from the permanent representation. <\/p><p> Senator Hayden touched on the point about attendance at Oireachtas committee meetings.  We do not individualise the attendance at Oireachtas committee meetings; it is not our role but we study it.  As I mentioned in the reply to questions and as Deputy Durkan outlined, we are very aware of the challenges and the workload and time constraints on Members.  For example, Deputy Kyne has indicated that he must leave to attend another meeting.  We are cognisant of the challenges on Members' time.<\/p><p> On the fiscal treaty, as the Chairman is aware we were very pleased to have an opportunity to present a submission on behalf of our organisation to the fiscal stability treaty.  We presented our report to the members of this committee.  I agree with Deputy Byrne that it is a challenge.  For our sins, we tried to summarise in two pages, in as concise and jargon-free language as possible, to explain the debt to GDP deficit ratios and golden break rules.  It is not an easy task.  As an organisation committed to communicating Europe and the EU in plain English, it is a challenge and one which we recognise.<\/p><p> Deputy Kyne asked a very good question about a topic we mention in all our four reports, the consistent methodology in terms of the European Commission and the geographical origins.  We submit this report to the European Commission annually.  We were pleased this year to put our money where our mouth is, so to speak, by submitting a Commission consultation.  We replied by the end of September on the European Commission's Commission consultation on the whole process.  We were able to give the recommendation to include the geographical origin and to have a consistent e-mail address for all the Commission consultations because what happens on occasion is that the e-mail address is disbanded after a certain number of weeks.  This recommendation will help to increase usage, engagement and accessibility on the part of citizens, trade unions, business groups, etc.<\/p><p> On the question about the list system and how we compare with other EU countries, what I like about having the opportunity to make a presentation to this committee is that as we continue to mention every year, this is an organic evolving project and programme.  It is only by engaging with people such as members of this committee and hearing their input and feedback that we are able to develop, expand and incorporate those recommendations and broaden out the report.  Every year we look at the four key pillars which we have outlined today.  We also take on board recommendations and feedback as to whether we should be looking at more.  To be completely frank and honest, 2013 was an incredibly busy year for all of us and we decided to make our report more concise and more focused for that year.<\/p><p> Senator Burke's questions and comments on the European Parliament are really welcome, as he has been an MEP.  We continue to engage with the MEPs.  They have outlined to us that on occasions it can take up to six weeks for an MEP to get an answer to a parliamentary question.  I am sure Senator Burke will bear this out.  They have told us that in most cases it is easier to pick up the phone to the relevant official.  We recognise the limits of looking at the hard data in this regard.  In reply to Senator Hayden, in terms of the increase in the number of reports by the Irish MEPs and rapporteurs and by the European directors, we would really welcome the opportunity to contribute to any discussions or debates by this committee on European issues.<\/p> <p> To answer Senator Hayden's point about signing in.  We are a small, lean organisation.  We do not have any staff in Brussels and we have not mastered the art of bi-location and being physically present at any of the committees in Brussels.  We can only report on what is on the record and publicly available.<\/p><p> The reports depend on the level of engagement with the political groups and the various reports.  We track and analyse what is publicly available.  We do seek to engage but we do recognise the qualitative soft data analysis.  In terms of the disenchantment and disengagement that all the speakers touched upon, that is a challenge.  Last year we commissioned Red C to carry out an independent poll analysing Irish sentiment towards the EU at the start of 2013.  Over 80% of the findings were very positive but notwithstanding that there are challenges.  We can never take it for granted and we need to work on ensuring that level of engagement and dialogue.  Euroscepticism is growing but for us the decline in voter turnout at the local and European Parliament elections is worrying.  As an organisation trying to promote engagement, debate and dialogue we did not welcome that statistic.  It is incumbent on all of us as a civil society organisation and the elected representatives to increase that engagement.<\/p><p> We welcome the engagement with Ministers at this committee.  It is an important opportunity.  We do not individualise Oireachtas committee members' or MEPs&rsquo; attendance.  It is not for us to decide the qualitative input.  We recognise the limits to the report but we still believe the exercise is valid and important in shining a light on the work of the committee, the MEPs, the Government and Ministers.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Durkan, we could consider how this committee compares with other national committees.  Malta is the only other EU member state with the proportional representation single transferable vote system.  The Eurobarometer reports give a good comparison of sentiment across the different EU member states. <\/p><p> The increasing number of speeches is tied to the increasing number of reports published by our Irish MEPs and the rapporteurs and the popular engagement around the country.  I am sure the Chairman knows from his work in support of the Blue Star programme the European Movement Ireland is pleased to be the national implementation body for that organisation.  Over 160 schools are taking part this year.  Over 16,000 pupils throughout the country have participated and continue to participate in this programme.  It is a really important part of that engagement debate.  Last year, as European Year of the Citizens and during the Irish Presidency, European Movement Ireland ran a series of regional town hall debates around the country.  We were in Galway, Cork, Limerick, Naas and Wexford.  That is a very important aspect of what we do and we are committed to doing it for the future.  I apologise for that whistlestop tour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111800015#O00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416323700,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I apologise for rushing Ms O&rsquo;Connell.

I will start by expressing our gratitude for inviting Eurofound to present some of our priorities and activities, particularly given the fact that we are the only European Union agency that was established in Ireland.<\/p> <p>As members may know, Eurofound is the short name for the much longer and nicer title of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.  This name reflects one of the key objectives, if not the key one, of the European Union project.  We provide knowledge, information and evidence that is likely to assist in the development of social and work-related policies that can lead to the improvement of the quality of life and work in Europe.  We work in a number of areas, those being, the labour market, unemployment policy, working conditions, industrial relations and social policies.  These are our core areas of expertise in which we focus our research and communication activities.<\/p><p> We have compiled a word cloud containing a number of words that have been key to debates in the European Parliament.  I am sure that discussions on employment are also central to debates in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These words are at the heart of Eurofound's research activities.  We wish to present a number of our findings of comparative information to highlight some of the data as they relate to Ireland so that members might have a flavour of the kind of information that we can provide and that would support members in their work as policy makers.<\/p><p> I will start with a basic figure on life satisfaction.  Members are probably more than aware that they are living in a country where people are reasonably satisfied, certainly more so than the European average of 7.1 on a scale of one to ten.  Like my country of Spain, Ireland is above the average, but we are both below the level of the Nordic countries, which have the highest levels.  For example, Denmark has a level of 8.4.<\/p><p> A number of elements are relevant for life satisfaction.  One is satisfaction with family life, which is pertinent for Irish citizens.  Ireland ranks close to the top of the comparative information with 8.4, whereas the EU average is 8.2.  If I understand the situation correctly, this point is highlighted by the number of debates the Houses have on supporting families, welfare assistance and public services.  We know from our research, particularly our analysis of the European quality of life survey, that the perception of the quality of public services has a stronger impact on trust in governments than the perception of economic performance does.  Members have mentioned issues of disengagement and trust.  These are matters that we explore through our quality of life surveys.  Members can see a screenshot of our survey mapping tool.  They can go to our website and, question by question, check how Ireland compares with other countries on different aspects.  In terms of trust in government, for example, our last survey two years ago showed the European average to be 4 whereas Ireland's rating was slightly below that and significantly below that of the top country, which had a rating of 6.9.<\/p><p> I will show the committee three different public services in which Irish citizens' perceptions were compared with those of citizens of other European countries.  In terms of child care, the European average is 6.2.  Ireland is close to this at 6.  In the perception of the quality of health services, Ireland's rating of 4.9 is below the European average of 6.3.  However, Ireland rates above the European Union average in terms of the perceived quality of the education system.<\/p> <p>The European average is 6.3 while Ireland&rsquo;s is 6.8, the same as the United Kingdom.<\/p><p> Employment is also at the centre of our research.  We examined structural changes in the labour market in Europe and in individual member states during the recession, taking into account the kind of jobs created or destroyed, whether wages are high or low, job quality and educational attainment of jobholders.  More than 5 million jobs were lost in the recession between 2008 and 2010.  These were concentrated in the middle and low-paid sectors, a pattern followed in Ireland.  Since 2011, Ireland has returned to job creation but most of them are middle and low-paid jobs.<\/p><p> How do wages in Ireland compare with those in other member states?  During the recession, wages in Europe dropped but Ireland is still among those with higher level salaries.  Compared with others in Europe, Ireland has the seventh highest wage distribution.  If this was not adjusted to take into account the cost of living, Ireland would have the fourth highest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111800018#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Juan Mend&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416324600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Would it be just behind the Benelux countries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014111800020#T00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416324600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Yes, it would.

We recognise that the Government has moved in this direction on two occasions, but it has not done so entirely.<br\/>This amendment asks us to prepare and lay before the D&aacute;il a report on options available for removing USC liability from all workers earning less than that figure per year.  The Minister will understand why the amendment is phrased the way it is because he has had the same difficulties himself when he was an Opposition spokesperson on finance.  The way we deal with the Finance Bill in 2014 is wholly inadequate, when Members of the elected D&aacute;il cannot propose amendments to a Finance Bill, but must jump through hoops to try and lay reports and so on, instead of being able to present something, debate it and vote on it if so desired.  Later on there will be a string of amendments that I have proposed on very simple things that I thought did not place a charge on the State, which have been ruled out of order.  I am explaining the origins and the reason the amendment is about a report.<br\/>We would like to see this enacted in this year's Finance Bill.  That is not possible coming from the Opposition, but I ask the Minister to consider this.  I know he moved in this direction two years ago and again this year at the mark of around &euro;12,000.  We need to go further and take out those earning the minimum wage, but I take this opportunity to press him to accept in the spirit of true political reform the legislation Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed, that there would be a constitutional amendment that would deal with the constitutional provisions that prohibit Members of the Opposition bringing forward amendments to legislation that would place a charge on the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800002#A00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416333600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  It is clear from the wording of the proposed amendment that Deputy Doherty's intention is that those earning the minimum wage or less should be exempted from USC entirely.  The Deputy should be aware that the changes proposed in the Finance Bill include a provision to extend the exemption threshold for USC from the current &euro;10,036 to &euro;12,012 per annum.  This measure alone removes an estimated 80,000 low-income earners entirely from liability to the charge.<\/p> <p>This is in addition to the 330,000 individuals removed from the charge as a result of the extension of the exemption limit I introduced in 2012.  It is now estimated that around 650,000 or 28% of all income earners will not be liable for the universal social charge, USC, from next year.  In addition to this, as a result of the reduction of the two lower rates of USC and the extension of the threshold at which the 7% USC rate becomes payable from &euro;16,016 to &euro;17,576, all those earning the minimum wage will see a reduction in the amount of USC they pay next year.  For example, as a result of the changes introduced in budget 2015 someone earning &euro;17,542 will see his or her weekly USC charge of &euro;10.51 per week fall to &euro;7.19 per week.  This means this person's tax bill will be reduced by just over 20%.  In fact, the new higher threshold was specifically chosen to ensure that those on the minimum wage would be exempted from the higher rates of USC.  It should also be noted that an individual on the minimum wage is also exempted from paying PRSI.  Increasing the USC exemption threshold to &euro;17,542 - effectively to &euro;17,576 for administrative reasons - would increase the entry point of the charge above the current entry point to income tax of &euro;16,500 per annum for a single employee.  This would seriously undermine the rationale for the introduction of the USC which was to broaden the tax base from its narrow, unsustainable level, with a relatively small portion of income earners responsible for a disproportionate amount of the overall income tax yield.  When the Government considers options for budgetary tax packages, it must take into account all the parts of the package.  Therefore, single measures cannot be contemplated in isolation.  <\/p><p> I take the point made by the Deputy that the amendment, to require the Minister for Finance to bring a report back to the D&aacute;il, is a drafting device to ensure the amendment is acceptable and I understand his point in general.  The prohibition on moving amendments which would impose a charge on the people is founded in the Constitution where the obligation is on the Executive to bring budgetary estimates before the parliament and it is the function of the parliament to dispose of those estimates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800002#A00600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416333600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>The Minister's last point goes to the heart of fundamental political reform and how we deal with this finance Bill and other money Bills.  We know the prohibition comes from the Constitution but I want to draw to the Minister's attention the proposal of the all-party committee on the Constitution, in its seventh report to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  In 2002, 12 years ago, it proposed that the Committee Stage provisions in Article 17.2 of the Constitution be removed.  We talk about the budget and a proper transparent budget and all the rest but we cannot propose anything in here.  This side of the House cannot do anything.  No matter what, we cannot make amendments unless we go through these acrobatic-like stages where we have to do a report on this, that and the other.  What I am saying to the Minister is that if there is a real, genuine desire for political reform and of how we deal with our budget and finance matters, the prohibition, at least on Committee Stage, on Opposition Members should be lifted -  as suggested in the all-party report in 2002 - so that we could have a real battle of ideas and be able to put forward suggestions that could impose a charge on the people and on the revenue.  We cannot do this, but it is within the Minister's gift to allow that to happen.  It is within the Government's gift to allow that referendum to take place.  I do not think such a referendum would be met with opposition from the general public.  It is something to which the Minister's party, and all other parties in the House in 2002, had signed up.<\/p><p>  On the amendment, the Minister has spoken at length on what the benefits would be for individuals.  I acknowledge the Government has increased the threshold from where it was, when it entered government, at &euro;4,000, or just over &euro;4,000, to &euro;10,000 and then from &euro;10,000 up to &euro;12,000 or thereabouts.  It needs to go further.  The cost of removing those on the minimum wage is in the region of approximately &euro;138 million.  This would be money directly injected into the economy.  I appreciate there are people who are working part-time who would have a yearly income below &euro;17,500.  However, most of them would be low income, low wage, individuals.  The majority of them spend all their money in the domestic economy.  While there would be a cost to the State, it would be a very positive move in terms of ensuring the injection of money and the injection of consumer spend in the real economy.  There would also be the obvious benefits of taking those who are least well of in society out of the USC tax net.    <\/p><p>  We will deal with this later on in section 13 or 14 when we deal with the special assignee relief programme, SARP.  It speaks volumes of the priorities of this Government when one compares the treatment of some of the highest individual earners in this State, where they are having their tax written off for a certain proportion of their income, with the unwillingness of the Minister to move that further bit for these who are earning the minimum wage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800003#B00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416333600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>This is one of the most welcome aspects of the budget that was introduced.

However, the Government at the start of its period in office established the constitutional forum, if that is the correct name for it, and it was vested with the responsibility of bringing forward proposals on what changes to the Constitution it thought might be appropriate.  The Constitution in its totality was debated and a whole series of proposals for referenda was brought forward, but there was no recommendation on this particular issue.  The Government is following the recommendations of the constitutional forum and is not proposing a referendum on this issue.<\/p><p>  However, with the excellent chairmanship of the Chairman and the willingness of myself and my officials to be quite flexible in the approach to the debate, while a Deputy in opposition cannot bring an amendment along the lines of what the Deputy suggests, to the point of including it in the finance Bill, there is no prohibition on proposing it and having a full debate on it and its merits.  It is worth pointing out that the universal social charge, when it was introduced by my predecessor, the late Brian Lenihan, replaced two levies - the health levy and the income levy.  It was not a new tax.  It was a replacement for impositions that had been there for many years.  <\/p><p>   On budget day, I outlined the budget's approach not only to the 2015 budget, but also to the 2016 budget which we hope to introduce in October 2015.  I went on to say that if we are back in Government after an election - we are making no assumptions about that - we would continue with a particular approach to personal taxation.  The approach is that with the resources available the approach we have taken in this finance Bill will be mirrored in next year's budget.  That means we will address the low paid again, through USC.  If people do not pay income tax until they get above a level of &euro;16,500, a person can make all the income tax changes he or she likes, but he or she will not reach down to lower income people.  However, it is possible to adjust their income and deliver benefits to them through the USC.  The majority of the resources available to us have been dedicated to people between roughly &euro;32,000 and &euro;70,000.<\/p> <p>They are the people who I would argue have borne the principal portion of the burden.  Also, from an economic point of view giving benefits increases the incentive to work and enables additional people to return to work.  It also fulfils another objective of the Government, namely, to make it possible for our young people abroad to return to work in Ireland and not be inhibited by very high rates of personal taxation.  This is the first year of a phased programme.  While we are reasonably confident that we will deliver the second phase of this programme, whether or not we can go beyond that is in the hands of the electorate.<\/p><p> The Deputy has chosen SARP, which we will be discussing later, as an indicator that the thrust of the budget is to reward high income people.  It is not.  We have deliberately put a cap on the benefits of personal taxation at a gross salary of &euro;70,000.  While people on incomes above this amount get a reduction in their USC and income tax they only get it at the same level as the person earning &euro;70,000.  As such a person earning a very high salary of &euro;200,000 will get the same break in USC and income tax, and the same relief per week, as the person earning &euro;70,000.  It is designed to be fair and equal.  I know everybody does not agree with the approach but I ask that they at least acknowledge it.  If they are going to attack the budget then they should attack it in terms of the approach taken rather than some other fictional approach.  <\/p><p> This budget was not designed to give tax breaks to the wealthy and it does not do so, rather it gives tax breaks to those people who have been defined as the coping classes and the squeezed middle.  This is the first time that any Minister has decided to put a salary parameter on what is the squeezed middle.  We are identifying these people as those in receipt of incomes ranging from &euro;30,000 plus up to &euro;70,000.  That is not to suggest that everybody earning above &euro;70,000 is extremely wealthy.  Given that individualisation has been bedded in as part of our tax code the couple working, one of whom probably drops the children to creche or school, following which both of them head off to work thereafter on public transport, or if fortunate enough, in the same car, will have individual caps of &euro;70,000.  As Members know, these are couples who form part of the 1.9 million people now at work.  They work hard all day, pay a great deal of tax, on return from work look after their children and in the last couple of years seldom got out and had to plan their social occasions carefully.  These are the people to whom under this budget I decided to give most of the relief, using the resources I had available.  I thought this time last year that I would not have resources available.  We were fortunate with how the year went in terms of tax buoyancy.  As well as not having to make an additional correction of &euro;2 billion to achieve a deficit of less than 3% we had additional resources as a result of tax increases put in place which we used to deliver some relief.<\/p><p> Without getting into specifics, I propose to mirror this approach next year.  Benefits will again be targeted at the low paid, through USC reductions, and the squeezed middle, through USC and income tax reductions, the squeezed middle being defined as people earning up to &euro;70,000.  Those earning above &euro;70,000 will get the same relief as those earning &euro;70,000.  I do not propose, in respect of those with an additional &euro;230,000 to introduce a 1% cut in the marginal rate, thereby providing additional relief of &euro;2,300, which is what would happen if one rolled the relief upwards.  The USC level of 11% was introduced to ensure that the 1% reduction in marginal tax rates, 41% to 40%, is negatived by an increase in USC so that the benefits are flat once one passes &euro;70,000.  As a result of the personal tax measures introduced in the budget, which are being implemented in this Finance Bill, every taxpayer paying USC or income tax, or both, will get some relief.  If one does a bell curve on this, one will find that the bell curve favours those on very low income and USC and the group earning between &euro;32,000 and &euro;70,000.  That is the thinking behind the budget.  I have no problem with members attacking the budget or with rigorous debate but I ask that they do not attack it under false colours or on the basis of objectives which I do not have and did not include in the budget or Finance Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800003#B00400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416334200,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his lengthy response.

I will deal later with an amendment I tabled in regard to the double Irish arrangement which has been ruled out of order.  I have written legislation on this which cannot be tabled in the D&aacute;il for constitutional reasons.  It does not make sense that in 2014 the hands of the Opposition are being held behind their backs in terms of their not being able to propose amendments for discussion.  It is within the Government's gift to propose the constitutional referendum on this issue, which I do not believe would meet with hostile opposition from the public.<\/p><p>  In regard to the Minister's suggestion that budget 2015 is not a budget for the wealthy in society, I contest that is.  I will deal with that issue as we go through the different sections of the Bill.  For example, in the context of SARP it is clear that the Minister thought the cap of &euro;500,000 was too low and that is the reason he has decided to remove it altogether.  However, in terms of what is proposed in this section in respect of USC and income tax, the closer an individual is to earning &euro;70,000 the more he or she will benefit.  The Minister will argue that the more a person earns the more tax he or she will pay.  While that is the approach of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, I would take a different approach and try to give the squeezed middle some benefit but as much as possible at the lowest end so that everyone benefits.  The reality is that comparable to an individual on the average industrial wage or below that, people earning &euro;100,000 or &euro;140,000 will receive multiple benefits under this budget.  I do not think that is fair.  <\/p><p>  The Minister stated earlier that those earning &euro;100,000 have obligations and so on.  I am sure some of them will be hard-pressed and perhaps over-committed.  However, they are not the people who in my view are presenting to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Therefore, what the Minister should have done is ensure as much as possible of the resources available were used to impact on those at the lowest end and on the squeezed middle.  This could have been done by way of increased tax credits and widening of the tax bands.  In terms of lowering the rate, which issue will come to later, I believe that is the measure that is least fair because it allows high earners to benefit more.   <\/p><p>  I have been fair in terms of acknowledging that the Government has been moving in the direction proposed in this amendment, as a result, hopefully, of Sinn F&eacute;in keeping the issue on the agenda.  We will continue to do so.  I intend to press the amendment to exempt those earning below the minimum wage from the USC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800004#C00600","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416334200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>The Minister's response does not fully take into account that there is a need for a radical reconfiguring of the tax system as a whole in order to redistribute wealth because of obscene inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth.<\/p> <p>That is what is driving people onto the streets and making them so angry about the regressive nature of water charges.  Regardless of what the Minister says or how he argues the percentages, those who cannot pay their bills and those who are on the minimum wage cannot see the fairness of the decision to give multiples of what they are being given to people who earn more than &euro;70,000.  Given that 20% of children in this country are living in poverty - that is one in five - I do not see how any Government that is making decisions about where benefits might be given back, or concessions might be given out, can say that anybody who earns more than &euro;65,000 deserves anything back, if it is a choice between giving money to such people and giving it to people on the breadline or children in poverty.  That comment does not arise out of a sort of vindictiveness against people who are earning over &euro;65,000.<\/p><p> I would say that when we sit down to look at scarce resources and decide where relief should be directed, we have to start with the families of the 20% of children who are living in poverty.  The first priority of any Minister for Finance in any budget should be to take budgetary measures that put enough income back into the pockets of the parents of those children to lift them out of poverty.  Rather than doing that, the Minister is giving &euro;600 or &euro;700 to somebody who is on &euro;65,000, &euro;70,000, &euro;80,000, &euro;90,000 or &euro;100,000.  Why does anyone on more than &euro;100,000 need to get anything back?  Such people are already on very high incomes.  They are not struggling.  They will not have difficulty.  The Minister might say they are not super-wealthy, and that is okay, but they are not struggling.  They are not even on the same planet as a family that does not know whether it will have enough money to feed the kids.  I think that is the point being made.  It was made by the tens of thousands of people who were out on the streets.  There has to be a radical shift towards addressing the despair, intolerable poverty and dire circumstances faced by tens of thousands of families.  They cannot understand why any extra burden, such as the water charges, is being imposed on them.  They do not understand why the Minister is not using the latitude he has - the relief that is available under the universal social charge or anything else - to help people in this group and help those who are in poverty out of poverty as an absolute first priority.<\/p><p> I was looking at the Credit Suisse global wealth report for 2014, which is a real eye-opener.  I honestly suggest that the Minister should have a look at it, if he has not already done so.  The report estimates that there are 88,000 millionaires in Ireland.  Like the Central Bank, Credit Suisse has shown that over the last two years, the total net assets of households in this country have increased by 13% to &euro;508 billion.  Over 20% of this is owned by the top 1% and over 40% of it is owned by the top 5%.<\/p><p> If one examines Credit Suisse's methodology - how it works out these estimates - one will see that it uses a few different models.  To a very large extent, it extrapolates its figures on the basis of how income is distributed in each society.  It can correlate from that how wealth is accumulated and distributed.  Even if this report is not absolutely accurate, it is shocking if it is close to the truth.  I do not understand why the Minister cannot hear the voices that are raised in the D&aacute;il or on the streets.  I refer to those who are saying we need a redistributive taxation system that prioritises people who are living in poverty.  That is really the point.  The system should take more tax from the top 5% or 10%, whose income and wealth levels are more than adequate to bear a significantly increased tax burden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800004#C00700","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416334800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The first point I want to make is that the logic of the points made by the Deputy suggests he believes in a model in society where everybody gets paid more or less the same.

I do not share that viewpoint, which has been put forward before.  We live in a meritocracy.  I think merit should be rewarded.  Different levels of salary are needed to reflect that.  If there are different levels of salary, there have to be different levels of take-home pay after tax.<\/p><p>  The second point I want to make is that the Deputy has not checked the numbers for net pay, as against gross pay.

Core social welfare payments have not been cut at all.  Personal taxes have not been increased.  Personal taxes have been reduced in this budget.  This is to our credit, given that inequality has increased among many of our fellow EU member states and OECD countries.  An analysis of the taxation measures in this budget, based on the ESRI's tax benefit model, known as Switch, indicates that all household deciles will gain from the income tax measures announced in budget 2015.<\/p><p>  We have very limited resources.  People forget very quickly that we inherited a banjaxed economy and a banjaxed fiscal situation when we came into government in March 2011.  We have made some progress.  I am not saying everybody is back in a position we would like them to be in.  All I am saying is that we have reached a point now where rather than taking, we are able to give something back.  I am outlining my personal policy position, as endorsed by the Government, on how we target the resources we have this year and those I hope we will have next year.  I am saying to the Deputy that next year, we will mirror what we did this year.  The ESRI has also found that the most vulnerable sectors of society were protected from the impact of the downturn, whereas the groups of people I am talking about - the squeezed middle and the coping classes - bore the bulk of the burden and carried the weight.  If we were to draw up a hierarchy of who suffered the most, it is obvious that those who lost their jobs were hit hardest.

If we do this for three years the estimate is that it will add 15,000 jobs because it will remove blockages in the labour market due to personal taxation and 15,000 extra people will be at work at the end of a three-year cycle of approaching matters in this way.  I would hope also that when the young people in Sydney or in London or in Boston look at the comparative tax taken out of their gross wages, they will not be totally put off coming back to Ireland and that they will not decide they cannot afford to come home.

I said this was a defective policy instrument whereas income tax was not, because people earning below &euro;16,500 pay no income tax so I cannot give them tax relief through reducing income tax.  People marginally above or even a couple of thousand above &euro;16,500, pay little enough income tax and as a result I cannot give them relief in that way.  I said also that I was using the personal taxation system as a policy instrument.  Of course I am using the cuts in the USC as a labour policy instrument.  Of all the people who go out to work in the morning, whether they are highly paid or low paid, most of them work very hard.  Whether one works harder than the other does not depend on the salaries they earn.

We will come to the income tax side - the band and the rate reduction - in a moment, but section 2 relates to the USC.  Given the way in which this budget was approached and the lack of information that we had as an Opposition party, no one could have foreseen that the Government would have had the resources to introduce a &euro;642 million full-year cost income tax package.  Right up to the eve of the budget, the narrative from the Government was that, instead of making an adjustment of &euro;2 billion, we were looking at a broadly neutral budget to achieve a deficit of less than 3%.  We prepared our proposals in that context.  Instead of a broadly neutral budget, though, the Government spent an additional &euro;1 billion.  It was a negative adjustment of &euro;1 billion.  We need to address this point because countless parliamentary questions, correspondence with the Department and efforts to establish the State's true fiscal position ahead of budget 2015 were unsuccessful.  We received answers that were essentially evasive and we were refused that information.  This undermines efforts to achieve an objective to which I hope we all subscribe, that being, to hold a proper debate in advance of and not just after a budget.<\/p><p>  That said, I stand by my position, which I advocated on behalf of the party, that 2015 was not the year to start a round of income tax cuts, as we will still borrow &euro;5 billion next year to balance the books, adding to the general government deficit.  As we all know, borrowed money must be repaid with interest.  The attack on services in recent years due to budgetary cuts has been savage.  The impact on access to critical services - the fair deal scheme among others, disability services and services for people across the country who are homeless tonight - could have been addressed to some extent.<\/p><p>  When we reach section 3, I will discuss the overall shape of the package and the way in which it was calibrated.  I acknowledge that the burden of income tax in Ireland is high.  It increased dramatically in recent years and unquestionably needs to be reduced as resources allow, but I stand by my point that, at a time when we are borrowing &euro;5 billion that must be repaid with interest, vital services have been cut to the bone and we are dealing with these issues in our constituency offices every day, this was not the right time to do so.<\/p><p>  I make these points in the context of Members having to prepare their own approaches on the basis of a neutral budget achieving a deficit of less than 3%.  Instead, the Government went &euro;1 billion the other way, which no one saw coming because there was no evidence that the scope to do so existed.  Regardless of who is sitting on the Minister's side or my side of this committee room, we will have to get this process right.  If pre-budget submissions are to be meaningful and form the basis of a proper debate, we must at least be working off the same numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800007#F00600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1416336000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>The numbers keep changing.

The Minister has given us a timeline, and the information that was available at the end was not available in June or July.  We appreciate that; it is not the issue.  Seven days before the budget was announced, Deputy McGrath and I had to use our priority questions on the floor of the D&aacute;il to try to elicit some information.  The Minister said we were not to hold him to it, but that it would be a broadly neutral budget with a scope of about &euro;50 million to &euro;100 million.  That was seven days before the budget was announced.  Three days later, at midnight on Friday, the White Paper came out showing that there was scope to hit the 3% target with about &euro;1.1 billion.  I find it very difficult to believe that the Minister for Finance was not aware this type of scope existed.  Was it just a pleasant surprise at midnight on Friday?  I do not believe it.<\/p><p>  When I look at what was in the newspapers in the weeks leading up this, and this is based on leaks so we will just take the information for what it is, it was very clear that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, was suggesting that there would be scope of &euro;400 million, which ended up being roughly what was in the budget.  The rest was taxation measures.  The point is that it is very difficult when both Opposition finance spokespersons are looking for information, and within 72 hours, the information comes out and it is completely different from what was suggested on the floor of the D&aacute;il, all within seven days of the budget being announced.  That is really difficult.  We cannot wind back the clock but we need to come up with a better, more fit-for-purpose system of trying provide information to the Opposition.  There seems to be a culture of not letting anybody know and of having the big bang on budget day, as it were, like in the past when the Minister for Finance would give his speech and not even the Cabinet would know what he was going to announce.  We are not in those days any more but it is very much clouded in secrecy.

When I was talking to the Deputy whenever we had questions after the D&aacute;il came back at the end of September, I thought we would have growth rates of 3.5% or something like that.  That changes the base.  Additional moneys came in from both the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency.  When the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, was talking about &euro;400 million, I understood him to be talking about &euro;400 million on the wrong side of the line, which would have to be raised by taxes.  We did raise taxation.  We were fortunate in one thing.  We were notified by the European Union that it had changed the tax application of services that originate in one country and are delivered in another country, for example, television signals.  We were informed that whereas in the case of television signals from the UK to Ireland the VAT would continue to be deducted and go to the UK exchequer until 2015, it would come to the Irish Exchequer in 2015.  There was more than &euro;100 million in that.  The yield will be &euro;100 million in 2015 and &euro;150 million in a full year from 2019.  We also put 40 cent on a packet of cigarettes.

We have been calling on the Minister to introduce a third rate of tax for a long time and now we have one anyway, given how we are dealing with the USC.  Some people will be paying 52% and some people will be paying 51% marginal rates of tax, and then we have the self-employed as well.  This proposal seeks to make the tax rate more progressive with a third rate of tax of 48% on incomes above &euro;100,000.  It is an issue that I have debated many times at this committee and I am not going to go over old ground again.  I wish to put it down as a marker as I believe it is something we should be looking at.  We see what is happening in society.  The issue of homelessness was raised in the D&aacute;il today and there are high levels of poverty and people in great need in society.  It all has to be paid for somehow.  There is only so much extra that can be put on a packet of cigarettes or a litre of diesel.  For those who have the most, if they see their money spent wisely and prudently, I do not think a measure like this would be overly onerous on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800008#G01900","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416336600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>The proposal is for a third rate of tax at 48% and that is eight percentage points above the 40% rate which is going to be the top rate from 1 January next after the Finance Bill is passed.<\/p> <p>The economic effect is on the marginal rate of tax.  Before the budget, the marginal rate was 52%, which includes universal social charge, USC, and PRSI, pay related social insurance.  This would take the marginal rate of tax up to 60% for those people, a significant jump.<\/p><p> Such a move would also have labour market effects.  If 60 cent were taken off every additional euro one earns above a certain level, literature on this question suggests it would reduce incentives.  It certainly reduces the incentive to come home for those who have emigrated.  The entry point in the Irish tax system is low.  Before the budget, it was &euro;32,000.  Paying 60 cent on additional earnings over &euro;100,000 would be a big imposition on a PAYE worker on such a gross salary.  For someone earning the same amount in London who gets a job offer in Dublin, such a measure - essentially taking 60% once one goes above a relatively low income threshold - almost eliminates an incentive to come home.<\/p><p> As the debate on corporation tax develops and it becomes clear changes in the regime will take place, the level of personal taxes in a country will become an influencing factor for those who control the flow of foreign direct investment when they are deciding where to locate industry.  Corporations do not make these decisions; it is people who make them.  For example, last week there was an announcement by the Taoiseach of an investment of &euro;1 billion by a multinational in a new plant in west Dublin.  Would those plant managers who will be coming into Ireland ignore the fact they might have to pay 60% of their income because of such a measure?<\/p><p> Take the case of the self-employed.  What would happen if one put an additional 8% on their tax rate of 55%?  Again, this would be a disincentive to entrepreneurial people to found their own businesses.  We live in a society where income and profit are drivers of activity.  Why would anyone set up their own company unless there is a personal benefit of a good income from it?  I accept there are other considerations in setting up one's own company but the bottom line is personal income.<\/p><p> One could argue this amendment has the capacity to make the income tax system more progressive.  Ireland already has the most progressive income tax system of all the EU members of the OECD being at the top of the league table of the EU&rsquo;s 28 member states.  This proposal sticks another 8% on to the tax rate.  Apart from the imposition on those with salaries who would be affected by this amendment, the economic case against it is very strong.  It would be bad economic policy and would reduce rather than create jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800008#G02100","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416337200,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Underlying what the Minister said and what we on the left claim is a philosophical difference of opinion translated into tax policy.

We have heard the answer, that the Minister's colleague is responsible for some of it, but this should be done.  If there is a genuine spirit of political reform then equality budgeting should be introduced.  Analysis should be done prior to the budget being introduced.  However, given the fact  that the Minister has told us it is only on midnight on the Friday before the budget that he finds out has &euro;1 billion and he must come up with ways to spend it within 48, 52 or 62 hours, I am not sure whether he would have the scope to do equality budgeting within this timeframe.  There is a need for independent analysis of how the budget impacts on various cohorts of people and how the changes in taxes and spending adjustments in the budget impact on people with regard to gender, income, age, marital status and disability status.  This basket of indicators can be expanded.<br\/>We introduced legislation calling for equality budgeting, which was debated in the D&aacute;il last year but the Government voted against it.  It did so because it has consistently failed to undertake independent impact assessments of its budgets in terms of the distributional impact on people's income or the impact on groups of people in society who are already disadvantaged.  Earlier, the Minister stated we should deal with the facts.  Let us do so.  Let us have an assessment of how the budget impacts on various people and not just rely on partial reports from the ESRI, which we all use at different times to inform the debate.

A very detailed distributional analysis was published by the Department of Finance in sections B.1 to B.26 of this year's budget.  This analysis sets out the distributional impact of certain tax and welfare measures over a range of 13 income levels across six family types.  The distributional analysis is complemented with a number of illustrative hypothetical case study families.<\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection will also publish a social impact assessment of budget 2015 using the ESRI's SWITCH model.

This social impact assessment will examine the effect of the budget across family types, income groups and economic status.  It will also report on poverty indicators.<\/p><p>  Current models available to the Government do not permit analysis of gender, marital status or disability.  However, the Deputy may be aware that research by the ESRI indicates the budgets over the years from 2009 to 2013 did not have a significant differential impact on people based on gender.  This reflects the fact that the tax and social welfare system does not discriminate based on gender.  Further versions of the SWITCH model may include gender-based analysis.  However, I am confident the reductions in income tax and increases in child benefit would not have a material impact on gender outcomes.  It is not currently analytically possible in SWITCH to assist the impact of budgets on groups of people based on their marital or disability status.

We have empowered a body to do this, which is good, and I like independent voices to come forward with analysis.<\/p><p>  Just as important to ensure we hit the European targets laid on the State is to have analysis on how the measures introduced by the Government or any future government impact on various groups of people.  We do not have a comprehensive assessment.  The Minister mentioned the 13 tables in the budget book.  I sat in the \"Prime Time\" studio the night the budget was announced, when an expert from one of the accountancy firms went through it and was asked by people how it would impact on them.  What is not included in the tables is, for example, the fact that one will pay water charges as a household and that one will pay more if one's child is attending third level education, or the impact on lone parents of certain measures which were announced several years ago but will kick in next year.  None of this is captured, which is why we need analysis of equality budgeting to inform the debate on how we budget.<\/p><p>  This is a mess.  I do not want to go over old ground, but we receive no information prior to the budget being presented.  A sum of &euro;1 billion may appear 72 hours before the budget is announced.

The Opposition is constitutionally barred from tabling an amendment which would amend a figure or timeframe, or do anything which would place a charge on the people or bring money to the State.<\/p><p>  We also do not have impact assessments on how measures work after introduction.  The Department may carry out a study two or three years after a measure is introduced, which has been done on a thematic basis, but we have no comprehensive assessment of how a measure impacts on certain sections of society.  The ESRI reports are not complete as they only look at certain parts of the budget.  The one before last showed the impact was borne by the least well-off, but did not factor in the full weight of the property tax or other social welfare measures which were not completely captured within it.<\/p> <p>There is a need for this.  In the way there are austerity rules and debt rules at European level, there is a need for us to ensure we meet those targets.

I made the point last year that the doubling of the property tax was not included in the booklet because it was not part of budget 2014 so technically the Minister was correct; it was not part of the measures announced on budget day.

I am not sure if the Minister has read the legislation, and the explanatory guidelines, I drafted the amendments based on the French model and those of some of the Scandinavian countries.  It could not be introduced in the D&aacute;il for the same reason I outlined earlier, namely, the prohibition on me or any other Opposition Member introducing a Bill that places a charge on the State but there is a need to look at this issue.  <br\/>I understand the CSO is at an advanced stage with regard to collecting data on where wealth is held in this State.  The big problem with introducing this, outside the ideological view that the Minister may be opposed to taxing wealth at those levels, is the issue of how much it would bring in and so on.  Work has been ongoing by the CSO which I believe is coming to fruition soon.  If the Minister or his officials were aware of that, that would be interesting to see.<br\/>It was mentioned earlier that we have seen wealth of Irish households increase by 10% in the past year.  It is at &euro;577 billion, but it is obviously not as basic as that.  Much of that would be the recovery in house prices and so on, therefore, we need to look at where the wealth is, how it is broken down and whether it is in the hands of certain individuals or distributed evenly across society.  <br\/>The report referenced earlier on wealth management in Ireland for 2014 suggests that the wealth per adult in Ireland is $209,000.  I am not sure if many of my constituents would feel they have $209,000 of assets, and that is counterbalanced by about $71,000 in debt, so there would be a net effect of $140,000.  If that is the case it is more likely that wealth is concentrated in certain hands and therefore we should be considering proposals to introduce a comprehensive asset tax.  It would also allow for the repeal of the family home tax.<br\/>This amendment calls for a report to be laid out.  I am hoping the Minister can inform us in terms of the CSO producing that type of information on where wealth is held in Irish society with the survey it has been doing for the past year and a half.  I commend the amendment to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800011#K00600","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416338400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>The Government has no plans to introduce a wealth tax although all taxes and potential taxation options are constantly reviewed.<\/p><p>  Wealth can be taxed in a variety of ways, some of which are already in place in Ireland.  Capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax are in effect taxes on wealth in that they are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of, in the case of capital gains tax, an asset or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance in the case of capital acquisitions tax.  Deposit interest retention tax is charged at 41%, with limited exemptions on interest earned on deposit accounts.  <\/p><p>  Local property tax, which was introduced in 2013, is a tax based on the market value of residential properties.  In order to estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax it would first be necessary to identify the wealth held by individuals.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they currently have no statistical basis for compiling estimates relating to a potential wealth tax, although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances, for example, after a death.  This information is not a complete measure of financial assets in the State nor is it recorded in the manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax.<\/p><p>  I am advised that the Central Statistics Office's institutional sector accounts do not give an indicator of the number of households or persons classified by the categories of wealth they hold.  These statistics are based on aggregate information collected from financial institutions and do not contain the demographic details which would enable such a breakdown of the statistics.  However, I understand that following discussions involving the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the CSO and the Central Bank, the CSO has commenced the household finance and consumption survey, HFCS, which will collect information on household wealth.  The results of this survey are not yet available.<\/p><p>  The main aim of the HFCS is to provide structural information on households' assets and liabilities based on a representative sample of households.  This will address gaps in knowledge about the economic well-being of households and the distribution and type of wealth, the liabilities among households and individuals as well as the factors that affect financial planning by households and individuals.<\/p> <p>That data to be collected by the CSO as part of its household finance and consumption survey are not being collected for the purposes of calculating the potential yield for a wealth tax but to collect general information on the financial situation and behaviour of households.  Such information may be relevant to the formulation of tax policy and I look forward to seeing the results of the HFCS.<\/p><p> Another factor to consider is that asset values increase and decrease over time and in the context of recent economic circumstances, they may have declined considerably in many cases.  Thus, if the value of an asset or an individual's wealth is measured at a particular time, there is no guarantee that the asset value of the individual's wealth will remain at the level or increase from that point.  This would make it difficult to predict the potential yield from a wealth tax and this would have to be borne in mind, in terms of its consistency, as a source of revenue.<\/p><p> My Department will monitor and consider any additional information and data that come to light and will continue to examine potential taxation sources.  As I stated, I do not propose to accept the amendment at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800011#K00700","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416339000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>It is hard to interpret the meaning of this.  I am not familiar with Deputy Doherty's proposed legislation but I would like to make two observations.  If one asks the average family what its greatest source of wealth is, the obvious answer will be the family home.  With respect, Deputy Doherty is speaking out of both sides of his mouth here because he was vociferous in opposition to the introduction of a very modest household charge which was subsequently replaced by a property tax and yet he has no difficulty taxing the same family home through this proposal.<\/p><p>  The second observation is that if one casts one's mind back to when the late Brian Lenihan introduced the infamous bank guarantee, it was introduced to protect deposits in banks.  The introduction of an asset tax or a wealth tax would cause a huge flight of capital from the country at a time when we need to protect it.  It would result in a massive loss of investment because the risk-takers would simply move their wealth or their assets to another jurisdiction where they would get a better return and where perhaps there would no property tax.  For those two fundamental reasons, I cannot support this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800012#L00200","speaker":"1185"},{"type":"speech","time":1416339000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Similarly, in all our budget submissions in recent years, we have proposed a wealth tax.  I find it indicative of the priorities of this Government and of previous Governments that when they want to take money from low and middle income earners, they go to extraordinarily lengths to bill them or to find out what means they have in order not to give them something.  The most obvious current example is water metering which, to my mind, is an utter waste of money.  Some hundreds of millions of euro are being wasted.  Immense effort has been made to ascertain how much one can charge somebody with a regressive tax.  Similarly, there is very invasive means-testing for a number of social welfare benefits.  The State went to extraordinary lengths to try to establish the value of family homes in order to charge for the local property tax.<\/p><p>  All this can be done but what we cannot do is work out how much money the very wealthy have because that is just too difficult.  I do not accept that for one minute.  Just to inform Deputy Walsh, both our wealth tax proposal and Sinn F&eacute;in's, although it can speak for itself, exclude the family home.  What we are talking about is a wealth tax on financial and other assets, excluding the family home.<\/p><p>  I mentioned it earlier but I would like to see the same sort of drive from this Government, or from any Government, to find out the distribution of the &euro;508 billion net, which is after liabilities are taken out, in household assets in this State, half of which, according to the CSO, are cash or financial assets.  The family home takes up a significant amount of that but half of it is financial.<\/p><p>  If the wealth distribution estimates given by Credit Suisse for Ireland are even close to true, they indicate a shocking inequality in the distribution of wealth and, overwhelmingly, that wealth cannot be family homes.  If it is true, as Credit Suisse estimates, that the top 1% have 20% of that &euro;500 billion, or the top 5% have 40% of it, that is &euro;200 billion and 200,000 people accounting for that.  Some 200,000 people have about &euro;200 billion, so even if one takes out their family homes, the majority of that is financial assets or commercial property, which is generating revenue.  That money in financial or other assets is just sitting there and is generating money all the time.  They do not have to do anything with it or lift a finger.  It is in investment funds and so on.  What is the average return on investment funds for people who have several million euro?  I would say that these days, it is 4% or 5% per year.  Could we not put a 2% tax on this?  They would still make money.  They would not lose out on anything.  If one is a millionaire, one's millions are making money all the time.  We would not even be hurting them but would just be taking a little bit of that money, which is just money making money, from them and putting it back into society, into our infrastructure, into redistributing the wealth and into narrowing the gap between rich and poor. <\/p><p>  However, whenever one talks about these things it is said it is cloud-cuckoo-land economics, it is all too difficult and that these people will all leave.  These people are obviously not very patriotic in that if they are asked to pay a little bit of extra tax, they will all run away.  There is a thing called capital controls.  Iceland did not implode when it imposed capital controls.  These things can be done if there is a will.  There would certainly be fairness to it.  As Deputy Doherty mentioned, it averages out at approximately &euro;200,000 per person in the State but the majority of people having nothing even approaching that amount.<\/p><p>  I do not see why there is no willingness, or no will, to really delve into this and to show the same energy delving into this which the Governments so often demonstrate when they try to take money from the less well off. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800012#L00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1416339000,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I look forward to seeing the data from the CSO when they are concluded.

God forbid this Government would tax high income earners in society, in particular those we are targeting in this amendment who have assets above &euro;1 million.<\/p><p>  I would give Deputy Walsh one piece of advice.  He spoke about me speaking out of both sides of my mouth but I would advise him that before speaking out of either side of his mouth, he should inform himself of the amendments before the committee.  Detailed legislation has been published and there is an explanatory guide for people who are not used to reading legislation.  He could see exactly what is proposed in the amendment.<\/p><p>  This has been an issue of debate for a number of years.  As I said, there are two issues here.  There is an ideological one as to whether we should tax this wealth.  We see the global reports and there is a question mark in terms of what access Credit Suisse has to this type of analysis when it suggests that there has been a 10% increase in wealth in this State and that a large part of it is concentrated among a number of individuals.<\/p> <p>It has been estimated that the number of millionaires in Ireland is above 88,000.<\/p><p> We need accurate data.  We cannot rely on a wealth management company to provide this.  It is questionable whether the CSO survey would be able to pick that up, given that a small cohort of individuals hold a bulk of this asset.  Some of the most conservative institutions in Europe, including the Bundesbank, have called for the introduction of a wealth tax.  It has been suggested that a European wealth tax should be introduced.  Suggestions have been made by the SPD in Germany regarding a wealth tax and Spain has introduced a temporary wealth tax.  A number of proposals for the introduction of a wealth tax have been made.  I am not suggesting we copy what other jurisdictions are doing but we should be at least be open to the idea of introducing a global asset wealth tax for those domiciled in this State and examine whether it would be fairer to do that than to cut the social welfare payments of those age 25 and under, cut services of those with disabilities who are reliant on services, provide homeless shelters for people who are lying on the streets, provide the necessary resources for children who have profound difficulties and life impairing ailments or build the children's hospital.  I hear many other proposals mentioned by constituents every week in my constituency office or every day by people who contract me by telephone.  The demands for services in society are immense.  If we have the same provision that exists in other countries, then why not tap into that wealth?  I am sure the Minister will put forward many arguments against it, including that wealth is fluid.

I disagree completely with reducing the top rate of income tax from 41% to 40% at this time.  This is not the right time to do it.  I have just given a list of priorities where this money should be spent.  I do not for one moment underestimate that those who are in this cohort who would benefit from this proposal are under financial pressure but the Government must consider the priorities.  I suggest that dealing with homelessness, disadvantage, the social housing crisis, the burden seven austerity budgets have put on individuals and the burden our public health and education systems are under are areas far more beneficial to our consideration than reducing the 41% tax rate at this time.  The closer one is to the &euro;70,000 threshold, the more one will benefit from it.  The figures provided indicate that the 41% tax rate will cost the State about &euro;225 million, which is nearly &euro;0.25 billion.  That measure alone in a full year when combined with the standard rate band accounts for &euro;405 million; it is 40% of the entire budgetary spend when account is taken of a full-year effect, or 30% in terms of a partial-year effect.  There are far more pressing areas of need.  The Minister has heard them all from Social Justice Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, whose members are the people dealing with them at the coalface.  New food parcel facilities are being opened all the time in my constituency in Donegal and across the area.  This is not where the focus should be at this time.

He has put forward a definition in terms of people in the middle income bracket.  The reality is that an individual earning &euro;32,000 a year - who falls just below the threshold at which one enters the higher rate - would only benefit from the USC changes.  That individual would benefit to the tune of &euro;174 per annum.  If one earns just inside the thresholds at which one enters the higher rate, one would benefit from the increase in the threshold and from the reduction in the rate cut.  One would get three tax cuts as such.  I, as a Deputy, would benefit to the tune of approximately  &euro;750, whereas an individual earning &euro;32,000 a year would benefit only from the USC changes of &euro;174 per annum.  Similarly, in the case of a married couple where there is only one income earner on &euro;41,000 a year, they would only benefit to the tune of &euro;174 per annum.  The Minister has not calibrated it fairly because there is a dramatic step-up for those who earn beyond the entry point to the higher rate of tax.  It is not fair that somebody earning &euro;70,000 would benefit four times more than somebody earning &euro;30,000, but that is what the Minister has done.  Somebody earning &euro;70,000 or more would benefit by &euro;750 per annum compared to somebody earning &euro;32,000 a year who would only benefit by &euro;174 per annum.  If one is earning &euro;32,000 a year, one's income will be above all of the eligibility thresholds for State support.  One would not qualify for a medical card, rent supplement or  family income supplement in all likelihood, and one would not qualify for any means tested payment.   Many people working full-time earn that amount and less.  People on the minimum wage are on &euro;18,000 a year.  It is most acute for those who are just below that entry point.  If the Minister had redesigned the USC in a more fundamental way, he could have graduated the benefit far more evenly than he has done, but what he has done has resulted in a crude impact depending on whether one is earning above or below the entry point to the higher rate of tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800013#M01500","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1416339600,"counter":387,"content":"<p>The Deputy's point comes back to a point I made to Deputy Boyd Barrett.  If one believes that regardless of qualifications, ability, enthusiasm, work ethic and all of the rest of it, everybody should be paid the same, I would argue that is an unrealistic model of society and an unrealistic model of the labour market.  I think we would all acknowledge that  because of the nature of society people get different levels of wages and different levels of salaries and they pay tax in proportion to the level of wages and salaries they have.  As soon as one starts giving reliefs, the reliefs will be in proportion to the level of wages and salaries as one winds it down.  I would give the following example.  A single individual employed on the standard minimum wage of &euro;17,542 per annum pays income tax of &euro;4.01 and USC of &euro;10.51 per week.  Furthermore, someone on the standard minimum wage is also exempt from paying PRSI.<\/p> <p>As a result of the changes introduced in budget 2015, the weekly USC of &euro;10.51 per week will fall to &euro;7.19 per week.  This means the tax bill will be reduced by 20%, which is significant at the bottom.  If one examines the percentage, one gets a better impression of the proportionality of the changes made.  A single individual earning &euro;70,000 per annum currently pays &euro;25,531 per annum, or &euro;490.98 per week, in income tax, USC and PRSI.  After the implementation of budget 2015, this individual&rsquo;s tax bill will be reduced by approximately 3%.  In fact, the highest proportionate benefit as a percentage of net income from the budget tax changes occurs at an income level of just &euro;12,000.  This is as a result of my decision to extend the USC exemption threshold from &euro;10,036 to &euro;12,012.  This affects 80,000 individuals.<\/p><p> It is not a flat-rate relief that is being applied.  Reliefs are availed of in proportion to the incomes to which they apply.  Percentages indicate the profile is far more even than one might believe.  Next year, if resources are available, I will try to mirror this.  Of course I agree that there are inexactitudes and anomalies but, within the policy instruments available, amounting to only three, namely, PRSI, income tax and USC, we have gone a long way.  We will try to iron out the anomalies also.<\/p><p> I do not believe Deputy McGrath's approach is too distant from mine.  I accept the points he made and we will examine in next year's budget the anomaly at the entry point to the higher rate.<\/p><p> Deputy Pearse Doherty and Deputy Boyd Barrett hold a different position.  They are opposed to the policies on personal taxation that are enshrined in the budget and Finance Bill.  Anyone considering the impact of tax must consider a range of taxes, as when the Deputies asked us to take account of water charges in addition to personal taxation.  However, Deputy Doherty wants the marginal rate of income tax to go from 40% to 48% and he also wants a wealth tax.  He would tax the economy out of existence if he brought in those two measures in the same year.  I do not run with scare stories about people leaving the country, but I certainly do not believe one will get 15,000 extra jobs if those proposed tax measures are introduced.  I could not quantify the result but I am strongly of the view that there would be a reduction in the number of jobs and the propensity of young emigrants to come home if both measures were introduced.  I have no problem with Deputy Doherty proposing these measures for debate but I am pointing out that there is a fundamental difference of approach between Sinn F&eacute;in and me.  I have outlined mine and Deputy Doherty has outlined his, but they are different.  The two do not meet.  There is no overlap or common purpose in respect of the proposals.  I am not criticising as I understand the policy position from which the Deputies come and that the effect of pursuing it is to move amendments along the lines of those tabled.  The Deputies' position is different from that of the Government, and ultimately the electorate will have to decide which approach it prefers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800013#M01600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416340200,"counter":389,"content":"<p>The Minister is correct that much of this is philosophical.

The concept of notional progressivity, as set out by the Minister with his percentages, fails to deal with the sense of injustice that people feel.  They do not look at graphs and say they are progressive based on equal proportions for different earners.  They note the fact that they cannot pay their bills while somebody who earns five times more than them is getting four or five times more back from the Government.  In such circumstances, they cannot help but feel this is unfair and wrong, and that it is a misdirected priority of the Government.<\/p><p>  The left has been very consistent on this.

The solution to the problem he has identified and articulated so well is to grow the economy in order that low-paid people can get a bigger share through higher wages and the retention of their income because of lower personal taxes.  That is the drive and objective, and that is where I am going to take it if I get another year or two at this.

As I stated, a single person with a gross income of &euro;70,000 may look very well off but is paying more than &euro;25,000 of that in personal taxes.  The solution required is not that of the Deputy but to do everything possible to grow the economy, put more people back to work and ensure there are decent pay increases coming back into the system.  In so far as tax buoyancy is available, it should be used to give back to all social sectors, particularly the low paid and those whom I believe comprise the squeezed middle earning salaries up to &euro;70,000.  That is not to say that people earning more than that do not need to have some relief also but my point is that they do not need disproportionate relief.  With the crudeness of the economic instruments, such as a tax rate, there can be a disproportionate benefit if one runs a 1% reduction on the marginal rate of tax for incomes of up to &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000.  There would be a huge gain in that case, and that is why there is a cap at &euro;70,000.<\/p><p>  It is not that those of us in the Government parties do not understand how difficult it is for people to live because we see it in our constituencies all the time.

The taxes have to be brought in because the deficit has to be reduced.  In order to get people back to work money has to be invested in the economy.  Instead, the Minister wants to levy more taxes on people to pay.  I refer to the water charges, property taxes, increased carbon taxes that were introduced in previous years, increased excise charges, prescription charges and medical charges.  All of those charges are indiscriminate of people's income or ability to pay.  It is not that the Minister is preventing all these additional taxes.  The problem is that bills are falling in the letterboxes of people who may be out of work or on very low incomes.

These two measures cost the State &euro;405 million yet not one person earning under &euro;32,000 will get a penny of it - none of them.  They will benefit from the USC changes later on but they will not see a penny from the &euro;405 million cost for these two measures.  The Minister has decided to focus that money on the middle income people and he has made a robust defence for doing so.  I suggest his position is flawed and that he has adopted the wrong priority at this time.  <\/p><p>  The Minister continually makes reference to immigrants in London and elsewhere who might not come home if we had a third rate of tax.  For example, reducing the tax to 40% may appeal to them and encourage them to come back.  Let us be clear, and he knows this better than me, England has three rates of tax.  First, the highest rate of 45% is levied on incomes above &pound;150,000.  Second, the middle tax is 40% and is the equivalent to the one here as it kicks in at about &pound;32,000.  He has failed to remember that England has a high PRSI levy of 12% which increases the percentage to 52%.  In reality a person in England who earns the equivalent of &euro;70,000 will pay more tax there than here.  In Australia and other jurisdictions to which he referred the kinds of difference in the systems mean that more is not paid.  However, somebody earning the higher amount of &pound;150,000 in England will pay far more tax in London, Edinburgh or anywhere else than he or she would in Ireland because the third rate of tax is 45% but there is a 12% social insurance contribution.  Also, the employers' social insurance contribution is way higher because we have the lowest employers' PRSI in Europe, apart from Denmark which does not operate such a scheme.  That is why our taxation system is crumbling.<\/p><p>  I want to know the following.  When will we get it right?  When will people who go to hospital not have to wait on a trolley in the accident and emergency unit?  What about when people go to school?  I suggest the Minister talks to teachers who will readily tell him they know well just by looking at the children that they have not had breakfast.  Does he know why?  It is because the children cannot concentrate.  Their eyes move back and forward and they cannot concentrate when their teacher talks to them.  Lack of breakfast means their concentration span is very short and only lasts a couple of minutes.  Breakfast clubs are being rolled out because parents do not have the disposable income to feed their children.  However, the Minister has &euro;405 million at his disposal but he has decided to focus it on individuals who earn between &euro;32,000 and &euro;70,000.  As I said, there is no doubt that some of them are hard pressed but a lot of them are not, particularly when compared with areas in society that need the retention more.<\/p><p>  This is a philosophical debate but it is also a factual one.  The Minister has made the wrong choices.  He said he is a constituency Deputy with which I have no argument.  I suggest that he has not mixed enough with people who have been battered and bruised by the Government's policies over the past three years and the policies of the last Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Administration.  People are at the end of their tether and that is why 150,000 have taken to the streets.  All they can see are water charges being imposed without a reprieve.  The Government has decided to focus the money it has available not on the least well off in society but on what it believes is a pressed cohort of individuals.  I agree that they are pressed but they should not be the priority at this point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800015#O00600","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416340800,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I will press on again.  The Deputy has described people who are suffering from the economic collapse in the country for a number of years and still are suffering.  He described that in very cogent terms and I do not think he will get much disagreement on it either from Labour Party Deputies or Fine Gael Deputies.<\/p><p>  The Deputy was incorrect to say that Fine Gael is a high tax party.  We happen to live in a high tax country for reasons which we all know about, principally because of the policy mistakes made by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Administration.  I do not want to recite the mistakes again but that is part of the base from which we are working. <\/p><p>  Fine Gael is not a high tax party.  We will reduce taxes as soon as we have the wherewithal to do so and we have started this year.  I suggest the Deputy looks at what we have done since we went into Government.  We were not a high tax party when we rescued the tourism industry by reducing VAT from 13.5% to 9%.  We did that when we had very little money.  We had to raise it elsewhere, principally by a pension levy that many people objected to.  We did so because we thought it was a successful policy instrument and it was the first step to rebuild the tourism industry.  We continued rebuilding it by abolishing another tax - the travel tax.  Those initiatives are not the mark of a high tax party.  The travel tax allowed all the airlines, but led by Ryanair, to bring an extra 1.5 million people in and out of the country in the past 12 months.  Other developments which were novel but not tax-related, like The Gathering and the Wild Atlantic Way, have added to improving the sector, and now we have a re-investment in hotels.  I have outlined a model of a particular sector but the first driver was a low tax position.<\/p><p>  We are committed as well to a 12.5% corporation tax.  On budget day I said that the rate was a red line, non-negotiable and not to even talk about it to us if one is from another jurisdiction trying to put pressure on us.  That is a low tax position.  We will also try to reduce personal taxes and we have started this year.  I admit to the Deputy that the starting position is a high tax one.  I reassert that our policy is to reduce taxes, particularly personal taxes.  <\/p><p>  The OECD has a hierarchy of taxes.  It says that income tax increases are the second most damaging tax to the provision of jobs and that consumption taxes are the least damaging.  It is worth considering that in detail.  I do not pluck out taxes arbitrarily and nor do I pick my priorities arbitrarily.  I try to deal with those measures that have the most economic effect and personal taxation has a big economic effect.  By any standards, personal taxation in Ireland is too high.  We have the most progressive tax system in the OECD but personal taxation is too high and people get to the higher rates too fast.<\/p><p>  People have said we should do more for the low paid.  If one does not pay tax one cannot do much for people through the tax system but help can be provided in other ways.  The Government was very conscious of the difficulties being experienced by families on low income and significant changes were made in child benefit by the Minister for Social Protection.  She is restoring a quarter of the Christmas bonus, again a feature of this budget.  That shows there are other ways of directing money to people.  <\/p><p>  I will defend emphasising those that hit the higher income of &euro;32,800 and that cohort of people up to &euro;70,000.  One can make it impersonal and turn it into a statistic. <\/p> <p>Who are they?  What couple is on &euro;70,000?  One gets a young fellow who is just back on a building site, a young fellow working in a factory, or a young schoolteacher or garda who is married to a young nurse or a girl who might work in the local shopping centre who might have &euro;70,000 between them.  The Deputy is saying they should not get tax breaks proportionate to their income and that they should contribute to Deputy Boyd Barrett's model where one takes more off them to redistribute it to people who are worse off.  That makes no sense.  If one looks at the people we are talking about, they are among the 1.9 million people at work who vote for Deputy Doherty as well as for me and he meets them every day of the week.  The Deputy should not turn them into a wealthy statistic, because they are not.  They are real people who find it hard enough to live.<\/p><p> It is easy to make a case for someone who seeks help from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I do not criticise anyone who makes such a case, but it comes back to my fundamental point that this country has come through the worst crisis since the Second World War, and probably since the Famine.  It has been an absolute disaster.  We are building the economy up slowly.  There has to be a set of consistent policies to do that.  In my view, the only cure for the ills of society, as described by Deputy Boyd Barrett, which come from low income levels, is to grow the economy and make sure that people on low and middle incomes get a proportionate share of the gains and that the gains are not hived off by a group at the top.  That is what we are about.  That is why we want to get more people back to work.  That is why we want to bring young emigrants home.  That is why the budget has been designed in the way set out.<\/p><p> I do not say the Deputies are not entitled to advance their policies, that they are not socially concerned or that they do not believe what they say.  Neither do I say the Deputies are not men of goodwill and that their parties are not people of goodwill, but what I say is that their economic model is wrong and it will do harm rather than good.

No. 325 of 2012) shall be exempt from income tax and shall not be reckoned in computing income for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>The amendment provides for the insertion of a new section, section 204B, into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide for an exemption from income tax in respect of compensation for living kidney donors.  Such donors will generally incur expenses associated with travel and accommodation as well as suffering loss of income during the process of providing a donation.  The donation of a kidney is governed by EU directive 2010\/53\/EU of 7 July 2010 on standards of quality and safety of human organ transplantations.  The directive sets out a common framework on quality and safety standards for organs of human origin intended for transplantation into the human body.  It also aims to protect donors and optimise exchanges between member states and third countries.<br\/>The directive was given effect in Irish law by way of European Union (Quality and Safety of Human Organs Intended for Transplantation) Regulations 2012, SI 325 of 2012.  Article 21 of the regulation stipulates that living donors may receive compensation for a donation provided it is strictly limited to making good the expenses and loss of income related to the donation.  It goes on to say that the Minister for Health shall define the conditions under which such a compensation may be granted &quot;while avoiding there being any financial incentive or benefits for a potential donor&quot;.  This new section provides for an exemption from income tax in respect of the reimbursement of expenses incurred by living donors under the conditions defined by the Minister for Health under these regulations.  Such reimbursements may apply to vouched expenses of travel and accommodation up to a maximum of &euro;6,000, and loss of income related to a donation up to a maximum of &euro;6,000.  The Minister for Health will shortly publish a document, entitled Policy on Reimbursement of Expenses of Living Kidney Donors, which will define the conditions under which the expenses of travel, accommodation and loss of income related to donations may be reimbursed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800016#P00900","speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416341400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416341400,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Sections 6 and 7 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416341400,"counter":410,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416341400,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 8 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1416341400,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I have a brief query on the section.

It will be a while before the construction industry provides new rental accommodation to any great extent, even in Dublin.  While it is to be hoped that a lot of activity will commence in the course of the year, there will be a time lapse before it is completed and rented.  It was brought to my attention that there are 475,000 rental properties in the State, of which approximately 5,000 are bedsits in Dublin that cannot be rented due to new standards for rental accommodation that came into effect in February 2014.

The regulation introduced in 2014 states that all bathroom and toilet facilities must be en suite.  This provision has taken approximately 5,000 bedsits in Dublin out of the rental market and has aggravated the supply and shortage problems.  Again, I cannot guarantee it but I wish to incentivise landlords who, I am told, are not the wealthy ones but are at the lower end of the rental market and who really no longer have the funds or the interest to carry out this work.

I will ascertain whether there is a solution to the problem but I am not making a commitment to the Deputy.  However, I will revert to him on Report Stage with a view as to whether his suggestion is possible.

However, setting all that aside, my concern is that the unintended beneficiaries of this measure might be the very big investors, notwithstanding the Minister's intention to direct it at bedsits and to encourage smaller-scale landlords to renovate some of these unsuitable properties or those properties which no longer even fit within the criteria and to make them available.  What is to prevent this measure from being of major benefit to the much larger corporate investors in property?

In addition, like the home improvement scheme, it will have to be put up on the website and we will know what contractors are carrying out the work and what are the applications.  Consequently, they can be tracked by Revenue and if there is any obvious abuse, we will be in a position to deal with it.

It is not possible to get relief unless one is paying income tax.  Most of those involved would not have a huge income tax liability.  Those who have would run out of headroom to avail of the tax credit.  Obviously, they could defer some of it to the following year and so on.

I am glad that the Minister has introduced an amendment to exempt officeholders, including Ministers and Ministers of State, from having their water charges deductible from their tax liability through the dual abode allowance.  At the time that I highlighted this issue, having clarified with Revenue that Ministers and Ministers of State were entitled to do this, the Minister was quick to respond that this matter would be addressed in the Finance Bill.  I again welcome that he has done so.  However, the dual abode allowance is not only about the water tax.<\/p><p>  I genuinely believe that the system in respect of the claiming of expenses for officeholders, including Ministers, such as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and Ministers of State, needs to change.  It should be far more transparent.  I cannot understand why it does not replicate the system for other Members of the Houses.  While most information in respect of this system is published on the Oireachtas website, other issues are dealt with in a very secretive manner.  For example, we know so far that ten officeholders of this Government have availed of the dual abode allowance but none of us know for what purpose they have availed of it.  A current officeholder who is a Minister or Minister of State can purchase a house in Dublin and can have his or her agents, architects and solicitors fees and mortgage interest in respect of that house written off against their tax bill.  He or she could also have maintenance in respect of upkeep of that house, which equates to approximately &euro;6,350, written off against their tax bill.  We do not know if that has been done because there is no transparency and Revenue will not, and rightly so, disclose individual's tax arrangements.  If the system in respect of Ministers and Ministers of State was the same as that used by other Members, it would at least be auditable and published in terms of the overall allowances received.<\/p><p>  In acknowledging that Ministers, Ministers of State and other officeholders will now not be able to claim back water charges under the dual abode allowance, I do not understand the system relating to the maintenance of a second residence in a hotel.  It appears that a person who maintains a second residence in a hotel, guesthouse, etc., as many Ministers and Ministers of State do, is entitled to an allowance equivalent to the cost of room rental, which is fair.  However, in addition, the officeholder is entitled to an allowance in respect of vouched additional costs associated with maintaining a second residence in a hotel and, as an alternative to vouched expenses, the officeholder can claim a flat rate allowance of &euro;3,500 per annum.  Whichever method is adopted will continue throughout the period of office.  When I clarified what was meant in this regard, it was suggested that the claim could be in respect of laundry expenses.  This is ridiculous.  There should not be in place a system which permits people to claim these benefits without any transparency and to have them written off against their tax liability.  People should not be able to claim unvouched allowances in respect of which there is no transparency in terms of what is available.<\/p><p>  I suggest that the Minister do what the Taoiseach when in opposition a short number of years ago committed to do, namely, he should abolish the dual abode allowance and bring officeholders under the statutory instrument under which the cost of staying in accommodation in Dublin is met.  The availability of a &euro;3,500 allowance in respect of the maintenance of a second residence is wrong.  If I was appointed a Minister of State today and I decided to buy a property in Dublin, I could have the agent, architect and solicitors fees, mortgage interest and &euro;6,350 per annum written off against my tax liability.  That is a huge bonanza.  Perhaps nobody is doing this but that this system exists is not acceptable in a situation where tens of thousands of our people are struggling to keep a roof over their heads.<\/p><p>  I agree with the payment of expenses in respect of a person who has a second home in the capital or needs to stay in a guesthouse and so on, but the system in this regard needs to be transparent.  I accept that my amendment has been ruled out of order but I suggest that the Minister go further than what was proposed therein and do what was proposed by the Taoiseach when in opposition and abolish the dual abode allowance.  Perhaps the Minister will outline the rationale for retaining this allowance in its current form.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800019#S00800","speaker":"959"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416343200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Deputy Kieran O'Donnell took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1416343200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>It appears that the purpose of amendment No. 8 was the abolition of the dual abode allowance, which is a tax deduction allowed to Ministers, Ministers of State and the Attorney General in respect of the cost of maintaining a second residence.  Section 836 of the Taxes Consolidation Act provides for a tax deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of the cost of maintaining a second residence where arising out of the performance of his or her duty a Minister or Minister of State is obliged to maintain that second residence in addition to his or her main residence.  The allowance is confined to officeholders who represent constituencies outside the Dublin area.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, overnight expenses are not paid to officeholders.  Such expenses apply only to Deputies and Senators who are not officeholders.  For this reason, I would not be able to accept the amendment.  The position is as outlined.  I cannot comment on individual cases because the Revenue does not share information on individual cases.  I do not know of any person in the current Administration who has purchased a second house in Dublin.  Perhaps there is a person, or more than one person, who has done so.  Typically, people rent an apartment and claim tax in respect of the cost of doing so.  For example, by taking an apartment on which the rent per month is &euro;1,400 or &euro;1,500 per month and multiplying it by 12 and taking away 41% of the end amount, the Deputy will see how short the amount which can be claimed is of the overnight expenses which all Deputies who are not officeholders receive.  It has reached the point - I am sure the Deputy is well aware of this - that Ministers of State in particular were much better off before they were promoted, in financial terms, because the dual abode allowance goes nowhere near compensating them for what they lose out in terms of overnight expenses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111800019#S00900","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1416343200,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Under the dual abode allowance, anybody renting accommodation gets the full amount of the rental cost written off their tax bill.

How much does the Deputy get in overnight allowances?  I should not personalise the question, but how much does a Deputy, claiming full overnight allowances, get?  If the Deputy does the maths, he will see that rather than gaining, officeholders lose dramatically in this regard.

An Oireachtas Member who stays in a hotel can have the full cost of the hotel written off their tax bill, and also have another &euro;3,500 written off.  It is not a case that one gets 41% relief; one gets the sum written off the tax bill.  In the other situation where one has one's own accommodation, one gets &euro;6,000 written off.  It is not transparent and it should not happen in that way.  Even if it costs the State more money, officeholders who represent constituencies outside Dublin should have a more transparent system of expenses for their accommodation when they are staying in Dublin.  We need transparency.<\/p><p>  Imagine if one put a face to the name of an officeholder and the Taoiseach bought a nice property in Shrewsbury Road and had the fees for his architect, agent and solicitor written off his tax bill as a result of this dual abode allowance.

I am not suggesting the Taoiseach has done this.  I am sure he has not done it, but the provision in our tax code is wrong.  The Taoiseach was correct when he said that he would abolish it.  The Minister for Finance is correct when he says that one should not be able to claim property tax and water charges, but that ministerial amendment needs to go further.  I know the Minister will not do it now but I suggest, and I am sure he would get the backing of his colleagues in Cabinet and the support of the Ministers of State for it, that he introduces a more transparent system so that all Oireachtas Members are in the same system.  If officeholders are staying overnight in the capital, they should be entitled to the same level of expenses as other Oireachtas Members.  There should be no secret arrangement with the Revenue that allows officeholders to have their tax liability written down.<\/p><p>  I have been tracking these figures for many years.
