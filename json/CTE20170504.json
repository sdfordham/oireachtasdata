It operates racing activities through 11 subsidiary companies and licenses greyhound racing at other privately owned tracks.  With effect from 2015, it has also operated catering and beverage services at its tracks.  Those services were previously outsourced.  At a previous meeting, the Chairman asked for a diagram explaining the group.  It is on screen now.  I have tried to indicate what comprises the group and the extent of my audit, which includes the head organisation and a company called Abargrove, which provides the catering services and operates the Newbridge track.  The ten other subsidiary companies operate greyhound tracks that are run by Bord na gCon.  A number of other tracks are privately owned but have received grant assistance from Bord na gCon.<\/p> <p>  Overall, the Bord na gCon group achieved a surplus for 2015 of &euro;438,000.  Its accumulated revenue reserves amounted to just &euro;46,000 as at the end of that year.  Bord na gCon received State funding of &euro;13.6 million in 2015, which was sourced from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  The 2015 surplus from racing activities was &euro;617,000.  This included a net profit of &euro;1.9 million from tote betting on turnover of &euro;19.6 million.  Excluding betting, track activities resulted in a net loss of &euro;1.3 million in the year.  Bord na gCon paid out &euro;6.5 million in prize money in 2015, towards which dog owners and sponsors contributed &euro;1.9 million.  General administration costs in the year amounted to &euro;9.2 million.<\/p> <p>  The audit report on the 2015 financial statements drew attention to note No. 24, which disclosed the basis on which the board was satisfied that it was able to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.  Some members will recall that I reported on the acquisition of land and the development of a racetrack and new corporate headquarters at Greenpark in Limerick, which was completed in 2010.  Since then, Bord na gCon has been carrying a high level of borrowing related to that development, as shown in the diagram that is now on screen.  The lighter coloured bar is the borrowing level.  In the same period, there has been a significant erosion of the group's operating surplus.  Hence, the need for the note on the going concern basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017050400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General.

The Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, is reporting an operating profit before interest, depreciation and taxation of &euro;2.3 million for the 12 months to 31 December 2015.  The comparable figure in 2014 was &euro;700,000.  The IGB also reduced its long-standing debt by &euro;1.35 million in 2015 and has since reduced it by a further &euro;700,000.<\/p><p>The generation of surplus allowed the board to increase race grants by 20% since the start of 2016.  Average attendance per meeting in 2015 was up 4% on the prior period, average gate income increased by 3% and average tote spend per customer was up 2% on the previous year.  The 2015 accounts show improvements under some metrics, but these do not disguise the difficulties the greyhound industry faces.  That said, the industry in Ireland is worth defending.  The economist, Jim Power, estimated the direct and indirect employment in the industry at approximately 10,000 staff in 2011.  The IGB employs almost 800 full-time and part-time staff.  The industry supplies the raw materials in the form of greyhounds to greyhound racing internationally.  A total of 83% of greyhounds racing in the UK in 2016 were bred in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The IGB's difficulties are not unique.  The industry globally is facing many challenges, notably as a result of the migration of wagering from track to technology platforms which has impacted on live attendances at race meetings.  With the closure of Wimbledon stadium recently, London, for example, now has no greyhound track, from a high of 33.  In the United States, there are only ten tracks operating full time.  In Australia, the industry is under huge pressure and, therefore, the notion that Ireland would somehow be unaffected by the reasons which have contributed to the nationwide decline is a nonsense.  Ireland, <i>per capita<\/i>, still has the highest number of stadia in the world, which is a reflection of the strength of the industry.  The number of stadia in the Republic, IGB and private, is 16.  There are 24 stadia run by the Greyhound Board of Great Britain, GBGB, in the entire UK.  The IGB's remit is to manage the industry against the background of current market realities and, critically, to deal with a crippling, systemic overhang of debt.  That debt stood at &euro;20.3 million at the end of 2016, compared with a turnover of &euro;31 million, excluding Exchequer funding.  It may also be of interest that the current board has reduced the debt by &euro;2 million and is the first board to pay down debt.<br\/><br\/>All these difficulties to which I have referred were known to lndecon consultants when they were commissioned by the then Minister in 2014 to carry out what is regarded as the most comprehensive review of the industry ever undertaken.  It is important to state that everyone in the industry - ourselves and critics of the board included - were extremely pleased that such a review would be undertaken.  The difference between us at this point is that the board has accepted the Indecon conclusions and recommendations, which were also accepted by then Minister, and has sought to implement them.  It is important to state also that lndecon also felt strongly that if the appropriate actions were taken, as laid out in its review, then the industry had a viable future.  One of the key recommendations was that an asset disposal programme would be adopted to include the sale of Harold's Cross, which was then, and still is, the asset most likely to yield significant value.  Notwithstanding the lndecon report and the support of Government for the recommendation, the decision to close Harold's Cross was something the board of the IGB agonised long and hard about.  Harold's Cross was an iconic stadium of great importance to our Dublin colleagues who have a huge emotional attachment to it.  We acknowledge that the closure is a blow to the greyhound fraternity in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>I assure the committee that we will bend over backwards to ensure that Harold's Cross racing finds a welcoming, respectful home in Shelbourne Park stadium.  The decision to sell Harold's Cross is not solely predicated on its potential value to the IGB or its contribution to the resolution of the debt issue but is also based on the fact that it is two miles from Shelbourne Park, which is twice its size and operates for a limited period every week, as indeed does Harold's Cross.  It does not make commercial sense.  The effective closure of the IGB's national arena for the past ten weeks by those opposed to the closure of Harold's Cross Stadium is clearly not sustainable.  In addition to the loss of &euro;300,000 that has been incurred by the IGB, the disruption of racing has cost owners and trainers &euro;250,000 in prize money.  The IGB cannot haemorrhage money in this way and unless there is a resolution, and I have to make this clear, the end game is the cessation of all racing nationally.  The easy option for the board is to kick the issue of debt further down the road and to pretend that it does not exist or that it can be magicked away.  We were appointed to do a job and we will face up to our responsibilities, even if our decision to do so is unpopular.  It is important also to understand that the debt issue is not some abstract problem or an accountancy issue.  It is an issue that grievously inhibits the capacity of the board to invest in the industry, protect its national footprint, encourage new ownership and breeding, address issues around the industry demographic, reach out to the leisure market and exploit the opportunities of online wagering.<br\/><br\/>We want a vibrant and rejuvenated greyhound industry with the highest standards in animal welfare and integrity, that is celebrated as uniquely Irish, embraced by all, thereby securing its place as a major national sport, and has a place for all participants, including breeders, owners, professional trainers and those involved full-time and part-time.  We want an industry that delivers a world-class racing product in a rejuvenated stadium network delivering that best visitor experience for leisure customers and racing fans while distributing racing across all technology platforms.  We want to make Shelbourne Park a state-of-the-art stadium to rival others in the capital, such as the Aviva Stadium and Croke Park, and to allow it to operate as many nights as possible and attract new corporate and leisure audiences as well as having premium facilities for our owners, trainers and greyhounds.  There is also a requirement to upgrade other stadia if we are serious about expecting those other than the diehard greyhound racing constituency to attend our events.  We need to invest further in information technology to ensure we continue to exploit the opportunities the migration to online wagering and the constantly evolving technology<br\/><br\/>platforms in all their forms present.<br\/><br\/>Prize money needs to be increased, as does ownership, especially through syndication.  On welfare, we need to build on what we have been doing in recent years and ensure full traceability for dogs.  By any objective yardstick, the IGB has made huge strides in the area of regulation and integrity in recent years and we wish to keep that momentum going.  We want to develop a clear pathway into the industry for those who wish to participate, with a range of support options, including training and professional development.  All these areas require capital for investment.  We do not have access to it and are trading at the maximum of our banking limits.  We can have access to capital by sticking with the decision to close Harold's Cross and to realise the value of the asset, pay down debt and reinvest in the industry.<br\/><br\/>As an organisation, are we doing as well as we possibly can?  No.  There are still operational and structural weaknesses we need to sort out, but we have made progress, and I am happy that we have considerable skills represented at board and executive level across finance and business, veterinary, regulation and law to ensure we continue the progress that has been made and perform better in future.  The members of this delegation are more conscious than anyone of the backdrop to this appearance before the committee.  There is no doubt we are at a critical stage in the life of the greyhound industry.  Our ambition is to deliver a commercial, well-regulated greyhound racing and breeding industry, enabling the delivery of a customer-centred, highly exciting and value-led entertainment experience.  That requires difficult decisions to be made now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017050400002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Meaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I will call our lead speaker for this session, which is Deputy Peter Burke.

I thank Mr. Meaney for his opening statement.  With regard to the management of the greyhound industry, it is clear the sector is at a crossroads.<\/p><p>In the context of the current board, the committee must assess the results presented in the 2015 annual report and how the board has driven matters in respect those results.  My concern is that the board's judgment has been called into question on a number of occasions in recent years.  First, on a question I posed to Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine officials, the 2015 accounts did not appear on the IGB website until February 2017, which, I suggest, is not in the interests of transparency and fairness.  Second, with regard to the reduction in prize money, while it is said the IGB has a cash surplus, at what cost is this to the industry in terms of shrinkage?  We are talking about reduced prize money and increased tote retention, which essentially means less value for the punter attending the track.  While this may be a short-term gain for the IGB, it will have significant consequences in the future.<\/p><p> On Enterprise Targeting Solutions, it was openly admitted by the board at a previous meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that it had not done its homework in checking out the company before the sponsorship contract was signed.  Legal fees rose substantially in 2015 to &euro;1.443 million, having been &euro;587,000 in 2014, and there have been a number of high-profile incidents surrounding that.  It is very important that greyhound racing is marketed correctly.  We have seen the issues surrounding the logistics of the closure of Harold's Cross and how that was carried out.  I am aware that a number of families had aimed to attend on St. Valentine's night and had booked out the restaurant.  If we are spending money on marketing, that gives a terrible view of the industry and how we go about our business in terms of the capacity to make decisions.<\/p><p> The first point I want to focus on in the 2015 annual report is wages.  Prize money and the overall turnover of the sector are decreasing but the one thing that is definitely not decreasing is wages.  I know the catering section was taken over.  It is stated on page 39 of the report that &euro;867,791 is the direct and operational cost and that food and beverage staff-related costs were &euro;2.778 million.

In the past 16 months we have had to resolve the three high court cases.  They have been resolved.  We have resolved the defined benefit scheme.  We reduced the balance sheet liability by &euro;5 million in 2016.  We have introduced several statutory instruments relating to regulation of drugs and remedies.  We have purchased a new laboratory machine in Limerick.  Considerable work has been done in the 16 months, despite what others might say.  The bank debt is the big thing we need to resolve.  The bank debt will be resolved in the coming months.  It will reduce the debt substantially.

One cannot build a house on a poor surface.  Many businesses throughout the country go into trouble.  Had they not attained financial stability, they would not be trading today.  The IGB is no different.  It has an overhanging debt that it cannot repay.  It is generating circa &euro;3 million per annum on the basis of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.  We cannot build a future business if we do not have a stable business to build from.  At the end of this process, it will be a stable business.  It will be able to reinvest in some of the capital issues necessary.  We will be able to refurbish our national stadium in Shelbourne Park.  More important, we will be able to give money back to breeders, owners and trainers.

The reason for that rule, I guess, is that there is a desire to avoid a situation where a public body would have to enter into a bidding war with private developers in the context of providing a public asset.  That is the reason the rule is there and the process that the chief executive has described is consistent with that circular and consistent with that rule.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017050400002#S06200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I find that answer almost unbelievable.

That is the purpose, it is not to create a bidding war or to encourage one but it is done to get the best possible return.  The reason I asked this is because there could be a perception that the Department of education buying this is a sort of state bailout of an organisation that has clearly failed.  The Department of education comes in and writes a cheque for &euro;15 million, wipes out a lot of the debt, every one is happy and, as usual, no one is held to account for the failures, mismanagement, poor judgment and everything else.  There is no point in asking that of the witnesses because they obviously will not agree, but it is a question that needs to be put.  When asking that question, I want to hear from the Secretary General of the Department of education as to why the Department was interested in these lands, who alerted it to it, what are its plans, what is it paying for it and all those issues.  I want to hear from the Department too and maybe we can come back to that at another time.

In terms of the pattern of decline, the largest decline occurred in the period up to 2012-13.  In the intervening years, from 2014 to 2016, we have managed to stabilise the attendances and the revenues.  Gate income for the first time in 2016 has stabilised and attendances stabilised over the 2014-15 period.  In 2015, average gate attendances increased by 4% to 5% on what they were in 2014.

Regarding the comparison, the narrative that has been around is how the IGB Tote has not been operating or functioning to the same level as the HRI Tote and the horse Tote.  However, if one is going to adopt that narrative, one should have a direct comparison of like for like.  The on-Tote revenues for horse racing and greyhound racing have continued to operate in very challenging betting environments since 2007, with a decline in Tote revenues of 67.9% at domestic horse tracks and 66% at greyhound tracks.  Therefore, when one compares on-track Tote performance, there is a very similar level of decline.

The statement on internal financial control in the 2015 appropriation account for Vote 20 - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, includes a disclosure that a number of features of the provision of ancillary services in the Garda College were not compliant with standard public governance procedures, and that an examination by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's internal audit was ongoing.<\/p> <p>  The internal audit report finds that on a number of occasions over the past decade issues had arisen within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about certain financial procedures at the college.  These issues were not communicated to my office until 31 May 2016 when the head of the Garda's internal audit, Mr. Niall Kelly, notified us of the concerns. That was after the 2015 appropriation account had been submitted to me for audit, and while the audit was under way.  Mr. Kelly informed us that he planned to undertake an internal audit of the college&rsquo;s affairs, and that duly commenced on 22 June 2016.  On 29 August 2016, internal audit informed us that an interim report had been drafted, and that significant issues had been identified that required further investigation.  Because we did not have a report or the detail of the findings at that stage, we asked the Accounting Officer to amend the 2015 statement on internal financial control to disclose the non-compliance with corporate governance standards, and advised that an investigation was ongoing.  I signed off on the audit on 5 September 2016.<\/p> <p>  A copy of the interim report executive summary was provided to my office on 13 September 2016.  We were provided with the final report on the internal audit on 22 March 2017.<\/p><p>We are examining the information and concerns outlined in the internal audit report and will be examining relevant records as part of the audit of the 2016 appropriation account to identify the implications for Vote 20 and other Votes, if relevant.

Many of the issues identified have their roots in the 1980s before the Garda Commissioner became the Accounting Officer.  While attempts were made to address some of these issues, they were not sufficient and did not go far enough.  While some practices, as identified in the interim audit report, should not have happened and are certainly well short of modern financial procedures and controls and public sector governance and financial procedures, it should be noted that the report has found the majority of expenditure at the Garda College is managed to a high standard and compliant with the Garda finance code.  It is also important to provide reassurance that the Garda College continues to provide high quality training.<\/p> <p>  As Accounting Officer, I take my statutory responsibility for how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na spends taxpayer&rsquo;s money very seriously.  It is vital that it be spent efficiently and effectively and in the best interests of the people, the State and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is why on receipt of the draft interim internal audit report in September 2016 the Garda executive immediately accepted its findings and commenced implementation of the recommendations.  We are actively seeking to ensure the issues raised in the recently published report will be addressed as quickly as possible by putting strong financial and administrative controls in place in the Garda College.<\/p> <p>  When the matters raised at the Garda College came to the attention of the Garda executive in July 2015, they were of grave concern.  It was directed that a high level steering group, to include representatives from the Department of Justice and Equality, be established immediately.  Between July 2015 and March 2016, the steering group actioned a number of initiatives, including closing bank accounts and seeking legal advice to resolve some of the complex issues associated with unwinding the existing systems and governance arrangements.  <\/p> <p>  In March 2016 the Garda internal audit unit was appointed to examine all of the issues involved.  It produced a draft interim report in September 2016, including a total of 19 recommendations.  Given the seriousness of the issues identified, all of the recommendations were accepted immediately.  At the time all interested parties were also invited to make submissions.  The report was finalised and accepted by the Garda audit committee in March 2017 and published by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The March 2017 report and its recommendations have been accepted fully by the executive.<\/p> <p>  Since September 2016, activity has been focused on implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  In that time we have also sought the advice of independent external governance experts.  I will outline some of the actions taken to date.  <\/p> <p>  Responsibility for college administration, including revised financial procedures, has now been assigned to an acting interim principal administrator.  The administrator is a civilian Garda member at principal officer level who has not previously worked at the Garda College and who has experience of public financial procedures.  The administrator is heading an interim administration team in the Garda College.  <\/p> <p>  A new operational structure for administrative functions and ancillary services in the Garda College has been designed and we are seeking approval from the Policing Authority to recruit personnel with the appropriate financial and administrative skills.  External accountants have been appointed to provide specialist accounting services and advice on the implementation of the recommendations made in the interim audit report.  <\/p> <p>  The number of bank accounts identified in the interim audit report in the Garda College has been reduced to six.  We are in the process of closing down the remaining accounts in line with the recommendations of the report.  <\/p> <p>  We are working with the Office of Public Works to ensure all interests in the lands are in State ownership.  We are working with the Office of Government Procurement to prepare tenders for the provision of food and ancillary services in the Garda College.  The Institute of Public Administration is to provide training for appropriate Garda staff and members on public financial procedures and standards.  <\/p> <p>  A dedicated project team has been put in place to ensure the interim audit report&rsquo;s recommendations will be fully implemented.  The project team reports to the steering committee chaired by the chief administrative officer, Mr. Nugent.  It includes a representative from the Department of Justice and Equality.  Regular updates on progress are provided for the head of internal audit, the Garda audit committee, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Policing Authority.  An assistant commissioner has been tasked with conducting a preliminary examination to establish whether there are other matters that require further inquiry and, if so, to make recommendations on the appropriate approach to be adopted.  <\/p> <p>  The practices identified in the interim audit report are unacceptable.  We are actively implementing the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  As I have said publicly on other matters, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na uncovered these deficiencies and we are working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality, the Policing Authority, the Garda audit committee, the Office of Public Works and the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure they cannot happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017050400002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":812,"content":"<p>The lead speaker in the first session is Deputy David Cullinane.

It is probably quite small money, but it is very troubling given that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did it.  The Garda Vote provides for Templemore a sum of money, as I understand it, for laundry services and-or supplementary food in the canteen or the mess, whatever they refer to it as.  For a period of time the college in Templemore was charging for the laundry service which led to large sums of money being accrued, which in turn led to money being transferred all over the place up to and including investment accounts and all the rest of it.<\/p> <p>  One of the troubling aspects of all of that, apart from it being unacceptable either from an accounting perspective or from a moral one, is that the moneys that were then transferred to the sports field then ended up being transferred in the amount of &euro;100,000 to the Garda Boat Club.  As stated in the interim report, the Garda Boat Club is a private organisation.  The report was very specific about who is in it.  It states that it is run by current and former staff and their families.  I have no problem with that.  I looked it up online and see it was established in 1954.  The website lists the committee, captains and all the rest of it.  It is a fairly open and transparent organisation from its public perspective.<\/p> <p>  However, &euro;100,000 was sent to a private institution and those who run it are not auditable or answerable to the Commissioner or anybody else for that matter.  The biggest issue I have with that is that those are public funds in a private organisation.  There is a term for that and it begins with an \"e\".

Its source is profits in various organisations, rent being procured - to which I will return in a minute - from a site owned by the State with the money originally being paid directly into the Garda accounts, but subsequently not - as the Commissioner identified.  Who controls the limited organisation that is the boat club?  Has the &euro;100,000 been returned?  I believe that was transferred between 2000 and 2003.

The Commissioner opened the door with regard to the fact that some of that money was being paid directly to the OPW.

I am not sure whether the Commissioner can answer that question.  Where did the money go in terms of the intended recipient?  I know it ended up in the restaurant account, the sports field account or one of those accounts.  Did nobody ask any questions?  How did it happen that this sum of money on an accumulated basis was sent around all sorts of different organisations?  Was Mr. Kelly aware of where the rent paid from that farm was going bearing in mind when that farm was purchased?

It is very important that we provide assurances to the committee and, by extension, to the public that actually we are not being remiss in doing this.  As soon as we became aware of these issues in 2015 they were immediately addressed, and we are actively engaging to ensure the recommendations highlighted in Mr. Kelly's report, albeit an interim report, are being fully implemented.  I have no doubt that as Mr. Kelly's work continues other issues will be identified, and we will also address these and deal with them.

That did not necessarily mean this was where they were.  For some reason or another they may have been temporarily transferred to another duty or they may have been taken off the front line to perform some vital and critical administrative function in the absence of civilian staff to do that particular work.  At this early stage the data are just coming in and are being cleaned in respect of going in to each of our divisions and districts, working with that original spreadsheet and then finding out exactly what everyone was doing on that day.  We hope to be able to present, in the next week or so, a detailed breakdown of what we would call the low-hanging fruit.  This would be the people who could immediately be transferred to the front line if we get civilian help in to replace them because they are doing vital work for us.  That runs to at least 200 personnel at this juncture but there is still more work to be done on this.<\/p> <p>  There is another tranche of people who are doing administration work, but they may be on restricted duties because of sickness or health issues.

We must put them in a position that will not put their health in danger.<\/p> <p>  There is another cohort of people who would traditionally have been assigned to offices.  Consider, for example, a district superintendent's office in the country.  Traditionally a Garda clerk would have been assigned to that superintendent.  We have to ask if this is still the position and do we still need a garda doing that work.  More in-depth work must be done on this issue because there are many views around it such as the view that a Garda perspective is needed in that role.  If we have civilians coming in at the bottom rung, they can work their way through the organisation and there is no reason why, in time, those positions could not also be civilianised.

I note on page 16 of the interim audit report that \"[t]here was a requirement from 2004 onwards from the Department of Finance for all Votes to have Risk Management Procedures in place\" and that this happened from 2010 through Garda management.  That is obviously a huge delay.  We were giving out earlier about Bord na gCon's delay in its process, but this is not something one would expect in such an advanced force as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The final line of the same paragraph reads: \"Despite these issues being identified as risks by the Finance Directorate, they were not included in the Garda College Risk Register, the Finance Directorate Risk Register or the Corporate Risk Register.\"  Has this been rectified?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017050400002#AAA00200","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1493884800,"counter":1429,"content":"<p>Yes.

We had issues about raising the awareness and establishing it as part of the culture of the organisation, and it was not fit for purpose as such.

At the time I talked about the internal audit report being comprised of a litany of failures and used the term sloppy practice.  Mr. Kelly used the terms irregular practice and maladministration, which I think we can accept.<\/p> <p>  Earlier I asked questions about the culture of the force.  What is the culture in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when these types of issues come to light?  How does the corporate body of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deal with them?  Are they dealt with in an appropriate manner?  After almost five hours of questioning and getting answers I am satisfied that the culture is not to root out wrongdoing and ensure the appropriate people have the appropriate information, and it certainly did not happen in this case.  That is my opinion.<\/p> <p>  The Commissioner can comment at the end but I have a couple of questions for Mr. Kelly.  Following on from Teachta McDonald's line of questioning earlier, I commend the fact that the Garda internal audit section, GIAS, did eventually publish a report.

When legislation is put in place, it applies to everybody.  I have responsibilities as a politician under the standards in public office, SIPO, legislation and under all Acts passed by Parliament.  I am one of those who is privileged to be in a position to put those laws in place.  We are all obliged to implement those laws and abide by them.  Instances have been illuminated in this report where bank accounts were opened without the permission of a Minister, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were directors of companies they should not been directors of, and land owned by the OPW was leased and the money generated used to pay for services that it should not been used for.  It is wholly unsatisfactory that there is a recommendation that &euro;128,000 derived from the Dromad Farm leasing arrangement be paid back to the OPW.  The taxpayer will foot the bill but, interestingly, I have discovered that the repayments to the OPW started in 2014.  Why did they start in 2014?

Will the Commissioner verify in writing to the committee that there is no such correspondence, emails or documents?  There are a number of requests for documents and information.  There is a huge volume as a result of this meeting and our hard working staff have kept a note of them.  The Commissioner has obviously kept a note of them also and we may be corresponding with her to make sure there is a correlation.  <\/p> <p>  In summary, this has been an extraordinary sitting and I thank the witnesses for their time.  I do not think I will ever attend a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts as extraordinary and incredible as this one.  Much of the evidence given was contradictory.  I do not think there is a unified theme, but that is just my observation.  There are massive issues.  There are also cultural issues in the organisation which say an awful lot about it.  I do not have confidence that the issues are being dealt with properly.  I do not have confidence that the issues have been dealt with appropriately in the past two years because of the trawl for information, the way information is being handled and the fact that people who try to have information brought to the very top of the organisation and made public are being thwarted on many levels.  We saw it happen in 2006, 2008, 2010 and, it could be argued, up to 2015.

This proposed constitutional amendment seeks to address significant concerns which have been strongly expressed by the public about the possible privatisation of public water services.  The public have indicated their strong desire to have the public water supply protected from privatisation.  This issue has been reflected as a matter of public importance in the report of the expert commission on domestic public water services which recommends constitutional protection from privatisation.  The Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services has also recommended that water should remain in public ownership and that a constitutional referendum should be held on that question.<\/p> <p>  It been recognised by both the expert commission and the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services that the appropriate means of addressing this issue is through our Constitution, as the people&rsquo;s document.  Constitutional protection can ensure that responsibility for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system remains the responsibility of Government and that this key public resource remains in public ownership into the future.  This also ensures the public interest can remain at the heart of decision-making into the future.<\/p> <p>  Providing constitutional protection also prevents the threat of a Government being strong-armed by an external authority or otherwise into transferring key assets and responsibilities to private interests.  It essentially puts it off the table and ensures the public water system and access to it is secure and protected into the future on behalf of the people.<\/p> <p>  The proposed amendment is designed to clarify and copper-fasten State ownership of the public water system as distinct from privately owned and operated water systems in the form of group water schemes and private wells and boreholes.  These privately owned water systems are not in public ownership.<\/p> <p>  The proposed amendment is also designed to clarify and copper-fasten the Government&rsquo;s responsibilities in terms of protecting, managing and maintaining the public water system in the public interest.

For clarity, if this referendum is passed, what implications, if any, will it have for the company called Irish Water, specifically and particularly in terms of its relationship with the company called Ervia, which is the holding company for Irish Water?  One of the problems I have always had, which relates to the intention behind setting up Irish Water, was that it would be a stand-alone entity and would not and could not be subject to the influence of Bord G&aacute;is, as it was initially, or Ervia, as it became.  I lost that argument in the debate with my political colleagues but it is one that concerns me.  Is there any implication for Ervia or the separation of Irish Water?  Would it better for Irish Water to be totally separate from its holding company in terms of the responsibility and accountability it will have under the Constitution?  While Ervia is a semi-State company, it is a commercial company.  I have concerns in that regard.

Before I ask my questions, I wish to put two general comments on the record.  The first is that it is significant that the single largest issue on which the expert commission received submissions of interest was, as Deputy Collins has outlined, the issue of the need for a referendum to protect the public ownership of the water and water services.  That is testament to how significant an issue this is among the public.  There were many things that those of us who sat through the 11 or 12 weeks of the hearings of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services did not agree on, but it is also significant that this was one of the issues, in terms of the core principle behind this Bill, on which we ended up reaching agreement.  We wanted to see such a constitutional protection, whatever the eventual wording.<\/p> <p>  The other point is that water is different.  Sometimes this gets lost in the public debate.  It is not like other so-called utilities.  Unlike fossil fuels that can be replaced by renewable energies etc., water is not replaceable.  Water is an increasingly finite resource and we are seeing in other parts of the world how the failure to manage this strategic asset adequately in the public interest is causing social, economic and cultural problems.  This is one of the most compelling arguments why this particular public resource needs to be retained in public ownership.<\/p> <p>  We received a briefing document from the Department.  It does not have an awful lot to say about the legislation but it raises a number of possible concerns.  I would be interested to hear the responses of Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail and Ms Brannick O'Cill&iacute;n to those concerns from a legal point of view.  The Department seems to be suggesting that there could be so-called unintended consequences if the wording of a constitutional amendment is not drafted carefully.  That is, that somehow assets which currently are private assets - privately owned boreholes, wells or group water schemes - could somehow be dragged into the definition of the public system.<\/p><p>What are the witnesses' views on it?  Do they think that there is currently any legal confusion about what is a public asset and what is a private asset?  If we were to pass this text into the Constitution by way of referendum, do they think it would allow assets which are today clearly private assets to be incorporated into the public system against the wishes of the owners of these assets?<\/p><p> The other issue that came up in the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services is this business of whether the State could sell decommissioned assets of the water system.  As we know, we have far too many water treatment plants.  Many of them are old and in a state of disrepair.  Irish Water has a plan to replace them and build new ones.  We will then have many of these facilities which will no longer be in use and therefore decommissioned and not part of the water system.  Is there anything in this text which would prevent Irish Water or any other public utility from selling those decommissioned assets once they are no longer part of the system?  Those are my questions.  Depending on how others proceed, I may come back with more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#D00500","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2348,"content":"<p>Similar to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I also have queries relating to the effect any such amendment would have on rural water schemes, group water schemes and privately owned wells.

As of now, I think there are 115 schemes for approximately 230 sites throughout the country.  What impact, if any, would it have on those?  Would the State still be able to participate in those schemes?<\/p> <p>  What assurance can be given that the management and oversight of the Irish Water entity will not shift from the Oireachtas to the Judiciary?

Critical issues arise at times and the courts decide them.  Then there is a precedent that governs any other issues that arise in that particular area.  This constitutional amendment, if accepted by the people, is no different from any other constitutional requirement except that it safeguards the public water supply in the public interest.  As I understand it, that is its main function and it is set out in the text.  The responsibility primarily lies with the Government.  The Government, as we know, generates the Bills that come into the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Therefore, the Government is in the best position of all, in the constitutional shadow, to protect the asset once this particular amendment goes into the Constitution, assuming it does.  I would have no trouble with that.<\/p> <p>  Public private partnerships have operated under the Constitution as it stands, with the requirement of the protection of private property.  I would not envisage that an extra layer or dimension, if one likes, of protection for public water supply would be any different in terms of its playing out in subsequent legislation or litigation.  I can only respond in general terms given that there is no particular example coming along the road.  When an issue arises in the courts and there is great uncertainty as to which way the courts will decide it, it is notorious that Article 35 in the Constitution gives that job ultimately to the Supreme Court.  We have a new Court of Appeal, but under the Constitution, the Supreme Court is still the deciding body for issues that go to the courts.  Often, in fairness to the courts, when an issue is decided in principle in one area, it assists in other areas in terms of clarity.  I hope Deputy Cowen can accept that rather vague explanation.<\/p> <p>  I have nothing further to add.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail"},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2351,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#E00500","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1493884800,"counter":2352,"content":"<p>Of course.  I agree with the tone of Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions.<\/p><p>I do not see any difficulty in distinguishing between private and public ownership of water supplies.  There was a question on what would happen to decommissioned assets.  When State companies have assets that are decommissioned, they are usually sold by the State company, such as Bord na M&oacute;na for example.  They can be sold, but they are sold subject to the requirements of Bord na M&oacute;na in its semi-State personality.  If there is any issue around public or private in that situation, Bord na M&oacute;na makes a decision which anybody can challenge.  The most famous challenge ever to Bord na M&oacute;na was about who owned the cutaway bogland.  That is now becoming very important because of the suggestion that we can have a huge lake in the midlands, drawn from the Shannon, to supply Dublin with water.  We have an underground aquifer on the Dublin-Kildare border that has been there since the ice age.  The experts say it can supply Dublin's domestic and commercial needs for 25 years but we might not want to tap it.  In respect of the cutaway bogland, the decision was that Bord na M&oacute;na's statutory remit from the Oireachtas was to cut, save and sell the turf.  The Oireachtas did not, however, give it ownership of the cutaway.  That was a famous case near Athlone many years ago.  That is still the law.  The position of these public bodies that have existed and served the people and the country very well in difficult times is not affected in any way by the passage of this referendum, which specifically deals with the public water supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2354,"content":"<p>I believe Deputy O'Dowd asked one further question.

For example, speaking in layman's language, I am aware in County Waterford that Waterford County Council has a number of old wastewater treatment plants that are no longer in use.  They are being decommissioned because new treatment plants have been installed.  They are obviously on pieces of land and they are now part of the overall water infrastructure.  How would Irish Water or the State dispose of those when they are no longer of use?  Will this amendment to the Constitution tie their hands so that they could not dispose of them?  I know Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail has tried to address that issue through his Bord na M&oacute;na response but, from what I heard, that was more or less about a product of the land, the turf or the briquettes, rather than about the land or infrastructure itself.  These are the technicalities that cause the complexity.

As the asset is no longer in the system, it is no longer covered by the amendment and there would be nothing to prevent Irish Water or another State agency from selling it on.  That is my reading of the situation, which I ask Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail to confirm. <\/p><p> I will be unfair to Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail by asking for a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer to my next question, which I acknowledge is difficult for a senior and eminent legal professional to say.  The Department included in its response to us the following line: \"unintended consequences that could impinge on individuals' [constitutional] rights to private property\".  I ask Mr &Oacute; Tuathail to state, as clearly as possible, whether he believes there is anything in the Bill put forward by Deputy Joan Collins that would have unintended consequences that could impinge the constitutional right of individuals to private property.

One can ask oneself the following question using any semi-State company.  What happens to C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann's buses when they are no longer fit for purpose and have for reasons of public safety been taken off the road?  Personally, I do not know what happens to them but, clearly, that would be a matter for the relevant State authority to decide and to get rid of.  I have mentioned that in some part of my presentation in which I stated that from the basis of first principles, if an asset relating to the public water system has become obsolete then it is no longer being used and cannot be considered to be part of the public water system.  Clearly, there would be a disposal way of doing it.<\/p> <p>  I can recall a period when Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann had a lot of obsolete railways.  There was a controversy years later about how it disposed of the sleepers and rails.  I have lost sight of the controversy since and it is long gone as an issue.  There were issues about the matter.  I understand they were issues of accounting for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann at the time, which was the responsible body.  If something becomes obsolete and is no longer of use in the public water system then clearly, like any properly managed asset, it should be disposed of.  There will be plenty of people willing to take that up.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question, I do not see any public-private issue arising from the proposed amendment.  If anybody has an issue, the legislation passed on foot of the amendment coming into place in the Constitution would either deal with the issue or it would become a matter for the court and the court would then deal with that issue.  The Deputy must remember that the proposed amendment refers to Article 28.  It does not apply to the private property article in the Constitution, which makes private property sacrosanct.  A constitution, when amended, must read as a whole.  One must read the entire Constitution and decide what is meant.  If there is an apparent conflict the courts come along and balance the Constitution and state what is the real meaning.  That is the specific function of the Supreme Court.  That aspect has operated successfully over the years in different contexts, with which I have no difficulty.   <\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the provision in the amendment that states: \"The Government shall be collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system.\"  The Government, on any of these issues, would have the best advice available to it via the Attorney General as to what should be done with something that has become obsolete or is no longer of use.  Let us say a new development arose for the distribution of water.  We know that there is a leakage of over 40% in the public water supply, which is being addressed.  If some issue arose that required the Government to take a view in light of the proposed amendment, assuming it is accepted, then the Government has the best advice available to it via the Office of the Attorney General, if required, and then the D&aacute;il, Seanad and the President can legislate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail"},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2370,"content":"<p>Do members have further questions?

The Department has not clarified why it has raised the clause of unintended consequences.  Its explanation should form part of the next debate on this matter.  If a question has arisen then the Department should identify the problems.  They have not done so because I do not believe problems exist.

At that time a good debate took place with Members on all sides of the House contributing.  That debate reinforced the fact that all of us share a common view on the State owning this vital public service.  Not once have I heard a dissenting voice in the Oireachtas on this issue. <\/p> <p>  There are a number of features of the water sector in Ireland that are relevant when considering the Bill.  First, the nature of our topography and population dispersal means that we have an extensive number of small, mainly surface water sources, rather than single large aquifers which can be the case in other countries.  In addition, the evolution of water services in rural areas has largely been dependent on private or group water investment.  Thus the public water utility, Irish Water, is not the exclusive provider of water services, but does provide drinking water to 83% of the population and waste water services to 64% of the population.<\/p> <p>  Water policy is seeking to ensure the appropriate stewardship of all of the nation&rsquo;s water resources and that all citizens have access to quality drinking water, across a sector that has multiple stakeholders and varying ownership and delivery structures.  That being said, the majority of citizens receive water services from Irish Water, the State&rsquo;s public water utility, and the concerns raised regarding potential privatisation of water services are focused on Irish Water.  That is my understanding from Deputy Collins's Bill.<\/p> <p>  It may be useful if I set out both the current legislative safeguards to prohibit the privatisation of Irish Water, as well as the current status of work, from my Department&rsquo;s perspective, on proposals for a constitutional amendment.  The Water Services Act 2013 places a clear prohibition on the shareholders of Irish Water, that is, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; the Minister for Finance; and the board of Ervia, from alienating their shares in the utility.  Subsequently, in 2014, the Government introduced a further safeguard through the Water Services Act 2014.  Arising from the Act, were a situation ever to arise where any privatisation or part-privatisation of Irish Water was to be contemplated, through alienation of any share in Irish Water to anyone other than another Minister, this could not occur without three specific actions taking place: first, both Houses of the Oireachtas would have to pass a resolution approving such a proposal; second, a majority of voters in a plebiscite would have to give their approval to the proposal; and third, the Minister would then have to initiate legislation to privatise Irish Water or alienate any share held by the Government.  In other words a triple lock was put in place in legislation to try to reassure people on this issue.<\/p> <p>  A key principle in addressing the fragmentation within the system and bringing delivery and strategic planning into a single water utility was that this would be a public utility - a State body in public ownership.  The objective of moving from a system of water services delivery by 34 water services authorities towards a single utility approach was to achieve economies of scale, greater efficiency and more effective long-term strategic planning, which I am glad to say is all happening now.<\/p> <p>  The strong policy intent of the State has always been to maintain public water services in public ownership.  This was already reflected in the Water Services Act 2007 and, in transferring functions from local authorities to Irish Water in 2013, the protections in that Act against what is termed &ldquo;alienation of public water assets&rdquo; were carried forward into the new arrangements.  Concerns that the reform process, initiated in 2011, might lead to the future privatisation of water services, persisted.  Recognising these concerns, the previous Government twice legislated on the issue of public ownership of water services to give further protections and I have outlined what those protections were.<\/p><p> Existing legislation, therefore, already provides a statutory prohibition on the privatisation of Irish Water and sets out a range of steps that would need to be taken in the event that the statutory prohibition involved was to be removed.  However, despite these legislative barriers to privatisation, people continue to have genuine concerns and I accept that.  The Government respects and acknowledges these concerns and the efforts made by the authors of the Bill to address them.  Indeed, it was in this context that I asked my officials to meet Deputy Joan Collins and her team to develop a shared understanding of the specific operation of the existing prohibitions and the issues that would need to be carefully considered in further future arrangements.<\/p><p> The possibility of a constitutional amendment to protect public ownership of water infrastructure has been considered previously.  The provisions on the plebiscite, reflected in the 2014 legislation, were brought forward as an alternative to a constitutional provision in light of concerns at the time regarding potential unintended consequences of such a provision.  They also reflected the fact that the operation of State structures is usually described in legislation approved by the Oireachtas rather than in the fundamental legal document of the State, namely, the Constitution.  However, in the intervening period, Opposition Deputies published four similar Bills proposing a constitutional amendment to enshrine public ownership of the water system in the Constitution.  Resulting from this, I stated during the Second Stage debate last November in the D&aacute;il that I am open to considering a workable proposal that provides the necessary certainty in respect of the future public ownership of Irish Water.  I also indicated that due to the complexity of issues involved in any potential constitutional protection, I reserved my position to propose a Government amendment to the wording on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> Among the issues to be considered in drafting a constitutional amendment are wording challenges arising as a result of the range of categories of infrastructural ownership, achieving a balance between principles reflected in the Constitution and the more detailed policy to be reflected in legislation and addressing the risk of unintended consequences.  The last is probably the biggest concern that I have, to be honest, but we can talk through these issues further.  Issues around the wording of any amendment arise from the plurality of water infrastructure ownership categories.  These include private bore holes, private group water schemes, private group schemes that are sourcing water from the public network and water infrastructure located on privately-owned land.  There are also issues to be considered in the context of the potential for unintended consequences that could impinge on individuals&rsquo; rights to private property, which are strongly protected in the Constitution.  My officials are working with the Office of the Attorney General on the issues arising in order to provide advice to me, the Government and this committee, as this Bill progresses through the Oireachtas.  I will possibly be bringing forward amendments to address some of the issues I have outlined.<\/p><p> I recognise where we have come to in terms of the water debates.  I also recognise the recommendations that have been made by both the expert commission and the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  This was one of the issues on which there was not a lot of division or contention at the aforementioned committee.  I hope that people will accept that there is a willingness to try to be helpful here.  That said, I also want to ensure that, in our efforts to put this issue to bed in terms of the concerns around privatisation of our water infrastructure, we do not do something that will prevent the normal functioning and management of Irish Water as a single utility in the context of its efforts to provide safe, efficient and well-run services.  I refer here to the infrastructure that needs to be put in place, as well as to the treatment of drinking water and wastewater.  I want to ensure that we do not, in some way, freeze Irish Water in its ability to be able to create partnerships and be innovative in its approach to the work it must do.  I am also concerned that we do not create unintended consequences for water infrastructure that is currently privately owned through group water schemes and other water infrastructure like, for example, the extensive network of septic tanks and wastewater treatment facilities, many of which are privately owned and operated.<\/p><p> I am anxious to be helpful.  I think I know what people are looking for here but we can tease that out further.  People want more than reassurance in legislation that could potentially be changed by a future Government with a majority.  They want constitutional protection and a permanency in terms of policy in this area regarding maintaining public ownership of core public water infrastructure and the company or, more correctly, the State entity that manages that.  That is where I am coming from.  If we can tease through the issues while also being willing to take sensible and good legal advice, particularly from the Attorney General's office, then we should be able to work together to get a good outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#L00200","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2377,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I will start by saying that I found the presentation we got from the Department and the Minister's opening statement very disappointing because they do not say an awful lot more than what was said on Second Stage.  In fact, the bulk of what the Minister has stated was said during the Second Stage debate in November, almost six months ago.  The purpose of this meeting, as I understand it, is for us to engage in detailed scrutiny of the actual legislation but the one thing the Minister did not talk about was the legislation.  I am genuinely not trying to score a political point here but that was the whole purpose of us inviting the Minister to appear.  If I remember correctly, during the Second Stage debate one of the Minister's final comments was that he would provide the expertise of his officials to the committee to tease this out by way of pre-legislative scrutiny.  What we are seeking to do today is to get into the detail of this.  I am hoping that in the course of our question-and-answer sessions we will start to deal with the actual legislation, which is what we are here to deal with.<\/p> <p>  On page 6 of the more detailed submission prepared by departmental officials, the two sets of general concerns that the Department has with this Bill are outlined.

Do the officials believe or does the Department have legal advice to say that Deputy Joan Collins' Bill is problematic?  Is it or is it not problematic?  It could be that the Department does not have advice from the Attorney General on that and the Minister cannot tell us now.  Is it problematic or not, based on the legal advice or the policy expertise that the Minister has available to him?  <\/p> <p>  The aforementioned document goes on to say that seeking to enshrine such property in public ownership through a constitutional referendum could have unintended consequences and could impinge on individuals' constitutional rights.  Again, this committee wants to know if, on the basis of the legal advice that the Minister has on this legislation and the policy expertise available to him, this Bill would rather than could have unintended consequences.  That is what we are trying to grapple with here.<\/p> <p>  I am also concerned that, on foot of his remarks, the Minister seems to think that there may be a confusion between publicly and privately-owned assets.  We already have constitutional protection for private assets and this Bill seeks to provide constitutional protection for publicly-owned assets.  Is it the Minister's fear that if this referendum were to pass, assets which today are privately owned under law could somehow be dragged into the public system against the will or the legal rights and entitlements of the owners?  If that is what the Minister believes, I ask him to explain how he thinks that could happen - given the constitutional protection for private assets -  and to provide concrete examples.  We had senior counsel in this morning and we asked them if they believed that there could be any impingement on the rights of private asset owners as a result of this legislation and they said \"No\", categorically.<\/p> <p>  At the end of his opening statement, the Minister raised the issue of partnerships, which is not referred to in the documents supplied to the committee by the Department.  Obviously, we are dealing with design, build and operate models for the delivery, for example, of water treatment plants and other such public private partnerships.  Whatever our individual policy views, it is an important issue that the Minister raises.<\/p><p>We again asked senior counsel this morning if, for example, this referendum on the constitutional amendment was to be passed and enacted, whether it would in any way affect the current operation of design, build and operate treatment plants.  The senior counsel categorically has said \"No\".<\/p><p> I believe it was Deputy Cowen who asked would it or could it affect the ability of a service provider - whether it is Irish Water or some other entity - acting on behalf of the State to enter into such arrangements in the future.  My understanding of the answer is that it would not.  The issue is that there needs to be clear public ownership and governance of the water system.  I do not want to know if the Minister has a general fear but is there something specific he is being advised about?  If so, can he give us the detail if it is contrary to what we have already got?<\/p><p> I take it from the last paragraph of the Minister's presentation that he does not have the Attorney General's advice on Deputy Joan Collins's Bill at this stage.  The Minister should confirm whether he has that advice.  If and when he does have it, however, the committee would like to know.  We understand that he cannot share the legal advice but on previous occasions he has given the committee a detailed oral summary of that advice.  If he does not have the advice at this stage, will he give a commitment to provide it to us at a later stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#M00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2379,"content":"<p>I thank the Minster for coming before the committee and acknowledge the work involved.  There are 38 signatories to this Bill, which is interesting.  I took the time to consult the Official Report of Wednesday, 9 November 2016, including the deliberations on what the Minister had to say, as well as what Deputy Joan Collins and other colleagues said.  That is more or less what we have heard again here today.  I accept exactly what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said.  The Minister's response is more or less the same thing as was said back on 9 November 2016 - in some cases it is exactly word for word.  That is the reality of it.<\/p> <p>  While I am open to correction, this is effectively about copper-fastening the ownership of water services.  In her statement, Deputy Joan Collins spoke about retaining Irish Water in public ownership and stressed the need for public management of the utility.  I would totally disagree with her on that point.  I do not think we should get hung up on Irish Water's day-to-day operations.  <\/p> <p>  I reiterate that this Bill in no way seeks to abolish Irish Water, despite the personal or political views of all the signatories.  I met someone outside the gates of Leinster House earlier today who was talking about the abolition of Irish Water.  I told him members would be talking here today but there is no question in Deputy Collins's proposal concerning the abolition of Irish Water.  The Deputy has advocated strongly against Irish Water but in this Bill there is no proposal to abolish the company.  That interesting and important point is worth making.<\/p> <p>  Why should we all get hung up on the public management of a structure?  A range of public utility services are contracted out to the private sector.  If it is the best way to do it and is value for money it should be pursued.  We should not get hung up on a political dogma or view that we have trotted out time after time that somehow State agencies or the State itself should be doing everything.  It is about value for the customer and the public generally.  We are really interested in having a top-quality service, not in the consistency of a political message.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has clearly set out the issues.  We all know the technicalities involved in having a constitutional amendment.  We should forget about the cost of having a constitutional referendum because while that is a consideration, it is not the most important one.  As regards the wording, what are we trying to achieve?  Let us not get hung up on the process.  I do not think anyone is against copper-fastening the ownership of Irish Water as a service and a public asset.  We need to separate those two.  <\/p> <p>  I understand that the Minister cannot share the Attorney General's advice with the committee at this point, but clearly he has an idea where all of this is hopefully going.  We are meant to be scrutinising legislation, so it would be helpful to know that view.  Can the Minister flag any concerns, such as the unintended consequences?  Can that be teased out?  Clearly, this has been coming down the tracks for many months and the Minister's officials and others have been advising him.  There are legal and technical issues involved.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about these key issues. <\/p> <p>  In the D&aacute;il debate, Deputy Wallace stated \"Like most people in Ireland, I do not think the water service should be privatised, but, sadly, unless we get rid of Irish Water, it might as well be privatised because that is where we are.\"  I do not know what that is all about.  We want a top-quality service for the public.  We should not get hung up on ownership.  Some people have set a political position whereby they want to get rid of Irish Water, so they throw everything at it but it does not wash with me.  It does not make for good policy, not to mention good politics.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister has outlined that in 2014 the Government had introduced further safeguards in respect of the Water Services Act 2014.  While I am happy about it, I would like it to be teased out.  The Minister referred to the triple-lock system and that eventually there would have to be a plebiscite, and he could not alienate his shares other than to another Minister or a part of Government.  Because the whole thing is so complex, people need to understand the certainty of the triple-lock system.  There has been a huge debate over this but people on all sides are trying to clarify it and keep it all simple.<\/p> <p>  Everyone, including the Minister, now agrees that Irish Water is an asset that needs to be safeguarded by the public.  How can we keep that simple and assure people that it will happen?  If there was a change of government in future with a vast majority, there would be some comfort in that it could not change or be unwound in some way.  There is the issue of protecting it.  I will leave it at that but there are critical issues involved.  As the wording of a referendum is a complex issue, how does that process work itself out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#N00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2380,"content":"<p>I obviously support the Bill and happily signed it.  There has been huge concern in the opposition to water charges that the final intention was to privatise water.  It is not an idle concern; it is an obvious one.  It happened with bin services that once charges were introduced, the services were eventually privatised.  When we had these debates in the D&aacute;il it was said that nobody in the House wanted to privatise water but I do not believe that.  Many Deputies would not have a fundamental or principled opposition to water being privatised and that is why people want a constitutional provision to prevent any political party from doing that in future.<\/p> <p>  In fact it is backed up by what Senator Boyhan just said in his contribution.  He said that we should not get hung up on political dogma about things being State-run or privately run; it is about value for the customer.  I do not want to be a customer for water, however.  I just want to have water that is paid for through central taxation.  I do not want to become a customer and get a bill.  Those words were used by Senator Boyhan.  He was basically saying that he would not have a principled opposition to water being privatised but that is why people want to see a referendum.  As we will be having other referendums, there should not be a problem in incorporating a referendum on this matter. <\/p> <p>  As regards the Minister's concerns, everybody is asking the same thing.  We need to hear a bit more detail about these concerns and why it could be problematic.  One issue being raised is that because of the diversity of water structures - approximately 15% of people are in group water schemes - it is being presented that such people would have a problem if it went into public ownership.  I would like to talk to some of those group water schemes to see if that is the case.  That was stated in one of the documents.  I think that a lot of those group water schemes should be brought into public ownership.  There is a basis for doing that and it could protect people from facing exorbitant fees and costs in the future.  <\/p> <p>  It seems that every time we want to have change - be it in housing, compulsory purchase orders for land or anything else - it is cited time and again that the constitutional right to private property could be impinged upon.  This argument is now being posed again in respect of water.  We seriously need to change that article in the Constitution and to downgrade the right to private property because it would seem that we cannot protect the common good otherwise, or at least it is always cited that way.<\/p> <p>  We have had countless presentations here on housing.<\/p><p>That is deliberately overused by parties that do not wish to see any constitutional change or public ownership being advanced and enhanced.  It is incumbent on the Minister to give us the legal advice or to indicate what impediments he believes there might be to proceeding with this.  There is huge public support for it.  We were all led to believe that when it was agreed at the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, it would be taken as read that it would be enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#N00300","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2382,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  From a theoretical point of view, this is the first time I have participated when it is not a Minister but a Member who is introducing the legislation.  That is unusual and welcome.  In fairness, this is the proper process for the people who have introduced the legislation.  The Minister made it clear that he is listening.  He or his officials have met with the proposers of the legislation.  I do not know if I am the only person who has seen it but he states in his official submission, \"My officials are working with the Office of the Attorney General on the issues arising, in order to provide advice to me and the Government, as this Bill progresses through the Oireachtas, and possibly on bringing forward some amendments to address some of the issues I have outlined.\"  The Minister is being reasonable.  He is listening, is in touch with the Attorney General and he is working on the wording.  If he came here and said the opposite, such as that he did not agree with a certain line and that he proposes this, that or the other, people would make the charge that he was interfering with the due process or was not giving due weight to the analysis of the issue.  The Minister has been clear that he will refer back to us on Committee Stage.  He is not opposing the legislation.  As I understand it, nobody opposes the principle.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions, although I do not expect the Minister to be able to answer them immediately.  I have a concern about Ervia, which is the holding company for Irish Water.  I introduced the original legislation in the first instance and the express intention at the time was that Irish Water, after its initial support from Bord G&aacute;is, would be a stand-alone, separate company.  That is not the case.  I argued strongly and trenchantly for that view, although it did not prevail with the political people involved in the decision-making at the time.  It was a bad decision to have it as part of Ervia.  I would like it to become a separate company.  I realise that the latter is not an issue for the Bill we are discussing.  As Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail said, it is a matter for the D&aacute;il, not a referendum.  However, it is exceptionally clear to me that Irish Water should have no hand, act or involvement with Ervia.<\/p> <p>  On my next question, many of these assets are very important and valuable.  Irish Water will have to raise funds and it will have to go to the private sector to get them.  It might be the case that a piece of infrastructure could be provided by a private company.  This happens at present, whereby a company might design, build and operate, DBO, water infrastructure.  Irish Water would work with it on that.  Are there any implications for that process or would it be neutral in its impact?  The officials can correct me if I am wrong but I understand that the supply of water to a significant part of Limerick city was built and is operated by a private company.  It is efficiently run and well managed.  It operates under the direction of Irish Water and does what it is told.  Would there be any issues in that regard?<\/p> <p>  My main point is about the principle of public ownership.  I introduced the initial legislation.  I debated the issue of public ownership with the Department and it was to be included in the legislation.  When the legislation was presented to me, however, it was not included.  I was very concerned about that and people were right to be concerned about it being in public ownership.  This referendum is essential for that reason.  At the same time, I wish to know the implications, if any, for the future operation of Irish Water, particularly in respect of design, build and operate, DBO, mechanisms and investment.  There are many legitimate funds, such as teachers' pension funds and so forth, that are seeking investment in infrastructure such as water.  That is a good thing if it is not exploitative investment.  It is long-term, low-interest investment in a solid and unique structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#O00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2383,"content":"<p>I will try to respond.  First, I cannot give members information I do not have.  We shared the briefing we sent to the Office of the Attorney General with the committee.  It is the same briefing, so we have been transparent about what we are doing.  We are in consultation with the Attorney General's office in terms of getting advice - the type of advice the member appears to have received from a senior counsel this morning.  I do not know who it was.  I presume it is a good senior counsel but I must ensure that I take my lead from the legal advice that is available to the Government.  As this process moves on, we will continue to take advice from the Attorney General on what we are doing.  Changing the Constitution is a big deal.  If one gets it wrong, it is difficult to correct.  It is not like legislation, because there must be another referendum.  We have seen in other areas where there have been unintended consequence and legal actions, both at home and abroad, to test the Constitution and its consistency with other legislative obligations and so forth.<\/p> <p>  The current position is that we have sent the briefing document the committee has seen to the Attorney General's office.  We are asking her to provide advice on how best to proceed.  I have made it clear to her that we want to try to do this.  It is not a blocking exercise.  We want to get it right.  That is how we are proceeding.  I will happily return to the committee to have the type of discussion mentioned when we have that advice.  I cannot publish the advice but I can talk it through in respect of some of the issues that are being raised.<\/p> <p>  As to whether it is problematic, there are issues here on which I must obtain legal clarity in so far as that is possible.  Until I have that, I cannot give the committee a definitive answer as to whether it is or is not problematic.  There are issues here on which we have to be reassured.  If we cannot get that reassurance, we will have to change the wording to ensure we are covered in the areas where there is concern.  That is my point.  We can potentially make that change on Committee Stage or Report Stage, but we would be better off doing it on Committee Stage rather then leaving it to the last Stage of the process.<\/p> <p>  It would probably be useful, during pre-legislative scrutiny, for the committee to speak to some of the stakeholders who have issues in this regard.  Deputy Coppinger raised the matter of group water schemes.  It would be helpful if the committee invited representatives from the National Federation of Group Water Schemes to appear before it.  The federation has indicated concerns to the Department about this issue.  Again, its members are trying to get their heads around what the State is proposing to put into the Constitution and how it will affect them.  There are group water schemes all over the country that have being managed and paid for over many years.  Some of them are working very successfully, others are under a little pressure.  We must be supportive of those groups, as is clear in the Oireachtas water committee's recommendations.  It is a different issue to suggest that we will simply take all of it into public ownership without suggesting how that would even work or who would take charge of it.  I am sure many group water schemes would have a problem with that because they are running their own operations, and very successfully in many cases.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan referred to the normal daily running and work of Irish Water.  We must allow this single utility entity, which has had a difficult introduction, to get on with the work it must do.<\/p><p>In regard to privatisation of the water system, or concerns around that issue, when local authorities were in charge of the water system there was a lot more privatisation going on in terms of treatment plants.  Local authorities did not have the capacity to put in place large water treatment facilities and so they contracted people in the private sector to build and operate them, many of which are working successfully.  Irish Water has now taken over that responsibility.  It is also building facilities because it has the capacity, not only in terms of economies of scale around financing but also economies of knowledge in terms of the teams it has, to run its own treatment plants.  We need to be careful in what we are trying to do that we do not prevent Irish Water creating partnerships with the private sector that make sense in terms of innovation and new methods of treating water.  In regard to the existing network of water treatment plants, some are owned and managed by Irish Water - I recently opened some of them - and some are operated on a contract PPP basis and they are working well.  We need to understand the consequences of the wording being put into the Constitution for those relationships and those day-to-day practical operations. <\/p><p> I get the sense from Deputy &Oacute; Broin -  Deputy Coppinger has a slightly different perspective on this and I respect that - that what he seeks is that there would be public ownership of the responsibility around delivery of water.  Deputy Collins's Bill proposes that the Government would bear responsibility for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system.  My concern is around the definition of the public water system.  We need clarity on that in terms of what we are proposing to put into the Constitution.  Whether we need to provide that definition in legislation is one of the issues on which we need advice from the Attorney General's Office.  This about ensuring that the diversity of the current system can be managed within all of that diversity mix.<\/p><p> I do not want to get into the political debate around whether there was an agenda for privatisation.  I have been involved in much of that discussion at various stages and there has never been any plan of which I am aware to privatise Irish Water or the Irish water system; rather there was a plan to introduce a much more efficient and cost-effective way of delivering water, with a conservation-based approach and a utility-based approach to providing water.  Just as there has never been any attempt to private the gas network, there was never an intention to privatise the water network or its management.  <\/p><p> We need to be cautious around changing the Constitution through a referendum.  We need to learn lessons from the past and we need to try to get it right.  From my perspective, I would encourage the committee to invite in some of the people who may consider that they might be directly impacted by what is being proposed.  It would be important to get their perspective on that in terms of the practicalities of how the system runs today and any potential concerns of an impact of the kind we are proposing to make.  We will continue to provide information.  When I get more definitive advice from the Attorney General, I, or my officials - whichever is easier - will happily come back before the committee to discuss the consequences of that with a view to trying to improving the wording proposed.  That is what the stage process is.  Normally, a Government brings forward legislation of this type.  If this was Government legislation members would rightly ask me about the legal advice on it because legislation does not get produced without legal advice.  I am being asked to respond to Deputy Collins's legislation, it being used as the basis for what we are seeking to do.  I am happy to do that but I will not be bounced into something that I regard as not having been fully legally tested and so on.  I am afraid people will have to be patient.  When I get the response from the Attorney General I can discuss it with the committee without publishing it and provide some suggestions in terms of how we an improve the wording, if that is necessary.  If it not necessary, we can proceed without too many changes.  I do not want to doubt the aforementioned senior counsel but it is the Government that will be blamed if we get this wrong, not Deputy Collins, with respect.  The Government has a responsibility to ensure this is tested appropriately from a legal perspective so that we can get on and fulfil the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee on water and fulfil the aspirations of everybody here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#O00300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2385,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to debate this Bill.  It is important there is clarity around the issues concerned.  The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights did not include water because it was not envisaged 70 years ago that private companies would be set up to run water services.  In 2010, 122 countries agreed that water sanitation is a fundamental human right.  That was a very important declaration after two decades of people raising the issue.  In contrast, in 2012 the European Commission issued a letter stating:<\/p><blockquote>Privatisation of public companies contributes to the reduction of public debt, as well as to the reduction of subsidies, other transfers or state guarantees to state-owned enterprises.  It also has the potential of increasing the efficiency of companies and, by extension, the competitiveness of the economy as a whole, while attracting foreign direct investment.<br \/><br \/>The Commission believes that [the privatisation of public utilities, including water supply firms] can deliver benefits to the society when carefully made.<\/blockquote> <p>As long as the European Commission believes that water provision would be privatised the potential exists for that to happen.  Also, there is the potential that a strong arm of a troika would force countries into privatisation of their water services.  I take on board the Minister's point that the Government, and the parties to it, do not want to privatise Irish water services.  That may be the case now but it may not remain so into the future, which is the concern of the public.  The only way we can protect water services provision is to provide in Article 28 of the Constitution that public ownership of it be the responsibility of the Government of the day.  <\/p><p>I wonder if some people have read the Bill.  It is very simple.  It provides that the Government shall be collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system and that it shall ensure, in the public interest, that this resource remains in public ownership and management.  It does not mention what entity shall do that.  There has been nothing concrete forthcoming from the Department regarding group water schemes, private wells and so on.  The senior counsel, S&eacute;amus &Oacute; Tuathail, who participated in this morning's session of the meeting, has vast experience in terms of public-private ownership legislation and law and so on.  I would like to make a few points for the record.  Private wells are protected under private ownership.  Group water schemes are set up as private companies.  To become a public company they have to apply to the local authority and go through a particular process.<\/p><p>Therefore, they are protected and it is clear that they are not part of the public water system, under which they receive subsidies.  The only aspect of group water systems governed through regulations is the requirement introduced by the European Union that governments must ensure public water systems reach a certain standard, are of good quality and well delivered.  There is no impact on group water schemes, bore holes and so forth. <\/p><p> It is a pity that a few individuals were not present this morning when it emerged that obsolete assets were not part of the public water system and could be sold off to raise revenue.  If the Department is concerned that group water schemes are not private and may be public, it should inform them of that concern.  It is clear from the structure and operation of group water schemes that they are private and separate from the public water system.  This issue needs to be clarified because it is used to muddy the waters when we hear about unintended consequences.<\/p><p> The Department and Irish Water should draw up an inventory of assets owned by local authorities.  I understand the local authorities are checking what assets they have.  It is only a matter of providing a record for the Government to ensure it is aware of what assets are in public ownership.  I ask for a response on that issue.  The Department should indicate whether it has concerns in that regard and if there are no such concerns, it should make a clear statement that there is no problem.  That would allow us to move on because the waters are being muddied in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#P00200","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2387,"content":"<p>The Minister has stated he will clarify the issues the Deputy has raised when he receives legal advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#Q00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2388,"content":"<p>We are not attempting to muddy the waters.

If group water schemes are part of the system that is providing water for the public, we need to be able to define it.  That is all I am saying.  I am not arguing that group water schemes are in public control.  However, the question as to whether they are part of the public water system needs to be clarified.  If, in the past, Cork County Council relied on a private company to build and operate a wastewater treatment plant in Youghal, Cobh or elsewhere and the plant is still being run under a 20-year contract as part of a public private partnership, it is in private ownership and being run privately while being paid for by the State through a local authority.  Such a facility is clearly not in public ownership, even though it is very much contributing to the public water system.  These are the issues we must nail down.  Interestingly, Irish Water is, by and large, opting to build and operate its own water treatment facilities, as opposed to engaging in public private partnerships.  However, it will partner with private companies in availing of engineering expertise, specialisation and so on. <\/p> <p>  To reiterate an earlier point made, we are not undermining normal, sensible efficiency operations around wastewater and drinking water.  I take the point that overall responsibility for the operation needs to rest with the State, through government, something Deputy Joan Collins is also trying to achieve.<\/p> <p>  I am glad to note a change in the language used on the issue of water services.

While the Fine Gael Party and the Government accept that there are also genuine issues which need to be teased out and finalised before we settle on a wording and commit to changing the Constitution in a way that is consistent with this wording, if we were to get this wrong, we would kick off a new series of problems linked with water.

It must be distinguishable in terms of its ownership, in other words, it must be a co-operative, trust or company.  The distinction between a public and a private water system is already made in law. <\/p> <p>  On regulation, the European Commission, in a case related to water quality, accepted and recognised this distinction and determined that Ireland had a regulatory role in group water schemes because they provided water for their members.  The Commission required Ireland to set regulations for the quality of water provided by group water schemes.  If it is the Minister's argument that the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment could have the unintended consequence of breaking down this distinction, it must be the case that it has already been broken down because there is a clearly accepted distinction made between public and private assets.

We take the Constitution, and proposals to change it, as seriously as the Government does.  The Minister is right to say there have been occasions where bad decisions were made, often when decisions were rushed as a result of political considerations, such as one case with which we are dealing at the moment.  Many good changes to the Constitution have, however, been made, some of which were proposed by the Government and were supported by many of us, such as the insertion of the rights of the child, which is very valuable.<\/p> <p>  I am, however, really frustrated as it is not as if this issue has landed on the Minister's desk in the past week.  We passed Second Stage of this legislation six months ago and an expert group stated five months ago that this was probably a good idea.  Even before the water committee finalised its report we knew there was a consensus among parties for some kind of constitutional referendum on the final wording.  I am frustrated because nothing we are doing in this committee is of any value to the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I accept that the Minister cannot give us answers he does not have, but that is the problem.  We were meant to be hearing the legal advice to Deputy Collins, who helped draft the Bill, and some concrete information from the Minister or his officials.  Instead, we are getting the same doubts the Minister was expressing six months ago.  These are significant issues and we should be considering them but we are having a circular conversation which is not allowing us to progress.  The same would be the case if we were to invite representatives of group water schemes.  I am more than happy to do so but they will want to know if passing this wording would impinge on their constitutional rights to private property.  We have one senior counsel who has an opinion on that which we could share with them, but ultimately it will depend on the legal advice from the Attorney General.  Inviting the group water schemes or any other stakeholder to appear before the committee prior to some indication of the Attorney General's advice will involve another circular conversation.<\/p> <p>  I am at a loss.  I am not trying to be awkward and the Minister is correct to raise all these issues but he raised them six months ago and we are having the same conversation today.  There is no point in my going back over the arguments because his answer will be that, while something may be significant, we cannot progress until he has the legal advice from the Attorney General.  In that case, what is the point of pre-legislative scrutiny?  What is the point in having the Minister here if he cannot answer any of the questions?<\/p> <p>  Maybe there is one question the Minister can answer, although he obviously cannot answer all the questions relating to Deputy Collins's Bill, which is the subject of today's discussion.  Has the Minister or have his officials seen any advice which suggests that, under the current legal situation, there is confusion between the ownership of assets in private wells, bore holes and group water schemes and those in the public system, owned by the State and currently managed by Irish Water?  The implication that our wording may impinge on categories of ownership of water services infrastructure suggests there is some uncertainty as to whether something is a private asset or a public asset.  Have there been any previous legal advices on this?  The Minister mentioned new projects and I assume he is referring to new water infrastructure developments but there is a legal process for taking a group water scheme into the public system, just as there is a process for taking private water infrastructure developments into the public system.  It is known as \"taking in charge\" and Irish Water now has a mechanism for doing this, as have local authorities.  In all these cases there is a clear legal process for incorporating a private asset into the public system.  I am not confused as to what is public or private but is the Department confused?<\/p> <p>  The Minister always tells us there are genuine concerns but repeating the point, on the basis of no legal advice whatsoever, that Deputy Collins's Bill may cause difficulties with public ownership or group water schemes, and may have unintended consequences, muddies the waters.  That might not be the Minister's intention but people in group water schemes might think it is a problem.  Before the Minister would have received the legal advice on whether this was or was not a problem, he would have created such a level of doubt as to cause significant concern.   The briefing note from the Department should say that something may or may not be a problem until the legal advice is received.  Likewise, it should say it may or may not have unintended consequences but it simply states that it may create problems.  My worry is that the Minister does not want this legislation and is hoping to delay it, which would be a tragedy.  If he says he will have the legal advice shortly I will take him at his word and I hope we can come back for another discussion.  Until we have that advice, however, there is no point in talking to anybody else at this stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#R00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2401,"content":"<p>I am not a permanent member of the committee so I appreciate the opportunity to contribute.  I want to make it clear where I stand on this.

The people put their trust in us to pass legislation they want.  I mean no disrespect to any senior counsel or to the Attorney General but I have a fear of inserting into the Constitution small individual lines to satisfy a political desire, whether it is something with which I agree or fundamentally disagree, to transfer responsibility from where it should always lie, that is, the Oireachtas and its Members, to a small group in the Judiciary to arbitrate, at some point in the future, on some case that cannot be foreseen by anybody in this room relating to the idea that the Government shall be collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system and shall ensure, in the public interest, that this remains the case.<\/p><p>I began my political involvement when I was very young in the 1980s and I have seen where we can end up when, with the best of intentions, people insert lines in the Constitution to copperfasten something they believe in and end up with exactly the opposite to what they thought they were doing.  The Minister's caution is well placed.  The triple-lock mechanism in place at present, ironically, is probably an even greater protection.  At the end of the day, if a constitutional amendment is passed, one can go back to the people and ask them to vote again.  There is built into the triple-lock a provision that requires consultation through a vote of the public on any Oireachtas decision.  My worry is not the wording or the proposal <i>per se <\/i>but the solution to what we want to achieve, which is to ensure that without the consent of the people and the Oireachtas, the water of this country cannot end up in private hands, is not best served by using this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#R00400","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2403,"content":"<p>I fully support the initiative of Deputy Collins to bring this legislation forward.

I have provided the briefing to the committee to provide transparency in respect of what we are asking of the Attorney General.  If the Deputy wants to turn that into a political issue that muddies the waters outside the committee, that is a matter for him but I will not do that.  To turn the terminology in a briefing note that I have sent to the Attorney General primarily, but that I have also provided to him to show what we have we have asked of her, into a political suggestion that we are try to muddy the waters is not only inaccurate but it is also probably unfair.  We have given the committee clarity in respect of what I have asked of the Attorney General and as soon we receive a comprehensive response from her office, I will be in a position to give more clarity.  However, I have to operate on the timeline of getting good advice rather than the timeline of responding to political pressure.  Amending the Constitution on the back of political pressure and timelines generated by that has proven to be a mistake in the past.  We are talking about a matter of weeks, not months into the future.  My understanding is this comes down to the definition of the \"public water system\" and whether that relates to the system that delivers water to the public or public ownership versus private ownership, which is the interpretation that Deputy &Oacute; Broin is putting on it.  The word \"system\" may be more encompassing than that because private assets provide water to the public and one of the issues we need to consider is whether they are defined as the \"public water system\".<\/p> <p>  The answer to Senator Grace O'Sullivan's question is I will happily provide information to the committee as soon as I have it.  I will make it clear to the Attorney General's office that parties are anxious to move this process on and I will seek a response from her.  A constitutional change is much more significant than the special water committee's report and recommendations, which we are acting on, and any legislative change we make.  Once we change the Constitution, we cannot change it again without another referendum.  We should take a few weeks to get this right.

This is legislation into which the Government needs to have an input.  We have agreed to use Deputy Joan Collins' Bill as the basis.  We could have introduced a separate Bill, but she asked us not to do so and I supported the adoption of that approach.  If I was introducing my own legislation and we were at pre-legislative scrutiny stage, I still would not have the advice.  We would not be introducing legislation this early.  I am afraid we are just going to have to work through the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017050400002#T01200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1493884800,"counter":2425,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for attending and our previous session this morning.
