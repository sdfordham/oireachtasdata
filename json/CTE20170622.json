Agreed.<\/p> <p>  With regard to matters arising, we will come to everything relevant in the course of the meeting today.  We will move straight on to No. 3, which is correspondence received.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Some will relate to the meeting we had with the Garda Commissioner on Tuesday because they have not been noted.  They arrived since our last public meeting but we did not note correspondence.<\/p> <p>  The first item is the opening statement from Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan for the meeting on 19 June.  We note that because that meeting was held on Tuesday.  The next item is opening statement for today's meeting from Professor Brian Norton.  We note that.  The next item is the opening statement for today's meeting from Professor Desmond Fitzgerald, president of University of Limerick.  We note that and it will be published with the other opening statement.  There is an opening statement for today's meeting from Dr. Brendan J. Murphy, president of Cork Institute of Technology.  We note and will publish that.  <\/p> <p>  Next is category B correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-up to previous meetings.  Correspondence dated 14 June from Cork Institute of Technology is as follows: a briefing document as presented to the Committee of Public Accounts on 10 December 2015 which outlines the background and details of the KPMG report.  We can raise that with its representatives when they are here shortly.  There are also relevant extracts from Committee of Public Accounts opening statements by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Department of Education and Skills and Higher Education Authority.  We also attach the full copy of the transcript of the Committee of Public Accounts hearing on Cork Institute of Technology, which was held on 10 Dec 2015.  Members have it by way of background information.  We note all that.<\/p> <p>  No. 603B is correspondence from the chairman of the Office of Public Works regarding a 2013 request to provide office accommodation for Caranua with instructions from the Department that Caranua would meet the appropriate rental costs.  Do we have that letter on screen?  Does anyone want to comment on it?  It is No. 603B.  What is the conclusion of that letter, towards the end of it?  Do members want time to consider it?  We will come back to it next week.  We will hold it over until next week.  <\/p> <p>  No. 607B is correspondence from the Comptroller and Auditor General dated 19 June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#E00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>On the previous letter about the rent, at all stages this committee asked for no rent to be paid.

We have completed our work in terms of our hearings and we will move to a report.  This was Mr. Barrett, who is head of human resources, asking the Commissioner to correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts.  When the questions were put, she said there was no need to correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It shows the clear contradiction between his understanding of what happened in meetings and her understanding of what happened at the meeting.  It is quite serious for the head of human resources to be alerting this committee to information he says the Commissioner had in respect of previous briefings she was given before she said she was briefed but also the nature of the meeting that he was present at.  He is writing to her and giving us a letter to say in his view she should correct the record.  She disputes that.

The last sentence is, \"On 30th June, 2015 and again in early July I had been advised that Mr. Cyril Dunne had brought these matters of critical concern, which I had been raising, to your personal attention\".  He is saying he was advised.  He does not say who advised him.  I read it carefully.  That letter is an element of hearsay.  He is saying he was advised by somebody.  He does not tell us who advised him and that something was brought to somebody else's attention.

We did speak about this matter in private, as other Deputies have said.  It is only this morning that I discovered the limited number of staff available to the secretariat by comparison with the number that were available to the banking inquiry.  The amount of work they do on our behalf is phenomenal.  As Deputy Connolly said, they are coping.  There is the equivalent of a mini-banking inquiry going on here every week, if not from month to month.  When one considers the various reports we are producing at the moment, one recalls that the banking inquiry had an entire floor in Agriculture House.  It had 20 or 30 people at its disposal.  In fact, there was an additional member of staff for each of the members of the banking inquiry.  It is not that I am looking for that &ndash; I am not &ndash; but I am appalled, quite frankly, that the secretariat of the Committee of Public Accounts, the only constitutional committee of the State, is limited to six or seven staff.  I was genuinely of the view, given the quality of the work coming our way and the research, that there was a team of 20 people behind the scenes.  The clerk, the members of the secretariat themselves and the Chairman should put a plan together and ascertain our optimal number of staff in terms of research, secretarial and administrative functions.  They should go to the Ceann Comhairle and Oireachtas Commission and make the case for them.

It is ranked in 54th position globally, 25th in Europe and 9th in the whole of the UK and Ireland.  The shared ambition of UCC and the IMI is to advance education by raising the standard of management in Ireland and by enabling organisations and individuals to fulfil their potential through world-class executive education.  Partnering with UCC, the institute's future growth will be supported by research-led insight and expertise from within the university as well as the IMI's corporate membership community which together will continue to serve as the bedrock that connects the IMI to the needs of Irish organisations.<br\/><br\/>Our joint ambition stretches beyond Ireland's shores.  The IMI and the Cork University Business School will forge significant international alliances and relationships with global reach.  This combined with the institute's global ranking offers a unique value proposition that can consistently deliver distinctive world-class executive education to Irish and international students.  The acquisition of the IMI by UCC is a great investment for the university, the institute, our students and the people of Ireland.  The relationship has evolved over eight years and in the period 2011 to 2016, it took the form of an alliance which was launched by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, in 2011.  During that period, the governing body of the university considered the possibility of a formal acquisition of the institute on several occasions.  However, the body decided not to proceed until it was satisfied that the conditions deemed necessary for long-term success were fulfilled.  In January 2015, the governing body, based on extensive information and due diligence, approved the acquisition of IMI, subject to a set of conditions to be met in advance of the completion of the transaction.  These conditions related to the absence of pension liabilities, the general financial position of the institute, settlement of any outstanding cases and approval by the Competition Authority of the transaction.<\/p><p>The acquisition was completed in November 2016 and is a complex and detailed arrangement which took several years to negotiate.  Both organisations persisted over those years because they fully believed in the benefits for UCC, the IMI itself and for Ireland.  We have outlined these benefits and other aspects in the papers that have been provided to the committee.  <\/p><p> The value of the Irish Management Institute nationally and its significance to the business community has been recognised by the Government.  At the launch of the alliance in 2011, the Taoiseach noted that the development was significant and welcome for its potential to greatly improve the capacity of Ireland's companies to compete internationally.  Similarly, the T&aacute;naiste, at the launch of the merger in January, emphasised the need for Ireland to have the capacity to develop the requisite calibre of business leaders to guarantee long-term economic success.  The university shares these views and believes that this acquisition will be of real benefit to University College Cork, the Irish Management Institute and the State as a whole.  <\/p><p> In summary, I would like to put the following on the record.  No taxpayer or Exchequer funds of any kind were used by the university to acquire the Irish Management Institute.  The acquisition is totally aligned with the university's strategic objectives and national priorities for lifelong learning.  In my own career I have been associated with many universities, including the University of California, Duke University and the University of Maryland.  All are institutions that operate to the highest standards of governance.  In my short time at University College Cork, I can assure the committee that UCC also operates to those very high standards of governance and accountability and that this acquisition was fully compliant with those standards and with the Government's framework within which the university operates, and specifically with the powers of the university under the Universities Act 1997 and the powers vested in the governing body under that Act.  The acquisition by University College Cork was fully disclosed to the Higher Education Authority in advance of the transaction close.  The Higher Education Authority fully supported the transaction and recognised the benefits it would bring for students and business education in Ireland.<\/p><p> I wish to assure the members that University College Cork has not misled the committee with regard to the acquisition.  Additional information was sought by the committee following our previous appearance in March.  This was provided on 13 April and 9 May.  We have also provided the committee today with supporting appendices and schedules.  These will provide additional reassurance on the transaction. <\/p><p>  I am accompanied today by the bursar and chief financial officer, Mr. Diarmuid Collins,  the corporate secretary, Mr. Michael Farrell, and the finance officer, Mr. Cormac McSweeney.  My colleagues and I are happy to address any questions that the committee may have on the IMI transaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>We are also joined by Dr. Des Fitzgerald, the new President of the University of Limerick.

I will not read out the document I sent in but I will briefly say that I am here today to acknowledge that we have a responsibility as a public body to ensure that we spend money properly and transparently.  I acknowledge that I now take responsibility for many of the issues that arose within the university before I took up the post.  I will now outline some of the things we have done to address some of these issues.<\/p> <p>  Before I start I would just like to say that the University of Limerick is an outstanding institution with great staff and students.  One of my keen objectives as we go through this process is to make sure that the reputation and credibility of the institution is preserved.  Since taking office I have taken a number of measures to address some of the issues.  Among the things that I am very keen to ensure we do properly is our duty of care to those staff members who have been caught up in the issues in question, particularly the whistleblowers who have currently either been put on paid leave or have left the institution. <\/p> <p>  The other thing I am keen to address is the issue of severance payments, particularly with regard to the information that has been given to this committee, to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the Department of Education and Skills.  I have to say at this early point that we are continuing to collect and analyse the information.  I would say, however, that I think the severance agreements made were unacceptably high.  <\/p> <p>  I will outline some of the things we have been doing since I took up office.  As the committee is aware, one measure was to initially call for an independent review of the University of Limerick.  Richard Thorn has been appointed to that role and we have given him every assistance that we can.  Within the institution we have appointed Professor Mary O'Sullivan to provide direct liaison with Dr. Thorn.  We have also been undergoing a review of the structure of the senior management team and there is currently an ongoing restructuring of that team, looking carefully at the finance department and at human resources in particular.  The audit and risk committee also initiated an internal review of some of the matters raised both by RTE and by the PAC, particularly looking at conflicts of interest, the issue of people going out of the university to take degrees elsewhere, and the matter of the severance payments.  <\/p> <p>  To conclude, I want to be clear that I am determined to take whatever action necessary once the review has been completed.  I believe that this is on course for the end of September.  As I mentioned earlier, I am particularly concerned with protecting the reputation of the institution.  It has terrific support from its staff and students and from the community.  They have worked hard in the past to ensure the establishment of a university for Limerick and for the mid-west region.  It is very important for all of us that at the end of this process the university is put on a firm footing to further develop its academic programmes to provide education, training and research in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Desmond Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank the witness.

Schedule 3, which is a transaction overview, sets out the transaction itself.  It is included in the papers.  It addresses in particular the points that the programme made and the points that we made at the last session here on 30 March.  We purchased the IMI Sandyford campus, just over 13 acres.  That was based on a professional valuation.  The sum of &euro;20 million was used.  We advised the committee at the last meeting and subsequently in writing to follow up that it was funded via borrowings so again there was no public moneys involved.  No Exchequer moneys were provided to UCC for us to acquire that asset.<\/p> <p>  The third bullet point is consistent with what we said previously, and there is supporting documentation in our papers under Schedule A confirming that.  IMI, with that &euro;20 million discharged two charges that were on that campus.  The charges in effect were mortgages.  The IMI had developed a residential aspect to its offering that had been supported and financed by AIB, so with an element of our &euro;20 million proceeds with which we bought the campus the mortgage was released, discharged and paid back.<\/p> <p>  In 2012 &ndash; this is a key point &ndash; because when we looked to acquire the IMI previously the existence back then of a pension liability prevented us going ahead.  We did not want to take on a pension liability of a private entity and we paused at that time.  We continued with the alliance and revisited it when that was resolved.  It was resolved in 2012.  That is confirmed in the documentation attached in the accounts in the report we got from Mercer's pension expertise and in our due diligence with PwC.  That charge was also paid with the &euro;20 million from UCC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#L01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Diarmuid Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>In terms of the &euro;20 million that was funded via borrowings, who borrowed the &euro;20 million?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#L01800","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498118400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>UCC borrowed &euro;20 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#L01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Diarmuid Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>UCC is a taxpayer-funded organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#L02000","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498118400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Over the years our funding sources have diversified.

The IMI has a planned programme of investment by which to spend that post-acquisition.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the point of how the IMI settled and discharged the two charges over the campus, as the Deputy mentioned, UCC paid &euro;20 million.  Therefore, the IMI had that &euro;20 million.  If we look at the IMI's 2015 accounts, the IMI itself had its own cash.  As an entity, by the time the transaction was completed, the IMI had about &euro;1.7 million to &euro;1.8 million of its own cash itself.  Between the IMI's own cash resources and the &euro;20 million it got from UCC, it was able to discharge the two liabilities or charges - the AIB one the Deputy mentioned and the charge that was given to the pension trustees, as well as the &euro;400,000 that was for professional fees.  That did include an element of contingency and not all of it was needed in the end.  The money we gave and the IMI's own cash resources were able to pay those monies.  The investment is set out in document A5.  It was also the intention and view of UCC, once we required the asset - remember that it is our asset as we bought it and are leasing it back - that it was probably a bit tired and needed investment.

I welcome without hesitation what Professor Fitzgerald has said, but preserving the reputation of the university is immaterial to me at the moment given what has been highlighted.  I have had the privilege of going to university.  I regard it as a privilege.  It is very important for Limerick and the area, but reputation is earned and it is earned by a university that is open and accountable with money which primarily comes from the taxpayer.  I see Professor O'Shea nodding.  I am worried and very concerned about the general comment that this is not public money.  We have been through this with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The universities get substantial public moneys.  They are co-mingled with other moneys which, it seems, are separate from the student foundations and trusts, which are not open and accountable.  We will be coming back to trusts and foundations that are not consolidated with accounts.  Generally speaking, the presidents, who all happen to be male, feel that these should not be subjected to public scrutiny at this committee and that the charities are the appropriate thing.  I will come back to that.  What strikes me, and it has already been said by one or two of my colleagues, is the matter of whistleblowers, what they have gone through and what has been said about them.

The Irish Management Institute has done what I would call \"a Clerys job\" here.  The wealth and assets of the organisation were taken to one side and the company was just a name.  It is just like Clerys.  Do the witnesses get the point I am making?  I do not want them to comment on Clerys.  We are making a comment.  It seems to be that sort of issue of taking the assets out of the company and just leaving the company.  Hence, Mr. Collins can say UCC bought the company for nothing because there was nothing to buy there besides the name.  That was disconcerting to everybody watching.  They could not rationalise what was being said because UCC knew the hairs it was splitting and did not make that clear.  We have a better understanding of this idea that UCC says the IMI cost the taxpayer nothing.  Of course the company cost nothing because there was nothing there.  However, somebody had to raise a loan.<\/p> <p>  I come back then to the situation of the public funding.  We are told UCC is down to 47% of income coming from public sources.

Research was a significant source of income but State and semi-State companies provided &euro;55 million of that.  The EU provided &euro;13 million of that.  I am going from the university's accounts here.  That is &euro;158 million, or in the region of 50% of UCC's income.  As such, it is substantially funded directly by the State.  The witnesses are saying it might now be 40%.  Ultimately, what troubles us a little - and we are trying to get to the bottom of the actual cost - relates to page 19 of the document presented here, in Appendix 9, namely the last paragraph, which is boxed.  We will get it on the screen there now.  We are back to this issue of saying no Exchequer moneys were used in the acquisition.  We accept that.  It was bank money that was used to acquire it.  If something goes wrong, however, it could ultimately fall back to the college to pay for it.  On day 1, the bank paid for it, but if things do not work out, it could fall back to UCC.  I am just looking.<\/p><p>I will read to the witnesses the last paragraph in their own note that they provided to us.  It is not on screen.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>The university has acquired an appreciating asset.  Were UCC to consider at some stage in future recovering its investment, recent land sales adjacent to IMI would suggest that any future sale of the campus would yield a return to UCC in excess of the amount paid.<\/blockquote> <p>We now hear the university justifying the price it paid on the basis that: &quot;Sure, we are going to have a property boom.  Values are going to go up.&quot;  That is UCC's Appendix 9 to us today.  When Deputy Alan Kelly asked, UCC said it had no intention, but it in its documentary evidence, it is a consideration because it has highlighted in a big, black box what would happen at some stage in the future if UCC were to consider it.  As such, it is a possibility.<\/p><p>They have somewhat hedged this &euro;20 million cost against the fact that the properties will rise in value anyway.  Do the witnesses not see how we find that a little disconcerting for a third level college?

Such arrangements represent a very small proportion of DIT provision and are entered into where there is clear student demand and where, for reasons of resources, we cannot deliver the programme in-house.  Students registered on such a programme are recognised as full DIT students with access to services, from the medical centre and counselling, to sports, clubs and societies. The DIT commercial modern music degree, delivered through the British and Irish Modern Music Institute Dublin, BIMM Dublin, is an example of such a programme which has run very successfully for five years.  The future delivery is currently under public tender.<br\/><br\/>We also provided further information concerning the library subscription service, Swets UK.  This company had been procured through a national public tender in 2012 but went into bankruptcy in 2014.  DIT has provided an additional document to the committee that relates to an investigation undertaken by DIT and conducted by an external consultant, Ernst &amp;amp; Young, EY, into the processes that gave rise to the payment by DIT to Swets UK.  The issues raised in this report are also addressed in the final management report, which was submitted in July 2016 to this committee.  I regret that the EY report was not specifically included.  There were press reports this morning in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that the report was not provided to this committee, but we have a receipt from the secretariat for the Committee of Public Accounts dating to 31 May 2017 that it was received.

For example, they included annual rental for DIT buildings, utilities and energy costs, catering contracts, audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and library resources.  These payments now go through the levels of formal approval required by our finance system for all payments under our authority to bind.<\/p><p> A loss of &euro;718,000 was incurred by DIT as a result of the Swets UK bankruptcy.  We subsequently procured the required services through another supplier at a cost of &euro;760,000.  While the cost is higher, the terms of the new contract do not require full prepayment and therefore reduce the exposure to potential commercial failure.  DIT has been excluded from IReL, the Irish Research electronic Library which is funded by the HEA and to date has only been available to universities.  Access to this resource would reduce our exposure to the viability of commercial provision.  I am pleased to inform the committee that we yesterday received notification that a process is under way to grant DIT access to it.<\/p><p> The scale of the loss incurred by the Swets bankruptcy reflects the scale of the library service in DIT, which accounts for approximately 6% of our annual non-pay expenditure.  The service provides access to relevant and current texts, research and related findings for our student population of 20,500 who are pursuing courses at levels from apprenticeship to PhD and our academic staff of over 1,200.  The library's extensive resources include 286,000 books, 18,500 dissertations and updated subscriptions to approximately 35,000 online journals, periodicals and databases to support students across a wide range of activities and disciplines and support our research activity.<\/p><p> We currently operate six libraries, which are located in Aungier Street, Kevin Street, Bolton Street, Cathal Brugha Street, Rathmines and Grangegorman.  Their dispersed nature adds to costs.  This will be alleviated by the development of a single library on the new single DIT campus.<\/p><p> I am delighted to say that despite some recent setbacks, by late 2019 DIT will have 10,000 students on campus at Grangegorman.  There are currently 1,200 students, researchers and entrepreneurs on campus and it is already making a very significant contribution to Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city.  Over the next five years, the development of the campus will assist in transforming this part of the city through contributing to the renewal of neglected areas and creating opportunities for educational access, community engagement and economic vitality.  Served by the new cross-city Luas line, it will change the map of Dublin.<\/p><p> Finally, I would like to briefly mention technological university legislation.  Since the publication of the Hunt report on higher education in 2011 and its adoption as national policy, DIT has been working closely with our partners in IT Tallaght and IT Blanchardstown towards creating a technological university for Dublin.  We have successfully gone through stage three of the four-stage application process.  We understand that the proposed legislation to enable us to move to stage four may come before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the very near future.  We ask members to support this legislation in order that, building on our combined strengths, we can create our new institution to serve the Dublin region.<\/p><p> I thank members for this opportunity to answer any questions they may have.  My colleagues and I will endeavour to do so fully and frankly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#MM00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian Norton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498118400,"counter":1052,"content":"<p>I thank the chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting to discuss the financial statements of Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, for 2015 and the KPMG reports conducted into anonymous allegations made in 2014.  I am joined by the vice president for finance and administration, Mr. Paul Gallagher.  Given that it is our first appearance before the committee, perhaps I could outline what CIT is all about.  It is one of the largest, most progressive and successful institutes of technology in the country with approximately 11,000 higher education students, 3,000 craft and junior music students and a staff of 1,400.  It operates on four major sites in Cork city and county.  CIT&rsquo;s Bishopstown campus comprises 38 ha, including major sports facilities, research centres and the Rubicon innovation centre.  The CIT Crawford College of Art and Design and the CIT Cork School of Music are both based in the city centre, and the National Maritime College of Ireland is based in Ringaskiddy, County Cork, close to the naval base in Haulbowline.  CIT is a major national provider of STEM education and research.  Its annual income and expenditure is approximately &euro;100 million and research activity constitutes 20% of its total budget.  CIT, in partnership with IT Tralee, has successfully completed three of the four stages of technological university designation.<\/p> <p>  CIT enjoys a national and international reputation for the quality of its education and research and the professional capabilities of its graduates.  It leads Irish higher education in the recognition of work-based learning and prior learning and the development of joint degrees, which is done in conjunction with UCC and universities in Europe.  The quality of its education programmes and research is overseen by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI.  Its governance is provided by its governing body and through its three committees: audit, finance and strategic development.  Its internal audit, while tendered for on a sectoral basis, operates on an independent basis in each institution.  It operates under the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006 and the HEA has a regulatory oversight of the institutes of technology.<\/p> <p>  Higher education in Ireland has been operating in a very challenging financial environment since 2008, with significantly increased higher education student numbers, reduced staff numbers and reduced State funding.  Even though CIT has continued to be successful in this period, it is not immune to these financial challenges as may be seen in our 2015 financial statements.  CIT incurred deficits in the academic years 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015.  I apologise because the figure of &euro;126 given in the briefing in this regard should read &euro;126,000.  The representatives of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be glad to know that we both agree that the deficit was &euro;1.2 million rather than &euro;1,216.  It is amazing that one can read something and miss a vital detail.  A break-even position was recorded in the 2015 to 2016 academic year and, following an extensive review and planning process in conjunction with a HEA process, forecasts for the next four years demonstrate the ability of the institute to remain in a sustainable financial position.  The forecast for the academic year 2016 to 2017 is in line with expectations.<\/p> <p>  The reason for the deficits in the academic years 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015 relate, in the main, to the STEM and apprenticeship areas.  In terms of STEM, the funding model has negatively impacted on the weighting of funding in this area following the introduction of the flat-rate student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum.  In terms of apprenticeship, CIT had approximately 100 staff working in this area in 2008 and carried the cost of maintaining these staff during a period of collapse in provision.  Fortunately, the area of apprenticeship is now experiencing significant growth and is contributing directly to the recovery in CIT&rsquo;s financial position.<\/p> <p>  CIT has always been prompt in the submission of its financial statements to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  With a year end of 31 August and deadline for submission of 31 December, CIT has consistently submitted its accounts in late October or November.  CIT's last set of financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2016 are expected to be signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General this month.  No outstanding issues of a high rating are expected.<\/p> <p>  The committee has indicated that it wishes to revisit the issue of the KPMG report.  This report relates to two anonymous letters received by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2014 in regard to CIT.  As for the first anonymous letter received in March 2014, a total of 175 allegations were made.  Many of these were grossly defamatory.  The anonymous letter was referred by the chairman of governing body to the audit committee, which was authorised by governing body to obtain independent legal advice.  Based on this advice, the audit committee, again with the agreement of governing body and via the independent legal advisers Arthur Cox, tendered for and engaged KPMG to carry out an independent review of the allegations.<\/p> <p>  KPMG&rsquo;s engagement was structured on a phased approach to ensure that the audit committee could retain oversight of the investigation while ensuring KPMG had sufficient freedom to complete its work.  KPMG&rsquo;s remit was to investigate the allegations as presented and was not limited to the handling of the process by CIT.  Indeed, KPMG noted in its report that it did not note any material limitations of scope as part of the review which prevented it from completing the scope of work as set out.<\/p><p>The phased approach included a review of the anonymous letters and management responses; a corporate governance review and review of internal policies and procedures and CIT&rsquo;s compliance; a review of expenditure documentation in CIT and its subsidiaries; consideration of whether each allegation had been addressed; and production of a comprehensive report of findings. <\/p><p> The results of the KPMG review were as follows: 32 of the allegations contained insufficient evidence to allow further review; 35 were responded to sufficiently at the outset by CIT management and no further action was deemed necessary; 52 were deemed repetitious to other allegations in the same letter; and 56 allegations were identified for additional information and documentation.  This was facilitated and of those 56 allegations, 47 were deemed to require no further action as they had been adequately addressed by the institute; three were considered to contain no evidence and therefore needed no further action; and six allegations were deemed repetitious to other allegations and required no further action. <\/p><p> In respect of the second anonymous letter received in December 2014, another 21 allegations were made.  Again, many of these appeared to be grossly defamatory and all were considered by the audit committee of CIT.  The audit committee engaged KPMG to carry out a further independent review, which determined that two of the allegations had been previously addressed by KPMG and did not require any further action; three were sufficiently addressed at the outset by CIT management and no further action was deemed necessary; one was deemed repetitious to previous allegations; and 15 of the allegations were identified for additional information and documentation.  This was facilitated and those 15 allegations were then deemed to require no further action as the allegations had been adequately addressed by the institute. <\/p><p> In summary, the outcome of the KPMG independent reviews was that of a total of 196 allegations, 35 were deemed to have insufficient evidence to allow further review, 102 were deemed to require no further action as the allegations had been adequately addressed by the institute and 59 were deemed repetitious to other allegations and required no further action. <\/p><p> The governing body received updates from the audit committee during the process.  A final report issued from the audit committee was considered by the governing body at its meeting on 26 March 2015.  It concluded that after two intensive external investigations, all individuals and-or agencies identified within the letters had carried out their professional duties highly diligently and with total integrity.  The governing body concluded that no further response or action was required from the institute&rsquo;s executive. <\/p><p> During the course of the extensive KPMG reviews, a small number of issues were found aside from the 196 allegations contained in the anonymous letters.  As is the case with any audit report, these matters and management responses were considered by the audit committee and controls were changed or strengthened as appropriate.  A full copy of the audit committee&rsquo;s final report to the governing body and the KPMG reports have been provided to the HEA, the Department of Education and Skills and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The chair of the governing body also provided the HEA with a full written account of the process undertaken to address the matter.  The matter was also addressed at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 10 December 2015 and extracts from the relevant statements of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills are attached in the appendix provided today.  All attest to the satisfactory manner in which CIT dealt with the matter. <\/p><p> We remain at the disposal of the committee to answer any questions it may have on these and other matters. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#NN00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>I thank Dr Murphy.

The impression was given that the loss from SWETS UK was of two amounts.  The bankruptcy loss was &euro;718,000 but the service that was subsequently procured was a budget amount that applied to that.  There was only one sum of money lost yet the impression was given that there were two.  Additionally, the impression was given that the review by Ernst &amp;amp; Young had identified sums of money that were not properly approved through our processes and that somehow, some money had gone amiss.  The approval process in its transaction had not been appropriate and we amended that subsequently.  However, those monies were budgeted for, approved and procured.<\/p> <p>  The other observation I would make is that the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report itself had been provided to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the HEA and fully discussed with the latter.  This was alluded to in the covering report we supplied to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is to the regret of our governing body and my own personal regret that we did not provide it here.  We did not do so because the issues and what we have done about them were covered in the management report we provided.

Professor Nolan told us that the service had been contracted for the previous 15 years.  I asked if the controls would be as robust as if a new service was being contracted.  Essentially, the response was that the kind of due diligence carried out would have been as if it had been a first-time contract.  It is very interesting to compare that transcript to the content of the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report.  The system that it seems to have gone though really consisted of somebody in the library signing off on it.  It was assigned at director level and did not go through the Agresso system, which would have provided checks and balances at either end.  This was a very large amount of money.  It looks to me like due diligence was not performed as I was led to believe it was when I asked the question on 6 April.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#OO00500","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498118400,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>The Deputy is certainly correct that the transaction was not in Agresso and would not have come to me for approval.

The company is funded directly by the HEA and has a board which is chaired by the president of another institute of technology, usually in rotation or a senior figure from an institute of technology, and has a membership drawn from representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and the institutes of technology, including DIT.

Accounts for the company have been approved by the board of An Cheim and by the auditors for the company, the Comptroller and Auditor General, earlier this month.<\/p> <p>  A full overview of the wind-down is contained in the statement of internal control in the accounts which will be posted by the end of this month on the Oireachtas website, and they relate to 31 August 2016.  With the permission of the committee and in the spirit of absolute transparency, I will go through some of the summary of the statement of internal control.  The company was established as a shared service support to the institutes of technology.  The main focus of the company was to deliver on a range of technology related systems, management information systems, MIS, to support human resources, student records, library management and finance needs across the ITs, for approximately 100,000 students and 7,000 staff.  It covered everything from registration, examinations and data management to all staff related systems.  The company was incorporated in 2006 with its own board of directors and a chief executive officer, CEO, with an annual budget from the HEA.  In 2013, as part of the consolidation of State agencies and also to provide an opportunity for greater synergies within the wider higher education sector, it was agreed to transfer the services of An Cheim to a new company, EduCampus Computer Services Limited, to be formed as a subsidiary of HEAnet and to wind down An Cheim.  There was a logic to that and it was a wise decision.<\/p> <p>  The process of gaining all the necessary governance approvals to establish EduCampus with charitable status and to transfer An Cheim services and assets to it was undertaken through 2014 and 2015.  A key objective of all parties was to ensure the continuity of service for core business applications across the ITs.  Accordingly, the smooth transfer of activity, staff and resources from An Cheim to EduCampus was seen as being very important.<\/p> <p>  On 1 October 2015, the HEA transferred all funding of activities from An Cheim to EduCampus and all suppliers and clients of An Cheim were informed.  Five of the eight An Cheim staff transferred to EduCampus and three returned to DIT.  The CEO of An Cheim remained as CEO to direct the contract novation process and to wind down the company.

I would like to talk with them about that at some stage.

The National University of Ireland, Galway, which is not here today, has a foundation which operates from an office in the university but which does not pay rent.  There is all this language around the situation being very good for the institutions.  In the guise of education, we are being told what is good for us with very little accountability.

I have one final issue to ask the witness about.  That is why I asked Mr. Love to give us an understanding of the presidents of the various third level institutions and whether their employment was full time or whatever.  Obviously, at the salary being paid, we would expect full-time service and not something else.  Professor Norton might talk to us about something that is public knowledge.  I think he is chairman of Action Renewables.  That is a Northern Irish company that was the principal adviser to people who applied for the cash-for-ash scheme or the renewable heat incentive.  The witness has stated he was not responsible for designing or delivering the scheme, which is undoubtedly the case.  However, I think his company processed at least 30% of all applications - that seems to be the accepted figure - under the renewable heat incentive.  Some people felt that that organisation - I do not know whether it has claimed some charitable status - should have advised the State in some way, because of that possible charitable status, that this scheme was not good for the people.  I think Professor Norton or executives of his company would say that it was not their job to do that, that their job was to assist applicants and that it would have been wrong of them to assist applicants to apply for funding under the cash-for-ash scheme while at the same time recommending to the Government that the scheme was not a good scheme.  The witness might talk to us about his commitment to the Action Renewables company, his involvement and any remuneration he receives from that company, because we have had this with the HSE and other organisations to which the State is paying full-time salaries.

I previously worked with the University of Ulster and had a link through that university to the promotion of renewable energy in Northern Ireland.  Action Renewables is, as I say, a charity.  Its activity is to develop and assist in policy measures and interventions with those who want to promote renewable energy, such as developing capabilities.  For example, the renewable energy training academy in Northern Ireland, which was an INTERREG activity, came through Action Renewables.  The all-Ireland grid study has enabled electricity that goes North-South throughout the island and it came out of a study done by Action Renewables.  It is about enabling measures for renewable energy.  If there are particular schemes that are introduced, and the renewable heat incentive was such a scheme, Action Renewables will advise those who want to avail of those schemes on how to do so.  There are a number of schemes.  There are schemes for photovoltaics, wind energy and others.   Around 20% of the applicants came to Action Renewables.

Part of that may be a gap in their English language ability, which needs to go to a particular level to meet the necessary entrance requirements.  To do that we need to draw on English language teaching provision which is IELTS accredited, so it actually meets the accreditation requirement for the relevant qualification they need to pass at the relevant level to gain entry.  That provision goes through the whole year, including the summer.  We do not have colleagues who deliver that type of provision.  Indeed, our colleagues deserve their summer holidays.  It goes through the entire year.  We went out to tender, to procurement, and we have a supplier of that service.  The nature of the foundation programme is about the gap in what students have and what they need to progress.<\/p> <p>  We get different intakes, and the nature of that will change.

The Chairman of this committee will understand, as a former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, that it is important for the Committee of Public Accounts to be able to scrutinise the spending of taxpayers' money, which is one of its core functions.

We need to recognise that confidence in how public money is spent is at an all time low for genuine understandable reasons.  The possible misuse of taxpayers' money is an issue of public controversy.  Where we have the expertise inhouse in the Civil Service that is where most of the work should be done.

This arrangement will greatly assist in the processing of certain cases, such as parental leave.  In order to process statutory and contractual entitlements such as parental leave, pension payments, survivor's pension and so forth, the NSSO is required to view and verify certain documents such as birth, death or marriage certificates relating to its customers, which would be normal practice.  Currently, the processes within the NSSO mean the original, long versions of forms must be sent to the office for verification before these important entitlements can be granted.  Many process delays occur when the customer fails or is unable to submit such forms on time, meaning that vital payments are sometimes delayed.  The protection of sensitive data such as that contained on these forms is obviously of utmost concern and consideration to the NSSO.  The customer will always be kept aware of any process before anything is done with the documentation.

Currently, the definition of voluntary patient in the Mental Health Act 2001 states that a voluntary patient is not subject to an admission order.  In other words, a person is a voluntary patient if he or she is not an involuntary patient subject to detention.  This definition makes no reference to consent.  In order to be compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and in line with the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015, it is necessary to amend the definition of voluntary patient to include a specific reference to the need for a person to consent to admission.<\/p> <p>  However, this change cannot proceed on its own without any associated changes being introduced.  The suggested definition of voluntary patient would immediately result in some people being denied inpatient treatment.  Such persons would be those who lack capacity and, therefore, cannot provide consent.  While they would need inpatient treatment, they would not be sufficiently mentally ill as to warrant admission as an involuntary patient.  As they lack capacity and cannot consent to treatment, they could not be voluntary patients but, equally, as they do not suffer from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 3 of the 2001 Act, they also could not be detained.  Such patients are often referred to as the \"compliant incapacitated\".  Before any new definition of voluntary patient which explicitly refers to capacity, we need also to include lawful measures which ensure that at no stage would the compliant incapacitated be denied treatment.<\/p><p>In this regard, my Department is currently working on deprivation of liberty safeguards, intended to allow persons without capacity to be lawfully admitted to residential care and to psychiatric hospitals for treatment.  It is essential that the change to the definition of \"voluntary patient\" occurs simultaneously with the commencement of provisions relating to deprivation of liberty.  Work is under way on these safeguards and my Department is in discussion with the Department of Justice and Equality about including these provisions in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  I assure Members here today that this is a priority change for my Department.  The fact that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has not yet commenced allows us time to finalise the necessary changes as without such commencement, and the roll-out of the decision support service, the planned deprivation of liberty measures cannot begin.<\/p><p> Where this important change is concerned we agree that it is a necessary change, but we ask Members to press the pause button because we need to finalise the deprivation of liberty safeguards in tandem with this change, otherwise we will be legislating to deny certain people inpatient psychiatric treatment.  This, obviously, cannot be allowed to happen.  It is my intention to revisit this provision on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017062200002#B00500","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":1970,"content":"<p>It appears that the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, is not putting any proposal before the committee.

My Department does not object to this proposal, which mirrors very closely a recommendation of the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001.  Under the current section 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 the best interests of the person are identified as the principal consideration in any decision to be made concerning the care or treatment of a person.  This section has, over the years, led to an over paternalistic interpretation of the Act.  This is no longer seen as appropriate and is not in line with modern human rights standards.<\/p> <p>  The expert group review of the 2001 Act, which was published in 2015, recommended that the principal consideration of best interests should be removed from the Act and replaced by a list of guiding principles.  These are the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of mental health with the person's own understanding of his or her own mental health being given due respect; autonomy and self-determination; a presumption that the person is best placed to determine what promotes or compromises his or her own dignity; bodily integrity; and least restrictive care.  This list is effectively the same as the principles listed by Deputy Browne in his Bill and my Department can agree, subject to possible minor changes on Report Stage, to the proposed provision.<\/p> <p>  I would ask Members to allow us some further leeway to examine what other possible linked changes might be necessary to ensure that the provision as it stands does not have any unintended consequences.

In this case it relates to children not adults.  There is one significant change.  While the intention is to add guiding principles, as is proposed for adults, with regard to children we would seek to retain the reference to \"best interests\".  There is agreement that this is the way to proceed where children are concerned.  The expert group review on the Mental Health Act 2001 also recognised that in the context of children there is a need to refer to \"best interests\" and it is noted that paragraph 1 of Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that in all actions concerning children that are undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be of primary consideration.<\/p> <p>  The guiding principles as laid out in this section of the Bill differ slightly from those recommended by the expert group review and I would appreciate the opportunity to examine more closely the wording recommended before we agree the final text.<\/p> <p>  I must stress once again that I have no difficulty with the principle behind the change, but the individual principles themselves may need to be tweaked to make sure we get them absolutely right.<\/p> <p>  While I accept the thrust of the provision it is my intention to once again revisit this on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017062200002#C02300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":1992,"content":"<p>Once again, it is my understanding that the Minister of State is not making proposals this morning and is simply reserving his position to make amendments at a later stage.

I have said previously that while what is being proposed is reasonable it cannot come in to effect until the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has actually commenced.  There is now agreement that the Mental Health Act 2001 needs to be amended insofar as consent and many other matters are concerned.
