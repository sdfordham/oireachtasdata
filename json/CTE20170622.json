Agreed.<\/p> <p>  With regard to matters arising, we will come to everything relevant in the course of the meeting today.  We will move straight on to No. 3, which is correspondence received.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Some will relate to the meeting we had with the Garda Commissioner on Tuesday because they have not been noted.  They arrived since our last public meeting but we did not note correspondence.<\/p> <p>  The first item is the opening statement from Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan for the meeting on 19 June.  We note that because that meeting was held on Tuesday.  The next item is opening statement for today's meeting from Professor Brian Norton.  We note that.  The next item is the opening statement for today's meeting from Professor Desmond Fitzgerald, president of University of Limerick.  We note that and it will be published with the other opening statement.  There is an opening statement for today's meeting from Dr. Brendan J. Murphy, president of Cork Institute of Technology.  We note and will publish that.  <\/p> <p>  Next is category B correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-up to previous meetings.  Correspondence dated 14 June from Cork Institute of Technology is as follows: a briefing document as presented to the Committee of Public Accounts on 10 December 2015 which outlines the background and details of the KPMG report.  We can raise that with its representatives when they are here shortly.  There are also relevant extracts from Committee of Public Accounts opening statements by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Department of Education and Skills and Higher Education Authority.  We also attach the full copy of the transcript of the Committee of Public Accounts hearing on Cork Institute of Technology, which was held on 10 Dec 2015.  Members have it by way of background information.  We note all that.<\/p> <p>  No. 603B is correspondence from the chairman of the Office of Public Works regarding a 2013 request to provide office accommodation for Caranua with instructions from the Department that Caranua would meet the appropriate rental costs.  Do we have that letter on screen?  Does anyone want to comment on it?  It is No. 603B.  What is the conclusion of that letter, towards the end of it?  Do members want time to consider it?  We will come back to it next week.  We will hold it over until next week.  <\/p> <p>  No. 607B is correspondence from the Comptroller and Auditor General dated 19 June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#E00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>On the previous letter about the rent, at all stages this committee asked for no rent to be paid.

We have completed our work in terms of our hearings and we will move to a report.  This was Mr. Barrett, who is head of human resources, asking the Commissioner to correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts.  When the questions were put, she said there was no need to correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It shows the clear contradiction between his understanding of what happened in meetings and her understanding of what happened at the meeting.  It is quite serious for the head of human resources to be alerting this committee to information he says the Commissioner had in respect of previous briefings she was given before she said she was briefed but also the nature of the meeting that he was present at.  He is writing to her and giving us a letter to say in his view she should correct the record.  She disputes that.

The last sentence is, \"On 30th June, 2015 and again in early July I had been advised that Mr. Cyril Dunne had brought these matters of critical concern, which I had been raising, to your personal attention\".  He is saying he was advised.  He does not say who advised him.  I read it carefully.  That letter is an element of hearsay.  He is saying he was advised by somebody.  He does not tell us who advised him and that something was brought to somebody else's attention.

We did speak about this matter in private, as other Deputies have said.  It is only this morning that I discovered the limited number of staff available to the secretariat by comparison with the number that were available to the banking inquiry.  The amount of work they do on our behalf is phenomenal.  As Deputy Connolly said, they are coping.  There is the equivalent of a mini-banking inquiry going on here every week, if not from month to month.  When one considers the various reports we are producing at the moment, one recalls that the banking inquiry had an entire floor in Agriculture House.  It had 20 or 30 people at its disposal.  In fact, there was an additional member of staff for each of the members of the banking inquiry.  It is not that I am looking for that &ndash; I am not &ndash; but I am appalled, quite frankly, that the secretariat of the Committee of Public Accounts, the only constitutional committee of the State, is limited to six or seven staff.  I was genuinely of the view, given the quality of the work coming our way and the research, that there was a team of 20 people behind the scenes.  The clerk, the members of the secretariat themselves and the Chairman should put a plan together and ascertain our optimal number of staff in terms of research, secretarial and administrative functions.  They should go to the Ceann Comhairle and Oireachtas Commission and make the case for them.

It is ranked in 54th position globally, 25th in Europe and 9th in the whole of the UK and Ireland.  The shared ambition of UCC and the IMI is to advance education by raising the standard of management in Ireland and by enabling organisations and individuals to fulfil their potential through world-class executive education.  Partnering with UCC, the institute's future growth will be supported by research-led insight and expertise from within the university as well as the IMI's corporate membership community which together will continue to serve as the bedrock that connects the IMI to the needs of Irish organisations.<br\/><br\/>Our joint ambition stretches beyond Ireland's shores.  The IMI and the Cork University Business School will forge significant international alliances and relationships with global reach.  This combined with the institute's global ranking offers a unique value proposition that can consistently deliver distinctive world-class executive education to Irish and international students.  The acquisition of the IMI by UCC is a great investment for the university, the institute, our students and the people of Ireland.  The relationship has evolved over eight years and in the period 2011 to 2016, it took the form of an alliance which was launched by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, in 2011.  During that period, the governing body of the university considered the possibility of a formal acquisition of the institute on several occasions.  However, the body decided not to proceed until it was satisfied that the conditions deemed necessary for long-term success were fulfilled.  In January 2015, the governing body, based on extensive information and due diligence, approved the acquisition of IMI, subject to a set of conditions to be met in advance of the completion of the transaction.  These conditions related to the absence of pension liabilities, the general financial position of the institute, settlement of any outstanding cases and approval by the Competition Authority of the transaction.<\/p><p>The acquisition was completed in November 2016 and is a complex and detailed arrangement which took several years to negotiate.  Both organisations persisted over those years because they fully believed in the benefits for UCC, the IMI itself and for Ireland.  We have outlined these benefits and other aspects in the papers that have been provided to the committee.  <\/p><p> The value of the Irish Management Institute nationally and its significance to the business community has been recognised by the Government.  At the launch of the alliance in 2011, the Taoiseach noted that the development was significant and welcome for its potential to greatly improve the capacity of Ireland's companies to compete internationally.  Similarly, the T&aacute;naiste, at the launch of the merger in January, emphasised the need for Ireland to have the capacity to develop the requisite calibre of business leaders to guarantee long-term economic success.  The university shares these views and believes that this acquisition will be of real benefit to University College Cork, the Irish Management Institute and the State as a whole.  <\/p><p> In summary, I would like to put the following on the record.  No taxpayer or Exchequer funds of any kind were used by the university to acquire the Irish Management Institute.  The acquisition is totally aligned with the university's strategic objectives and national priorities for lifelong learning.  In my own career I have been associated with many universities, including the University of California, Duke University and the University of Maryland.  All are institutions that operate to the highest standards of governance.  In my short time at University College Cork, I can assure the committee that UCC also operates to those very high standards of governance and accountability and that this acquisition was fully compliant with those standards and with the Government's framework within which the university operates, and specifically with the powers of the university under the Universities Act 1997 and the powers vested in the governing body under that Act.  The acquisition by University College Cork was fully disclosed to the Higher Education Authority in advance of the transaction close.  The Higher Education Authority fully supported the transaction and recognised the benefits it would bring for students and business education in Ireland.<\/p><p> I wish to assure the members that University College Cork has not misled the committee with regard to the acquisition.  Additional information was sought by the committee following our previous appearance in March.  This was provided on 13 April and 9 May.  We have also provided the committee today with supporting appendices and schedules.  These will provide additional reassurance on the transaction. <\/p><p>  I am accompanied today by the bursar and chief financial officer, Mr. Diarmuid Collins,  the corporate secretary, Mr. Michael Farrell, and the finance officer, Mr. Cormac McSweeney.  My colleagues and I are happy to address any questions that the committee may have on the IMI transaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>We are also joined by Dr. Des Fitzgerald, the new President of the University of Limerick.

I will not read out the document I sent in but I will briefly say that I am here today to acknowledge that we have a responsibility as a public body to ensure that we spend money properly and transparently.  I acknowledge that I now take responsibility for many of the issues that arose within the university before I took up the post.  I will now outline some of the things we have done to address some of these issues.<\/p> <p>  Before I start I would just like to say that the University of Limerick is an outstanding institution with great staff and students.  One of my keen objectives as we go through this process is to make sure that the reputation and credibility of the institution is preserved.  Since taking office I have taken a number of measures to address some of the issues.  Among the things that I am very keen to ensure we do properly is our duty of care to those staff members who have been caught up in the issues in question, particularly the whistleblowers who have currently either been put on paid leave or have left the institution. <\/p> <p>  The other thing I am keen to address is the issue of severance payments, particularly with regard to the information that has been given to this committee, to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the Department of Education and Skills.  I have to say at this early point that we are continuing to collect and analyse the information.  I would say, however, that I think the severance agreements made were unacceptably high.  <\/p> <p>  I will outline some of the things we have been doing since I took up office.  As the committee is aware, one measure was to initially call for an independent review of the University of Limerick.  Richard Thorn has been appointed to that role and we have given him every assistance that we can.  Within the institution we have appointed Professor Mary O'Sullivan to provide direct liaison with Dr. Thorn.  We have also been undergoing a review of the structure of the senior management team and there is currently an ongoing restructuring of that team, looking carefully at the finance department and at human resources in particular.  The audit and risk committee also initiated an internal review of some of the matters raised both by RTE and by the PAC, particularly looking at conflicts of interest, the issue of people going out of the university to take degrees elsewhere, and the matter of the severance payments.  <\/p> <p>  To conclude, I want to be clear that I am determined to take whatever action necessary once the review has been completed.  I believe that this is on course for the end of September.  As I mentioned earlier, I am particularly concerned with protecting the reputation of the institution.  It has terrific support from its staff and students and from the community.  They have worked hard in the past to ensure the establishment of a university for Limerick and for the mid-west region.  It is very important for all of us that at the end of this process the university is put on a firm footing to further develop its academic programmes to provide education, training and research in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Desmond Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank the witness.

Schedule 3, which is a transaction overview, sets out the transaction itself.  It is included in the papers.  It addresses in particular the points that the programme made and the points that we made at the last session here on 30 March.  We purchased the IMI Sandyford campus, just over 13 acres.  That was based on a professional valuation.  The sum of &euro;20 million was used.  We advised the committee at the last meeting and subsequently in writing to follow up that it was funded via borrowings so again there was no public moneys involved.  No Exchequer moneys were provided to UCC for us to acquire that asset.<\/p> <p>  The third bullet point is consistent with what we said previously, and there is supporting documentation in our papers under Schedule A confirming that.  IMI, with that &euro;20 million discharged two charges that were on that campus.  The charges in effect were mortgages.  The IMI had developed a residential aspect to its offering that had been supported and financed by AIB, so with an element of our &euro;20 million proceeds with which we bought the campus the mortgage was released, discharged and paid back.<\/p> <p>  In 2012 &ndash; this is a key point &ndash; because when we looked to acquire the IMI previously the existence back then of a pension liability prevented us going ahead.  We did not want to take on a pension liability of a private entity and we paused at that time.  We continued with the alliance and revisited it when that was resolved.  It was resolved in 2012.  That is confirmed in the documentation attached in the accounts in the report we got from Mercer's pension expertise and in our due diligence with PwC.  That charge was also paid with the &euro;20 million from UCC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#L01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Diarmuid Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>In terms of the &euro;20 million that was funded via borrowings, who borrowed the &euro;20 million?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#L01800","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498118400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>UCC borrowed &euro;20 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#L01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Diarmuid Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>UCC is a taxpayer-funded organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#L02000","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498118400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Over the years our funding sources have diversified.

The IMI has a planned programme of investment by which to spend that post-acquisition.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the point of how the IMI settled and discharged the two charges over the campus, as the Deputy mentioned, UCC paid &euro;20 million.  Therefore, the IMI had that &euro;20 million.  If we look at the IMI's 2015 accounts, the IMI itself had its own cash.  As an entity, by the time the transaction was completed, the IMI had about &euro;1.7 million to &euro;1.8 million of its own cash itself.  Between the IMI's own cash resources and the &euro;20 million it got from UCC, it was able to discharge the two liabilities or charges - the AIB one the Deputy mentioned and the charge that was given to the pension trustees, as well as the &euro;400,000 that was for professional fees.  That did include an element of contingency and not all of it was needed in the end.  The money we gave and the IMI's own cash resources were able to pay those monies.  The investment is set out in document A5.  It was also the intention and view of UCC, once we required the asset - remember that it is our asset as we bought it and are leasing it back - that it was probably a bit tired and needed investment.

I welcome without hesitation what Professor Fitzgerald has said, but preserving the reputation of the university is immaterial to me at the moment given what has been highlighted.  I have had the privilege of going to university.  I regard it as a privilege.  It is very important for Limerick and the area, but reputation is earned and it is earned by a university that is open and accountable with money which primarily comes from the taxpayer.  I see Professor O'Shea nodding.  I am worried and very concerned about the general comment that this is not public money.  We have been through this with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The universities get substantial public moneys.  They are co-mingled with other moneys which, it seems, are separate from the student foundations and trusts, which are not open and accountable.  We will be coming back to trusts and foundations that are not consolidated with accounts.  Generally speaking, the presidents, who all happen to be male, feel that these should not be subjected to public scrutiny at this committee and that the charities are the appropriate thing.  I will come back to that.  What strikes me, and it has already been said by one or two of my colleagues, is the matter of whistleblowers, what they have gone through and what has been said about them.

The Irish Management Institute has done what I would call \"a Clerys job\" here.  The wealth and assets of the organisation were taken to one side and the company was just a name.  It is just like Clerys.  Do the witnesses get the point I am making?  I do not want them to comment on Clerys.  We are making a comment.  It seems to be that sort of issue of taking the assets out of the company and just leaving the company.  Hence, Mr. Collins can say UCC bought the company for nothing because there was nothing to buy there besides the name.  That was disconcerting to everybody watching.  They could not rationalise what was being said because UCC knew the hairs it was splitting and did not make that clear.  We have a better understanding of this idea that UCC says the IMI cost the taxpayer nothing.  Of course the company cost nothing because there was nothing there.  However, somebody had to raise a loan.<\/p> <p>  I come back then to the situation of the public funding.  We are told UCC is down to 47% of income coming from public sources.

Research was a significant source of income but State and semi-State companies provided &euro;55 million of that.  The EU provided &euro;13 million of that.  I am going from the university's accounts here.  That is &euro;158 million, or in the region of 50% of UCC's income.  As such, it is substantially funded directly by the State.  The witnesses are saying it might now be 40%.  Ultimately, what troubles us a little - and we are trying to get to the bottom of the actual cost - relates to page 19 of the document presented here, in Appendix 9, namely the last paragraph, which is boxed.  We will get it on the screen there now.  We are back to this issue of saying no Exchequer moneys were used in the acquisition.  We accept that.  It was bank money that was used to acquire it.  If something goes wrong, however, it could ultimately fall back to the college to pay for it.  On day 1, the bank paid for it, but if things do not work out, it could fall back to UCC.  I am just looking.<\/p><p>I will read to the witnesses the last paragraph in their own note that they provided to us.  It is not on screen.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>The university has acquired an appreciating asset.  Were UCC to consider at some stage in future recovering its investment, recent land sales adjacent to IMI would suggest that any future sale of the campus would yield a return to UCC in excess of the amount paid.<\/blockquote> <p>We now hear the university justifying the price it paid on the basis that: &quot;Sure, we are going to have a property boom.  Values are going to go up.&quot;  That is UCC's Appendix 9 to us today.  When Deputy Alan Kelly asked, UCC said it had no intention, but it in its documentary evidence, it is a consideration because it has highlighted in a big, black box what would happen at some stage in the future if UCC were to consider it.  As such, it is a possibility.<\/p><p>They have somewhat hedged this &euro;20 million cost against the fact that the properties will rise in value anyway.  Do the witnesses not see how we find that a little disconcerting for a third level college?

Such arrangements represent a very small proportion of DIT provision and are entered into where there is clear student demand and where, for reasons of resources, we cannot deliver the programme in-house.  Students registered on such a programme are recognised as full DIT students with access to services, from the medical centre and counselling, to sports, clubs and societies. The DIT commercial modern music degree, delivered through the British and Irish Modern Music Institute Dublin, BIMM Dublin, is an example of such a programme which has run very successfully for five years.  The future delivery is currently under public tender.<br\/><br\/>We also provided further information concerning the library subscription service, Swets UK.  This company had been procured through a national public tender in 2012 but went into bankruptcy in 2014.  DIT has provided an additional document to the committee that relates to an investigation undertaken by DIT and conducted by an external consultant, Ernst &amp;amp; Young, EY, into the processes that gave rise to the payment by DIT to Swets UK.  The issues raised in this report are also addressed in the final management report, which was submitted in July 2016 to this committee.  I regret that the EY report was not specifically included.  There were press reports this morning in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that the report was not provided to this committee, but we have a receipt from the secretariat for the Committee of Public Accounts dating to 31 May 2017 that it was received.

For example, they included annual rental for DIT buildings, utilities and energy costs, catering contracts, audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and library resources.  These payments now go through the levels of formal approval required by our finance system for all payments under our authority to bind.<\/p><p> A loss of &euro;718,000 was incurred by DIT as a result of the Swets UK bankruptcy.  We subsequently procured the required services through another supplier at a cost of &euro;760,000.  While the cost is higher, the terms of the new contract do not require full prepayment and therefore reduce the exposure to potential commercial failure.  DIT has been excluded from IReL, the Irish Research electronic Library which is funded by the HEA and to date has only been available to universities.  Access to this resource would reduce our exposure to the viability of commercial provision.  I am pleased to inform the committee that we yesterday received notification that a process is under way to grant DIT access to it.<\/p><p> The scale of the loss incurred by the Swets bankruptcy reflects the scale of the library service in DIT, which accounts for approximately 6% of our annual non-pay expenditure.  The service provides access to relevant and current texts, research and related findings for our student population of 20,500 who are pursuing courses at levels from apprenticeship to PhD and our academic staff of over 1,200.  The library's extensive resources include 286,000 books, 18,500 dissertations and updated subscriptions to approximately 35,000 online journals, periodicals and databases to support students across a wide range of activities and disciplines and support our research activity.<\/p><p> We currently operate six libraries, which are located in Aungier Street, Kevin Street, Bolton Street, Cathal Brugha Street, Rathmines and Grangegorman.  Their dispersed nature adds to costs.  This will be alleviated by the development of a single library on the new single DIT campus.<\/p><p> I am delighted to say that despite some recent setbacks, by late 2019 DIT will have 10,000 students on campus at Grangegorman.  There are currently 1,200 students, researchers and entrepreneurs on campus and it is already making a very significant contribution to Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city.  Over the next five years, the development of the campus will assist in transforming this part of the city through contributing to the renewal of neglected areas and creating opportunities for educational access, community engagement and economic vitality.  Served by the new cross-city Luas line, it will change the map of Dublin.<\/p><p> Finally, I would like to briefly mention technological university legislation.  Since the publication of the Hunt report on higher education in 2011 and its adoption as national policy, DIT has been working closely with our partners in IT Tallaght and IT Blanchardstown towards creating a technological university for Dublin.  We have successfully gone through stage three of the four-stage application process.  We understand that the proposed legislation to enable us to move to stage four may come before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the very near future.  We ask members to support this legislation in order that, building on our combined strengths, we can create our new institution to serve the Dublin region.<\/p><p> I thank members for this opportunity to answer any questions they may have.  My colleagues and I will endeavour to do so fully and frankly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#MM00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian Norton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498118400,"counter":1052,"content":"<p>I thank the chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting to discuss the financial statements of Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, for 2015 and the KPMG reports conducted into anonymous allegations made in 2014.  I am joined by the vice president for finance and administration, Mr. Paul Gallagher.  Given that it is our first appearance before the committee, perhaps I could outline what CIT is all about.  It is one of the largest, most progressive and successful institutes of technology in the country with approximately 11,000 higher education students, 3,000 craft and junior music students and a staff of 1,400.  It operates on four major sites in Cork city and county.  CIT&rsquo;s Bishopstown campus comprises 38 ha, including major sports facilities, research centres and the Rubicon innovation centre.  The CIT Crawford College of Art and Design and the CIT Cork School of Music are both based in the city centre, and the National Maritime College of Ireland is based in Ringaskiddy, County Cork, close to the naval base in Haulbowline.  CIT is a major national provider of STEM education and research.  Its annual income and expenditure is approximately &euro;100 million and research activity constitutes 20% of its total budget.  CIT, in partnership with IT Tralee, has successfully completed three of the four stages of technological university designation.<\/p> <p>  CIT enjoys a national and international reputation for the quality of its education and research and the professional capabilities of its graduates.  It leads Irish higher education in the recognition of work-based learning and prior learning and the development of joint degrees, which is done in conjunction with UCC and universities in Europe.  The quality of its education programmes and research is overseen by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI.  Its governance is provided by its governing body and through its three committees: audit, finance and strategic development.  Its internal audit, while tendered for on a sectoral basis, operates on an independent basis in each institution.  It operates under the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006 and the HEA has a regulatory oversight of the institutes of technology.<\/p> <p>  Higher education in Ireland has been operating in a very challenging financial environment since 2008, with significantly increased higher education student numbers, reduced staff numbers and reduced State funding.  Even though CIT has continued to be successful in this period, it is not immune to these financial challenges as may be seen in our 2015 financial statements.  CIT incurred deficits in the academic years 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015.  I apologise because the figure of &euro;126 given in the briefing in this regard should read &euro;126,000.  The representatives of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be glad to know that we both agree that the deficit was &euro;1.2 million rather than &euro;1,216.  It is amazing that one can read something and miss a vital detail.  A break-even position was recorded in the 2015 to 2016 academic year and, following an extensive review and planning process in conjunction with a HEA process, forecasts for the next four years demonstrate the ability of the institute to remain in a sustainable financial position.  The forecast for the academic year 2016 to 2017 is in line with expectations.<\/p> <p>  The reason for the deficits in the academic years 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015 relate, in the main, to the STEM and apprenticeship areas.  In terms of STEM, the funding model has negatively impacted on the weighting of funding in this area following the introduction of the flat-rate student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum.  In terms of apprenticeship, CIT had approximately 100 staff working in this area in 2008 and carried the cost of maintaining these staff during a period of collapse in provision.  Fortunately, the area of apprenticeship is now experiencing significant growth and is contributing directly to the recovery in CIT&rsquo;s financial position.<\/p> <p>  CIT has always been prompt in the submission of its financial statements to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  With a year end of 31 August and deadline for submission of 31 December, CIT has consistently submitted its accounts in late October or November.  CIT's last set of financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2016 are expected to be signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General this month.  No outstanding issues of a high rating are expected.<\/p> <p>  The committee has indicated that it wishes to revisit the issue of the KPMG report.  This report relates to two anonymous letters received by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2014 in regard to CIT.  As for the first anonymous letter received in March 2014, a total of 175 allegations were made.  Many of these were grossly defamatory.  The anonymous letter was referred by the chairman of governing body to the audit committee, which was authorised by governing body to obtain independent legal advice.  Based on this advice, the audit committee, again with the agreement of governing body and via the independent legal advisers Arthur Cox, tendered for and engaged KPMG to carry out an independent review of the allegations.<\/p> <p>  KPMG&rsquo;s engagement was structured on a phased approach to ensure that the audit committee could retain oversight of the investigation while ensuring KPMG had sufficient freedom to complete its work.  KPMG&rsquo;s remit was to investigate the allegations as presented and was not limited to the handling of the process by CIT.  Indeed, KPMG noted in its report that it did not note any material limitations of scope as part of the review which prevented it from completing the scope of work as set out.<\/p><p>The phased approach included a review of the anonymous letters and management responses; a corporate governance review and review of internal policies and procedures and CIT&rsquo;s compliance; a review of expenditure documentation in CIT and its subsidiaries; consideration of whether each allegation had been addressed; and production of a comprehensive report of findings. <\/p><p> The results of the KPMG review were as follows: 32 of the allegations contained insufficient evidence to allow further review; 35 were responded to sufficiently at the outset by CIT management and no further action was deemed necessary; 52 were deemed repetitious to other allegations in the same letter; and 56 allegations were identified for additional information and documentation.  This was facilitated and of those 56 allegations, 47 were deemed to require no further action as they had been adequately addressed by the institute; three were considered to contain no evidence and therefore needed no further action; and six allegations were deemed repetitious to other allegations and required no further action. <\/p><p> In respect of the second anonymous letter received in December 2014, another 21 allegations were made.  Again, many of these appeared to be grossly defamatory and all were considered by the audit committee of CIT.  The audit committee engaged KPMG to carry out a further independent review, which determined that two of the allegations had been previously addressed by KPMG and did not require any further action; three were sufficiently addressed at the outset by CIT management and no further action was deemed necessary; one was deemed repetitious to previous allegations; and 15 of the allegations were identified for additional information and documentation.  This was facilitated and those 15 allegations were then deemed to require no further action as the allegations had been adequately addressed by the institute. <\/p><p> In summary, the outcome of the KPMG independent reviews was that of a total of 196 allegations, 35 were deemed to have insufficient evidence to allow further review, 102 were deemed to require no further action as the allegations had been adequately addressed by the institute and 59 were deemed repetitious to other allegations and required no further action. <\/p><p> The governing body received updates from the audit committee during the process.  A final report issued from the audit committee was considered by the governing body at its meeting on 26 March 2015.  It concluded that after two intensive external investigations, all individuals and-or agencies identified within the letters had carried out their professional duties highly diligently and with total integrity.  The governing body concluded that no further response or action was required from the institute&rsquo;s executive. <\/p><p> During the course of the extensive KPMG reviews, a small number of issues were found aside from the 196 allegations contained in the anonymous letters.  As is the case with any audit report, these matters and management responses were considered by the audit committee and controls were changed or strengthened as appropriate.  A full copy of the audit committee&rsquo;s final report to the governing body and the KPMG reports have been provided to the HEA, the Department of Education and Skills and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The chair of the governing body also provided the HEA with a full written account of the process undertaken to address the matter.  The matter was also addressed at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 10 December 2015 and extracts from the relevant statements of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills are attached in the appendix provided today.  All attest to the satisfactory manner in which CIT dealt with the matter. <\/p><p> We remain at the disposal of the committee to answer any questions it may have on these and other matters. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#NN00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brendan Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>I thank Dr Murphy.

The impression was given that the loss from SWETS UK was of two amounts.  The bankruptcy loss was &euro;718,000 but the service that was subsequently procured was a budget amount that applied to that.  There was only one sum of money lost yet the impression was given that there were two.  Additionally, the impression was given that the review by Ernst &amp;amp; Young had identified sums of money that were not properly approved through our processes and that somehow, some money had gone amiss.  The approval process in its transaction had not been appropriate and we amended that subsequently.  However, those monies were budgeted for, approved and procured.<\/p> <p>  The other observation I would make is that the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report itself had been provided to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the HEA and fully discussed with the latter.  This was alluded to in the covering report we supplied to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is to the regret of our governing body and my own personal regret that we did not provide it here.  We did not do so because the issues and what we have done about them were covered in the management report we provided.

Professor Nolan told us that the service had been contracted for the previous 15 years.  I asked if the controls would be as robust as if a new service was being contracted.  Essentially, the response was that the kind of due diligence carried out would have been as if it had been a first-time contract.  It is very interesting to compare that transcript to the content of the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report.  The system that it seems to have gone though really consisted of somebody in the library signing off on it.  It was assigned at director level and did not go through the Agresso system, which would have provided checks and balances at either end.  This was a very large amount of money.  It looks to me like due diligence was not performed as I was led to believe it was when I asked the question on 6 April.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062200002#OO00500","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498118400,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>The Deputy is certainly correct that the transaction was not in Agresso and would not have come to me for approval.

The company is funded directly by the HEA and has a board which is chaired by the president of another institute of technology, usually in rotation or a senior figure from an institute of technology, and has a membership drawn from representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and the institutes of technology, including DIT.

Accounts for the company have been approved by the board of An Cheim and by the auditors for the company, the Comptroller and Auditor General, earlier this month.<\/p> <p>  A full overview of the wind-down is contained in the statement of internal control in the accounts which will be posted by the end of this month on the Oireachtas website, and they relate to 31 August 2016.  With the permission of the committee and in the spirit of absolute transparency, I will go through some of the summary of the statement of internal control.  The company was established as a shared service support to the institutes of technology.  The main focus of the company was to deliver on a range of technology related systems, management information systems, MIS, to support human resources, student records, library management and finance needs across the ITs, for approximately 100,000 students and 7,000 staff.  It covered everything from registration, examinations and data management to all staff related systems.  The company was incorporated in 2006 with its own board of directors and a chief executive officer, CEO, with an annual budget from the HEA.  In 2013, as part of the consolidation of State agencies and also to provide an opportunity for greater synergies within the wider higher education sector, it was agreed to transfer the services of An Cheim to a new company, EduCampus Computer Services Limited, to be formed as a subsidiary of HEAnet and to wind down An Cheim.  There was a logic to that and it was a wise decision.<\/p> <p>  The process of gaining all the necessary governance approvals to establish EduCampus with charitable status and to transfer An Cheim services and assets to it was undertaken through 2014 and 2015.  A key objective of all parties was to ensure the continuity of service for core business applications across the ITs.  Accordingly, the smooth transfer of activity, staff and resources from An Cheim to EduCampus was seen as being very important.<\/p> <p>  On 1 October 2015, the HEA transferred all funding of activities from An Cheim to EduCampus and all suppliers and clients of An Cheim were informed.  Five of the eight An Cheim staff transferred to EduCampus and three returned to DIT.  The CEO of An Cheim remained as CEO to direct the contract novation process and to wind down the company.

I would like to talk with them about that at some stage.

The National University of Ireland, Galway, which is not here today, has a foundation which operates from an office in the university but which does not pay rent.  There is all this language around the situation being very good for the institutions.  In the guise of education, we are being told what is good for us with very little accountability.

I have one final issue to ask the witness about.  That is why I asked Mr. Love to give us an understanding of the presidents of the various third level institutions and whether their employment was full time or whatever.  Obviously, at the salary being paid, we would expect full-time service and not something else.  Professor Norton might talk to us about something that is public knowledge.  I think he is chairman of Action Renewables.  That is a Northern Irish company that was the principal adviser to people who applied for the cash-for-ash scheme or the renewable heat incentive.  The witness has stated he was not responsible for designing or delivering the scheme, which is undoubtedly the case.  However, I think his company processed at least 30% of all applications - that seems to be the accepted figure - under the renewable heat incentive.  Some people felt that that organisation - I do not know whether it has claimed some charitable status - should have advised the State in some way, because of that possible charitable status, that this scheme was not good for the people.  I think Professor Norton or executives of his company would say that it was not their job to do that, that their job was to assist applicants and that it would have been wrong of them to assist applicants to apply for funding under the cash-for-ash scheme while at the same time recommending to the Government that the scheme was not a good scheme.  The witness might talk to us about his commitment to the Action Renewables company, his involvement and any remuneration he receives from that company, because we have had this with the HSE and other organisations to which the State is paying full-time salaries.

I previously worked with the University of Ulster and had a link through that university to the promotion of renewable energy in Northern Ireland.  Action Renewables is, as I say, a charity.  Its activity is to develop and assist in policy measures and interventions with those who want to promote renewable energy, such as developing capabilities.  For example, the renewable energy training academy in Northern Ireland, which was an INTERREG activity, came through Action Renewables.  The all-Ireland grid study has enabled electricity that goes North-South throughout the island and it came out of a study done by Action Renewables.  It is about enabling measures for renewable energy.  If there are particular schemes that are introduced, and the renewable heat incentive was such a scheme, Action Renewables will advise those who want to avail of those schemes on how to do so.  There are a number of schemes.  There are schemes for photovoltaics, wind energy and others.   Around 20% of the applicants came to Action Renewables.

Part of that may be a gap in their English language ability, which needs to go to a particular level to meet the necessary entrance requirements.  To do that we need to draw on English language teaching provision which is IELTS accredited, so it actually meets the accreditation requirement for the relevant qualification they need to pass at the relevant level to gain entry.  That provision goes through the whole year, including the summer.  We do not have colleagues who deliver that type of provision.  Indeed, our colleagues deserve their summer holidays.  It goes through the entire year.  We went out to tender, to procurement, and we have a supplier of that service.  The nature of the foundation programme is about the gap in what students have and what they need to progress.<\/p> <p>  We get different intakes, and the nature of that will change.

Above all, I thank them for their support in solidarity with Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  Since 2014 my country has fought against foreign military aggression.  It is not a civil war or a guerrilla war; it is nothing but aggression shown by Russia in the occupation of part of Ukraine, Crimea, and its invasion of certain parts of Ukraine in the Donetsk and Luhansk region.  Since the aggression began, more than 9,800 Ukrainian citizens have been killed, 23,000 have been wounded and 1.8 million have become internally displaced.  Over 7% of Ukrainian territory has been seized by Russia and millions of Ukrainian citizens live under occupation.<\/p> <p>  At the same time we have not witnessed political will in the Kremlin to implement even the basic provisions of the Minsk agreements.  Moreover, this year Russia has intentionally escalated the security, economic and humanitarian situation in Donbas.  Steps such as imposing a visa tax on Avdiivka and Krasnogorovka, recognition of so-called documents issued by the terrorist organisations, the circulation of Russian roubles as the only currency and the illegal expropriation of Ukrainian assets and property have led to the crippling of all four thematic tracks of the Minsk agreements.<\/p> <p>  The formula of a peace settlement is simple and clear.  Russia needs to stop shooting, withdraw weapons, set our captives free and let the OSCE monitoring mission carry out its mandate.  Did it do everything it could with this formula?  Did it withdraw weapons from our territory?  Sadly, I believe I know the answers to these questions.  Instead, the situation on the ground remains tense and volatile.<\/p> <p>  All previous agreements to provide for a comprehensive ceasefire were neglected by Russia.  For example, from 1 April to 15 June this year, 3,849 ceasefire violations against Ukraine were registered.  Ukraine's combat death toll is shocking.  Between 1 January and 15 January this year, 115 servicemen were killed in action and 853 wounded.  At the same time the civilian population remains highly vulnerable.  From 1 January to 15 June this year, the OSCE SMM confirmed that there had been double the number of civilian casualties compared with the number for the same period last year.  Since the beginning of the year, 47 civilians have been killed and 222 wounded.  Moreover, the militants continue to shell buildings and infrastructural facilities.  In April and May they shelled 47 and 39, respectively, which resulted in damage to buildings and facilities, but the sustained attacks would not be possible without logistical support.  The uncontrolled segment of the Ukraine-Russia border remains the source of escalation on the ground and inflows of weaponry and military personnel from Russia into Donbas persist.  Since 1 January, 125 illegal crossings of the said part of the border were registered.  Some 66 so-called humanitarian convoys were sent to my country.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, to hide the violation of the Minsk agreements, the terrorists significantly restrict the freedom of movement of the monitors.  The mission has already this year reported at least 20 incidents of intimidation of its monitors by militants.  The tragic death in April of a member of the OSCE SMM patrol and the injuring of two monitors in the non-government controlled area in the Luhansk region was a cynical attempt by the Russian terrorist forces to undermine the efforts of Ukraine and the OSCE to stabilise the situation along the contact line.<\/p> <p>  Another shocking incident happened in May when a member of an illegal organisation in the Donetsk region resorted to aggressive sexual harassment of a female member of the SMM patrol.  Just a few days ago, on 10 June, the OSCE SMM reported that militants armed with machine guns had fired in the direction of OSCE patrol cars, attempted to enter the cars, threatened the observers with weapons and smashed the glass of a car.<\/p> <p>  Two main principles, immediate release and the use of the all-for-all formula, are totally ignored by Russia and its proxies.  Currently, the militants detain 129 hostages.  Despite Russia's commitment to put additional pressure on the militants to let the humanitarian organisation, the International Committee of the Red Cross, into the region, the situation on the ground remains tense.  We have not seen even the slightest change.  For example, this year the International Committee of the Red Cross has conducted 35 visits to 25 places under the control of Ukraine and only one to a place in the uncontrolled territory of Donbas.  All of this tension, with ongoing Russian efforts to build up its military infrastructure along Ukraine's eastern state border and in the temporarily occupied Crimea, create a new risk of the full-scale resumption of hostilities and may serve as cover for preparation for a possible full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia.<\/p> <p>  In the past year we have consistently demonstrated that we are ready to move forward towards implementation of the Minsk agreements.  Even with the constant provocations by Russian terrorist forces, the armed forces of Ukraine follow the regime of silence and open fire only in response.  On the political track, Ukraine demonstrates commitment and constructiveness as much as possible, but a political settlement is only possible if Russia provides adequate security preconditions.<\/p><p>A political settlement will not make any sense as long as we have constant shelling, Russian troops and mercenaries on Ukrainian soil, Russian weapons in Ukraine and no control over our border.<\/p><p> Before coming to the next issue, I express my sincere gratitude to Ireland and all those countries which supported the resolution adopted last December on human rights in the autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.  Since the start of the occupation, the human rights situation on the peninsula has deteriorated sharply and we have witnessed murders, torture and illegal detention.  The Russian authorities use such methods to eliminate any public opposition to the illegal occupation of Crimea.  Particularly cynical was its decision to ban the Mejlis on the false accusations of engaging in extremist activities.  Such a decision potentially threatens approximately 3,000 members of Mejlis structures.  Approximately 4,000 Ukrainians and 20,000 Crimean Tatars were forced to leave the peninsula and Russia has more than 29 political prisoners in occupied Crimea.  Ukraine filed a lawsuit against Russia at the International Court of Justice which, as a result, on 19 April, recognised the validity of Ukraine's claims and ordered Russia to take measures to stop violations of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  With regard to the situation in Crimea, the court ordered Russia to refrain from maintaining or imposing restrictions on the ability of the Crimean Tatar community to maintain its representative institutions, including the Mejlis, and to ensure the availability of education in the Ukrainian language.  Ukraine will spare no effort in urging Russia to show full compliance with its obligations as an occupying power according to international law and to ensure safe and unfettered access for international human rights missions to the occupied peninsula to monitor and report on the situation in accordance with their mandate.<\/p><p> Another issue is the militarisation of Crimea.  After the illegal occupation, the militarisation of the peninsula has completely changed the security landscape.  Compared to the preoccupation period, Russia has almost doubled the personnel strength of its military in Crimea.  Particularly dangerous are Russian actions to prepare Crimea's military infrastructure for the deployment of nuclear weapons.  International partners and key global organisations, as well as regional organisations, should develop a co-ordinated approach to counter Russian military activity in Crimea.  Solidarity and consistency in the international policy of non-recognition of the illegal occupation of Crimea are very important.  Of particular importance are sanctions.  We welcome the recent decision of the Foreign Affairs Council to extend by 12 months its restrictive measures.  We expect economic sanctions against Russia to be extended without substantial changes in July this year since we have had no single ground so far to reduce them.<\/p><p> Ukraine has to oppose Russian aggression and at the same time reform itself.  We have strengthened democracy and the rule of law.  Law and justice are supreme in post-Maidan Ukrainian society.  The state is undergoing unprecedented reform in the area of justice and law enforcement.  A network of specialised institutions to combat corruption has been created and the unique e-declaration system of assets, income and property of public employees was introduced.  The scale of this measure is unprecedented, even in European practice.  We initiated a clean-up of the banking system and have made good progress in deregulation that significantly eases the registration of business.  As a result, we climbed 32 positions in the World Bank's ease of doing business rating.  We have taken hard but important decisions in the energy sector which have led to Ukraine's energy independence from the use of Russian gas supplies.  Not many countries in the world have experienced making so many positive changes in such a limited time span.<\/p><p> Starting this month, Ukrainian citizens can enter the European Union, Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland and Switzerland without a visa.  In that regard, we highly appreciate Irish support during the vote in the European Parliament.  We hope that at an early date Ireland will cancel the visa regime for Ukraine.  For our part, we have already done so.  We are grateful to Ireland, despite its own challenges, for standing firmly by Ukraine's side in its fight against foreign aggression.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017062200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Olena Shaloput","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498122000,"counter":1860,"content":"<p>I thank Mrs. Shaloput who has outlined in some detail the very difficult situation facing her country and what has been happening in recent years.

I thank her for the very clear presentation.  I agree entirely with what the Chairman and Deputy O'Brien have said.  We are very concerned about the situation in Ukraine and fully support on the committee the national sovereignty of Ms Shaloput's country and its territorial integrity.  Individually and as a committee, we have questioned the Russian ambassador here about his country's invasion, its illegal annexation of Crimea and its support for the separatists in the Donbass region.  We have been highly critical of Russian intervention and aggression in the region.  We are conscious of other countries like Georgia and their concerns about the spread of Russian dominance.<\/p> <p>  I have three specific questions about how we can assist Ukraine to make progress.  With the Minsk process stalled or frozen and persistent violations of the ceasefire, how can the EU and individual member states like Ireland support the peace process?  Ukraine is calling in particular for the strengthening of sanctions.  Can Ms Shaloput outline how the strengthening of sanctions might support developments in the peace process?<\/p> <p>  There is a great deal of concern about the safety of monitors in the region and the incident in April in which an American monitor was killed while two others were injured.

The Minsk agreements are the only option for the peaceful settlement on the table.  We are keen to unlock the political process but that is if Russia implements the security provisions of the Minsk agreements.  I am convinced that a political settlement is possible if adequate security pre-conditions are provided by Russia.<\/p> <p>  Speaking of how people from the Donetsk and Lugansk regions will integrate into our society, we have no problem with Russian-speaking people.  My mother is Russian and she speaks fluent Russian with no problems.  She does not feel any restrictions in Ukraine.  These are our people in the Donetsk and Lugansk region.  The only simple solution is for Russia to take its weapons, militants and regular and irregular forces from our territory.  We were living very peacefully before.  We have never had such problems with our people inside our country, including Tartars, Russians and Ukrainians.  That is the answer to how we can live together in peace.  We were already doing so.<\/p> <p>  As to how to help with the Minsk process, I am a diplomat and want to resolve all problems diplomatically.  The most important thing today is sanctions.  Russian people are tied to everything we have now, including our privations.  Simple Russian people want to live in a prosperous state and to have free movement around the world.  They are interested in this piece.  That is why sanctions are the most important thing today.<\/p> <p>  I was asked how we can save the monitors.  That also depends on Russia because there are no accidents with SMM monitors in the territory under the control of Ukraine.  All of these incidents, including the one two days ago, happened in uncontrolled territory.  We have no influence in this territory but Russia does.  Russia can influence its proxies.<\/p> <p>  As to the Irish experience, the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, visited Ukraine last year and shared his experience of how to resolve conflict.  It was very useful for us.  We appreciate Ireland's current support in the European institutions and at a bilateral level.  We need common solidarity.  Only together can we overcome the problem we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017062200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Olena Shaloput"},{"type":"speech","time":1498122000,"counter":1870,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing the beginning of Ms Shaloput's presentation.

One is about the effect of the sanctions on their country and the Crimea.  How hopeful is Mrs. Shaloput regarding the approaching EU summit in Kiev on 12-13 July?

Is it a force for change and positive change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017062200002#D00600","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498122000,"counter":1872,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.  I have a number of questions.  Mrs. Shaloput might not be able to answer some of them.  They are possibly outside the remit of her paper this morning.  Like others, I am concerned about the continued fighting in the region and the cessation or ceasefire that clearly does not seem to be happening.  It is clear from her figures that demilitarisation does not seem to be happening.  The big question that we all have relates to this log-jam.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about the upcoming summit.  Does Mrs. Shaloput have confidence in terms of some sort of structure or that people will become serious about this process and will try to come up with some sort of solution in relation to it?  She said that the Ukrainian Government is committed to the process, but is she optimistic about this summit?  Does she believe that something can break the log-jam?<\/p> <p>  According to a UN report in March, it was estimated that at least 9,940 people were killed and 23,455 wounded between mid-April 2014 and mid-March 2017.  In Mrs. Shaloput's opinion, what has caused the recent flare-ups and the violations of the ceasefires?  Is there something triggering it?  Is it part of this process of just slowly trying to wear people down?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the OSCE's special monitoring mission.  How many of them are operating in the region?  Am I right to say that their task is to observe and report in an impartial and objective manner the situation in Ukraine and to facilitate dialogue among all parties to the crisis?  Is that dialogue among all those groups and parties to the conflict happening?  How important is it that the special monitoring mission continues to operate in the region?  How important is it for the Ukrainian Government?  Mrs. Shaloput spoke about the restriction of movement of the monitors.  She might expand on what is happening.  She said that shots were fired and that there was sexual harassment and so on.  What other restrictions are there?  Are they limited to a particular area or can they travel around the region?<\/p> <p>  On landmines, could Mrs. Shaloput provide the committee with an update on the de-mining process?  As part of this demilitarisation that was supposed to be going on, how many mines have been removed from the witnesses' own side?  How many were removed from the other side?  Do we have any figures in relation to that?  I am conscious that the witnesses may have come in here without those figures, but it would be useful to get a sense of it.  We have seen how devastating mines can be to civilians long after wars.<\/p> <p>  Mrs. Shaloput gave an inventory of some of the weaponry that has been brought into the region.  What is the narrative from the Russian side in relation to these weapons that are in the hands of the rebels?  Are they buying them on the international market?  what are they saying?  How are these weapons supposed to be landing in these regions?<\/p> <p>  Another area concerns refugees.  I understand that the conflict has displaced between 2 million and 3 million people.  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, at least 1.6 million Ukrainians moved west towards the Ukranian capital, Kiev, as a result of the righting.  Russia says that 2.6 million Ukrainians moved east.  What is the Ukrainian Government doing to assist refugees?  Is Ukraine receiving support from the international community to provide these refugees with humanitarian support and so on?  Is there anything Ireland or, in particular, the EU can do on it?<\/p> <p>  I have a question that is outside the parameters of this meeting, but the Chairman will guide me.  I wish to ask about South Sudan.  I do not know if Mrs. Shaloput can comment on that.  There are disturbing reports about Ukraine's connection to the war in South Sudan.  Thousands have died in the war, 100,000 people are on the brink of starvation and 1 million are in danger of starvation, yet reports state that Ukraine has signed a $33 million contract to sell Mi-24 attack helicopters to forces loyal to Salva Kiir, the South Sudanese President.  The UN Security Council revealed that the contract was signed long after the war on South Sudan broke out in 2013.  Mrs. Shaloput might come back to me on it, but according to a leading UN investigator the helicopters are being used to target civilians.  They have been reportedly used against the International Committee of the Red Cross hospital.  Is Mrs. Shaloput aware of this?  Is Ukraine still committed to the arms embargo placed on South Sudan?  If it is, why is it clearly breaking it?<\/p> <p>  The other controversial area I wish to raise - I do not think anyone has touched on it - is the emergence of the far-right in Europe.  It has been raised many times in this committee.  I am particularly concerned with this within Ukraine.  Some armed militias in Ukraine have been known to use Nazi and neo-Nazi insignia and so on and to propagate far-right ideology.  There was concern about some of the people that were appointed to Government and so on.  One could say that they were elected and so on, but they were put in important security roles within the Ukrainian Government?  What is the Ukrainian Government doing to tackle these neo-Nazi militias?  Mrs. Shaloput might speak about why there seems to be such a growth in that regard.  Thankfully, in Ireland we have not seen that happening, but it has happened right across Europe.  It is clear that it is happening in Ukraine as well.  Mrs. Shaloput might give us her view on why this is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017062200002#E00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1498122000,"counter":1873,"content":"<p>If Mrs. Shaloput does not have information to hand regarding the South Sudan issue that Deputy Crowe raised, she might communicate with the committee at a later date on that particular issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017062200002#E00300","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498122000,"counter":1874,"content":"<p>I do not have information about Sudan.

In my view it is important the public is satisfied that there is sufficient oversight in regard to the spend on such matters.  The Chairman of this committee will understand, as a former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, that it is important for the Committee of Public Accounts to be able to scrutinise the spending of taxpayers' money, which is one of its core functions.  If the spend by this organisation on consultants and advisers was not subject to scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts, that would be a mistake.  We need to recognise that confidence in how public money is spent is at an all time low for genuine understandable reasons.  The possible misuse of taxpayers' money is an issue of public controversy.  Where we have the expertise inhouse in the Civil Service that is where most of the work should be done.  Some advisory work is necessary at times but it should be at a minimum and when consultants and advisers are used, the contracts should be subject to proper scrutiny, not just by a Minister but by Members of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>The intention of my amendment is simply to ensure that the spend by this new office on consultancy and advisers' fees is subject to scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062200002#B04300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1498126200,"counter":1946,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cullinane for his contribution.

It is not clear that the committee would be the best place to consider and review, in isolation from wider Government policy and practice, the remuneration rates established by the Minister for a particular body as proposed.<\/p><p>The biggest concern is precedent and where it would stop in respect of other bodies and whether the remuneration of the board members of every public board and body would be established by the sectoral committees within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The committee could very well be ground to a halt.  It is the reserve of the Minister on that basis.  It is also noted that section 17(8) states: &quot; In the performance of his or her duties under this section, the chief executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.&quot;  Accordingly, it would appear incongruous for the committee to review remuneration rates established as part of Government pay policy without having the benefit of the background, reasons, context and policy.

This arrangement will greatly assist in the processing of certain cases, such as parental leave.  In order to process statutory and contractual entitlements such as parental leave, pension payments, survivor's pension and so forth, the NSSO is required to view and verify certain documents such as birth, death or marriage certificates relating to its customers, which would be normal practice.  Currently, the processes within the NSSO mean the original, long versions of forms must be sent to the office for verification before these important entitlements can be granted.  Many process delays occur when the customer fails or is unable to submit such forms on time, meaning that vital payments are sometimes delayed.  The protection of sensitive data such as that contained on these forms is obviously of utmost concern and consideration to the NSSO.  The customer will always be kept aware of any process before anything is done with the documentation.  This is a workable element of the legislation and it is required in order for people to access their entitlements.

Currently, the definition of voluntary patient in the Mental Health Act 2001 states that a voluntary patient is not subject to an admission order.  In other words, a person is a voluntary patient if he or she is not an involuntary patient subject to detention.  This definition makes no reference to consent.  In order to be compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and in line with the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015, it is necessary to amend the definition of voluntary patient to include a specific reference to the need for a person to consent to admission.<\/p> <p>  However, this change cannot proceed on its own without any associated changes being introduced.  The suggested definition of voluntary patient would immediately result in some people being denied inpatient treatment.  Such persons would be those who lack capacity and, therefore, cannot provide consent.  While they would need inpatient treatment, they would not be sufficiently mentally ill as to warrant admission as an involuntary patient.  As they lack capacity and cannot consent to treatment, they could not be voluntary patients but, equally, as they do not suffer from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 3 of the 2001 Act, they also could not be detained.  Such patients are often referred to as the \"compliant incapacitated\".  Before any new definition of voluntary patient which explicitly refers to capacity, we need also to include lawful measures which ensure that at no stage would the compliant incapacitated be denied treatment.<\/p><p>In this regard, my Department is currently working on deprivation of liberty safeguards, intended to allow persons without capacity to be lawfully admitted to residential care and to psychiatric hospitals for treatment.  It is essential that the change to the definition of \"voluntary patient\" occurs simultaneously with the commencement of provisions relating to deprivation of liberty.  Work is under way on these safeguards and my Department is in discussion with the Department of Justice and Equality about including these provisions in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  I assure Members here today that this is a priority change for my Department.  The fact that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has not yet commenced allows us time to finalise the necessary changes as without such commencement, and the roll-out of the decision support service, the planned deprivation of liberty measures cannot begin.<\/p><p> Where this important change is concerned we agree that it is a necessary change, but we ask Members to press the pause button because we need to finalise the deprivation of liberty safeguards in tandem with this change, otherwise we will be legislating to deny certain people inpatient psychiatric treatment.  This, obviously, cannot be allowed to happen.  It is my intention to revisit this provision on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017062200002#B00500","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":2017,"content":"<p>It appears that the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, is not putting any proposal before the committee.

My Department does not object to this proposal, which mirrors very closely a recommendation of the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001.  Under the current section 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 the best interests of the person are identified as the principal consideration in any decision to be made concerning the care or treatment of a person.  This section has, over the years, led to an over paternalistic interpretation of the Act.  This is no longer seen as appropriate and is not in line with modern human rights standards.<\/p> <p>  The expert group review of the 2001 Act, which was published in 2015, recommended that the principal consideration of best interests should be removed from the Act and replaced by a list of guiding principles.  These are the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of mental health with the person's own understanding of his or her own mental health being given due respect; autonomy and self-determination; a presumption that the person is best placed to determine what promotes or compromises his or her own dignity; bodily integrity; and least restrictive care.  This list is effectively the same as the principles listed by Deputy Browne in his Bill and my Department can agree, subject to possible minor changes on Report Stage, to the proposed provision.<\/p> <p>  I would ask Members to allow us some further leeway to examine what other possible linked changes might be necessary to ensure that the provision as it stands does not have any unintended consequences.

There is agreement that this is the way to proceed where children are concerned.  The expert group review on the Mental Health Act 2001 also recognised that in the context of children there is a need to refer to \"best interests\" and it is noted that paragraph 1 of Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that in all actions concerning children that are undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be of primary consideration.<\/p> <p>  The guiding principles as laid out in this section of the Bill differ slightly from those recommended by the expert group review and I would appreciate the opportunity to examine more closely the wording recommended before we agree the final text.<\/p> <p>  I must stress once again that I have no difficulty with the principle behind the change, but the individual principles themselves may need to be tweaked to make sure we get them absolutely right.<\/p> <p>  While I accept the thrust of the provision it is my intention to once again revisit this on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2017062200002#C02300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1498118400,"counter":2039,"content":"<p>Once again, it is my understanding that the Minister of State is not making proposals this morning and is simply reserving his position to make amendments at a later stage.

I see today&rsquo;s meeting as a chance to hear at first hand the committee's views on how we can build on the significant progress being made to implement the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, as well as discussing the third quarterly progress report.  I would also like to take this opportunity to briefly outline what I see as my own priorities for action on housing over the coming months and how I envisage the undertaking of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland, as signalled by the Taoiseach last week.  I am joined today by a number of officials from my Department, as already welcomed by the Chairman.<\/p> <p>  The first quarter report focuses primarily on actions identified for delivery during the first three months of the year, detailing progress under 47 actions across the five pillars of the action plan.  In addition, an updated social housing construction status report has been published, setting out the position at the end of the first quarter of 2017.  Before I run through the highlighted actions in the first few months of this year, however, I will briefly set out some of my own priorities over the coming weeks and months. <\/p> <p>  As we approach the first 12-month milestone for Rebuilding Ireland next month, it is timely and appropriate that we take stock of how implementation is progressing, assess the impact of the new investments, policies and initiatives, and consider where we need to focus and redouble our efforts to address the remaining supply and affordability issues.  In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that some of these actions, for example, the infrastructure investment of &euro;226 million, will take some time to make an impact on the building of new homes.  What is most important is that the appropriate environment be created to ensure that the housing output that we need comes on stream.  As the Taoiseach outlined in the D&aacute;il last week, the Government's commitment and mandate to create and foster a republic of opportunity is also an opportunity to reflect on the substantial progress already made in delivering more homes to buy or rent, in opening up lands for housing development, in making better use of the empty homes we have, and in supporting those most in need of accommodation.<\/p> <p>  In acknowledging the progress that has been made, I in no way underestimate the challenges remaining.  Resolving these challenges remains a top priority for the Government and we must continue to push the boundaries of ambition in what we are doing, whether that is in accelerating and expanding our social housing targets, encouraging and facilitating landlords to offer more and more affordable homes for rent, or maximising the potential re-use of vacant homes in our cities and towns.  I am undertaking a prompt, overall review of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan, focusing on where we can strengthen the measures already in place and identify new initiatives that would add value.  I want to be clear that this is not a question of starting again from scratch.  The Government clearly signalled back in July 2016 that Rebuilding Ireland had to be a living and evolving plan and that it would be important to refine and review the overall objectives and measures in place as we progress along the implementation journey.  This is exactly what we are now doing.<\/p> <p>  All of the evidence and trends point to the fact that the number of new homes being planned, constructed and finished is increasing.  Our focus must, therefore, be on maintaining this momentum and on accelerating delivery of more homes to meet current and future demand.  I do not want to pre-empt what new or enhanced measures might come out of the review, but I would welcome the views of members here to inform the work that we will be doing over the coming weeks.  As members will have already received the latest quarterly update reports, I will give just a brief overview of some of the key areas of progress across the five pillars of the action plan during the first quarter of 2017.  <\/p> <p>  As the committee knows, a key priority of Rebuilding Ireland is to address and prevent homelessness.  A range of initiatives is contributing to the work in this area.  While the overall ramp-up in social housing delivery is playing an important part, progress is significantly underpinned by a number of specific initiatives, particularly the housing assistance payment targeted at homeless households.  I had an opportunity over the past few days to see some of the homeless services in Dublin at first hand, visiting a Dublin Simon Community medical detox and recovery unit, supported emergency accommodation in Carmen's Hall, and a new project delivering long-term accommodation for homeless individuals and families being provided by the Peter McVerry Trust.  This morning, I opened 28 new social housing units which Focus Ireland has built on Harold's Cross Road, targeted at homeless individuals with long-term needs, including older people and people with mental health issues.<\/p> <p>  Just over 3,000 sustainable exits from homelessness were achieved last year, an increase of 31% on 2015.  Over 200 additional emergency beds were provided.  Significant additional resources are in place under budget 2017, which will enable the achievement of a further increase this year of sustainable exits from homelessness.  In Dublin, the homeless HAP scheme saw more than 400 tenancies created in the first three months of the year, assisting both in preventing homelessness and in providing a pathway out of homelessness for individuals and families already in emergency accommodation.  <\/p> <p>  Rebuilding Ireland recognises that accommodating families in hotel arrangements is inappropriate for anything other than a short period of time.  The target set to limit the use of such accommodation to exceptional circumstances by mid-2017 is a challenging one.  This is particularly the case as the numbers presenting as homeless between March and May of this year was three times the normal rate of new presentations.  While it is a challenging objective, progress is being made.  At the end of April the number of families in hotels and B&amp;Bs in Dublin had reduced from 871 to 695.  This number will continue to reduce.  I expect that the data from the end of May will show a further reduction in this number as additional substantial progress continues to be made week by week.<\/p> <p>  As well as addressing the long-term housing needs of homeless families, housing authorities are also pursuing the delivery of additional and enhanced supported temporary accommodation that is more suitable for the short-term accommodation needs of such households than commercial hotel arrangements.  These custom-developed facilities will offer family living arrangements with a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Such arrangements will also facilitate more co-ordinated needs assessment and support planning, including on-site access to required services such as welfare, health, housing services, cooking and laundry facilities, and appropriate family supports.<\/p><p>Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more co-ordinated needs assessment and support planning, including on-site access to required services, such as welfare, health, housing services, cooking and laundry facilities and appropriate family supports.  I had the opportunity to visit one of these new family centres this week, the new Mater Dei facility.  It is nearing completion and will provide much improved short-term accommodation for 50 families.<\/p><p> The second pillar is focused on securing a significant increase and acceleration in the delivery of social housing.  Over 19,000 households had their needs met across the range of programmes in 2016, exceeding the target of a little over 17,000.  The construction programme of local authorities and approved housing bodies continued to be the focus of concerted action in the first quarter of this year.  The updated social housing construction programme status report, which has been published as a companion document to the overall first quarter progress report, shows strong progress in the first quarter of the year with some 1,600 new housing units added to the programme.  The overall programme at the end of the first quarter stood at over 10,000 houses in over 600 developments across the country.  Only yesterday, I saw some of the finished product that is now coming on-stream with the opening of a project providing 70 new social housing units by the Iveagh Trust in Ballyfermot in partnership with Dublin City Council.<\/p><p> The Housing Agency acquisition programme also got under way in earnest in the first quarter, utilising a &euro;70 million rolling fund to purchase vacant properties from institutional investors.  By the end of the quarter the agency had made successful bids on 330 housing units and had closed over 130 contracts.  In addition, the first quarter saw a significant milestone under the housing assistance payment scheme with the nationwide roll-out of the scheme being completed following its introduction on 1 March 2017 in the Dublin City, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority areas.  Eligible households in all 31 local authority areas can now avail of the scheme and &euro;153 million has been made available for its operation in 2017.  The scheme is on track to achieve its target of supporting 15,000 households during 2017.<\/p><p> Current and capital funding of &euro;1.3 billion is in place for housing in 2017 with the aim of meeting the housing needs of some 21,000 households.  The significant increase in momentum in programme implementation is evident in the pace of spend across the housing budget this year.  In the period to the end of the first week of June 2017, spending was running at &euro;0.5 billion, which is close to three times the spend in the corresponding period in 2016.<\/p><p> The third pillar addresses activity levels in the wider housing market.  There is strong evidence that the measures outlined in Rebuilding Ireland are beginning to have the desired impact on increasing and accelerating housing supply albeit from a historically low base.  Monthly housing activity reports prepared by the Department consistently show that planning permissions, commencement notices and residential connections to the ESB grid are rising steadily month-on-month.  The Ulster Bank purchasing managers index points to a strong increase in house-building activity.  The house builders elements of the index for May 2017 reached the highest point for over a year and registered the second fastest rate of expansion in residential construction during the 17 year history of the survey.  In March, approvals were announced for 34 projects across 15 local authorities under the local infrastructure housing activation fund, paving the way for investment of &euro;226 million in critical enabling infrastructure works between now and 2019.  In turn, this will facilitate the delivery of 23,000 new homes by 2021.<\/p><p> Another recent achievement involved the publication of the Rebuilding Ireland housing land map, a comprehensive online mapping database of publicly-owned lands in key areas that identifies potential additional land suitable for housing.  The database includes details of over 700 local authority and Housing Agency owned sites, totalling some 1,700 hectares, as well as 30 sites with a combined area of 200 hectares in key urban areas owned by State and semi-State bodies.  The map also shows the location of 144 active residential construction sites in the Dublin region, encompassing the construction of some 5,200 new dwellings.  The land map will inform the approach to strategic state land management in the new national planning framework and will provide an evidence basis for a more proactive approach to strategic land management.  The imperative now is to ensure that the State, in particular housing authorities, does everything in its power to deliver quality homes from these sites in the shortest possible timeframe.  The Housing Agency has prepared a strategic management and development plan for the 73 land aggregation scheme sites.  My Department will shortly be engaging with local authorities seeking similar plans for the delivery of housing from their sites.<\/p><p> The recent announcements from two local authorities, Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council, that they are bringing forward four key sites capable of delivering 3,000 social and affordable homes is an early indication of the potential opportunities presented by publicly-owned lands.  These sites are at Emmet Road, Infirmary Road and Oscar Traynor Road in Dublin city and at Kilcarbery in south Dublin.<\/p><p> The fourth pillar is focused on improving the rental sector.  During the first quarter, ministerial orders were made designating a further 14 local electoral areas in parts of counties Cork, Galway, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow as rent pressure zones.  These further designations mean that 57% of tenancies nationally, that is, some 186,000 rental households, now benefit from the rent predictability measures provided for in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  The recently published Residential Tenancies Board rent index for the first quarter of the year shows a significant moderation in the rate of rent increases with rents virtually flat during the quarter.  This is a welcome early sign of the impact of the Government rent stability measures, but we will be continuing to keep developments in the rental market under close scrutiny.<\/p><p> In February, major infrastructure works were launched at Cherrywood in Dublin as a first step in the delivery of over 1,300 new build-to-rent homes within an overall development of 8,000 homes within the strategic development zone site.  All in all, this initiative represents one of the biggest urban development projects seen in Ireland in recent times.  The aim is to start the construction of new homes this autumn.  Easier, cheaper and more efficient means of enforcing Residential Tenancies Board determination orders will become available after new District Court rules are finalised next month.  The new rules will allow such orders to be enforced through the District Court rather than at Circuit Court level.  In addition, following its establishment in the first quarter, the working group on the tax treatment of landlords is continuing its work.  Following the completion of a public consultation process the group will report to the tax strategy group and to ministers in the third quarter in the context of budgetary preparations.<\/p><p> Under the fifth pillar, the Housing Agency has completed its preparatory work on a vacant housing re-use strategy.  This is now being considered within the Department.  We are engaging with other Departments, as appropriate, with the aim of bringing proposals to Government for consideration in the coming weeks.  In the meantime, significant measures are in place to address vacant housing, including the roll-out of the repair and leasing scheme and the buy and renew scheme as well as the Housing Agency acquisition fund, which I have already mentioned.  Local authorities are using the detailed census data to identify and follow up on vacant properties in key areas.  They are actively engaging with property owners to support such properties being brought back into use, either for private or social housing purposes.<\/p><p> The report of the latest survey of unfinished housing developments was also published during the first quarter, confirming that a further 248 developments have now been fully resolved in the 12-month period since the previous survey.  The latest survey has identified vacant and near complete units that have potential for social housing purposes.  Local authorities will now be actively engaging with developers and receivers with a view to realising that potential.  In overall terms, since the first survey in 2010 the number of unfinished developments has fallen from 3,000 to 420.<\/p><p> That is a quick summary or overview of progress on some key areas under each of the pillars, with a particular focus on key developments during the first quarter of 2017, the period covered by the third progress report.  The three progress reports published to date and the additional comprehensive information we have published on the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland website as well as my Department's website show that relevant Departments, agencies, local authorities, approved housing bodies and other stakeholders have collectively made significant progress within the first nine months of what is a six-year housing and homelessness action plan.  We are fully aware that further significant and challenging work remains to be done in accordance with the objectives and timelines set out in Rebuilding Ireland.  Ongoing implementation, therefore, continues to be a top priority for the Government and will be evaluated in detail as part of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland that is now getting under way.<\/p><p> The next update on implementation will set out progress made in the second quarter of this year and will be finalised in late July or early August.  I am happy to respond to any questions that members may have.<\/p><p> I have been requested to address a topical issue at 5 p.m. on the issue of a hotel being used for homeless accommodation for families as well as some concerns around fire safety.  If the committee is willing, we might be able to suspend at that time to allow me to take that topical issue in the Chamber.  I am happy to take any questions now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#G00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2081,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I raised the issue previously of the monthly report and the numbers of people that the Department is reporting as homeless.  The figures that come from the Department go through the pathway accommodation and support system funded through the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  We know that currently approximately 390 families have stamp 4 visas and are in direct provision.  These people are on social housing waiting lists and full-time social welfare payments.  They are effectively using direct provision as a form of emergency accommodation.  The same applies to the figures from Tusla for domestic violence, refuge and step-down accommodation.  This is accommodation for homeless adults and children as well.  We do not have the 2016 figures but the figures for 2015 indicate almost 2,000 adults and almost 3,000 children are involved.  There has to be a way for the Department to lead a conversation with Tusla and the Department of Justice and Equality to provide, on a quarterly basis, accurate figures of the number of adults and children who are homeless and in emergency accommodation funded by all three Departments.  I urge the Minister to look at that as something that he could tackle quickly.<\/p> <p>  The major news item today is the announcement by the Minister that the deadline in Rebuilding Ireland to get families out of hotels by the end of this month has been missed.  I am not surprised by that.  It was patently clear for some time that the deadline was not going to be met because of the lack of supply of housing.<\/p><p>My question on this, however, is specific.  The commitment on page 17 of Rebuilding Ireland was not to move families from hotels into other forms of emergency accommodation even if that other emergency accommodation is of a better quality.  The key action on page 17 is explicit.  Families were to be moved out and into two other types of housing: rapid builds and the Housing Agency initiatives.  At what point did the Department change that target from being one to move those families out of hotels into permanent housing to being one to move some into permanent housing and others into emergency accommodation?  At the end of the month the Department will notify families about where they are going.  How many will remain in emergency accommodation after they are moved out of the hotels?<\/p><p> I am also concerned by some of the media reports on the hub.  This will be a Topical Issue debate on this with the Minister.  I have a specific question about it.  At what stage did that premises get its certification of completion?  My understanding is that a premises cannot be occupied legally until it gets its certificate of completion validated by Dublin City Council.  Did it have its fire certificates and its disability access certificates certified by Dublin City Council?  I am not looking for general assurances that it was fire safety compliant.  I want to know if it met the legal requirements of the B-CAR system before the families that recently spent the night there moved in, albeit it for one night.  I would also like to know who is the assigned certifier for that premises?<\/p><p> Will the Minister give us an update on Housing First and the number of tenancies that have been delivered to date?  I have three quick questions on the social housing end.  I do not want to get into a row about the figure of 10,000 in the pipeline because I know that we will not agree on it.  Of the 10,000 units that the Minister is saying are in the pipeline, I would like to know how many have commenced the Part 8 process.  For how many of those has the Part 8 proposal been published?  For me, the pipeline does not start until the Part 8 proposal is published.  <\/p><p> I am very concerned about what I am hearing from a number of local authorities inside and outside of Dublin county around the ongoing problem of the approval process.  We discussed this with Mr. John McCarthy and others before.  However, I am hearing that there is no improvement in the length of time between passing Part 8 and construction work starting.  It is incredibly frustrating to elected members who pass Part 8 proposals to council officials.  I would like us to return to that matter to see how long it is now actually taking from Part 8 approval to commencement and then to tenanting. <\/p><p> My last question concerns joint ventures.  The Minister mentioned four.  I am hearing worrying signals from at least one of the possible locations in Dublin city in terms of the market not coming back with viable alternatives.  I am also hearing worrying things in terms of whether there will be any affordable units delivered and, in particular, in terms of Dublin, if there will be any affordable units.  I would like more information on that.  If the affordability cannot be guaranteed, I am urging the new Minister, as I did with his predecessor, to consider allowing, at least in one instance, a local authority to pilot a fully funded, council-led, mixed tenure estate on public land.  Many of us have argued from the start that that would be a better and more cost-effective and sensible way from a housing management point of view of delivering those.  I urge the Minister to consider that and ask for his responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#H00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2084,"content":"<p>As a member of the committee, I wish the Minister well and congratulate him on his appointment.  It is in all our interests that Rebuilding Ireland would be a success, notwithstanding the gaps that we know that are in it in terms of supply initiatives.  We hope to use our influence in so far as we can to try to ensure that the Minister takes on board some of our initiatives and policy directives in that area.  Rather than going into that now though, as the Chair has said, we want to focus on the progress and the implementation of the existing plan under the various headings and pillars to ascertain what improvements can be made in order to make some progress.  Unfortunately, we have not seen the level of progress that had been intended.  That is quite obvious.<\/p> <p>  Based on the figures we have been examining, homelessness has increased since January 2016 to April of this year by in the region of 28%.  Based on the figures associated with that percentage increase, 11 people every day have presented themselves as homeless during the lifetime of this Government.  The Minister states that there have been 3,000 successful exits.  As previous speakers said, he states that within this plan it was envisaged exits from homelessness would be directed towards modular units and social agency homes.  Will the Minister confirm that we still have only 22 modular units completed?  We have been hearing about pipelines for close on two years now.  However, specific to this plan and the commitments made within it, will the Minister confirm that, as of now and the completion of the quarter about which we are questioning the Minister, only 22 units have been provided?<\/p> <p>  It is clear that the social housing units are not being delivered at the pace envisaged either or we would not have the increases that we have in homelessness.  As has been alluded to, the Government has made a conscious decision to provide family hubs.  As temporary forms of accommodation, I welcome them.  They are an improvement, one would say, on the hotel and emergency accommodation that was provided heretofore.  However, it is quite obvious that the Government will not meet the commitment made by the previous Minister.  Will the Minister say when the Government might realise that success?  In terms of what the Minister has said to us today, he states that \"[s]significant additional resources are in place under budget 2017, which will again enable the achievement of a further increase this year of sustainable exits from homelessness\".  Is that a further commitment to us that the Government will have achieved its targets then?  Has the Minister reassessed the targets considering the increase in homelessness?  Is it purely confined to the area of family hubs in terms of how people will exit homelessness?<\/p> <p>  The other point relates to what is to be discussed this evening.  It follows on our discussion yesterday with the Department in relation to the Airbnb situation.  As I said then, based on a decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la last year and circulars by the Department to local authorities, there is a responsibility on local authorities and planning authorities to enforce the planning laws and guidelines.  In those cases, one would have expected a trawl of units that were being offered although they did not have the relevant planning permission given the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  However, it is patently obvious that local authorities do not have the staff, resources or inspectors to ensure that that work is done.<\/p> <p>  When we hear today that emergency accommodation which was to provided for the homeless fails a fire inspector's test, I am sure that it sets off alarm bells.  Do we have the inspectors, manpower and resources to ensure that property being made available for those in these circumstances also meet the requirements?  I spoke to a representative of a local authority this morning about the responsibilities for the housing assistance payment and the rental accommodation scheme and was told that the local authority had not got around to inspecting all the properties that are currently let and are in receipt of funds.  Given what happened in the UK last week, this sets off alarm bells.  There must be an immediate effort on the part of the Government and those in responsibility to ensure that whatever funding, personnel and expertise are necessary is made available so that we can say categorically that the issue is being dealt with effectively, properly and to the letter of the law.  If there is any deviation from that, there is a culpability and those in authority with responsibilities must respond immediately to it.<\/p> <p>  If the Department truly believes that local authorities do not have adequate resources or staff to deal with those issues, we want to know about it.  We do not want to hear about it after some tragedy.  The tragedy of homelessness is bad enough and urgent enough.  It is a crisis and an emergency.  Unfortunately, that urgency did not manifest itself yesterday when I heard a Department official say that, as far as it is concerned about the Airbnb issue, which is only one aspect of many commercial realities contributing towards this crisis, local authorities have not had a reported incident that would agree with the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p>They have not been trawling their own records and files because they do not appear to have the wherewithal, manpower or expertise to do so.  God forbid that the same situation would arise with regard to the inspection of properties being offered to people to reside in.  I remind the committee that in many such cases, the State makes a contribution through the housing assistance payment and rental accommodation schemes.  That is the issue in a nutshell.  I ask the Minister to respond to it.  What progress is being made with modular units?<\/p><p> As I said to the last Minister, we should be told if there is a legislative issue with the provision and deliverability of modular units.  Members of the Opposition and others are willing to consider legislation to ensure speedier progress can be made with this issue so that homes of this type can be made available.  That is what we are interested in doing.  We sat late into the night a few years ago to deal with the banking crisis.  We are only too willing to assist in ensuring adequate legislative provision is made.  We are prepared to enable emergency legislation to be put in place for a period of time to ensure people can see there is real urgency and a real effort to deliver.<\/p><p> As I have said, this well-intended plan received the resources needed for the input and effort of stakeholders.  When it was initially proposed, we said it was all about its implementation.  Just nine months later, we are unable to realise some of the modest targets contained in it.  This issue is being overtaken by events and commercial realities.  The measures being taken in respect of the house construction and provision sectors, including the social responsibility measures, are driven by demand initiatives, with no emphasis on supply.  I have explained what I would like to see happen, which is a broader point.  I have asked a few specific questions about homelessness that I would like to see answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#J00200","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2086,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for graciously facilitating me.  I will have to leave shortly.  I was here at 2 p.m.  I understand someone was detained elsewhere.  I welcome the Minister, who holds one of the most important briefs in the Cabinet.  It is because there is so much riding on his success that we all want to work constructively with him.  As Deputy Cowen has said, we want to help to remove any roadblocks that are in the way.<\/p> <p>  I would like to talk to the Minister about the position with regard to rough sleeping in Cork.  Many of the examples he gave in his opening address referred to Dublin.  I assure him that there are serious and unattended homelessness issues outside the capital.  The number of rough sleepers in Cork has increased ninefold from 38 to 345.  While those numbers can be managed, they are greatly in excess of what we have known in previous years.  When I left Cork in 2011, there were enough beds in Cork city for every homeless person who wanted one.  We were worried about long-term homelessness and getting people out of emergency accommodation, but now there is an actual problem with rough sleeping.<\/p> <p>  When I attended the AGM of Cork Simon on Monday, I heard that housing is the key.  I learned that those involved are tearing their hair out because they cannot get access to housing.  They are running into all sorts of difficulties.  They are anxious for housing to be developed in the city in the first instance.  They are waiting for the go-ahead to do that.  They have argued that a rolling programme of funding under the capital assistance scheme would be of assistance.  Every time they receive a new call, they have to go back to the drawing board.  They sometimes find that the houses or sites they have identified have gone because the market is so competitive.<\/p> <p>  This year's target for the rapid-build programme, which enables people to move out of emergency accommodation, was 1,000, but I understand it now looks like the final outturn will be just 200.  What are the hold-ups in this regard?  Should we be refocusing on permanent housing, rather than moving people from pillar to post from hotels to hubs and into rapid-builds?  Children need to have permanency.  If they do not know where they are and what schools they are going to, we will store up huge mental health problems for the future.<\/p> <p>  What about the funding for mental health and homelessness?  The Minister said that when he visited Dublin Simon, he saw its excellent detox and addition services.  It is running a counselling service on fund-raised moneys.  The provision of &euro;140,000 a year would cover these costs, but instead Dublin Simon has to raise funds.  It supports approximately 450 people every year.  A modest investment in its ability to provide these services would make a big difference.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 2,500 children are living in emergency accommodation.  I am concerned about them in the here and now and also about their futures.  We are impairing their futures by not acting.<\/p> <p>  While Rebuilding Ireland is well and good, I suggest we need to step back and look with fresh eyes at a fundamental new approach to housing in Ireland.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I share the view that there is a need to look at constitutional rights in this area.  I intend to convene a seminar on this issue on 13 July next.  All members of this committee will be invited.  I hope they will be able to attend.<\/p> <p>  I heard the Minister on the news last night.  I saw him with my colleague, Gene Clayton, in Ballyfermot.  It is great to see that this scheme, which has been in development for a long time, is happening.  I congratulate those involved.<\/p> <p>  I understand the Minister is looking for fresh ideas.  I would like him to turn his attention to Singapore, which solved its real housing problem by establishing a housing development agency to build houses on very tight pieces of land.  Approximately 80% of people in Singapore live in houses that were built by that country's Government and sold on 99-year leases.  The remaining 20% of people are renting.  It is an innovative place to look at.  We always look at the Nordic countries.  The Singapore approach to housing provides us with an interesting example.  I will leave some details of that with the Minister to be considered in addition to what we are looking at now with Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We are falling behind on key targets.  I do not think we are winning the war.  I suggest we should consider the right to housing and look at the Singapore example.  I am really sorry that I have taken up the time of proper members of this committee.  I wanted to catch the Minister before I left.  I hope I can stay for another five minutes to hear his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#K00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2087,"content":"<p>As the Senator is deputising for Senator Grace O'Sullivan, she is a proper member of this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#K00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2088,"content":"<p>I am never quite sure.

It is no surprise to me or to many others that the July target for solving the emergency accommodation issue will not be met.  The Minister apparently announced &euro;10 million today to move 200 families from hotels and B&amp;Bs into hubs.  It seems to me, unless I am interpreting the figures incorrectly, that he is talking about spending &euro;50,000 per family.  This equates to approximately one third of the cost of building a house.  I ask the Minister to reflect on that for a minute.  There are 650 families in emergency accommodation or hotels.  Rather than allocating &euro;32.5 million to put them into hubs, why not provide &euro;100 million to build houses for all of them?  This follows on from the point about Housing First that was made by a previous speaker.<\/p> <p>  As someone who deals with many homeless families, I think it is better to be in a hub than in a hotel.  We all agree that it is certainly a step up.  Families in hubs can cook, enjoy certain facilities and have a bit more security.  We all know that there are curfews.  It is like a Magdalen laundry-type situation in so far as it involves putting people in collective units.  The Minister can shake his head, but I remind him that one of these facilities is an old Magdalen laundry.  The point is that it is better than a hotel, but it is not very good in the long term.  People cannot bring family members back.  People cannot socialise or have a glass of wife.  Their way of life is restricted.<\/p> <p>  Rather than pursuing the hub strategy, why does the Government not try to acquire vacant housing?  We all know that there is loads of it in Dublin and all the other areas.  We are always told this is never possible until it actually becomes possible.  After the Grenfell fire in London, the Tories in Britain suddenly found the money to rehouse families that had lost everything in housing that was lying vacant.<\/p><p>How come they could do that?  They could do it because of the political pressure on them to do it and because Jeremy Corbyn has been raising it for a week and there have been protests.  We could do the same here but there is no political will to do so.<\/p><p> On social housing, the Minister stated that he went over the target.  The targets are a joke.  They are obviously too low, otherwise homelessness would not be increasing.  Of the 19,000 households that had their needs met across the range of programmes, only 652 were newly built social housing units.  That is an incredibly low figure considering there has been an emergency brewing for years.<\/p><p> Dr. Rory Hearne from TASC has made the point, which I am sure the Minister has heard, that in the Dublin City Council area it would take 40 years at the rate things are going to house everybody on the social housing list.  It is actually worse in that it is estimated that there are approximately 211,600, or 10%, of households in so-called unaffordable and insecure housing.  It is actually double the social housing list.  One would be waiting 80 years to sort their problems out.<\/p><p> I will be frank.  This is an ideological issue.  The Minister must know this is not working for those affected, although it is working for some.  It is working really well for the developers, for the elite who are building luxury houses, for example, all over Dublin 15 but mainly in the plush parts of Castleknock where one cannot afford to buy them and where the crisis is not as acute.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach stated he intends to invest more in social housing.  How much more?  Does the Minister know?  How many decades will it take to house all those on the social housing list and in that severe unaffordable and insecure sector I mentioned?  That would include a range of different people who have already been mentioned, such as those in direct provision and those in refuges for domestic violence.<\/p><p> On social house building, I doubt it will be dealt with today but maybe the committee could consider undertaking a session on it.  The pattern of social house building that has been favoured in recent years is getting private developers to build social housing but the problem with that is twofold.  It adds to the cost of a house because the developer has to get a cut, which can be anything from 10% to 20%.  In the old days when local authorities were given funding, they could build them directly and it was much cheaper.  The other aspect is work conditions.  The Minister comes with an interest, and from a background, in finance, and maybe this is a session we could have to go into it in detail and invite in building workers.  However, I have good information that there are building workers on the Dolphin regeneration project, for example, for a number of weeks who have been told that they are PAYE workers but who have not yet seen a payslip, have not had any interaction from Revenue and are getting paid in cash or by cheque.  We all know building workers have been forced to be entrepreneurs and self-employed.  It is a bogus way to operate and the State is losing out massive amounts of revenue which does not seem to be of any interest to it.  If this is going on in social house building projects right now, it is real cause for concern.  Will the Minister look into it?  There have been many instances of it.<\/p><p> What is happening is sub-contractors are being brought in from the North.  I have no problem with where a sub-contractor is from but that generally creates a lot of difficulties - Rapid and Malmac being two of them.  I heard a joke from a Dublin worker that, ironically, the harder the Brexit, the better for them.  The reason the worker said so is because building workers are coming down from the North and driving back up every day.  When that happens, it is not good for work conditions and for pay.  It is bad that this is going on in projects getting State investment.  We had a campaign about welfare fraud but this is fraud as well, if people are not-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#K00600","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2092,"content":"<p>I am not trying to curtail Deputy Coppinger but, because she does not have any proof of that, it is unfair to go down that line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#L00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2093,"content":"<p>It is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#L00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2094,"content":"<p>Whether it is true or false, we do not have anybody here to defend or verify that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#L00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2095,"content":"<p>Okay.

There is no way we can resolve the scale of the housing crisis through relying primarily on the private sector through HAPS, RAS and all these schemes.  It seems it is difficult to get a movement in society around this issue, like we got on the water charges or on other issues because people are in such dire straits.  That is the only way I can see pressure being brought to get change from Fine Gael.  Fianna F&aacute;il is not fundamentally different - maybe there is a nuance of a difference.

I have taken a note of each one and I will come back to each.  Please bear with me.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised the issue of the numbers of reported homeless, what we count and how we count it, and it is a valid question.  We in the Department are responsible for our own numbers and we publish them.  We are good in getting the information we get out there.  It is appropriate that we do so.  I understand the point the Deputy is making, and I have spoken about that with officials and I will look at it.  We cannot be responsible for how others report their numbers but if there is scope for us to co-ordinate with other parts of Government to see how we can get a total figure on this, we will try to do that.  Whether or not the Deputy was counting those who are in direct provision is another question but I am coming into this brief with an open mind, which is important.  My predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has done an excellent piece of work in Rebuilding Ireland and given all the work everyone on this committee, led by the Chairman, has done as well, now is the time to see whether there are new initiatives we can bring forward.  We are 12 months in and whether a new person is coming into the brief or not, it is good practice to review what one is doing every 12 months, at least when it comes to policy initiatives but also given the importance of this brief.  I am keeping an open mind.<\/p> <p>  The target for homeless families was an ambitious one.  However, having an ambitious target was good because what it has driven a huge amount of work to get homeless families our of hotels across the country, in particular, in the four local authorities in Dublin where it matters more than most because 85% of homeless families have presented in Dublin.  If one looks at the total figure from when this plan was launched last year to the end of May, approximately 1,200 who presented as homeless were either moved out of hotels or prevented from going into hotels because other supports were found for them.  Of course, that speaks to the scale of the crisis but a huge amount of work was done by the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Earlier today, I announced that we would allocate an additional &euro;10 million to the existing &euro;25 million for the building of these family help supports so that rather than have 600 families accommodated, we will have 800 families accommodated - an additional 200 families.  At the end of May, although we are still waiting for the final figure, there were roughly 650 families in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  I have made the commitment not only with that funding but also in working with the local authorities that by the end of this month, those 65 families will have either have been moved out of their commercial accommodation or will know where they are going because they have been given a letter telling them where they are going.  That will happen in a number of weeks.  Of course, some families will remain due to exceptional circumstances.  Unique individual needs will need tailored solutions.<\/p><p>However, we have seen an increase in families presenting as homeless, in particular in the last number of months, which is why I have made that new funding available for the new hubs.  That will accommodate 200 families.  One site has already been chosen and we will get those other sites up and running as quickly as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#L00700","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2099,"content":"<p>How many families will remain in some form of emergency accommodation by the end of July, for example?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#M00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2100,"content":"<p>We do not yet know the total number who will present-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#M00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2101,"content":"<p>Of the 600 or so currently in the hotels, how many will get permanent homes and how many will remain in other forms of emergency accommodation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#M00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2102,"content":"<p>Of the approximately 650 families there at the end of May, a large number will move out of commercial accommodation in hotels into hubs or other supports while others who will not have been moved by the of the month will have been notified by letter where they are going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#M00500","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2103,"content":"<p>The Minister thinks all those families are going to stay in emergency accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#M00600","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2104,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#M00700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2105,"content":"<p>Of the 650-odd families currently in hotels, how many will be moved to permanent tenancies and how many will be in another form of emergency accommodation, hub or otherwise, by the end of the summer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#M00800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2106,"content":"<p>This is the purpose of the meeting I am having with the local authorities in the morning.

They are incredibly impressive.  They will have playrooms, cooking facilities and wraparound services for children including homework clubs and supports to help families move out and on to permanent forms of accommodation, which is what we want.  It is well worth it.  When the Deputy talks about the spend, we have to solve this now.  I understand that she says if we spent three times as much, we could put these people into actual homes.  However, we cannot build homes overnight.  However, we can build hubs in less than 18 weeks.  If our priority is to get them out of hotels, we will work on that.  What we are getting for what we are spending is good value.  Families will come in and families will move out and we will have these units for a number of years.

This is being operated by Dublin City Council in conjunction with the fire authorities.  When the building works and the project is completed, this hotel is going to become a hub for families.  It is being operated in full compliance and no one is there as a tenant at the moment.  There is, therefore, an opportunity to do the work that needs to be done to make it a first-class hub.  That is what is happening.  If it is all right with the committee, I will address that in a little more detail when I speak on the Topical Issue.  It is important to note that this particular location was used as an absolute last resort when it was used.  Ten rooms in the building were made available on one floor and 24-7 surveillance was put in place by the fire authorities to ensure that it was safe and that everything else was up to standard.  However, we do not want to see Lynams - sorry I do not want to name the hotel - continuing to be used as emergency accommodation in its hotel form.  We want to transform it into a hub and that work is under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#M01700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2115,"content":"<p>This is quite an important point.

There are just under 100 under the Housing First policy but more will be coming online in August.  I have had a great deal to do already, but I have had a chance to look at this policy and to see exactly what it means by meeting with the McVerry Trust.  It is a very exciting way to look at things.  I know they have been doing even more innovative things in Canada and I am looking forward to looking at that to see what more we can do.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin also raised the issue of the 10,000 houses in the pipeline.  This is an issue he has raised before in terms of what and how we are counting.  We can come back to how we discuss numbers in more detail if this is a target we want to meet.  If a particular site will not be met by local authorities, then they will have to find a new site.  In the Deputy's own local authority area, 40% of what is designated is already on-site, which is a welcome development.<\/p> <p>  On getting Part 8 and moving to construction, Deputy Cowen talked about supply.  One of the things I have been speaking about since I took the brief is the need for direct measures to improve supply.  Of course, that means ensuring that once we get planning permission, we get on site and get building quickly.  We are going to move to put timelines around the four-stage process we have so people can be clear on the timelines at each stage.  Where there were previous bottlenecks, for example, with the rapid builds, the previous Minister, Deputy Coveney, to be fair to the very good work he has done, put in place a special framework for procurement so that we could move more quickly.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin also raised the matter of affordable rent and the idea of the council piloting a mixed tenure estate.  This is something I am going to look at.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has done some work on this.  Affordable rental has to be a big part of the new measures we bring online very quickly because it is a key part in this chain or pyramid, depending on how one likes to analyse the problems we have, in ensuring homes are affordable for people to rent.  When we have the supply at affordable rents, we will look at measures to get people greater security of tenure.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cowen said the homelessness figure had increased since January with 11 new people presenting each day.  Obviously, that is very worrying and difficult for those who present.  Social housing output got ahead of target last year from 17,000 to 19,000, as I noted in my opening statement.  Good work is being done but this continues to be a challenge.  No one is saying this has been solved or that we have finished what we needed to do.  We need to continue to do as much work as we have been doing which is why it is good to see the progress that has been made under Housing First.  I had the chance to look at St. Agatha's Court, which is where some Housing First people will get new homes.  That is very welcome.  We also have the new HAP homeless scheme, the flexibility and achievements around which members will be familiar with.  That has also been very welcome.  I was asked how many modular units and rapid builds had been completed.  There will be 68 completed in July with an additional 30 by August, however 500 are advancing.  The delay there was procurement but that has been solved.  We have that new framework, which is very welcome.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cowen also raised the issue of getting families out of hotels.  It is not a question of saying the problem will be solved when the families have moved from hotels to hubs.  That is not the solution.  The hubs are a first response and not the end of what we want to do.  What we want to do is find sustainable, secure tenancies for these families.<\/p><p>That is incredibly important.  I mentioned this earlier today when I was with Focus Ireland and spoke about some of the issues that I was made aware of by people who were working in early years education.  A number of years ago, some of the problems that people were having were around social and language skills with children aged from birth to three years because of problems we had coming out of the recession and the problems in terms of resources and unemployment in families.  Some of the problems that are being presented today are in relation to motor skills because of the lack of crawling space for children who are in crowded accommodation or are in hotels and everything else.  That is why the hubs are so important but they are only the first response, not the final response in dealing with homeless families.  <\/p><p> The issue of Airbnb was raised and I know that officials were here talking about it yesterday.  By the third quarter, we will have the report that was intended to be ready by now.  The shared economy is fantastic in a nation wherever it arises, be it in relation to issues around motor vehicles, GoCar, car sharing, how we deliver food but also how we live and how some people manage to get a little bit of extra cash each week or month to meet their own accommodation bills.  The shared economy, however, also presents new problems when it comes to things such as Airbnb and that is why we will need to reach a memorandum of understanding between the Government and Airbnb around some of these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#M01900","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2118,"content":"<p>The Minister has answered questions on hotels and I want to clarify a point.

It has been confirmed to me that they have confidence in their ability to respond.

We need to find solutions for people who want to downsize.  The lady to whom I was fortunate enough to give the keys to her new home was downsizing from a house and 16 new tenants in those homes had come from larger family homes in the area.  We did not just unlock 70 new homes; we actually unlocked 86.  The Iveagh Trust, together with the council, the authority and the Department, were able to do that.  I have been given the documentation on Singapore.  I will look at it to see what they are doing with their housing development agency.

A lot of resources have been put in to tackle this challenge and additional resources were made available today by me.  The social housing output is ahead of target which is a good thing.

I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, earlier about this.  I made that exact point to him and he made the exact same point back to me.  I have also said it to the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  When he appointed me, he said no idea is too radical.  He told me to think of everything and not to dismiss anything because it does not sound like something Fine Gael might support.  That is the approach I am taking.  I see this as an emergency and a crisis.  I have also signalled to the Attorney General that I want to sit down with him.  I mentioned this earlier today.  If we need to find new laws and new powers, we have to move quickly to do it.  It is very important to me.<\/p> <p>  It is true that only 652 social housing units were built last year.  It is true but we were starting from scratch in terms of what had been done previously.  The target for this year is 2,400 and 2,000 are already on site in terms of construction, which is positive.  A lot of good work has been done by the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.  Deputy Coppinger said there were 211,000 households in insecure housing.  I am not sure what service she was referring to.  People are probably asking when we will get the housing market fixed but it is not just a market issue.  We have had a dysfunctional market here in many ways since the mid-1990s.  We have to find a way to fix the market but we also have to make a much bigger intervention in terms of what has been done to date by the local authorities and Government.  The Deputy asked what the Taoiseach meant when he talked about investing more money in social housing.  What the Taoiseach said was that if new money needed to be found, we will have to find it.  Meetings have already been held by the Minister of Finance in the Department of Finance and my own Department on EUROSTAT and what can be done to fund projects off-balance sheet and through public private partnerships.  That is important.  Meetings have also been held by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, with the European Investment Bank on new avenues for funding.  We need to make sure that in finding solutions, money will not be the problem.  That is what we need to make sure of.  We will do everything we can to do that in investments that need to be made.  <\/p> <p>  I will not comment on the site the Deputy mentioned because I do not have any evidence in front of me.  Deputy Boyd Barrett has reported sites previously when he was worried about suspicious work practices.  It can be reported on and inspected.  The construction cost review was touched on by Deputy Coppinger.  This work is being done at the moment.  Two reviews are being done.  One is an international benchmarking exercise which is important to see if we are outliers in any way when it comes to construction costs.  The other review being done, which my Department is involved in, is on the cradle-to-grave construction costs.  We will have the results of that review at the end of August.  What does it actually cost at each point in the chain and what can be done to try to reduce some of those costs?  That work will be completed at the end of August.  I think I have answered all of the questions raised in the first round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#O00500","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2138,"content":"<p>I compliment the Minister on his new position.  I know he will do lots of work for us because we are counting on him.<\/p> <p>  I had massive concerns when I read in the paper this morning that homelessness targets in Rebuilding Ireland are not being met.  As previous speakers said, I am not surprised.  Many of the issues previous speakers mentioned have been raised over the past number of months.  Sometimes I feel they are not being listened to.  We all know Dublin has a crisis.  It is great we are working with Dublin and trying to sort it.  Rural Ireland also has a crisis, although perhaps not to the same degree.  We have massive issues.  Rural areas are forgotten.  I say this all the time.  If one reads the reports that came in yesterday and the Minister's response, one will see the statistics are on Dublin.  I have no issues with that, but I have concerns that no other counties in Ireland are being mentioned apart from Dublin.  It is unfair.  Nothing can be accurate until there is some sort of information on other parts of the country.  We are getting figures but I do not think they add up.<\/p> <p>  Another concern, which I have brought up on several occasions, is to do with women's refuges.  I am told they are the responsibility of a different Department.  Nobody is taking responsibility.  I have massive issues with this.  Every county in Ireland should have a women's refuge because women and children are at risk of homelessness.  There is none in Carlow and Kilkenny and Waterford are full.  It is the Minister's duty to have a refuge in every county where there is a population as big as Carlow county, which is over 50,000.  We have no women's refuge.  We cannot get people to Kilkenny or Waterford.  In 2017, there is no need for this.  Every time I bring it up with different Departments I am told it is the responsibility of another Department.  It is a housing need so perhaps the Minister can look at it.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the hub, I am not sure what impact it will have on Dublin.  In rural areas such as Carlow, I do not know if the hub will be a solution.  We have buildings that could be bought cheaply.  I have said it here on several occasions.  We now have a market in which housing and buildings are quite reasonably priced and could be bought more cheaply than renting them.  My other issue is renting.  We have spoken about the HAP scheme here before.  I have massive concerns about it.  It changed from the rent allowance scheme to the HAP scheme but landlords do not want to accept HAP.  It is a massive concern particularly in rural areas.  There needs to be legislation or something from the Department to say that if one is on the local authority housing list and qualifies for HAP, they should be put on the HAP scheme if they go looking for a rented house and have a good record.  It is not happening and that is why the homelessness crisis is getting worse.  The scheme has changed from the rent allowance scheme.  It is quite good because under the scheme people are allowed to work a certain number of hours.  All of that is taken into consideration, which I appreciate because it gives people an incentive if they want to work.<\/p><p> However, getting people to take the HAP is the biggest issue.  They are then coming in to the local authorities and presenting as homeless.  It must then be asked what is the criteria for homelessness.  As far as I can see, every local authority is saying that this is homelessness and that is not homelessness.  What is homelessness?  What are the criteria?  Every local authority needs to have in writing the criteria for homelessness.  That is crucial.  I have so many issues with this and I cannot understand how the Department is not doing something about it.  If the Deputy compares Carlow to Portlaoise or Kilkenny in our neighbouring counties, the limit is &euro;27,500 to qualify to get on the local authority housing list in Carlow but in a lot of other places it is &euro;30,000 and over.  If one is &euro;20 or &euro;30 over that limit, one cannot get on that local authority housing list.  One then goes for a mortgage but does not qualify for it.  One actually does not fit in anywhere.  Where are those people then?  They become homeless.<\/p><p> It is the common sense approach that is not being followed.  It is as though the Department is making all these rules and regulations but they are not adding up because people are not qualifying for them.  There is no common sense and no one saying that this is what is happening or that this case or that case needs to be looked at.  I know the last time I brought it up with the different Departments, they said to go back to the local authorities.  Who is over the local authorities?  Who is actually able to sit down with local authorities?  It is like what Deputy Cowen said - I had better give him his proper title - about staffing.  Who is responsible for it?  Is there staffing there?  After dealing with people that come into my clinics, I have come in here for the last few months to meet the Minister and the heads of the Department and bring up issues, but I feel that I am going back down to the clinic to say that I am highlighting them but not getting an answer.  It is the same with the local authorities.  In our own local authority, we have many boarded up houses.  Why is there not money to buy them?  One could buy a house more cheaply than to give the rent allowance of &euro;800 or &euro;900 every month to a HAP tenant.  The local authority could actually buy it cheaper in the long term.  Then there are people who come into my clinic to say to me that there are three houses boarded up in an estate and to ask why they are not being developed.  There needs to be a programme put in place.<\/p><p> Carlow is not as dear as the Dublin area and I can understand that the Minister has to look at the hub to try to get people off the housing list there and into emergency accommodation.  However, in rural Ireland, the houses are that bit cheaper.  They could be bought cheaper than the HAP.  I cannot understand why the Department is not doing that.  I have said before that I have major issues with the dezoned lands that the local authorities own.  Years ago when I was on a local authority, the Department gave the initiative that all the land inside the county was to be dezoned.  Now local authorities need to look at building on local authority land that is dezoned.<\/p><p> A few months ago, the Department contacted all local authorities requesting what the build was going forward for each local authority.  Two years ago, we were promised 26 houses near my own home place.  I am still waiting on them.  There were six houses that were meant to be built for people with disabilities.  The plans and all had gone through.  They were in the council offices for the last year but there is not even a word of them being built.  We have co-op housing that has provided some houses near to where I live.  There are four houses sitting idle for the last few months.  I met the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, twice and asked him if he would please allocate the four houses that are ready.  I am still waiting.  I cannot understand it.  I am going to the Department myself now.  For a long time I was going back to the local authorities and they would come back to me.  I am now going to the Department myself.  I find that I am getting the same answers.  Could common sense not prevail, particularly in rural Ireland where we have boarded-up houses that we would buy and build cheaper than the cost of paying out the HAP scheme?  The HAP scheme is fine in the short term but it is a very expensive scheme for the country on a long-term scale.  If the local authorities invested, it would be cheaper in the long run.<\/p><p> There are issues there that we need to work on.  I brought up something else yesterday when we talked about homelessness in the short term.  There are families that might have a room or might be able to help their family on a short-term basis and there could be an initiative given to them.  At the moment, a local authority tenant paying rent of &euro;90 and trying to help the family that is homeless the rent can be increased to &euro;150 per week, with no other help coming in.  Such tenants are just getting by.  Could there be some small incentive for families that maybe have a room in their house in order to help their family on a short-term basis so that they are not in a bed and breakfast or hotel, because that is not good for the family or the children?  There needs to be an incentive for families to help themselves if they can.  That needs to be looked at.<\/p><p> I repeat what the previous speaker said.  Common sense needs to prevail here.  It is not happening.  All of the money that we are told we have is not coming through to local authorities.  That is a fact.  If the Department was going down to local authorities, we would not be waiting that length of time to get houses built or waiting on reports on houses that need to be done.  It seems to be happening in all local authorities.  Somebody needs to take action on this and there needs to be accountability.  Unless we start stepping up to the mark, the homelessness crisis will only get worse.  It will not get any better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#O00600","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2140,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Ellis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#P00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2141,"content":"<p>Has the Chairman got my name down?

There has been a huge amount of work done over the last year or two in terms of putting plans together by everyone, including this committee, the local authorities, the different Departments and all of the different homelessness and housing agencies.  This plan that set up the different pillars, 1 to 5, is by and large a good plan in terms of focusing efforts.  However, one of the big problems is that when things are not working one has to ask what the cause of them is.  It is clear that there are many areas in which things are not working.  The main issue is the delivery of social housing.  Why are we not delivering enough social housing, never mind affordable housing, which the Government has not even considered.  It has constantly talked about affordable leasing but it has never talked about affordable housing.  Affordability is one of the areas the Government really needs to look at.  To give an example, the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance in Ballymun is delivering five houses from between &euro;140,000 and &euro;150,000 in the next week or two.  It says that it is capable of delivering a lot more.  It is looking for more contracts to fulfil.  Therefore, it has an agreement with the construction company it is working with and it is prepared to do more.  There is a model we can work with and have a look at.<\/p> <p>  There are areas in which we are failing to deliver.  I will outline some of them and I hope the Minister will take some of them on board.  The first area in which we are getting hammered is due to the ideology the market is set to.  We rely on the markets and we are told we are to leave it to them and not interfere with them.  We rely on the private markets.<\/p><p>We also do not want to upset the construction industry because the prices are as they are on the market.  We now have houses that are priced at least &euro;300,000 and upwards in areas where there is no way such prices are sustainable.  We must get to grips with the situation because it is absolutely unsustainable, totally over the top and totally driven by greed and the same applies to the rental market.  Who in their right might can handle paying high rents?  Realistically, we can talk about the HAP scheme and rental supplements but these rents are way beyond control and something must be done.  My own thinking on this, and we have suggested it many times, is that we should have a State-run company that is run by local authorities to build and direct the building of social and affordable housing.  It would be one way to stop the markets from running away and prevent people making massive profits.  I know that a State-run company goes against many people's ideology but I ask the new Minister to seriously consider the idea.  <\/p><p> I will give another example of where we have allowed things to get out of hand.  NAMA and the banks are selling off large portfolios and individual places left, right and centre.  Such a situation should never have been allowed happen.  We could have brought in legislation to control that practice instead of allowing them the option.  Originally NAMA was given a certain role but it one that could have easily been changed.<\/p><p> We have not delivered on the public private partnerships, PPPs.  We have ran into all sorts of problems to deliver PPPs and we will face even more problems.  Another area is the financial contribution.  In my own area alone people have been asked to give up larger accommodation for senior citizens because we need greater housing concentration.  If we take what has happened in my area then how many units can the initiative deliver across the city?  A huge number.  <\/p><p> We also have not delivered on the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  We have talked about the initiative many times.  In terms of the amount of mortgage-to-rents and properties that have kept people in their homes, it does not make sense that we have not delivered the scheme.  I have suggested some areas for the Minister to consider.  I hope he will assess whether the initiatives are possible.<\/p><p> Talk of a housing supply frustrates me more than anything else.  In every area that I can think of we built schemes with shops at the bottom of them but, unfortunately, they have all been left lying idle.  It has never made sense to me why they have been left sitting idle for ten or 15 years.  It seems the Government would rather let these places remain empty and unused instead of converting them into accommodation.  I do not understand that mindset.  I urge the Minister to do something about the problem.  Commercial units are lying idle in Ballymun, Finglas and everywhere one looks.  The other day I was in Sallins and I saw that the place was littered with boarded up premises.  The situation will not change unless something is done.  We have talked about small towns and the number of shops that are closed.  Many of the complexes were built in the past few years and a couple of hundred, literally, were built in Finglas.  I urge the Minister to do something about the matter.<\/p><p> I get very frustrated now because I remember when the idea to introduce rapid build houses was first mooted.  At the time I was the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on housing and I said I would consider the whole idea but the newspapers went ballistic at the prospect of people living in containers.  I was the first person to say I would consider rapid build and I got lashed out of it for saying so.  I do not have a problem with hubs if we put in proper, decent accommodation that is well controlled and properly dealt with.  Crucially, we cannot afford to allow rapid build units to become long-term accommodation.  We must be in a position to move people on.  That is the only way I can see rapid builds working.  We must be honest with ourselves about the waiting list.  We still have 90,000 applications or thereabouts on the housing waiting list.  We have not moved an inch.  In fact, the waiting list has increased a bit due to a greater number of homeless people and a greater number of people waiting for a house.  Things are not working.  Can we change tack?  Can the Government consider some of my ideas?  Will the Minister consider incorporating some of my ideas?  We want to improve the situation as best we can.  Without doubt, everything takes time but we  cannot afford to wait any longer.  We need to move and act quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#P02600","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2166,"content":"<p>Deputy Cowen focused on Pillar 1 so I will focus on Pillar 2, and specifically the social housing construction programme.  I wish to state that committee members were delighted to get all of the data in the open format and Excel format.  They have made it a lot easier to follow what is happening.  Is it possible to provide each project with a unique identification number?  I make the suggestion because I found it hard to compare the programme data from three months ago with this month's programme.  We discovered some differences.  <\/p> <p>  I would like an additional column in the report to show when houses become occupied.  The term \"partial completion\" does not mean anything.  It would be useful to have a column that shows how many houses have become occupied and that people are living in as it would give us definite defined data.<\/p> <p>  The only advice I would give the Minister is that the social housing construction programme is too small.  If we realistically want to tackle the housing crisis then we will have to intervene a lot more.  What we have been presented with here today is just not enough. <\/p> <p>  In terms of the Government's construction programme, 75% of the 600 projects are for 20 units or less and 45 of them are for single one house units.  We have only two projects for over 100 units and we have one for 100 units.  The largest project in the country is for 106 units and it is located in Deputy O'Dowd's constituency of Louth.

I know there are reasons for the delay but I felt that we would have had more units built by now.<\/p> <p>  I have analysed the movement of the different construction projects and I identified eight projects that have gone backwards.  Maybe it is just that we are not matching them properly or something.  I have a list of them in front of me.  The eight projects have moved from either stage 4 to stage 1 or whatever but I will not go into the details now.  Equally, we can see that there have only been 181 completions in Q1 of this year.

He stated that no local authority had been refused a construction project.  I find that hard to believe, unless there is a pre-consultation process taking place where local authorities are told not to submit anything.  I cannot believe the small volume of the projects submitted.  Given the crisis unfolding in every county, I cannot believe local authorities would be submitting application for five, ten or 20 units; they would be submitting applications for significantly higher units.  Are the local authorities being consulted prior to them submitting construction projects to the Department?  We need to know that because we are not delivering on social houses.  Unless we get real about this, I do not think we will get there.<\/p> <p>  The issue of vacant properties was brought up.  This is a win-win situation for everybody.  We do not need infrastructure because it is already there.  There is no cost involved.  We have 198,000 vacant properties according to the Department's website and have only targeted 800, or 0.4%, of them.  Targeting vacant properties is a win for everybody.  There is no huge infrastructure cost.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of infrastructure, I know approximately &euro;200 million is there for it.  We are only rolling out &euro;50 million or so of that on an annual basis, however.  If we are only rolling the last &euro;50 million of that out in year four, it will be three or four years before that infrastructure is in place.

I have been told by experts, however, that because of the defective nature of the building standards regulations in the area of fire, named estates have dangerous, inflammable materials, including cyanide-emitting materials, such as those which have now been identified as a factor in the Grenfell fire.  This is very serious.  It is not just issues of enforcement, staff and inspections, important as they are.  The actual regulations are defective.

I just wanted to mention this in passing.  My question is: when we will see the fire safety review?  I understand the new regulations were agreed at the beginning of this year.  When exactly are we going to see them?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of homelessness, I would like to pick up on Senator Murnane O'Connor's point.  Before getting into specifics, we need a change of attitude.  We need to accept at this point that we have let every single homeless person down.  We have to start with that.  I know where the Senator is coming from when she says some of these hubs are very good but no hub, no hotel and no emergency accommodation is good from the point of view of the people in it.  Their being homeless means we have failed them and it is not good.  There needs to be an attitude change from the very top right the way down through everybody engaging with the homeless.  People should not be expected to be grateful for getting slightly better emergency accommodation.  That attitude exists.  We have failed everybody who is homeless.  We should recognise these are human beings and the first thing we should do is apologise to them and then listen to them.  We should not have arbitrary self-imposed targets such as getting people out of hotels by a certain date, getting them into hubs, etc.  Some people would rather be in a hotel near their children's school than be sent to the best hub in the world 15 km away.  Other people might want to be in the hub rather than the hotel.  The key is to start with the human beings, the individuals, rather than having arbitrary self-imposed schemes.<\/p> <p>  The second group of people to whom I would urge the Minister to talk is the staff in the housing departments whose morale is on the floor.  These are the people who have to take the flak for the failure of successive governments.  The Minister needs to really listen to them and to ask what it is they think would help matters.  I would start with the human beings affected by the crisis and move on to those working on the front line.<\/p> <p>  On the July issue, in my area in particular, and this may be true elsewhere, I do not want to keep hearing of people being told they are being put out of hotels because the local authority needs to clear everybody out and that they will be put in a hub in town, whether they like it or not.  That should not happen.  I have had to fight and go to the Department on this.  Bob Jordan has been very helpful.  We need to start with what is best for the children and for the families and that may mean staying in a hotel until something better can be found.  Nobody should be in a hotel or in a hub, but the point is that we need flexibility based on humanity.<\/p> <p>  On vacant properties, I really urge the Minister to look at this issue and to conduct an audit.  We need staff to go out to look for these vacant properties.  Let us take the Robin Hill apartments, an example I highlighted before.  These should never have been sold by NAMA to Cerberus.  There are 15 empty apartments there now.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council tried to get them a year ago and was refused.  These apartments are empty.  Can we have them please?  Can we have action to get those apartments and can we please tell Cerberus, which has made a fortune out of this, that it is not to evict anybody?  We cannot allow them evict anybody, which is what it is currently trying to do because some of those people evicted from Robin Hill at the end of July will then be down to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council looking for emergency accommodation.  That is the reality.  Either we stop those evictions or those people will be down to the county council.  <\/p> <p>  More generally, can we have an audit of empty properties in every area and the resources provided to achieve this?  We need to approach the owners of every one of these empty properties and the councils need to look to acquire them in some shape or from for the purpose of social housing.<\/p> <p>  Of Rebuilding Ireland's target of providing 110,000 to 120,000 social housing units of all sorts by 2021, approximately two-thirds is through HAPs.  Does the Minister now accept this is simply not going to happen?  Some of it will happen.  For two-thirds of the social housing strategy to depend on HAPs, however, when this scheme is self-evidently failing in a number of areas, has to be revised.  I am not saying some degree of HAPs cannot work but there are reports that in many areas landlords cannot be persuaded to sign up.  Worse still, many landlords are pulling out of the HAPs arrangement and making people who thought that they were socially-housed homeless.<\/p><p>There has to be some recognition that this is not a viable strategy.  The extent to which the social housing strategy depends on the scheme has to be scaled down and replaced with something better.<\/p><p> In so far as the Minister is persisting with housing assistant payments I have a request for every local authority.  We do not have place finders in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  We are dependent on the offices down town.  Under the current set-up the responsibility for families who are in homeless accommodation is on the council.  The council must help them to find a rental property rather than someone who is trying to get the children to school from some hub or hotel, especially when that person is also being told to find their own HAP arrangements.  It is absolutely scandalous.<\/p><p> I asked officials in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council whether they know about the place finders unit.  They did not even know about it.  There is no place finders unit in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  They refer us to town and they do not even know what is going on in the place finders unit in town.  It is crazy that senior housing officials in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council barely know what the service is.  I appeal to the Minister on that point.<\/p><p> Another question on housing assistance payments relates to the projection.  I appeal to the Minister to scale it down and replace it with something else.  In so far as the Minister intends to persist with it, what is he going to do with the lack of security on HAP that is emerging?  Is the Minister going to revisit the nature of the HAP arrangements in order that there is some security to them?  Otherwise, they do not represent a form of social housing.  It is not social housing if a person can be turfed out a year from now.<\/p><p> The Minister mentioned Cherrywood and affordable rental schemes and so on.  Currently, we are only going to get 10% of Cherrywood for this.  The Minister said it is one of the biggest residential developments happening anywhere in the country.  If we got a higher proportion, we could, with that one development, almost solve the housing crisis in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  However, we are only getting 10%, even though under the original strategic development zone we were supposed to get 20%.  Can the Minister explain what we are going to do about that?  Can we please at least insist that we get the 20% level that was in the SDZ?<\/p><p> Will the Minister please ask NAMA about it too?  NAMA has property there that is not included in the Hines element.  Will the Minister ask NAMA to provide its land up there for social housing?  We do not know the status of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council land in the Cherrywood development.  Can we ask that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council also provide social housing on the council part of the land in Cherrywood?  That would significantly increase the proportion of social housing.<\/p><p> I wish to ask about the contrast between the Government's stated policy commitment to social mix and other arrangements.  Why is it that on private land &ndash; some of it used to be public, but we sold it &ndash; we are only asking for 10%?  This means the social mix amounts to 90% and 10% is for social housing.  However, on public land the Government appears to be proposing 33% for social housing and 66% for various forms of private housing.  I do not agree with any public land being privatised, as the Government is proposing.  Anyway, at least for the sake of consistency, if the Government believes in social mix, then surely the same percentage should apply to private land.  Why is the social mix different on public land and private land?  I am asking the question seriously.  If there was consistency within the Government policy - which I somewhat disagree with - the proportion of social housing in overall residential developments would significantly ramp up.  Will the Minister respond to those questions?<\/p><p> Finally, threshold limits on eligibility for social housing must be revised immediately because people are getting knocked off the list simply for doing some extra shifts.  Their income would not be anywhere close to allowing them to be able to rent or buy but they are being knocked off housing lists.  Can that be reviewed urgently?  Can the Minister issue an instruction to local authorities to stop taking people off the list now until we have revised those limits?  This is vital because people are being thrown off the list as we speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#R00800","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2180,"content":"<p>Do you want to wait until the next meeting, Senator Boyhan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#S00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2181,"content":"<p>I think it would be better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#S00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2182,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Dowd, do you want to wait until the next meeting so that you have a proper amount of time, or do you want to ask a quick question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#S00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2183,"content":"<p>I am happy to talk now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062200002#S00500","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1498136400,"counter":2184,"content":"<p>You will literally have three minutes.

By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I open the floor to Lord Alderdice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017062200002#A00200","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498138200,"counter":2218,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his kind welcome and also the staff of the Seanad who have been very helpful in making arrangements for today from my point of view.  I bring the Members greetings from the House of Lords, their sister chamber on the other side of the water.  I especially appreciate being here not just because of the subject, but I understand the Members will be moving out of this Chamber in the near future to allow for renovations.  That is also planned for the Parliament in Westminster once the complicated and very expensive business of contracts and where to put us during the work on the building is sorted out.  It is a delight to be here again in this building.<\/p> <p>  I am very grateful to the Members for facilitating the sitting today because I was in Colombia on peace process business; I came back yesterday.  I mention that because one of the things that has struck me in being involved in the Colombian process is their failure to understand the importance of something we learned in the Irish peace process, that is, the fundamental significance of the relationships between various important groups.  The Members will recall that in our process North, South, east and west, we identified three key sets of relationships between unionists and nationalists in the North, between people in the North and in the South and between Britain and Ireland.  Of course, the relationship with the United States was important and, particularly as we are thinking about it today, the relationship with Europe, but the three key sets of relationships in our process were the three that I have mentioned.  We established the process in three strands, each mirroring in its content and membership those who represented those relationships.  The form of the process followed the function of addressing those relationships rather than the reverse.<\/p> <p>  In Colombia, they worked extremely hard.  They have gone around the world trying to identify all sorts of useful processes, but they have not understood the significance of these historic disturbed relationships.  That is a problem in the European Union itself.  The EU was a peace process.  The purpose of the whole European project was to ensure there would never again be a terrible war in Europe so all the instruments with which we have become familiar - freedom to travel, to trade across borders, the development of the euro - were instruments to the purpose of relationships which would not break down into war.  As time has gone on, people have forgotten about the purpose and focused more on the instruments to deliver the purpose.  That is one of the reasons the project has got itself into some difficulty and it may well be one of the important reasons we are having to address, unfortunately, the question of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  I will not focus on all three sets of relationships.  The committee has had many sittings to address a number of them.  In particular, I will not focus on the relationship between the rest of the United Kingdom and Ireland because although it is very important - economically, it may be more substantial than the relationships between North and South and in some ways more complex to address - I will focus more on the relationship between North and South and also the relationships within Northern Ireland.  I will explain the reason I believe that is relevant shortly.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, the North-South relationship is less of an issue in economic terms than we would wish. I would rather there was a great deal more economic to and fro between North and South, but in percentage issues, with the exception of agriculture and agrifood business, and possibly of electricity and energy, we would like to grow the economy and the economic relationship between North and South much more.  There is, however, an issue of individual people moving backwards and forwards, many of them every day, living on one side of the Border and working on the other side.  As we all know, in the past few years that has been a great deal easier for many people in practical terms.  I find it very encouraging that none of the political parties, North or South, wants a hard Border.  That would not have been the case a number of years ago.  Some political parties in the North would have been very keen to emphasise the Border and to make it a very hard Border.  The consequence of the peace process, working together over a period of time and appreciating the value of that, means that nobody, including now the largest party in Northern Ireland, the DUP, wants a hard Border.<\/p><p>It is very positive that among all the parties now there is an attitude that we want to make sure that as little harm as possible comes from the consequences of Brexit.  However, there is less free movement than we would sometimes like to believe.  When I was working as a doctor and psychiatrist, I was keen to encourage the secondment of doctors, particularly young doctors in training, to the South and from the South to the North.  I also talked to some people in the police because I thought it would be good if we could have some secondment backwards and forwards between the police services.  It is funny what really gets in the way.  It was not professional recognition or salaries, but pensions.  There was a huge problem about making sure that if somebody went North or South, they did not lose out on pension contributions.  When I spoke to some colleagues in a couple of other countries about this, they said it was the same with them.  Freedom of movement is one thing and professional recognition is another, but sometimes it is these practical national issues that get in the way.<\/p><p> When we think about the question of the free movement of people and what they can do, there are other places to which we can look to see the consequences, positive and negative, helpful and otherwise, not only with the movement of people, but also other things.  We think very much about the freedom of movement between countries in the European Union and I mentioned, for example, professional recognition.  If one goes to work in the United States or Canada as a doctor, one will get one's professional recognition in one province in Canada or in one state in the United States but one will not be able to simply move and work in another part of the United States or another part of Canada.  It would be much easier for one to move in Europe than it would be within the United States or in Canada.  On the other hand, there are some quite positive aspects of the relationship between Canada and the United States.  As in so many other areas, it is valuable for us to look and see what things we can learn from the experiences of others, and I will return to that, particularly in regard to the EEA, in a few minutes.<\/p><p> There is the importance of the North-South relationship.  While it is the case that the British and Irish Governments, the United Kingdom Government and Brussels will have to do much of the heavy lifting in connection with the Brexit negotiations, it is important that there are open and constructive North-South channels.  That is one of the reasons in a number of debates, particularly before the Westminster election, in March and April that I and others in the House of Lords, perhaps most notably Lord Trimble, suggested that in the event that it is not possible to get the Executive re-established in Northern Ireland - we hope this will not be the case - before the end of this month or at whatever point is necessary, that any change, and the legislation which would be necessary for any change, would keep the Assembly in business in order that it might be possible to have an elected body that could relate North-South on issues particularly related to Brexit.  It is important that the people of Northern Ireland, through their elected representatives, engage with the people of the rest of the island through their representatives in order that we can address this North-South relationship.  It is important to point out that it would not be satisfactory if the two major parties in the North, the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn F&eacute;in, which will obviously have the most to say about this, were to leave the heavy lifting on these difficult issues to the Government in Dublin and the Government in London to address.  It is too easy to leave these responsibilities to others and then sometimes criticise others for the outcome.  It is important that we all take up our responsibilities to address these issues.  I hope it is the case that the Executive will be in place soon but if it is not, I would again say in this Chamber today that it is very important to maintain the elected body of the Assembly in order that there are those within Northern Ireland with whom to engage, people who are elected to serve and represent the people.<\/p><p> That means there would also be the possibility of a serious engagement within Northern Ireland about these questions.  When the issue of the referendum arose, knowing that I was a very committed remainer, as people describe it now, some of my colleagues in the Liberal Democrats asked me: \"Are you going to run a campaign for remain in Northern Ireland?\"  I said, \"No, I am not\".  They said, \"Why, do you not believe in it?\", and I said, \"Absolutely, I do.\"  However, if we were to run an effective campaign to remain, I know what would happen.  The community would split down all the old usual dividing lines and Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP and Alliance would also say \"remain\" and the two main unionist parties would say \"Brexit\".  All we would have done would be to deepen the division in the community on yet another issues.  Those colleagues asked me: \"What are you going to do?  Are you going to ignore it?\"  I said: \"No, on the contrary, we are going to be very active about it.  We are going to have a community initiative and we are going to create a public conversation in which we address all of these issues.\"  The young man who is accompanying me today, Mr. Conor Houston, was responsible together with my colleague, Eva Grosman, in the Centre for Democracy and Peace Building in Belfast, for creating what was the only significant public initiative in the run up to the referendum and since then, called \"EU Debate NI\".  That brought on to platforms in meetings of people from the Border areas, including lawyers, farmers, business people, students and others, people across the range of views on the remain side and the Brexit side to have a serious conversation about the implications.  It was extremely successful not only because it enabled people to talk about it, but because there was not the polarisation and the vitriol that there was in England over the question.  People were able to have a good conversation about it and the Ulster Unionist Party in the end took a position that it would vote to remain.  The Democratic Unionist Party said that it had discussed and thought about it but, on balance, it would vote for Brexit, but they also decided that, on balance, it was not a question of splitting in a partisan way.  That is important when we examine these questions in Northern Ireland, where it is so easy for us to fall into divisions, that we find it possible to explore the practicalities we face, and there are some real practical difficulties that we face.<\/p><p> What are these practicalities?  It is not too difficult to identify what the problems might be, but it is quite difficult to be clear on what size they will be.  For example, in terms of getting facts, some estimates of the Northern Ireland balance of payments with other parts of the EU have suggested there may be a surplus of some hundreds of millions of sterling but a more recent Northern Ireland Assembly research paper suggested a deficit of about &pound;2 billion.  The facts are quite difficult to come to grips with and in many ways we will have to wait and see whether all the problems we expect are as great as we fear or whether they are even worse that we imagine.  There are some benefits, for example, to being in the European Union, which we do not need to lose.  I cite the simple example of mobile phones.  As Members of Seanad, the Senators undoubtedly travel a good deal not only within Ireland, but beyond it, and they will know that excessive roaming charges have now been reduced by the European Union, which is of great benefit.  This was a  problem not only when we went to other parts of Europe, but in Northern Ireland if one used one's phone not even near the Border, but in Portrush or Portstewart, one was often caught with having to pay international roaming charges because the nearest mast was in Donegal.  Some people have suggested there will be a return to our having roaming charges, but there is no need for that if, for example, the UK Government were to say to the telephone companies that it would only give them a licence if they were to continue to address roaming charges in the way that they do with the rest of the EU, and they would not be given a licence unless they did that and could be held to that.  <\/p><p> There may be some issues that do not have to be as bad and they may some that will be worse.  It will be difficult to be sure what the result will be in advance.  We have to explore all the questions and perhaps examine the possibility of having more information technology for traceability of people and movements between Britain and Ireland.<\/p><p>On that point, I should point out that things are not actually frightfully consistent, even at present.  When I came over from London this morning, I showed my passport.  I will travel to Belfast on the train this evening and may or may not use my passport.  When I return to Britain on the ferry, I will not use my passport at all, but if I travel on some flights, I will have to use my passport as photo ID.  There is an idea that there is complete consistency and that problems will be created because of inconsistencies due to Brexit, but the truth is that we are not as consistent as we might like to believe we are.  If we think about and discuss the issue more and come to an agreement, we may find ourselves being able to be more consistent and provide for better traceability.  In Ireland we are very used to the traceability of animals but less so of people.  Perhaps we might be more able to trace the movements of people in a way that is accepting of their privacy and does not intrude excessively into it.  Where, for example, we need customs checks and checks on the movement of goods and services, it may not necessarily always be the case that they need to be made at the Border.  It would be quite possible to create authorised economic operator status, as already happens, for some companies.  It is a little excessive for small or medium-sized enterprises, but something of that nature could be done to enable some companies to address these issues more easily.<\/p><p> In many ways, the perceptions of a hard border, checkpoints, watchtowers and so on were security related rather than related to customs.  I see no evidence of a serious threat of a return to that security problem.  I say that because, although some dissidents remain, one of the things the last Assembly elections and, to some extent, the Westminster elections showed was that the political project of the leadership of Sinn F&eacute;in and the success it had achieved demonstrated that democratic politics was the way forward, whatever one's political vision.  The use of violence does not help that vision; rather, it detracts from it.  The success of Sinn F&eacute;in, often at the expense of others - that is democracy, as we all know - has demonstrated to its own satisfaction and that of many of those who follow it that democratic and peaceful politics rather than the use of violence is the way forward.  When people think of the problems of Brexit and a hard border as something that threatens the peace process, as distinct from the political process or economic relations, it is not as great a danger as some might have perhaps feared.<\/p><p> We need to be aware that moving from the current arrangements to the new dispensation does not have to happen overnight.  In a very useful paper, Professor David Phinnemore from Queen's University, with a number of colleagues, explored the question of the European economic area, EEA.  I pay tribute to the professor and Ms Katy Hayward, with whom we have co-operated quite a lot in the past couple of years when they sought expertise in these areas.  I am sure many colleagues will know of the paper he, with a number of colleagues, produced which explores the question of the European economic area.  Even in the paper, it tends to be seen as the alternative to the current arrangement or a complete separation.  That may very well be a possibility.  It would certainly maintain the free movement of people, goods, capital and services while remaining outside the European Union. <\/p><p> There is, however, another possibility, namely, making an agreement that by the end of the two-year period starting from the invoking of Article 50 there would be a transition period for Northern Ireland, during which it would be within the EEA but outside the European Union, which would smooth the way for an ultimate Brexit.  This would make it clear that there was time to explore the practicalities, that is, all of the things members and I have mentioned, without necessarily trying to find a resolution for all of them within the two-year period and at the same time making it clear that the people had made a determination on Brexit and that that, therefore, was what would happen.  There would be an interim period to make it easier to address some of the economic questions, in particular.  The costs are significant.  It is not clear to us how great they will be, but if there was a transitional arrangement, they might be lower for us in the short term.  One of the criticisms of EEA status has been that a country pays the money but has little say on the rules.  That would probably be less of an issue if it was a short-term transitional rather than a permanent arrangement in which, over many years, a country had little or no say on any rule change.<\/p><p> As a Northern Ireland politician, the committee knows that I could speak at considerable length about almost anything at all, particularly when I have a captive audience, but it would be much wiser for me to finish there and take the opportunity, if colleagues wish and with the permission of the Chairman, to have questions and answers.  I again thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017062200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Lord Alderdice","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498138200,"counter":2221,"content":"<p>I thank Lord Alderdice for his opening remarks which were very thought-provoking and appreciated.

We go back a long time and were members of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, ELDR, when I was a member of the Progressive Democrats Party which was affiliated to the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party.  I am also a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and have the opportunity to be in the House of Commons from time to time where I want to acknowledge we are always warmly received.<\/p> <p>  Lord Alderdice mentioned a number of very interesting issues.  He also referred to the north, south, east and west.  Any politician from the Republic and, possibly, the island of Ireland would ask about the opportunities to achieve a better deal for the island of Ireland within the European Union.  That is an objective for us and it is a reasonable aspiration.  <\/p> <p>  I was in Balmoral recently to attend an agricultural show at which I met someone from the Ulster Farmers Union.  He said he had looked at the issue and that although things had moved on, he was loyal to the Crown but perhaps more loyal to the half crown.  That touched a nerve because he was talking about economics.  Money in people's pockets and for their families, the economy and the great agricultural trade links between the North and the South all unite people.  <\/p> <p>  Agriculture and the food sector generally are key trade areas.  Products which originated in the Republic Ireland are processed in the North and then brought back across the Border.  Some large co-ops have merged.  There are many synergies in the agrifood sector, North and South.  As we know, it is a very successful sector in economic terms.  <\/p> <p>  I know about the immense record of Lord Alderdice in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and achieving peace on the island of Ireland.  I acknowledge the significant role he played in that regard.  He mentioned Sinn F&eacute;in, one of the few parties which published a proposal.  I am disappointed, therefore, that Sinn F&eacute;in Senators are not present.  On the two occasions I have attended the committee I have not met a Sinn F&eacute;in Member in the Chamber.  Sinn F&eacute;in drew up a document on seeking special designated status for Northern Ireland within the European Union.  It is worth looking at the broader picture.  Mrs. Theresa May is involved in ongoing discussions with the DUP which are critical for her very survival.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, we fall in with all of that.  Is there now some sort of political will that could see a greater synergy, union or advocacy for the issue of special designated status within the EU for the island of Ireland, not specifically Northern Ireland, although that is the piece we are talking about?  Of course, we have concerns about the need to protect the peace process, retain access to the Single Market, remain part of the common travel area, to which Lord Alderdice referred, and maintain EU funding streams.  When we get down to the nuts and bolts, it is about money, funding, economics and prosperity, all of which underpin and sustain peace.  How do we protect the existing unfettered cross-border and EU-wide access to employment, social welfare, security and health care?  There are a lot of things which are of mutual benefit to us.  For example, how do we retain, maintain and grow agriculture and trade links, North and South?<\/p><p> I travel to Northern Ireland very often as I have family and connections up there.  The one thing that is clear now is that people are facing real choices.  Without dwelling too much on agriculture, it is clearly a very successful area and people see the importance of the links and the markets for all of that.  I have two questions.  First, does Lord Alderdice feel such a special status can be achieved through flexible and pragmatic negotiations?  Is there the possibility, be it through a bilateral arrangement or an international arrangement, of a negotiation for this special designated status for Northern Ireland within the EU?  Second, what is Lord Alderdice's view of the argument for that special designated status?  Can it be done with the DUP, given Sinn F&eacute;in has clearly indicated some support for it?  I would like some feedback and comments based on Lord Alderdice's experience both as a committed European and as a very successful politician in Northern Ireland.  I thank him for his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017062200002#C00300","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498138200,"counter":2224,"content":"<p>I welcome Lord Alderdice.  His comments were very enlightening and his vast experience is evident from his words.  I would like to get his opinion on the current political status following the Westminster election.  If he had been here three weeks ago, would any of his contribution have been different?  Does the current political situation determine his outlook in a way that is different from his outlook before the election?  I assume he is no different from ourselves, in that we did not see the result we were handed coming down the line.  In view of the ongoing negotiations between the DUP and the Conservatives, and given Lord Alderdice pointed to the possibility of a worst-case scenario if the Assembly cannot be re-formed, what effect would that have for the island from a Brexit perspective?  I hope it does not happen but we have to ask the question as to whether Northern Ireland might revert to direct rule, while the DUP is part of supporting the minority Conservative Government during that situation of direct rule.  To use an old phrase, where would the tail stop wagging the dog in that situation?  I can imagine it would have terrible consequences for the Good Friday Agreement and it certainly would not help our collective wish for a soft Brexit for the island.  Perhaps Lord Alderdice can tease that out.<\/p> <p>  Before the election result, from an Irish point of view and in hoping for the best from the Brexit negotiation, I would have seen \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" and a Conservative Government with an overall majority as being our worst-case scenario.  Now, given Theresa May's overall majority never happened and she is weakened to a certain extent, many are saying that this has to work to Ireland's advantage.  However, I have a fear that the enemy in the room under those circumstances could be our colleagues within the 27, in that they now see the UK in a weaker position and they see an opportunity to teach a lesson to somebody who wants to leave the classroom before the bell goes.  Therefore, they could go for an even harder Brexit than had been anticipated, now they have the opportunity, and we could be the big losers.<\/p> <p>  While we are only one of 27, we have had kind words from everybody who speaks in any position of authority or otherwise, but kind words do not wash when it gets down to the nitty-gritty.  We have no commitment from anybody, despite what they have said about what we deserve and should get.  I would like to hear Lord Alderdice's opinion on my fear that our worst enemy may be our own side, in the sense that they may go for the jugular by virtue of the fact the UK is in a weakened position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017062200002#D00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1498138200,"counter":2225,"content":"<p>I have a question that builds on a point made by Senator Daly.  It goes back to Lord Alderdice's previous role in Stormont rather than his current role in Westminster, and concerns the position of the devolved Administrations and the role they are playing in the negotiations within the UK.  How does Lord Alderdice feel their voices can be heard best by Westminster and by the UK Government in particular, and are they being heard?  I met this week a delegation from the Welsh Assembly and two weeks ago I visited Edinburgh and met a number of MSPs.  To be frank, part of the feeling there was party-political as opposed to relating to the devolved Administrations, in that they were to an extent being frozen out.  Obviously, the current impasse in Northern Ireland does not help that situation.  Going forward, as Senator Daly noted, Ireland will be engaging in serious internal negotiations with the other 26 remaining states at Council of Ministers level and beyond.  However, we will also wonder what is the negotiation in the UK.  Is it solely a London-led deal and how are they going to incorporate the devolved Administrations in the negotiations and in the Great Repeal Bill, whenever it comes?  Moreover, are they going to be able to properly implement whatever deal comes to pass?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017062200002#D00300","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498138200,"counter":2226,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and his colleagues for their thoughtful questions and interventions.  First, on the questions raised by Senator Boyhan about the island of Ireland and the question of special status for Northern Ireland, I think there will be a degree of resistance to the notion of a special status for Northern Ireland, particularly if it gives Northern Ireland itself a different relationship with the EU than the rest of the United Kingdom.  I think there would be an instinctive difficulty about that, especially if one speaks about it in broad terms.  One of the lessons from the negotiations on the Good Friday Agreement was that when people talked in terms of broad principles, they tended to divide.  When they talked about practicalities, however, very often it was possible to get an understanding.<\/p> <p>  I remember when we were talking, for example, about issues like animal health, where we recognised the island as a whole is a kind of natural quarantine, there was very little resistance from the DUP.  Indeed, I remember someone asking Dr. Paisley, on the question of European funding for farming and so on, how he squared the fact that, on the one hand, he was very anti-EU but, on the other, he was quite happy to engage when it concerned agriculture.  To which his characteristic response was that the people are British but the cows are Irish.  I think there is something interesting there because he recognised, as Senator Boyhan did, how important agriculture is for the island and how we have a natural quarantine.  It may be worth exploring whether the island as a whole would have some special context within Europe.  For example, Senator Boyhan said that animals and food products move around within the island and we are all very aware that if it comes to something like BSE or foot and mouth disease, the island as a whole has to take action, not just the North or the South.<\/p><p>We are separated by the water that protects us as well as sometimes isolates us.  There could be mileage in looking to the EU for some special arrangement on specific areas, such as agriculture and agribusiness, and to ask the EU if it would accept, for practical reasons such as disease control and the economy, that the entire island of Ireland would have a special status, not in every area but in this area.  There could be other areas as well, but if we look at the specifics and the practicalities, and the fact our island status has sometimes created problems for us but also has advantages, maybe there is something that can be done.<\/p><p> Can this be done with the DUP?  I think it can.  There is a much greater openness to these things now than there was before.  We should not underestimate the effect of the changed security situation and the changed attitudes in the country.  There has been a liberalisation of the economy and of many attitudes, North and South, which means many people not only in the younger generation but in the older generation feel less anxiety and antipathy.  Senator Boyhan asked how attitudes in the North might have changed or be changing and he linked it to the importance of finance and the economy.  He is right about this, but it is not just this.  Attitudes have eased up and loosened up.<\/p><p> For many years, many of us said those who wanted to bring people together with the use of violence were on the wrong track altogether.  One does not bring people together with the use of violence.  One brings people together when they can relate without anxieties and concerns and they get to know each other, and I think this has happened.  It is the case that many people in the unionist community are looking at the prospects for the future in a different way and with a different set of attitudes than would have been the case even ten years ago and certainly 20 or 30 years ago.  If we can continue working together more and more on things, the future with decide itself, and do so peacefully and democratically, through people building relationships with each other.  Agriculture is one place and there are many other places.  Sport is a place for competition, but it is also a place where we can have common identity with each other.  I am not negative about this, on the contrary.<\/p><p> In a sense this leads us to Senator Paul Daly's questions on the current political situation.  Sometimes I joke when people ask me what I think will happen that I am the son of Presbyterian Minister and not the son of a prophet.  I had absolutely no idea what the outcome of the election would be and I was no better than anybody else in working that out.  However, it seems to me that some important things have changed.  There has been a lot of talk, in particular perhaps in England, about the potential negative nature of the dependence of Prime Minister Theresa May on DUP votes and I understand this.  However, one of the concerns might have been that the Prime Minister might not have been paying attention to the relationship with Ireland, North and South, and I remember in April when we had a debate on this question I noted the Prime Minister had not always paid attention.  When she was Home Secretary she did not pay attention in the creation of the National Crime Agency to the fact there was a land border for which it would be responsible.  When I asked whether there had been discussions with the Minister for Justice and Equality in Ireland there was no thought of it.  It was not that there was an intention to snub, it just had not been thought about.  She will not be able not to think about Ireland, North and South, because of the DUP, ironically perhaps.  Do I think that will be negative?  Not necessarily.  When it comes to questions such as agriculture and animal health, and issues such as the air passenger duty for flights, the need to ensure energy co-operation and the electricity interconnector, I think we will find the DUP is much more concerned about some of these economic concerns now than it is about issues of social legislation being expanded to the rest of the United Kingdom.  The DUP will keep Ireland, North and South, on the agenda and that will be helpful.<\/p><p> When people talk, as some have, with a good deal of anxiety about the consequences for the Good Friday Agreement of the DUP been involved, not in coalition but in a confidence and supply arrangement, I have said to them they are complaining about that degree of co-operation but they were telling us what a wonderful thing it was when some of our parties went into government with it in Northern Ireland.  Although it may or may not please everybody in the Chamber, it is not unlikely that at some point in the future there will be a coalition government here in the rest of the Ireland in which Sinn F&eacute;in will play a part.  Will people say that is the end of the Good Friday Agreement?  I do not think so.  I do not think even the DUP will say it is an end of it.  On the contrary, it will say it is an outcome of democracy and we have to find a way of working with it.<\/p><p> I am much less anxious and concerned than some.  I understand the concerns but, for example, the Chairman asked about devolved administrations being heard and one of the problems for Wales and Scotland is they have Governments of a different political complexion from the Government in London and, therefore, there is not an immediate set of relationships, whereas the situation for Northern Ireland is there will have to be constant conversations between the leaders and chief whips.  Scotland and Wales will have their difficulties but, having said that, my impression is the Prime Minister understands and is committed to trying to keep the United Kingdom and relationships in these islands together rather than them going apart under her watch.  There will be moves, but especially in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> Paradoxically, the dependence on the DUP may be a helpful thing.  Is it possible the big enemy may be the other Twenty-six Counties?  I would not like to speak about it being an enemy, but it is a challenge and we need to recognise that it is a challenge.  This is a good reason for working together.  I very much hope that colleagues here will see the opportunities and imperative of ensuring good relationships between this House and its Members and colleagues in all the political parties in Northern Ireland as well as with the Government in London.  I am anxious, as everyone is, but I am not as pessimistic as some are if we work together on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2017062200002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Lord Alderdice","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498138200,"counter":2228,"content":"<p>I thank Lord Alderdice.
