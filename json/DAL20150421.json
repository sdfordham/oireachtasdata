The article was based on freedom of information documents the newspaper had secured from the Department of Finance in the form of memoranda.  Any reader of the article would have to come to the conclusion that there are grave concerns about how that company was sold.<\/p><p>There were a number of such concerns.  I pay tribute to the Independent Deputy Catherine Murphy, who has doggedly pursued this issue for well over 12 months, if not longer, through parliamentary questions and so on.  In the beginning she was told by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that he was satisfied that the best interests of the taxpayer were met in the sale of this company.  We know that IBRC sold Siteserv at a loss of &euro;105 million.  We know that the legal advisers acted for both the purchaser and the seller.  We now know that the financial adviser Davy, which was advising the company but whose fundamental obligation was to its own shareholders and not the taxpayer, recommended a payout of &euro;5 million to the shareholders to induce them to sell.  Therefore, in a company that owed the State &euro;150 million, the shareholders and directors, five of whom were, I think, clients of Davy, got &euro;5 million.  Trade buyers were excluded on what I would consider to be relatively spurious grounds and there were reports of other companies that wanted to bid higher but were spurned.  Latterly, as Independent Deputy Catherine Murphy was putting her questions, the Minister revealed somewhat more in answers to parliamentary questions, and outlined all of the concerns I have outlined as being concerns of his officials.  We have now learned that there were two separate reviews of the deal, one by Department of Finance officials and another by Central Bank officials.  There are huge potential conflicts of interest all over this deal.  Let us remember that we are talking about a company whose subsidiary, Sierra, went on to win the largest contract to install water meters and has now become a very profitable company in itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100017#P01300","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429627500,"counter":127,"content":"<p>What is new?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100018#Q00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1429627500,"counter":128,"content":"<p>The point I am making is this.

We should not lose sight of the fact that their horrors are a direct result of Europe's colonial record over the years and the much more recent policies of the West towards north Africa and the Middle East.<\/p>  <p>  Italy has urged the EU to act to prevent further loss of life.  EU foreign Ministers met and produced a ten-point plan which, in my humble opinion, is inadequate for dealing with this humanitarian disaster.  For example, doubling funds to the EU border patrol mission will not provide the search and rescue operations needed in the face of this crisis.

It commemorates the 1,490 people who walked the route during the Famine and boarded coffin ships for Canada, upon which more than 700 of them died.  A point made yesterday was that this replicates what is happening in the Middle East.  This is simply appalling in the sense of humanity.  The fact that it is on the Mediterranean exacerbates the situation, because people's lives are lost through drowning.<\/p>  <p>  Some 1 million people have left Syria and moved to south Lebanon or Jordan, but there is no humanitarian plan to deal with that scale of migration.  There are countries without boundaries in Africa, where people move from Somalia through Libya to the coast to get to Europe.  The scale of this is unprecedented in terms of numbers.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Flanagan, representing the Government, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, attended the meeting in Luxembourg yesterday.  There was agreement from the European Ministers for foreign affairs and security and justice on the ten-point plan.  President Tusk has called a meeting of the European Council on Thursday to deal with this.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Adams's question is perfectly valid.  It depends upon the scale of investment in search and rescue operations and humanitarian relief.  The second part of that concerns what it is possible to do in vast areas that are on a knife edge and where all kinds of cruelty against humanity are practised.  These people, desperate in their destitution, are arriving at the shores of the Mediterranean, are put, in some cases, put on ships without captain, steward or compass, and are doomed before they ever sail.  This is an appalling disgrace.  It will not be sorted out at the European Council meeting on Thursday, but Italy and Malta are to be commended for what they did.  Italy had the Mare Nostrum project in place and now needs assistance in terms of surveillance, interception, rescue and humanitarian relief.<\/p>  <p>  There is a deeper and much more challenging problem in the vast countries where large numbers of people are being treated savagely by warring factions, a problem that is not confined to Libya alone.  Ireland will make its case on Thursday and will continue to offer humanitarian assistance.  A figure of 5,000 refugees has been mentioned, and Ireland will play its part as it has always done.  In many years gone by, people from this country went wherever they might be welcome, which is one of the reasons we have such an extensive diaspora of descendants.<\/p>  <p>  This is an immediate problem.  Children, babies and helpless people are being loaded onto boats at this moment in time by unscrupulous racketeers who know that the complete inadequacy of the vessels they are putting them on dooms them to the probability of drowning in the Mediterranean when all they want is to flee from persecution, savagery and death and look beyond the immediate shores to a place where they might have hope and a new life.  The challenge is of an unprecedented scale for all countries in Europe.  For our part, in terms of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Justice and Equality and Defence, we will contribute in whatever way we can to dealing with this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100019#R01200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1429628100,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I tried to moderate my question because I do not want to make any political points out of such a serious issue, but I asked the Taoiseach to outline for us the message he will bring to our European partners and the proposals for which he will argue.  He did not do that.  He told me about a commemorative march from Strokestown.  I commend those on that march.  The Taoiseach is very familiar with the walk from Louisburgh known as the Trail of Tears, a road I have walked.  Famously, Native Americans assisted Irish people from the Taoiseach's county.  If I recall correctly, it was the Choctaw tribe, who did more in their day for the Irish people than we are doing now for others.  The problem is a result of direct interference by Western powers in the affairs of the countries involved.  People are being persecuted and are fleeing for a better life.  They are trying to reach a better place to live.<\/p>  <p>  It has been reported that the EU will seek to stop them at sea.  Is that true?  What is the view of the Government on that?  Will people be detained in camps in Libya?  The Taoiseach mentioned the fever camps.  I visited those in Grosse &Icirc;le on the eastern coast of Canada and North America, where our people died.  What happened in the era of the coffin ships is happening now.<\/p><p>The proposal to resettle 5,000 immigrants in EU states is a drop in the ocean considering that hundreds of thousands are desperate to travel.  Reference is made to a package of return travel to where the individuals are trying to flee from.  What is this?  Ryanair?  The resettlement of 1,200 people in 14 years is what we have achieved.  The treatment of people in direct provision centres is not a matter of which the Government or its predecessors can be proud.  Will the Taoiseach accept that as a nation that has experienced conflict, famine, forced emigration, fever camps, death and the spectre of coffin ships, Ireland needs to strengthen search and rescue operations through a joint effort involving EU member states?  Does he accept that the European Union as a whole must provide more safe and legal routes to Europe for those who are now being forced to take dangerous journeys in the first place and ensure they have access to international protection?  The very least the Taoiseach could do is inform the D&aacute;il of the proposals he will put at the meeting to help alleviate the plight of these people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100019#R01300","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429628700,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Yes, I am aware of the Walk of Tears and the incredible story of the Choctaw Indians who sent us the equivalent of $10,000 for famine relief.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the meeting of the European Council on Thursday is to endorse the ten-point plan put together yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministers for security and home affairs in Luxembourg.  Clearly, there is an immediate catastrophe facing us.  People are being loaded onto unseaworthy craft now on the shores of Libya.  Many of them have travelled from Somalia, Mali and other locations, and others are fleeing the conflicts in both Syria and Libya.  They all want to cross the Mediterranean, and Malta, Lampedusa and Italy are the first ports of call.  Clearly, this is a matter of the utmost seriousness.  What can Ireland do about this?  It can contribute with other bigger nations with greater resources.  The Deputy is well aware that what is in our own DNA, given our history, leads us to be one of the most humanitarian countries around, proportionately speaking.  We will continue to be that.  As I stated, between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Defence, we will contribute to this debate on Thursday in the hope of saving the lives of those who have just left the shores of Libya in craft that will never reach the far side of the Mediterranean.  The ten-point plan exists for everybody.<\/p>  <p>  The pirates, smugglers and unscrupulous people are using their deadly opportunity to make money by putting innocent people, who are fleeing war, rape, pillage and all kinds of inhumanity, on boats to cross the Mediterranean from the Libyan shore in the knowledge that there is sometimes neither skipper, captain, steward nor compass to get them to the far side.  Mare Nostrum did save many lives.  I expect that the meeting on Thursday will result in a much more focused and immediate response in terms of greater surveillance, activity and humanitarian relief and a greater opportunity to search for and rescue these innocent people.  From a political point of view, addressing the causes of the desperation of so many people, requiring them to leave for Europe, must be dealt with in the bigger political field.

Hundreds of vulnerable recipients have been informed by letter that the HSE is making some drastic cuts to its already-diminished service. which has been diminishing over the past two years.  The unfortunate notice is being sent to a very worried and stressed group of citizens.  This action is replicated in other counties.  The Taoiseach will have to intervene very strongly with the Minister for Health as this cannot be allowed to continue.<\/p>  <p>  The home help service for our elderly and vulnerable population is probably the best and most effective means of delivery of home care services to ensure people can live in their own communities, at a very low cost.  This is the environment in which people are happiest.  There is a policy of upgrading and developing the delivery of community care in general, but what is happening on the ground is contrary to all this.  There is certainly a deficiency and we need to rectify it as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  These regressive measures are further compounding an already-diminishing service.  The service for many deserving elderly and infirm people is being very much cut down to the very minimum.  The cost of home care provision is significantly lower than the cost of nursing home provision but there is currently an emphasis on forcing those in receipt of home care into private nursing homes as an alternative means of care.  In many cases, an adequate home help service, in addition to the respite care provided in the district and community hospitals, would be the solution.<\/p>  <p>  The trend has been evident over the past two years, in particular.  The minimum number of home help hours has been provided.  In many cases, perhaps only a half an hour is allowed at a certain time in the morning or afternoon.  Consequently, the home help provider may not be in inside the door of the house and may be trying to get her or his chores done as fast as possible before leaving.  What is happening is counter-productive.  The best value for money is not being realised as the service is currently run.  Over &euro;70 million has been provided for the care of the elderly under the fair deal system and community care in general.  I ask that sufficient moneys be invested immediately to address the issue I am raising.  I ask the Taoiseach to speak to the Minister for Health this evening to stop this unfortunate action, which is causing undue fear, stress and strain among those concerned and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100020#S00300","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1429628700,"counter":174,"content":"<p>The home help scheme has been of extraordinary benefit to thousands of people over the years, given the hours of care and attention given by the home help staff throughout the country.  I agree with Deputy Fleming that elderly people, either living alone or in numbers in houses, prefer to be in their own place.  Many can manage this with a little opportunity to have home help provided to them.  In its decision before Christmas, the Government provided an extra &euro;25 million for the fair deal scheme so people who have to go to nursing homes can do so without having to wait for a very long period.  A further &euro;75 million was allocated in recent weeks.  A portion of that was for better home care packages, which would include home help service and care, depending on the complications or challenges people face.<\/p>  <p>  The home help scheme is monitored and managed by individuals within each district.  Many home help personnel, whom I meet regularly, will say they can adjust the hours for person X to suit him or her better.<\/p><p>As the Deputy pointed out, some people might require half an hour in the morning and others might require much longer.  There is always a challenge with a population which is ageing to have adequate numbers of home help carers.  This is part of the process of trying to normalise the health system so people can stay at home for as long as is possible before they may have to go to a nursing home for more full-time care and attention.  I expect the home help managers in each district will look at the budget they have and the extent of personnel and how best to manage it in the interests of the patients.

These include the most wide-ranging reforms of the policing and justice system since the foundation of the State, as well as robust actions taken to investigate certain allegations.  The policing reforms include the establishment of a new independent policing authority; the appointment of a chair-designate for the new authority; the first-ever international open competition for the position of Garda Commissioner, which was run by the Public Appointments Service and involved the chair-designate of the new authority; a similar open competition, which is currently under way, for the positions of Deputy Commissioner in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the provision of enhanced powers to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; the passing of new legislation to protect whistleblowers; and the reform and extension of freedom of information legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The drafting of the legislation to establish the independent policing authority is nearing completion and it is intended that it will be published in early May.  I hope it can be enacted by the summer recess.  When the Bill is published, the Public Appointments Service will be requested to conduct an open process for the selection of the remaining members of the police authority and a new chief executive and support staff.  The authority will then be established in shadow form so that it can commence preparations for its formal establishment and get down to work quickly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this series of reforms, the Minister for Justice and Equality commissioned a report from an expert independent review group, chaired by Mr. Kevin Toland, into the Department of Justice and Equality.  That report was published in July 2014 and the Department is now implementing its recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  As well as implementing wide-ranging reforms, a number of independent inquiries were established by the Government to investigate serious matters of public concern.  Mr. Justice Cooke was appointed to investigate allegations that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was the subject of unlawful surveillance.

His report was published in May 2014.  He recommended that a commission of investigation be established to further investigate certain matters.  That commission, whose sole member is Judge O'Higgins, has now been established and has commenced its work.<\/p>  <p>  Potentially the most serious allegations related to taping of telephone calls in Garda stations over a period of 30 years or more, including their possible implications for a case that was then before the courts.  This is the case taken by Mr. Ian Bailey, which concluded recently.  Those allegations are now being investigated by a commission of investigation, whose sole member is Mr. Justice Fennelly.  Following the initial proposal to investigate the taping allegations, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality wrote to me recommending that the Fennelly commission should also address issues related to the retirement of the Garda Commissioner.  I agreed to that proposal.<\/p>  <p>  The terms of reference of the commission were therefore amended to include issues relating to the furnishing of a letter dated 10 March 2014 sent by the then Garda Commissioner to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality and the sequence of events leading up to the retirement of the Garda Commissioner.  In July 2014, Mr. Justice Fennelly advised me that it would not be possible to complete the full investigation by the end of last year but that it may be possible for him to submit an earlier interim report on the issues of the Commissioner's letter and his retirement, if so requested by me.<\/p><p>In response, I formally requested that Mr. Justice Fennelly submit that interim report if he believed it to be feasible and appropriate, and I informed the D&aacute;il of that request.  In November 2014, the commission submitted a detailed progress report to me and formally requested an extension of the timeframe for his full investigation.  He also indicated that he expected that his interim report on the issues of the letter and retirement would be submitted by the end of March 2015.  I agreed to the extension of the overall timeframe.  I also published the detailed progress report.<\/p> <p> In February 2015, Mr. Justice Fennelly wrote to me again stating that the commission was at an advanced stage in its preparation of a draft interim report.  He also indicated that the draft interim report would not be disseminated to affected parties, which is required under the relevant legislation, until after the proceedings in the Bailey case had been disposed of by the High Court.  That letter was also published by me.  The proceedings in the Bailey case have now been disposed of.  It continues to be entirely a matter for Mr. Justice Fennelly how he conducts his investigation and when he submits his reports.  It would be totally inappropriate for the Government to seek to direct the independent chair of the commission of investigation as to how he should prioritise or otherwise conduct his work.  I am aware of speculation about the evidence given to Mr. Justice Fennelly by me and by others.<\/p> <p> Mr. Justice Fennelly's progress report of November 2014, which has been published, outlines the procedures followed by the commission.  It states that he wrote to 20 witnesses and heard oral evidence from 15 witnesses.  He also stated in his November report that some witnesses were recalled in September, that the process was not yet complete and that he anticipated further hearings.  I have provided written and oral evidence to the commission, at its request, in respect of those matters of which I have personal knowledge.  That evidence was given in private, in accordance with the Commission of Investigation Act.<\/p> <p> The rules and procedures of the commission state that the disclosure of evidence heard or documentation produced to the commission in private is not permitted save in certain limited circumstances set out in the Act, and may constitute a criminal offence.  I understand that those rules and procedures were provided to all witnesses.  I therefore cannot comment on my own evidence or that of any other witness.  It is a matter for Mr. Justice Fennelly to finalise his report in accordance with the procedures set out in the relevant legislation.  When his completed report is received by me, I will publish it in accordance with the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100021#T01400","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429629900,"counter":192,"content":"<p>It is ironic that we are discussing this while the former Minister is in court answering questions on similar topics.  I gather the Taoiseach is saying that although he promised the Fennelly report would be published before the end of 2014, he is now saying it will be by the end of 2015 and that it is out of his hands.  The progress of the promised reform is frustrating.  It is all linked.  There is a perception that the Taoiseach is not very keen on getting to the truth.  I fear there are many things we will not discover before the next election.<\/p>  <p>  The Guerin report was set up nine months after it was initially planned.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can enlighten us on why it took so long.  The excuse used for the independent review mechanism, which was to be delivered in September and which we have still not seen after Easter - eight months later - is that there are a lot of cases.  There are always a lot of cases.  I wonder why the Taoiseach thought it could be delivered in September.<\/p>  <p>  I wonder why the GSOC changes that the Taoiseach was extolling some moments ago have not been implemented.  The legislation has not been put in place, and I find this a bit strange, given that it was passed in the House.  What was passed is a weak version of what we proposed in the Police Bill in 2013 and 2014.  The Taoiseach has probably brought in around 10% of the recommendations of Professor Dermot Walsh, an expert in the field.  There was much talk about GSOC holding the Commissioner to account, but clearly it can only do so with the permission of the Minister of the day.  This means the process remains politicised.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach boasts about having appointed an independent police authority.  The authority was to be up and running by December 2014.  Last month I asked the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, for the latest date by which the authority would be up and running, and she said she hoped to have it up and running by the end of 2015.  It beggars belief that there could be such a difference between the current estimate and the original proposal that it be up and running by the end of 2014.  In addition, the appointment of the chairman was a political appointment, no matter how independent the Taoiseach says it was.  Likewise, the Taoiseach called the appointment of the Garda Commissioner an open competition, although we have pretty good evidence that N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan was earmarked for the job long before any open competition started.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach sees an independent policing authority as a cornerstone of historic police reform.  I believe an independent policing authority would be historic, and would be absolutely crucial to remodelling our police force, which, sadly, seems to distance itself from an explicit and focused human rights agenda.  This is core to many problems in the police force.  Unless the policing authority is truly independent and completely depoliticised, many of the problems will continue.  Over the past year, the Taoiseach has had a wonderful opportunity to make things different.  Fine Gael has always prided itself on being the party of law and order, and there is an appetite among people for a different police force.  I do not believe the Government has really grasped how much needs to be changed.<\/p>  <p>  I will not go into the whistleblower elements that we have not yet mentioned.  It is clear that all is not well and that many problems remain in the force.  GSOC, which is also crucial, now has the role of the confidential recipient but not the resources to deal with it.  A garda made a complaint to GSOC in September and was told in December that the matter was being taken seriously, but he has not heard a word since, which is worrying.  I am not giving out to GSOC or suggesting it is being underhanded but that it finds it difficult to do its job.  GSOC is not being resourced as well as it needs to be for its challenging job.  It is not yet getting the sort of co-operation required to be an effective oversight and investigative body.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach will be aware of the fact that Deputy Daly was arrested two years and three months ago on a drink-driving<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font>charge.  GSOC has been dealing with it for two years and three months and we still have not received a report on it.  Here is a sample of why we have not.  GSOC wrote to Deputy Daly's solicitor, stating:<blockquote>Unfortunately, the garda&iacute; who were directly involved in the arrest have declined to voluntarily provide accounts or to cooperate with the GSOC investigation.  I have directed that accounts be obtained from the members by use of the power of compellability contained within Section 39 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended [...] Section 39 of the Act imposes on a Garda member a duty to account for any act or omission made by the member whilst on duty.  A failure answer may leave the garda member subject to disciplinary action, including dismissal.<br \/><br \/>We have also been unable to secure a meeting with the local District Officer.  I understand that he has been periodically unavailable for personal reasons.  We have been attempting to arrange this meeting [for a long time].  A number of letters and phone calls have gone unanswered since then, and consideration will now also be given to using the powers available to us under Section 39 of the Act to secure the cooperation which I consider to be necessary.  <br \/><br \/>We have also experienced delay on the part of the garda authorities in responding to general documentation requests. There is a protocol between GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to how such requests are to be made and fulfilled.  Under the agreement, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has undertaken that <i>&quot;The information requested by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission will be made available as soon as practicable and in any event the information will be provided within 30 days&quot;. <\/i>Unfortunately, this undertaking has not been met. <br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>I am also aware that the garda authorities appointed a Superintendent to carry out some level of internal enquiry as to the accessing of PULSE following the arrest of Deputy Daly.  Thirty-three days have elapsed since I requested the identity of this Superintendent, and access to documents obtained by him\/her.  At time of writing, I am still unaware as to the identity of the Superintendent and do not know what level of enquiry he or she has conducted, the degree to which it might overlap the GSOC Investigation and I am still unaware as to whether the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is carrying out an investigation into any aspect of the arrest and the subsequent press coverage of same. This has the potential to impact adversely on the GSOC investigation.<br \/><br \/>At present, there are a still number of items which the garda authorities are refusing to supply to GSOC.  Further representations are being escalated to senior garda&iacute; in accordance with the protocols between GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br \/><br \/>These delays on the part of the garda authorities have inevitably and regrettably slowed the progress of the GSOC investigation.  Further efforts will be made by GSOC to secure the requested material, and I will keep you apprised of any developments.<\/blockquote>The Taoiseach will agree that this is an unsatisfactory situation, given that it has taken two years and three months and there is still no conclusion to this investigation, which one would not imagine would require unbelievable research by a great number of personnel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100022#U00200","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429630500,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I agree that the situation would be far better if this matter were cleared up once and for all.  I recall the issue surrounding Deputy Daly and the clarification about that.  Perhaps the Deputy might be good enough to give me a copy of the document he read into the record and I will have that communicated to the Minister for Justice and Equality immediately.  I am sure the Garda Commissioner herself would want to see that this matter is concluded in so far as the issues Deputy Wallace has raised are concerned.<\/p>  <p>  I took a few words from what the Deputy said.  He indicated that we are more or less saying that commissions of investigation are out of our hands.  They are, and it is not that we are just saying that now.  We have always said that.  Once the Cabinet approves terms of reference and they are debated and agreed by the House, or voted on by the House, the commission of investigation becomes the sole responsibility of the person in charge of it.  That is not a new issue, it has always been the case, and it is perfectly clear and distinct from any responsibilities in the Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  The changes in the justice system that were referred to are the most extensive since the foundation of the State.  The appointment of an independent policing authority speaks for itself.  That is now in the process of becoming a formal entity, which is a clear decision of Government, and it puts the justice system and the Garda in a very different space from what they have occupied since 1922.  I am not sure what the Deputy means when he says there seems to be a failure to get at the truth.  If he wants to clarify that in a supplementary question, I would be happy to listen to him.  What is it that he feels we are not looking at?  Is he suggesting that there is something here which is deliberately not being analysed or investigated?<\/p>  <p>  I cannot accept his statement that there is pretty good evidence that the current Garda Commissioner was earmarked for the job.  This was an open competition, both nationally and internationally, with a very independent interview process.  That was also by decision of the Government.  Garda Commissioner O'Sullivan came through that process very strongly, from the applications to the short list to acceptance by the Government.  That included the shadow chairperson of the policing authority.  The independent policing authority is independent.  It puts the situation in a very different light from before.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy said that people still do not seem to have grasped how much it needs to be changed.  However, the changes that have occurred or are in the process of occurring include the establishment of an independent policing authority; the appointment of a chairman designate; the international open competition for the Garda Commissioner; a similar open competition, which is now under way, for the appointment of Deputy Garda Commissioners; the provision of enhanced powers under GSOC; the passing of new legislation both in respect of freedom of information and of whistleblowers; and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Act 2015, relevant to GSOC, which was enacted in March 2015 and provides for the strengthening of the powers and the functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman's Commission in respect of complaints, procedures and investigations.  These provisions will commence very shortly.  The process of appointing the Garda Commissioner was by open, international competition, and the same applies in respect of the two current vacancies at deputy commissioner level.  The policing authority Bill was published last November.  It was referred to the Oireachtas committee for pre-legislative scrutiny, as is now the norm.  The text of that Bill will be published by the Government early in May.  It is also intended to advertise for the remaining members of the authority in early May, through the Public Appointments Service, and to appoint a chief executive.  That is a very significant change from the process that used to apply.  If the Deputy wants to discuss his comments about pretty good evidence and a perception that there is a reluctance to get at the truth, I would be happy to respond to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100023#V00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1429630500,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Let us get back to the actual subject of the six questions, namely, the Fennelly commission.  The Taoiseach took us on a tour of the entire justice portfolio in his opening reply.  To set the scene again, the reason I tabled three of these questions on the extended time requested and allowed for the Fennelly report and asking the Taoiseach whether he would make a statement on the matter is that the Taoiseach has essentially refused to answer any specific questions about the commission as it is still reporting.  We must always remember that this relates to a meeting held on Monday, 24 March 2014, which the Taoiseach attended, as well as two Secretaries General, and over a year later we still do not know what were the instructions to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>In advance of the establishment of the Fennelly commission, the Taoiseach refused to give a proper, comprehensive account of what happened, and we only learned a few days after the event that he had sent the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  There has been a fundamental lack of transparency regarding a very serious issue, namely, the forced resignation or, as I said at the time, the sacking, of a Garda Commissioner, or whatever one wants to call it.  The sequence of events was blurred.  We would never have needed Fennelly to investigate it had the Taoiseach been forthcoming in the House and fully transparent about all that took place.  The Garda Commissioner resigned the morning after the meeting that was held in the Department of the Taoiseach.  We do not know what was discussed or what directions were given to Mr. Purcell before he visited the home of the then Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan.  No minutes of the meeting were kept.  The former Secretary General could not attend the justice committee or answer questions there because he was going before the Fennelly commission.  Although we talk about the primacy of the House, in this case the House was sidelined.<br\/><br\/>When the Taoiseach was asked in a very straightforward way whether he had been called back before the Fennelly commission, he gave a long rigmarole about him not being legally allowed to say whether he had been called back and that it would be an offence to do so.  The solicitor of the commission has confirmed that it would not be an offence and was unable to cite any legislation which would make it an offence for witnesses to confirm their attendance.  However, the Taoiseach continued to publicly mislead everybody by saying it would be an offence to confirm his attendance.  It would have been no big deal to have said he had attended the commission a second time.  In the Taoiseach's reply, could he confirm whether he was called back a second time by the Fennelly commission?<br\/><br\/>Overall, there has been an unhealthy unwillingness on the part of the Taoiseach to be up front and straight about what happened during the days leading up to the resignation of the former Garda Commissioner.  The truth cannot harm the inquiry.  As the then T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, said, the public is entitled to know the full facts surrounding the resignation of the Garda Commissioner.  The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has resigned.  The Secretary General of the Department has been transferred to another Department.  Serious questions remain unanswered.  Although the Taoiseach could have answered all the questions in the D&aacute;il, he asked a retired Supreme Court judge to investigate the matter.  The Taoiseach trotted out the line that the committee asked him to do it and he agreed.  I do not buy it.  This has been deliberately put on the long finger to get him out of a hole.  It flies in the face of all the talk about how &quot;Paddy likes to know&quot; and transparency which the Taoiseach said before he came into government and was elected Taoiseach.  A year and three months later the Taoiseach cannot come here and give us a straight narrative and tell it as it is.  He could have done it at the time.<br\/><br\/>The terms of reference of the commission state include:<blockquote>(n) to investigate and report on the furnishing to the Minister of a letter dated 10 March 2014 sent by the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality;<br \/><br \/>(o) to investigate and report on the sequence of events leading up to the retirement of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan.<\/blockquote>The Taoiseach and the Department of Justice and Equality could have covered both of the issues.  It did not require the appointment of Mr. Justice Fennelly.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach is saying the timeframe is entirely a matter for the judge.  No inquiry goes on forever.  I have a very straightforward question, which is contained in Deputy Wallace's question.  Will we see that module of the report before the next general election?  Does the Taoiseach intend that it will go on forever and that no time limits will be set for the conclusion of the report?  The Taoiseach would agree that would be very unsatisfactory.  The D&aacute;il and the public have a right to know.  I remember the meeting I had with the Taoiseach at the time, at which Deputy Adams was present, when the Taoiseach talked about the possible implications.  The Government put out a story that court cases and convictions would be in jeopardy, which was a fog.  Let us look back at the three or four days around the establishment of the Fennelly inquiry and ask some hard questions about what was happening in the Government.  The Labour Party was not told anything.  The former Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, was very clear that the Cabinet was not alerted to anything about the possible retirement of the Garda Commissioner.  The Cabinet was not told about the then Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality going to the then Garda Commissioner's house.  The world was going to collapse, judicially speaking.  The safety of convictions was going to be in jeopardy due to the very strong, earth-shattering potential implications of the taping of phone calls in Garda stations.  This was all trotted out.<br\/><br\/>The Bailey case has come and gone and the world has not collapsed.  There were dark mutterings around the tapes related to that case and the repercussions if we showed certain things.  There was much hype, much of it inspired by the Taoiseach.  He established the inquiry on phone calls very quickly.  Normally, for example in the Guerin inquiry, there is a scoping study to assess the situation before a full political investigation is established.  It did not happen on this occasion.  I grant that the Department of Justice and Equality was in a state of flux at the time and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, had one crisis after another and there were many controversies.  The Taoiseach made up his mind and moved very quickly on the Sunday to establish the inquiry.  He added on the piece about the Garda Commissioner and the letter he had sent to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality afterwards and he claimed cover from the justice committee as a rationale for doing so, which I do not buy for one moment.  There comes a time, especially 15 months on, to stop hiding about this.  The Taoiseach and three or four other people know what happened.  Is it too much to ask for the public and the House to be told the truth?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100023#V00300","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429631100,"counter":197,"content":"<p>The Deputy has had a long time to speak.

The commission of investigation under Mr. Justice Fennelly faces an enormous challenge.<\/p><p> I do not accept the Deputy's assertion in respect of the forced resignation of anybody.  The Garda Commissioner is a very important position in the Constitution, and there is a process if a Government has a wish to force the retirement of a Garda Commissioner.  The Deputy knows that.

That is now concluded, and a spokesperson has said it is moving on.<\/p><p>In his letter on 17 February last, Mr. Justice Fennelly said:<blockquote>The Commission is at an advanced stage in its preparation of a draft interim report on these matters.  In accordance with Section 34 of the Act, before the report is submitted to you as specified Minister, copies of the draft or relevant extracts thereof must be submitted to any person who is identified in or identifiable from it, in order that he or she may have the opportunity to submit statements to the Commission or applications to Court, if it is alleged that the Commission has not observed fair procedures.<br \/><br \/>The Commission has at all times been mindful of the High Court proceedings currently underway involving Mr. Ian Bailey and Ms Catherine Jules Thomas who are suing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Minister for Justice and Equality and others for false imprisonment, harassment and related claims arising out of the investigation of the murder in 1996 of Madame Sophie Toscan du Plantier.  Although the Bailey and Thomas cases are not expressly mentioned in sub-paragraphs (n) and (o) of the Commission's terms of reference, they are undoubtedly related to some extent with the events that culminated in the retirement of the Commissioner.  Mention of matters relating to the Bailey and Thomas cases is therefore unavoidable in the draft report concerning sub-paragraphs (n) and (o).<br \/><br \/>The Commission is of the view that it would not be appropriate to submit any parts of the draft interim report to named persons whilst the High Court proceedings are at hearing.  That hearing has taken much longer than had been originally estimated.  The Commission is not in a position to say how much longer it [the Bailey case] will take.  Accordingly, the Commission wishes to inform you as the specified Minister that the Interim Report on Terms of Reference 1(n) and (o) will not be disseminated to affected parties until after the Bailey proceedings currently at hearing have been disposed of by the High Court. [As the Deputy is aware, that is now concluded.]<br \/><br \/>The timeline anticipated by the Commission in its first Interim Report must be adjusted accordingly.<br \/><br \/>The broader question of whether it will ultimately prove feasible to report on 1(n) and (o) in isolation from the other Terms of Reference remains under consideration as work on the draft Interim Report progresses.<br \/><br \/>The Commission will keep you informed of any decisions made in this regard.<\/blockquote>The letter is signed by the sole member of the commission, Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly.  That letter of 17 February sets out the reasons, the background and the progress being made, as well as the fact that he will inform me in due course of progress or decisions made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100025#X02400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1429631700,"counter":224,"content":"<p>That is what I asked the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100025#X02500","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1429631700,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I must call Deputy Adams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100025#X02600","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1429631700,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I asked a question and he did not answer.

One is the opportunity that was presented as a result of revelations about misconduct in the administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and so forth.  It was an opportunity to introduce a police service that is accountable, lives up to the sacrifice and public service of the vast majority of the members of that service and removes it from the political patronage and control which was normal here for a long time.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in argued very strongly for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be Pattenised - for the Patten commission's approach to be adopted in relation to all of these matters.  The hesitant, slow and protracted way in which the Government has gone about this has undermined that opportunity.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to understand that there are issues of public confidence involved here.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach is at the centre of the second issue I would like to raise.  The difficulty is that the Fennelly commission has to send its report to him.  The former Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan resigned, retired or was sacked over a year ago, on 25 March 2014.  Sources close to the former Commissioner are reported in the media as saying he was left with no option and was forced out of his job, in effect, after being visited on the night of 14 March 2014 by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Brian Purcell.  We know that Mr. Purcell was sent by the Taoiseach to meet the Garda Commissioner at that time.<\/p> <p> I want to put one issue to the Taoiseach very clearly.  There have been countless media reports, which might be totally untrue and unfounded, that the Taoiseach was recalled by the commission to give evidence.  He has refused to comment on this.  He has chosen to hide behind the claim that to answer this question would be an offence, but that is patently not true.  He has already said that he went and gave evidence to the commission.  I have confirmed that I spoke to the commissioner.  N&iacute;l rud san Acht a chuireann cosc ar an Taoiseach a r&aacute; an raibh s&eacute; mar finn&eacute; agus ar ghlaodh ar ais &eacute;.  Nothing in the Act prevents the Taoiseach from saying he was called back.  What is the problem with being called back?  This is another issue of public confidence.  By refusing to give a simple confirmation, the Taoiseach ends up almost transfixed by this issue.  I ask him to confirm if he was called back, or indeed if he was not.  How many times has he been called to give evidence?  It is not a big issue.<\/p> <p> When the Taoiseach spoke about this on a few occasions, he put it in a sort of negative way.  I was listening to what he said.  He said the commission could not send on its interim report until after the Bailey case.  In fact, my recollection is that the commission was to send its interim report after the Bailey case to the Taoiseach, to Deputy Alan Shatter, to the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and so on.  That has not happened.  Unless I have misheard him, the Taoiseach has not said he will publish the draft report when he receives it.  We do not know when he is going to receive it.  I ask him to clear that up.  If he has already answered that question, I apologise for my ignorance.  It would be useful to publish the draft report and give the D&aacute;il an opportunity to debate this issue.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach has said that he cannot set a timetable and that any attempt to raise a question about this aspect of the matter would in some way impugn the integrity of the sole member or of the commission.  That is not the case.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality recommended that the modules dealing with the departure of the former Garda Commissioner, the letter he sent to the Department of Justice and Equality and the investigation of other elements of this case should have a timetable.  The terms of reference ignored that recommendation, however, by setting it to one side.  In other words, the Fennelly commission is in effect open-ended.  It can go on forever.  That is not in the Taoiseach's interests as someone who is doing his best or in the interests of the Government.  More particularly, it is not in the interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or in the interests of public confidence in that service.<\/p> <p> Section 6 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 provides that \"the power to set a commission's terms of reference includes the power to amend, at any time before the submission of the commission's final report, those terms with the consent or at the request of the commission for the purpose of clarifying, limiting or extending the scope of its investigation.\"  Therefore, it is not too late to amend the terms of reference and to set a fixed timeframe.  Will the Taoiseach consider amending the terms of reference to set a clear timeframe for the completion of the Fennelly commission of investigation?<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach has nine minutes and 50 seconds.  He can talk the clock down.  He can waffle and go through all of this, or he can answer in a few brief remarks the two questions I have put to him.  First, was he recalled to the commission?  Second, will he consider putting in place a clear timeframe, as he is permitted to do under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004?  By answering these two straightforward and simple questions, he can clear up these issues, allow the work of the Government and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to proceed and, in particular, uphold public confidence in the handling of this issue by Taoiseach and his Government.  I refer particularly to the work being done by the people who are out there on the beat protecting citizens and keeping public order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100025#X04300","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429632300,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I could certainly turn that speech back on your good self.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100026#Y00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1429632300,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Of course you could.

The Government decided to establish an independent policing authority and to have a Garda Commissioner appointed on foot of a public advertisement by means of international competition and selection.  This process, which is also being used for the deputy commissioners, differs significantly from the process that had been applied since the foundation of the State in regard to the appointments made.  I disagree entirely with the Deputy's suggestion that the Government has undermined that opportunity.  The Government considered the process that was under way in Northern Ireland when Mr. Patten was put in charge of dealing with the structure and the propositions for that.  We decided there was a different requirement here.  The fundamental issue in so far as the Garda is concerned is that we now have an independent policing authority, enhanced powers for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, an independent process of selection of and reporting by the Garda Commissioner and independent processes for the deputy commissioners.

I have already given my view on this.  I received correspondence from the commission in the same way as other people did and I responded to that in writing and in evidence to the commission.  I am not going further than that.  When the commission's final report is received by me, it will be published by me as the sponsoring Minister in accordance with the law.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy said it was not a big issue but he started off by saying that it was a big issue.  He made the point that this could not have been dealt with until after the Bailey case.  That decision was made clearly by Justice Fennelly and not by anybody else.  He made that decision and he is in sole control of this commission of investigation.  <\/p>  <p>  People say they want this dealt with in this House or by an Oireachtas committee or that they want an independent investigation but when there is an independent commission of investigation, they want it to be dealt with their way.  The terms of reference were debated, approved and, indeed, amended by the House.  A unanimous request was made, and a letter was sent to me, by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which Deputy Martin called an \"add-on\", asking that the terms of reference be amended so that these two elements would be investigated by the commission of investigation.  I agreed with that request and I also made the point that I, no more than the committee or anybody else, was not in a position to dictate to the sole member but that if it were possible for him to bring forward an interim report on these two matters at an earlier date, he should do so if he considered it appropriate and relevant.  The commission's terms were amended to take into account the formal unanimous request by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and that was debated in the House. <\/p>  <p>  I cannot indicate to the Deputy when I expect to receive the final report because Justice Fennelly said in his letter that he did not propose to send sections of the interim report to persons who were spoken to by the commission until such time as the Bailey case was disposed of.  It has now been disposed of and, as I said to Deputy Martin, a spokesperson from the commission said it was proceeding with the drafting of the interim report.  I assume the process in terms of commissions of investigation will be rigorously applied by the judge.  As I said to Deputies, when the report is received by me, I will publish it.  Just because I happen to be the sponsoring Minister of this commission of investigation does not allow for that not to happen.  When Justice Fennelly submits his final report, I will publish it.

Page 4 of the programme for Government states: \"A system of universal health insurance will be introduced by 2016, with the legislative and organisational groundwork for the system complete within this Government's term of office.\"  It is now April 2015.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that legislative promise will not now be achieved and that the commitments will not be realised within the Government's term of office?  Can he further confirm that universal health insurance, with a public or private insurer, will be compulsory with insurance payments related to ability to pay?  Will that happen between now and the general election?<\/p>  <p>  When can we expect the universal primary care Bill?  Does the Taoiseach envisage it coming into being within the next 12 months?  When can we expect the integrated care agency to be established?  I have been pursuing this for quite some time and getting very little in the form of confirmation.  It is more than four years since the programme for Government was published.  It stated that investment in the supply of more and better care for older people in the community and residential sectors will be a priority of the Government.  What has actually happened in the past three to four years are reductions.  There have been reductions in fair deal allocations and in the number of home helps, many of whom only get half an hour or 40 minutes with the people they are looking after.  We were told we would get more home care packages but we are getting fewer.  We were told there would be a review of the fair deal scheme and we have asked time and again on the Order of Business for the publication of that review, or a timeline for its publication, only to be stalled every time.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach would indicate definitively when we can expect the review.<\/p>  <p>  On primary care, there remains a fundamental issue in terms of the extension of the medical card and access to primary care without fees for those who are chronically ill or have long-term illnesses.  The programme for Government stated that access to primary care without fees would be extended in the first year to claimants of free drugs under the long-term illness scheme.  It also stated that access to primary care without fees would be extended in the second year to claimants of free drugs under the high-tech drugs scheme and that access to subsidised care would be extended to all in the next phase, while access to care without fees would be extended to all in the final phase.<\/p><p>About four or five pages in the programme for Government are devoted to health.  I have asked the Taoiseach on numerous occasions when we can expect all the proposals contained in this document to be realised.  I have received long letters in response and the over-riding conclusion is that very little of it will be implemented before this Government's term ends.  Would the Taoiseach accept that this is a sham, that the section pertaining to health in the programme for Government is completely illusory and that if someone came down from Mars, read it and compared it to the reality over the past five years, they would be left scratching their head?  I have not even gone into bioethics.  It is said that assisted human reproduction, stem cell research, post-mortem procedures, organ retention and organ donation and an opt-out system will be legislated for but none of this will happen.  The patient safety authority is not happening.  There is an obligation to at least commit to ditching these five or six pages because they are completely illusory and are misleading the public in terms of the rhetoric and the reality.  Could the Taoiseach answer in terms of the specifics of the legislation about which I asked?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100027#Z01700","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429633500,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Universal health insurance will not be introduced in the lifetime of this Government.  On taking office, the Minister for Health reflected very carefully on the timeframes set out for health reform.  He pointed out last July that he determined that while good progress had been made in implementing health reform, the original timeframe for full implementation of universal health insurance was too ambitious.  He pointed out that notwithstanding this, the Government remains committed to its major programme of health reform and plans to continue to press ahead with those main foundations for universal health care.  This include the phased extension of GP care without fees; implementing a number of key financial reforms, including activity-based funding; the establishment of hospital groups; and improved chronic care management.  Hospital groups, primary care centres and the GP card system for children aged under six and people aged over 70 are part of the foundation necessary for universal health insurance in addition to the requirement for people to take out private health insurance based on age limits.  This is all under way.  The Government recently allocated &euro;75 million for home care packages and the fair deal scheme in order to reduce the waiting list from 18 weeks to approximately five weeks.  This seems to be working well.  Obviously, we hope this is managed in the best interests of the patients.<\/p>  <p>  The integrated care agency is part of the Government's commitment to reform of the health service.  Future Health referred to the agency as the health care commissioning agency and this agency will be charged with driving performance improvement in health services through value-based purchasing.  The Minister is reviewing how best to develop the structure that is required to replace the HSE - I know Deputy Martin's party now has a different view - including the question of a health care commissioning agency.  Future Health set the broad direction of travel for reforming the health system and made it clear that an incremental, phased approach to implementation was taking place.  This is just one of number of structural changes envisaged under Future Health.  Others include hospital groups, community health care organisations, a health care pricing office and the commencement of activity-based funding.  The Minister intends to build on these as part of the wider structural reform agenda.  However, the complexity and scale of the issues to be addressed require detailed preparatory policy work to provide the basis for legislative proposals.  The next incremental step in that process will be to develop policy on a health care commissioning model in an Irish context.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the review of home care, the HSE is progressing a range of measures to improve the position overall.  Providers are monitored through service-level agreements with the HSE.  They are supervised through local and regular operational meetings and the review of care plans for individual patients.  The HSE is undertaking a full review of home care services with a view to improving services generally.  This includes national quality guidelines, which will apply to all home support services, including those procured by the HSE from external providers.  <\/p>  <p>  If I have left anything out, I will respond to Deputy Martin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100028#AA00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1429633500,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Could the Taoiseach tell the D&aacute;il when the Government will move the writ for the Carlow-Kilkenny by-election?  There is a vacancy there.  The previous Government was forced by Deputy Pearse Doherty's High Court action to call by-elections within six months so I would like to know when the people of that constituency will have the opportunity to elect a Deputy to represent them.<\/p>  <p>  My other questions concern the working group on Seanad reform, the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015 and the health (transport support) Bill.  Mar is eol don Leas-Cheann Comhairle, an tseachtain seo caite d'fhoilsigh an gr&uacute;pa oibre maidir le athch&oacute;iri&uacute; an tSeanaid a thuarasc&aacute;il.  This report falls far short of what Sinn F&eacute;in and others believe is needed to make the Seanad a genuinely democratic and representative elected Chamber mostly because of the restricted terms of reference it was given.  The fact that the Taoiseach retains the privilege of appointing 11 nominees is wrong.  Other issues include the failure to deal with university representation, gender equality or the representation of ethnic groups, particularly the Traveller community.  The numbers to be elected by universal suffrage are too small.  Having said all that, when will the D&aacute;il have the opportunity to debate this report and when does the Taoiseach expect the Government to produce legislation? <\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; ceist eile agam faoi Acht at&aacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach, namely, the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015.  We are told that this Bill is about making school enrolment more structured, fair and transparent.  It also provides that a school will not discriminate on the basis of religion but if I understand it properly, it then goes on to provide for discrimination by allowing schools to refuse to admit certain children in order to maintain the ethos of the school so this means a school can still discriminate based on religion or faith.  The Minister for Education and Skills has also said that she favours allowing schools to admit 10% of pupils if their parents are past pupils.  Clearly, this also discriminates against children who do not have that distinction.  What is the Taoiseach's view of this and has the Government set a date for the Second Stage reading of this Bill?<\/p>  <p>  I have raised the next issue many times with the Taoiseach.  I have noticed over the past few months that the Government is almost ticking boxes with regard to issues that have been raised here.  These are very important issues that do not cost an awful lot of money.  It is almost as if the Government is trying to close down these issues of discontent as it prepares for the general election.  The health (transport support) Bill is a major injustice.  In 2013, the Government closed the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grant, affecting 5,000 citizens and their families.<\/p><p>I have raised this with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions and he has acknowledged that what is happening is wrong.  The excuse given by the Minister at the time was that the Government could not afford to keep the scheme open.  It is interesting that this was brought to the attention of the D&aacute;il because it was ruled to be in breach of equality laws.  We were told that the issue would be resolved by the health (transport support) Bill.  Two years later, there has been no progress.  Two years later, these people are still being denied this necessary grant.  According to the legislative programme, it is not possible to indicate when this Bill will be published.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will clarify for the House when the health (transport support) Bill will be published.  Address of this issue would not cost the Government or taxpayer a great deal of money but would alleviate great difficulties for these citizens and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100028#AA00300","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429634100,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I have answered this question previously for the Deputy.  I cannot give him a specific date in regard to publication of that Bill.  It is included in the legislative programme for this year, under legislation relating to the Department of Health.

No date for the taking of that legislation in the House has yet been agreed.  It is a matter for the Whips to agree on a time for debate of that Bill in the D&aacute;il.

The group comprises members nominated by party leaders to represent their parties.  The people made their decision in respect of the retention of the Seanad.  The terms of reference of the group include an examination of the electoral system and the work programme that might be possible for the Seanad, but within constitutional parameters so as not to require a further referendum.  The people decided, albeit by a narrow majority, to retain the Seanad.  The question of the number of Members to be appointed to the Seanad by the Taoiseach of the day is enshrined in the Constitution.  As such, no change in that regard can be made without a referendum.  The group was asked to work within the constitutional parameters.

That is separate from the question of bankruptcy being reduced from three years to one.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McGuinness will be aware that when the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, brought the Bill through the House to reduce it from 12 years to three, there was no great division on whether it should be three or one.<\/p><p>However, I would caution that Deputy Penrose's Bill was presented to the House and was not objected to, and I was in the House.  The information available to me is that where bankruptcy applies, 70% of cases end up with repossessions of the house, which is not what the Government is about or what anyone wants to see.<\/p> <p> In addition to that, I believe the Oireachtas committee should certainly look at this question.  We should take into account all the small and medium-sized enterprises and the credit unions which are owed money.  They would lose and the taxpayer would have to pay for all of that.  It is not as simple as it seems to say that a reduction from three years to one year is a panacea for all these issues.  The evidence is that in bankruptcies, repossessions occur in 70% of cases.  How many people running small businesses in Kilkenny, Cork or Clare or how many credit unions throughout the country which are owed money would lose out completely if we had a system whereby a debtor could decide that he or she is getting out and declaring bankruptcy?  Those people would lose out.  It might be an issue for the committee to have some hearings on this and to get first-hand evidence of what might happen.  I am sure people do not want to get into a situation where unintended consequences mean that more and more people could be caught by having this apply.  I see certain people applying pressure now that this Bill be introduced automatically.  A well-known and well-publicised case is currently being considered.  I understand many millions are owed in that case.  If bankruptcy applies, then clearly there are serious losses on that scale.  It is not an answer to everyone's problem.  Perhaps the Oireachtas committee could do a very useful exercise here in looking at those issues, for example, in respect of small and medium-sized enterprises, credit unions and smaller contractors which are owed money but which will not get it if there is a simplicity factor whereby a debtor can decide to become bankrupt and say \"Tally-ho\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100030#CC04900","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429635300,"counter":362,"content":"<p>Bankruptcy is bankruptcy, just as when a person is dead, he is dead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100031#DD00200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1429635300,"counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100031#DD00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Airport Promotion","time":1429635300,"counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100031#DD00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1429635300,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his attendance.

Aer Lingus and Ryanair have announced the cancellation of routes on top of a reduction of further flights to continental Europe, including the ending of the Cork to Lisbon, Cork to Nice and Cork to Brussels routes.<\/p>  <p>  Passenger numbers are now at 2 million.  We cannot blame it exclusively on the downturn and we cannot blame it on the motorway or the associated improvements, as some do - I understand the Minister's suggested this recently.  Shannon Airport passenger numbers have gone up 18.7% and those in Dublin have gone up by 6.5%.  I believe we can trace this back to the decision in 2012.  I am certain Cork Airport is not operating on a level playing pitch.<\/p>  <p>  The reconstitution of Shannon Airport under a separate State company with Shannon Development and the rental revenues that flow from Shannon Development have put Shannon in a strong competitive position.  Good luck to Shannon in that regard.  Its debt burden has also been written off to the tune of &euro;100 million.  Essentially, it is in a position to offer far better prices to airlines than Cork Airport.  This is not something I am saying; officials of the Dublin Airport Authority are saying it.  In fact, one thing that concerned me when I met DAA officials was that they were reluctant to go public because they were fearful of the political repercussions.  The DAA seems to have been rather muted until relatively recently on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Certain legislation was brought in at the time.  The Government abolished the Cork Airport Authority, although the legislation allows for it to be re-established.  Essentially, it is part of the DAA structure now.  It is clear that Cork Airport lacks a strong independent advocate and is very much subservient to the DAA's diktat.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the Booz report and the legislation, Cork Airport was never really given any new lease of life by the Government and it is at a severe disadvantage now.  The Government directly intervened elsewhere.  I have no doubt the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was influential in terms of the Shannon situation.  Shannon Airport can offer deals to Ryanair that Cork Airport cannot.  That is fine except it does not add any value to the country.  That is the bottom line.  Approximately 100,000 passengers were going through Cork and they are now going to Shannon because of the deals that can be offered.  That is what DAA officials are saying behind the scenes.  They are clear and straightforward about it.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the pitch must be levelled somehow in terms of facilitating growth in Cork.  There is no way that the airport can prevent the diversion of services as a result of the incentive pricing that is going on.  In particular, Ryanair, as a low-cost airline, has diverted a good deal of its traffic to the airport down the road.  There is no doubt that substantial discounts, success fees and marketing payments are all factors in that change.  I believe it is a race-to-the-bottom model and one the Government should reflect on and change tack in terms of ensuring a feasible long-term future for Cork Airport.<\/p>  <p>  One step I recommend to the Minister is for the Cork Airport board to be re-established.  At least that would allow for a strong board that could advocate for Cork Airport, in particular.  That would mitigate the sense, which is now very strong in the region, that certain issues are being muted because of the DAA's relationship with the Department and its political masters, that DAA officials are not allowed to raise awkward questions and that they do not want to publicly articulate awkward questions.<\/p>  <p>  A route development fund is essential for Cork Airport, or else a regional support fund for tourism activities in the region.  Something has to happen to redress the current imbalance between the three airports.  Route development funds have been successful in the past in developing regional airports and increasing connectivity elsewhere, including Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and northern England.  The Government should seriously consider ways and means of redressing this otherwise the situation will continue to decline.  It is not sustainable in the current framework that operates throughout the three State airports.  A route development fund and an independent authority should be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100031#DD00500","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1429635300,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin for raising this matter.  I am very much aware of the importance of this matter.  The interest he has is shared with his constituency colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, Deputy Jerry Buttimer and Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch.<\/p>  <p>  Before I comment on the importance of Cork Airport and our plans for it, I emphasise that the market for air services in the European Union is fully liberalised.  Any European registered airline is free to operate any service between any two points in the European Union.  It is, therefore, a matter for airlines, including Aer Lingus Regional or Stobart Air, to decide what routes they service based on their commercial judgments.<\/p><p>I have no involvement in those decisions.  My understanding is that while Stobart will be reducing frequency on some routes, it is also increasing capacity on others or resuming summer services, as all airlines do over the year, depending on seasonality and passenger demand.  In particular, the airline will recommence its twice-weekly summer services to Jersey and Rennes from Cork in early June.<\/p> <p> The Government is very conscious of the importance of Cork Airport.  It is the second largest airport in Ireland and vital for business and tourism in the Cork region.  With all this focus on and discussion about declining passenger numbers, let us not forget that it still had more than 2.1 million passengers last year, has 42 scheduled routes and offers passengers excellent connectivity into three major European hub airports.  The airport has excellent passenger facilities and provides award-winning customer services.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding all of that, I am also very aware of, and concerned about, the continuing decline in passenger numbers at the airport.  Since becoming Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have met with all the stakeholders in regard to Cork Airport on a number of occasions and have engaged extensively with Government bodies in the matter.  The DAA and Cork Airport management are working hard to stabilise passenger numbers and restore Cork Airport to growth in the short to medium term.  The DAA is actively engaged with existing airline customers, including Stobart, and potential new entrants to help expand traffic at the airport and generate new services.  It is crucial that existing and new services are, therefore, supported by the people in Cork and the wider catchment area to ensure their sustainability.<\/p> <p> I believe there are also opportunities to increase the number of incoming tourists in the Cork region, particularly in view of the fact that only 37% of Cork Airport's passengers are inbound, which is quite low by international standards.  I have engaged with Tourism Ireland, which has undertaken significant co-operative marketing activity with carriers serving Cork Airport to promote flights to Cork and boost travel to the wider regions.  East Cork will also be promoted as part of the new tourism proposition for the south and east of Ireland, Ireland's Ancient East.  Cork city and airport now have the opportunity to act as a gateway to both Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way.<\/p> <p> Ultimately, creating new services and growing inbound tourism depends not just on the availability of competitive access but also on ensuring that potential visitors have a reason to visit.  I urge everybody to work together to develop these products in the Munster region, not just around the airport.  The stakeholders, along with the airport and the tourism agencies, will then be better able to pursue every opportunity to develop and highlight those products.  It is only by working together that the objective of ensuring a sustainable airport that is able to grow in the future can be achieved for the benefit of the region, the city and the county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100031#DD00600","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429635900,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I am very disappointed with the Minister's response because it is a holding response and does not deal with the core issue.  There are three State airports, and one need only look at the structure to see the issue.  Cork Airport is at a competitive disadvantage because of the way the Government has structured the three airports in terms of governance and supports to the respective airports.  Essentially, there was a reorganisation of Shannon Airport, with Shannon Development, the rental revenues and all of that, but there is no corresponding structure for Cork Airport or any other supporting mechanism in terms of where it stands within the DAA group.  That is a fundamental issue with regard to its capacity to offer competitive rates to airlines.<\/p>  <p>  The other key issue is industry.  The region is home to some of the biggest names in global technology, from EMC to Apple, and the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry.  The Minister knows that airline connectivity is a very important factor in terms of the capacity to bring in foreign direct investment.  There is huge concern about the continuing decline of the airport's passenger numbers.  It is a fine airport which is number one in the world in terms of its customer relations - it has received awards in that regard.  However, all of this will have an impact on FDI eventually if we do not have that international and global connectivity.  That is a big issue of concern for people in the region, particularly those in industry and business.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important in the context of the country's spatial planning.  Everyone is talking about the two-tier economic recovery in the sense that everything is happening in the Dublin region and very little outside it.  Our second largest airport is now being essentially undermined and downgraded because of the structures that have been put in place, inadvertently or otherwise - I do not know which.  The Minister from Cork, Deputy Coveney, must have been asleep at the table or been considerably out-muscled by other Ministers in this regard, but the outcomes are clear in terms of what is happening on the ground.  The airline charges offered by Cork Airport are quite competitive across the European landscape, and I have no difficulty with the position of Shannon and Dublin airports, but when we see the other airport going in the opposite direction, surely that raises alarm bells in the Department and with the Minister which call for action.

If I looked at the different matters the Deputy has raised, I would point to the fact that Tourism Ireland, as I said in my reply, is working with Cork Airport to land routes and that new routes have recently been landed at the airport.  I met with the management of Cork Airport only weeks ago to review with them the efforts they have made to bring in new routes and bring new access to the airport.<\/p>  <p>  I have already acknowledged to the Deputy, as I have to many of his colleagues within the region, that I am concerned about the trend that is evident there.  I want to see Cork Airport increase its passenger numbers in the future for reasons of supporting investment in the region and supporting tourism in the area and beyond.  I point to the support we have given it in the recent past.  We have now launched a new proposition, Ireland's Ancient East, to respond to some of the points that have been made within the Deputy's county regarding the need to better support different tourism assets within the area.  A crucial reason for this is the need to find ways to generate more demand within that region, which in turn will support this airport.  In terms of specific supports that I and State agencies are providing to the airport, I have engaged directly with the management of Cork Airport and Tourism Ireland is working directly with them to support their efforts to bring in new routes in what I know is a competitive environment.

I am aware that he spoke on this topic in the past week or so and I very much welcome his commitment to ensuring that the school completion programme is maintained.  Having said that, it is a reality that the co-ordinators of these programmes have received no certainty or clarity from Tusla or the Minister.  They have not been informed as to whether there will be further reductions in funding next year or dramatic, deep-rooted change to the programme, or whether it will be overhauled entirely.  That is causing a lot of stress.<\/p>  <p>  I recently met nine principals from DEIS schools in my constituency and our local co-ordinator on the question of the future and security of the school completion programme.  They have gone through a very turbulent time, which goes without saying, in terms of a reduction in funding.  They have moved from a model of part funding from the European Union to the Department of Education and Skills, and are now under the umbrella of Tusla.  There has been a lot of chopping and changing, which has contributed to the sense of uncertainty.<\/p>  <p>  The service nationally has experienced a substantial cut in funding from &euro;32.9 million in 2008 to &euro;24.7 million in 2014.  It is fair to say that while everybody understands the enormous economic challenges the State has faced since 2008, it is essential that the most vulnerable in our society are protected.  It is also essential that programmes that are proven to produce results are protected, that their funding is ring-fenced and that they are supported and grow.  That has to be a priority and I would very much welcome any statement from the Minister in that regard, in terms of a commitment to expanding and continuing the school completion programme because it is working.  I know from first-hand experience in my constituency, which has some of the most deprived areas in the whole country, that children who are extremely vulnerable to mitching school and early school leaving benefit from this programme.  It is working and all of the principals in all of the schools in my constituency would back that up 100%, as would teachers.<\/p>  <p>  We are awaiting the result of an ESRI report on this matter.  I understand it was due in March and has still not been forthcoming.  It has not been published; I am not sure whether it has been provided to the Minister or Tusla but it has not been made public.  It is anxiously awaited and, incidentally, ties in with the very good and comprehensive report the ESRI published in recent weeks on the overarching challenges facing DEIS schools.  It was a wide-ranging report which investigated the effectiveness or otherwise of DEIS schools.  An interesting recommendation, which I am sure the Minister has read in detail, is the concentration of resources on band 1 schools in urban areas, which are the most vulnerable and where, unfortunately, the least amount of progress is being made.<\/p>  <p>  The ESRI recommendation focuses on DEIS schools but there is a reference to the school completion programme.  It very clearly and concretely recommends the concentration of resources in the most vulnerable schools in urban areas.  I would like to hear whether the Minister would support a similar focus in terms of the school completion programme, that is, the concentration of resources in the most vulnerable areas.  It is logical and is what this programme is all about, namely, ensuring that every citizen, in particular every child in our State, is cherished and has equal opportunities.  We know that is not the case.<\/p>  <p>  The ESRI report on DEIS schools tells us what we already know, but it is worth reiterating.  DEIS schools are more likely to have students who come from unskilled, manual or non-employed households, parents who have lower levels of education and families with lower household incomes.  Children in such schools are more likely to come from lone parent families.  There is a range of factors which are entirely predictable and mean these children are more vulnerable and require much greater intervention.  I am very keen to hear the Minister's thoughts on that report and how it directly affects the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100033#FF00300","speaker":"1186"},{"type":"speech","time":1429636500,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question.

It involves 124 projects and related initiatives operating in 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  These projects provide a range of supports and interventions designed to support approximately 36,000 children identified by local management committees as being at risk of educational disadvantage.  Typically, projects offer homework clubs, breakfast clubs, mentoring programmes, learning support, social and personal development programmes, out-of-school supports, including music, art and sports, and a range of activities during holiday periods.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has had operational responsibility for the school completion programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects.  In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million was provided for the school completion programme.  The agency has indicated a similar allocation for the programme in 2015.  It has approved local projects school retention plans for the 2014-15 academic year.

The review is being overseen by a steering committee involving officials of the Child and Family Agency, my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  The review will, among other things, examine the school completion programme structures and their fitness for purpose to support an integrated approach to address early school leaving.

It is envisaged that its final report will be delivered very shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Education and Skills recently published an evaluation of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, or DEIS, programme which was also prepared by the ESRI, and which refers to the school completion programme as an integral support within DEIS in improving attendance and engagement in education, something the Deputy mentioned in her remarks.  I would like to reiterate that I have advised the agency of my commitment to ensuring that there is no diminution in the school completion programme services.<\/p>  <p>  The school completion programme is an important service within the agency's educational welfare services.  It is, as Deputy Creighton and many other Deputies have said over the past number of months, a highly regarded programme and a key response in securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving.

It has tremendous value and goes a long way towards levelling the playing pitch to ensure children at risk of finishing school earlier than they should will remain in the educational process.  As one goes around the country and examines the various areas in which the programme is implemented, and the various ways in which it is implemented, one realises it is important that the co-ordinators follow the lead of the students themselves and find out from them what they are interested in.  They should use this knowledge as a means of leading the students back into education and explain to them that if they had a better understanding of mathematics or another subject, they would be better able to pursue their interest in a certain area, be it carpentry, cookery or another practice.

The first two Topical Issue debates were taken by the relevant line Minister.<\/p>  <p>  When I first started raising this issue with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, he told me IBRC operated at arm&rsquo;s length from the State.  As I probed deeper, he conceded his Department was concerned about the Siteserv deal but that he was satisfied it was in the best interest of the State.  When I pushed further, he eventually admitted that far from being satisfied, his Department actually conducted a full review of the deal and that following that review, the Department made a decision to second one of its officials to the board of IBRC to provide greater oversight.  Six months later, IBRC was wound up in a very rushed fashion.<\/p>  <p>  Today, I received freedom of information documents from the Department of Finance which show not only that the Minister was not satisfied the deal was the best one for the State but that he believed the deal resulted in a less than optimum return for the bank and, by extension, the State.

That led me to a web of potential conflicts of interest which I am still trying to understand.  I refer to people such as Mr. Richard Woodhouse, the head of specialised asset management in IBRC, who also managed the Siteserv account and the personal borrowings of the Siteserv CEO, Brian Harvey, as well as being a personal friend of Denis O'Brien.

I have been told by a whistleblower, although I am open to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s version of this, that Millington was not even considered in the first round of bids and that Millington received a letter from the aforementioned Mr. Richard Woodhouse informing it that it needed to change its bid if it was to be considered in the second round.  Millington added a &euro;5 million cash sweetener for the shareholders to the bid and Millington was successful.  The memo I got through freedom of information today again reiterates the point and the Minister&rsquo;s concern that the decision to exclude trade buyers was serious.  It is even more serious in the context of the metering contract which was later won.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier today the Taoiseach told this House that the relationship framework governing the transaction was the 2009 framework, which did not require IBRC to involve the Department in the transaction.  However, the freedom of information documents show that negotiations for the implementation of the new framework were ongoing for some time prior to that.  I believe there were approximately 30 versions of it prior to the Siteserv deal.  It came into effect two weeks after the conclusion of the deal.  The documents further suggest that IBRC's CEO, Mike Aynsley, and the board resisted the implementation of the new framework at every hand&rsquo;s turn until the Siteserv deal was concluded.  I need to have an answer to that.<\/p>  <p>  IBRC had been told by the Department to act as if the framework were in place earlier than when the Siteserv deal was concluded.  Why did it not do so?  Did Mr. Alan Dukes, as chairman of IBRC, ignore the instruction to act as if the framework were in place?  The strange relationships and extremely fractious relationship between the Department and IBRC and the concerns surrounding the Siteserv transaction and other large transactions raise serious questions about the real reasons underpinning the eventual \"prom night\" in which IBRC was wound down in a very hurried fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100034#GG00400","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1429637100,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising the issue.  I am grateful to have an opportunity to place some information on this matter on the record of the House.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 March 2012, the board of IBRC met and approved the sale of Siteserv.  Under the relationship framework that was in place between the Minister for Finance and the bank at that time, which had been place since July 2009, the board of IBRC was required to engage with the Minister for Finance on certain key issues, which included \"any material acquisitions, disposals, investments, realisations or other transactions, other than in the ordinary course of Anglo Irish Bank's banking business.\"<\/p><p>It should be noted that this relationship framework did not include any specific monetary thresholds which would trigger mandatory consultation with the Minister for Finance.  It should also be noted that at the time the ordinary course of the bank's business was to conduct an orderly run-down of the bank.  As such, IBRC's efforts, as a secured lender, to maximise the recovery on its loans to Siteserv was considered to be in the ordinary course of business.  For that reason, and under the relationship framework in place at that time, IBRC was not required to consult the Minister for Finance on this matter in advance of making the decision to approve the sale of Siteserv.<\/p> <p> Upon receipt of critical representations following the transaction, Department of Finance officials inquired about the transaction with IBRC management as part of their regular engagement.  Following initial discussions, they agreed with IBRC's chairman and CEO, on 31 May 2012, that they would review the transaction involving Siteserv in greater detail to better understand the decisions taken and the impact these decisions had on the process and the final recovery for the bank.  Through this review, which took place on 11 June 2012, Department of Finance officials were concerned that IBRC had decided to allow Siteserv to control the sales process rather than itself acting in a primary role in this transaction.  This decision appears to have given rise to a number of other subsequent actions which could quite reasonably be considered to have caused a reduction in the bank's recovery on the Siteserv exposure.  These included the exclusion of potential trade buyers from the sales process, the fact that legal advisors to Siteserv also acted for the purchaser, and the making of a payment to the shareholders of Siteserv.  In light of these concerns, the shareholding management unit of the Department of Finance recommended that the chairman of IBRC commission an independent review of the transaction, and this was included in a briefing note to the Minister for Finance prior to his meeting the chairman and CEO of IBRC.<\/p> <p> On 25 July 2012, the Minister for Finance met IBRC's chairman and CEO to discuss concerns regarding this transaction which were raised with him by Department of Finance officials following their engagement with IBRC management.  The chairman and CEO gave strong assurances that the transaction had been thoroughly assessed by the IBRC board and that the management and board of IBRC were satisfied that the transaction was managed in the best manner possible to achieve the best result for the State, including the decision to allow Siteserv to control the sales process.  At this meeting, the chairman and CEO further confirmed and provided assurances, with regard to the specific concerns previously mentioned, that trade buyers had been excluded due to the potential damage to Siteserv's competitive position that might otherwise have arisen; that the legal advice was provided by two different teams within the law firm concerned, and that appropriate Chinese walls were in place between the two teams; and that the payment to shareholders was necessary to ensure a vote in favour of the deal.<\/p> <p> To help prevent such concerns regarding the quality of decisions taken by IBRC management from arising in the future, the Minister for Finance requested that a further meeting take place between the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, John Moran, and the then CEO of IBRC.  A meeting took place in August 2012 at which this matter was further discussed.  At that point, and at all other points mentioned above, the transaction had been concluded and no further action could have been taken.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding the fact that a revised relationship framework and operational protocol had been put in place on 29 March 2012, it was decided following John Moran's meeting with the then CEO of IBRC in August 2012 that a senior Department of Finance official would be seconded to IBRC to explore opportunities for deleveraging with a view to maximising the recovery for the taxpayer.  This had the additional benefit of supporting the management team while also providing greater oversight, given that a number of matters within IBRC at that time raised concerns with Department of Finance officials.  The secondment of Neil Ryan to IBRC commenced shortly thereafter, in October 2012, and he took up his role as the bank's new head of market solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100034#GG00500","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429637700,"counter":390,"content":"<p>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, went out of his way on the night IBRC was wound down to compliment the board of IBRC.  He stated, \"I wish to emphasise that the reasons the steps are being taken are entirely distinct from the performance or the direction of the board of management of IBRC.\"  He also stated: \"I acknowledge, with much appreciation, the significant efforts the directors and staff have made\".  This is at odds with some of what I have received under the freedom of information provisions, including an internal memo from the Department which states that it was concerned at the number of very large transactions of over &euro;100 million that were poorly executed under the direction of the then CEO, Mike Aynsley.  The memo also states that the performance management in executing these transactions raised the question of the effectiveness of the CEO.<\/p>  <p>  Much of what the Minister of State said I could probably have written myself because of the information I have received through parliamentary questions, which was like pulling hen's teeth, but a whole lot of other questions need to be answered.  There were many other very large transactions and we need to know what they were.  The people whom the Minister of State and I meet every day, who are struggling and who bailed out the bank, have an entitlement to know they got as much as was possible.  It seems that a golden circle is operating and that there are serious conflicts of interest all over the place.  I would go so far as to say I believe there needs to be an independent inquiry into this transaction.  If it is the case that a company, by virtue of winning that deal, was positioned to go on and win lucrative deals such as a metering contract, as was in the news, to the exclusion of other people who were trade buyers, one must ask why this could have happened.  There are very serious questions which undermine democracy, and transparency needs to be the winner in this.  I compliment the officials in the Department because from a lot of this I can see that they were really doing their job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100035#HH00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1429637700,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Every action taken by the Government and the Minister for Finance has been taken with the aim outlined by Deputy Murphy: to minimise the cost of bailing out the bank to the Irish taxpayer and to restore our banking sector to a functioning reality so it can continue to serve the Irish economy.  We may disagree on this, but it is the reason for the efforts undertaken by officials in the Department of Finance, whom the Deputy has rightly complimented, and by the Minister for Finance.<\/p>  <p>  I have already outlined how the Minister, once these concerns were brought to his attention - after the transaction had been completed, under a relationship framework put in place by the previous Government which did not require him to be consulted - took a number of steps, including meeting the chairman and the CEO, asking the then Secretary General to meet them and seconding Mr. Neil Ryan to IBRC from the Department of Finance.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Ireland's third review under the EU-IMF programme of financial support, a report on which was published in September 2011, Ireland committed to a number of conditions and actions.  One of these was to develop a framework to govern the exercise of the State's ownership rights in the banks resulting from the capital injections, including to put in place relationship frameworks with the banks to protect the commercial basis for the banks' operations while under State ownership.  The end of March 2012 was the deadline put in place for the introduction of these relationship frameworks with each of the banks in which the State acquired an interest in the context of the financial crisis, to govern the relationship between the State, as shareholder, and each bank.  The relationship frameworks were designed to recognise the separation of each bank from the State, to ensure their businesses would be run on a commercial, cost-effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset to the State, and to limit the State's intervention to the extent necessary to protect the public interest.  New frameworks were put in place, and the revised relationship framework introduced with IBRC was considerably more intrusive than those with the other banks, and rightly so, as this was necessary given the increased level of oversight required in view of the unique position of IBRC as a run-down vehicle financially supported by the State through the promissory notes, and the Department of Finance's experience to date with IBRC at that time.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy knows and has heard it from the Government that the ultimate decision to liquidate IBRC was taken in the context of the overall cost to the State of its orderly wind-down, which was being supported by the promissory notes at a heavy cost to the State.  What concerns existed about certain management decisions are documented by the Department of Finance, and I have acknowledged them.  Ultimately, the aim of minimising the cost of the orderly wind-down of IBRC was of primary concern to the Government.  While it is not possible for any of us to express definitive views in the House on commercial decisions taken by boards of banks, it is possible to clearly set out the facts.

Along with my colleagues, I attended a public meeting on Friday night in my home town of Castledermot.  It was called to discuss an issue that has caused many a sleepless night for the residents of three townlands close to the town, Madges Lane, Davidstown and Ballybannon: a repossession order granted from the High Court in regard to farmlands adjacent to the stated areas.  The High Court decision is not part of the Topical Issue.  However, I have grave concerns in regard to the actions that resulted from the decision and, in particular, the efforts of the receiver to repossess the property.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, upwards of 30 men, dressed in black, sought to access the property in the hours of darkness.  Rural Ireland has suffered a lot from burglaries, theft, anti-social behaviour, etc., over the past number of years, to the point that communities have united to protect their properties and communities.  One need only travel to practically any part of the country to see the great work and actions that those communities are involved in to give a sense of protection to themselves and their loved ones.  I know from personal experience the great work that community texting does in my own community.  In this context, one cannot but have concerns in regard to the actions outlined, with upwards of 30 men dressed in black, some with dogs and some wearing balaclavas, arriving at a rural location in the middle of the night.  Can we explain this arrival in a rural area in the middle of the night?  It is inexplicable that this was allowed to happen.  It cannot be right, and we cannot but imagine the torment of those living in this rural location, many of whom are elderly.  One woman of 75 years of age says she has not gone outside her door since.<\/p>  <p>  What is the procedure in regard to such actions?  Is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na informed or asked to attend?  Has the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the authority to say to the receiver that he or she cannot attend because of the hour of the night?  Can the Minister of State please inform us whether, through the legislative process, we can ensure that actions as a result of such High Court decisions can take place only between dawn and dusk?  We do not want to see it happen in our community or any other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100036#JJ00100","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1429638300,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being in attendance to discuss this issue.  There always have been and, unfortunately, always will be repossessions of houses, land and property, and it is a dreadful vista for any individual or family, but it happens only at the end of a lengthy process.  It is a dreadful experience for others living nearby.  Leaving aside the rights or wrongs of individual repossession cases, I am concerned about the protocols or guidelines for dealing with such issues.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, an ongoing case in south Kildare came to a head when receivers acting on a court order attempted to take possession of land at three o'clock in the morning.  It is reported that men wearing hoods with dogs were there.  Neighbours stated that land was trespassed on and great intimidation took place as the situation escalated.  I do not know if those in the hoods with dogs were the receivers or the protestors, but the activity took place in the middle of the night, and land belonging third parties, who had no truck with what was going on, was crossed.  Elderly people living alone were subjected to the sight of these strangers going around the area.  My concern in this instance is primarily for neighbouring residents and landowners who have no involvement with either the receivers or the landowner against whom the order was made.  This was always likely to be a flashpoint, because protestors were present and receivers were moving in.<\/p>  <p>  In the event that a receiver is in possession of a court order, the only role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to keep the peace, but surely the view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have to be taken on board by the receiver if it decides on a course of action?  What guidelines or protocols, other than those to do with keeping the peace, exist for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that those innocent people who live nearby are not put at risk and that their property is not interfered with?  Does the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have any say or role if receivers decide to move on a property in the middle of the night?  What protocols exist for receivers?  If the court order does not stipulate how the order is to be enforced, is there a limit to the level of force that can be used?  If the only role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to keep the peace, and garda&iacute; cannot stop receivers acting at certain times in a certain manner that may inflame a situation, we are asking the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to play referee between two factions with their hands tied behind their back.  This is a dreadful situation.  We must learn from it and ensure such events do not happen in Castledermot or elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100036#JJ00200","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1429638300,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who regrets she is unable to be present for the debate due to other official commitments.  I will bring the views of the Deputies to her attention.<\/p>  <p>  Without wanting to comment on the specific circumstances of any particular case, the Minister is very much aware of the strain that can arise for individuals and their families when their personal or business finances become distressed.  In these circumstances, repossession of a home or other property inevitably brings those pressures to a head.  As public representatives, we have all engaged with people struggling in these circumstances, and it is undoubtedly one of the most tangible legacies of the national economic mismanagement which this Government has been grappling with.<\/p>  <p>  This Government has put in place a broad strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears and family home repossessions.  This included an extensive suite of interventions designed to address the problem, including specific Central Bank targets for the banks through the mortgage arrears resolution targets, MART.  In addition, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears produced by the Central Bank sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in, or facing, mortgage arrears.  We have also seen the extensive recasting of the personal insolvency legislation, including the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the introduction of the personal insolvency agreement model.  In addition, we have enhanced the provision of advice through initiatives led by Department of Social Protection.  Furthermore, the mortgage to rent scheme has been put in place to assist borrowers who are in an unsustainable mortgage position in remaining in their homes through the involvement of social housing agencies.<\/p>  <p>  I call attention to the review of the insolvency legislation announced as part of the statement of Government priorities.  This involved consultations with all the relevant stakeholders and has been completed by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Work is currently under way across Government Departments to develop a comprehensive and effective response to help those trapped in unsustainable debt to arrive at sustainable solutions.  That work is expected to conclude shortly, and the Government's action plan in this area will be announced.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is conscious of the painful situations that have arisen for families and farm and business owners, a number of which have been raised specifically with her as Minister.  As these cases are matters that have been, or are, before the courts, it would not be appropriate for her to comment on their specifics.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the issues raised by the Deputies concerning the need for Garda guidelines on repossessions, it is important to be clear about the role and functions of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in these circumstances.  The proceedings that give rise to repossessions are first and foremost civil proceedings in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not a party.  There may be situations in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na becomes aware, or is notified, that a property is to be the subject of enforcement proceedings on foot of a court order.  In those circumstances, it is an operational matter for Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na management to assess whether a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na presence is advisable so as to prevent any risk of a breach of the peace.  Preserving public order is an essential function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether in circumstances relating to repossession or otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  Where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attends in those circumstances, it is equally important to be clear that it does not have a role in the repossession process itself, unless specific actions are directed by the court, and is not in a position to act as an arbiter in the proceedings.  There may be confusion on this point in the public mind, but this is the legal position and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is clear about this when present in such circumstances.  Issues of difference or difficulty concerning the enforcement of the order are matters for the parties to resolve before the courts.<\/p>  <p>  Where a breach of the peace occurs, there are of course provisions in public order and other legislation that may apply.  Similarly, where an individual has concerns that a criminal action may be have been committed by any person in the course of such proceedings, this is a matter that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will investigate.  Furthermore, if a person feels he or she has grounds for complaint about the actions of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this or any other matter, it can be pursued through a complaint to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has no function with regard to persons appointed to execute courts orders who are operating under the aegis of the courts.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Minister underlines that, as a matter of general Government policy, the effective management of the mortgage arrears challenges remains under continuous review.  More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears.  As the Taoiseach has previously announced, the Government is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100036#JJ00300","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1429638900,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I accept that the core issue is probably not highlighted in the format of the Topical Issue we submitted.

This Bill has dragged on for a number of years and there has been extensive input from various stakeholders around the make-up of the new authority.  The amendment reflects the perspective I have heard from key stakeholders.  There is a range of experience, and there should be a balance of people from the legal fraternity and people from the lay fraternity who have relevant expertise and who could make a real contribution.  In terms of a new dispensation and giving the new authority a clear, strong, independent footing from the beginning, but also having representation from the legal fraternity, this is a better proposition than that offered initially by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100037#KK04100","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1429638900,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I have considered the proposed Opposition amendments, Nos. 7 to 11, relating to the modalities of the appointment of the new legal services regulatory authority.  I think the Deputy will agree that these amendments remain pretty much as put forward before.  They do not give due recognition to the enhancements made by the Government to the legislation and to the committee discussion at which these concerns were outlined.  The relevant enhancements made on Committee Stage met the core concerns about the appointment procedures of the new authority which were on the table at that time - namely, how authority members would now be nominated independently of the Government.  Authority members will now be nominated independently of the Government, and we are also setting out their terms and maximum duration of office, including the modalities of resignation, removal and disqualification, and the filling of temporary vacancies.<\/p><p>The election of a lay chair and the gender balance of the authority's overall membership have also been consolidated into the text, which has also been adjusted, for example, to take account of the destigmatisation of bankruptcy under the Government's insolvency reforms.  The group of amendments being tabled does not adequately take into account the intervening developments of the Bill on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, and they remain in essence as positioned by the Bar Council in its document of 12 March.  Regarding the Opposition amendments, this is particularly the case for the duplicate amendments Nos. 7 and 8, which set out a series of similar criteria for the establishment and membership of the new legal services regulatory authority with some variations from what is provided for in the Bill under section 8.<br\/><br\/>Having reviewed the intervening development of the Bill and the key qualitative improvements made regarding the appointments to the new legal services regulatory authority, I do not believe there are any fundamental disparities remaining in how the Bill deals with the issues concerned.  The safeguards in the Bill, and those reflected in today's reiterated Opposition amendments, therefore, reflect a series of common concerns which have been met substantially under the Bill as it stands.  The reconfiguration of section 8 of the Bill on Committee Stage put to rest the initial concerns raised upon the publication of the Bill about the independence of the authority from ministerial or Government interference.  There will be no Government appointments, lay, legal or official, to the authority, which makes it more robustly independent in this regard than it would be, for example, under today's Opposition amendment No. 9, which would allow the Government to appoint the lay members.  The authority, as a statutory regulator, would also be independent of the Judiciary in its appointment, as befits the fact that under the Bill's independent professional conduct regime, proceedings may come before the High Court which retain key functions regarding the termination of matters of professional conduct by legal practitioners.  Taking into account the obvious virtues of independence of the Government and Judiciary, I do not see merit in amendments Nos. 9 and 10.<br\/><br\/>Members of both Houses will welcome the fact that section 8 of the Bill provides that members of the authority shall be appointed only following the passing of a resolution approving such appointments by both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  This important model safeguard provision is consistent with the highest international standard.  The proposed amendment No. 11 has been made redundant by the fact that the lay membership of the new regulatory authority is to be appointed by means of the external nominating bodies to which I have already referred.  I have given consideration to the possible addition of further members to the new legal service regulatory authority, including in light of earlier discussions on Committee Stage.<br\/><br\/>The authority is to be a regulator of the provision of legal services in the State by legal practitioners and, therefore, is not an entity of the social partnership model.  The authority is to have a membership of 11 members with a lay majority.  The six lay nominees will be drawn from the Citizens' Information Board - which everybody will welcome - the Higher Education Authority, the Competition Authority, the recently merged Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, whose title under section 8(4) will be updated in the Seanad, the Institute of Legal Costs Accountants and the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  It is very important that consumers have representation on the legal regulatory authority.  If I were to add even more lay members, and a further two legal representatives, we would move towards a much more administratively cumbersome body of approximately 15 people.  The balance of interest between the legal profession and the consumers of legal services at the levels of the individual community and enterprise can be met and regulated effectively and most efficiently under the current configuration of 11 members.  I do not intend to enlarge the membership of the authority beyond this, in order to ensure that it will be an efficient body that gets on with the job that has to be done and makes decisions.<br\/><br\/>Great care has been taken in ensuring that the concerns that have been expressed since the publication of the Bill about the independence of the new regulatory regime in its appointment and functions have been addressed.  Only a slight difference of emphasis remains between the proposals being put forward today and the Bill's current provisions regarding this area of the Bill, and I hope, in light of the points I have made and the considerable enhancements, including in particular the very important point about independence, that the Deputies will withdraw amendments Nos. 7 to 11, inclusive.<br\/><br\/>The first of the next group of amendments, tabled by Deputy Catherine Murphy, amendment No. 11<i>a<\/i>, seeks to preclude any person who is served with the Solicitor's Disciplinary Tribunal, the Barristers' Professional Conduct Tribunal or its appeals board from becoming a member of the authority.  Similarly, amendment No. 49<i>f<\/i>seeks to preclude any barrister who has served on the Bar Council or any of its permanent or non-permanent committees from becoming a member of the committee being established under section 44 of the Bill to review complaints about inadequate services.  Amendment No. 50<i>a<\/i>also seeks to preclude any barrister who has served on the Bar Council or a Bar Council committee, the Barristers' Professional Conduct Tribunal or the Barristers' Professional Conduct Appeals Board from eligibility for the chairmanship of the new legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal, as set out under the terms of section 63 of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>While I can see that the amendments seek to put maximum distance between the workings of the Solicitors' Disciplinary Tribunal and Bar Council and those of the new regulatory entities concerned, they would, by the same token, be likely to exclude many people with relevant experience.  This is by virtue of the fact that the amendments, if implemented, would exclude a very large number of barristers and solicitors from participating in the capacities concerned, including some who would have relevant experience in the types of complaint and disciplinary procedure involved.  Over the years, a large number of legal practitioners would have held office or served on such tribunals or committees, and it remains desirable that they could be drawn from to enable the new regulatory architecture to function effectively.  This is acceptable.  Under section 63 of the Bill, the chair of the legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal may, under the specific criteria set out, be a lawyer or a non-lawyer.  The chair, whether a lay person, a solicitor or a barrister, will be appointed by the President of the High Court for a five-year term, once renewable, from the list of persons nominated by the Minister for membership of the tribunal.<br\/><br\/>In light of these safeguards already in place and the very practical considerations that clearly arise regarding the availability of suitable candidates for membership of the committee and the position of chair of the disciplinary tribunal, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 11<i>a<\/i>, 49<i>f<\/i>or 50<i>a<\/i>.  I hope my detailed explanation, particularly regarding the first set of amendments, illustrates that we have taken on board and dealt with the concerns that were expressed on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100037#KK04200","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429639500,"counter":441,"content":"<p>While there have been some improvements, the Minister has not accepted the proposal that there be 13 members on the authority, which would give her scope for including very relevant organisations.

Anybody would accept that the bodies on it represent a very broad range of groups and concerns.

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission brings a wealth of experience to the board in respect of citizens' rights and basic equality.  I have explained in considerable detail why we have taken this direction with regard to representation and I believe that, as currently constituted, the balance of interests is well represented on the regulatory authority.  It is not exclusive and does not exclude any particular perspective.  It brings a broad range of perspectives to bear on decision making.  Ultimately, we wish to have an authority that works effectively and efficiently and that has the numbers that will lead to good decision making.  I am satisfied that the current approach achieves that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100039#MM00100","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1429640100,"counter":443,"content":"<p>One of the issues this Bill was supposed to deal with - in which it has not succeeded, although amendments have been made - was the cost of accessing justice for citizens.  One of the challenges for the legal fraternity in terms of its reputation is to look increasingly at its role as an advocate for citizens in terms of their rights and to ensure there is affordable access to the legal system and a change in how we conduct law in this country from the archaic, very expensive and, arguably, elitist judicial system, as some people perceive it.  I have much admiration for people in the legal fraternity, but there are perceptions, which are sometimes the reality, about how the system has worked.<\/p>  <p>  It is a serious omission.  The Minister could easily increase the number on the board to 13, an argument I made to the Minister's predecessor, and provide a place at the table for organisations such as the Free Legal Advice Centres, which are strongly respected, the ICCL and other groups that are champions or advocates for the citizen and that challenge all of us in terms of how the administration of justice works.  Having people of that calibre on the authority could only strengthen it.  They would be alternative voices.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously the error of not including them on this board for the sake of two extra places.  The Minister argues that ICTU and IBEC need not be on the authority because it is not a social partnership model, and I reluctantly accept that point.  However, I do not understand why she cannot include the advocacy organisations that are so respected in the community and that could bring a dynamic to the authority that does not exist based on the current membership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100039#MM00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1429640100,"counter":444,"content":"<p>How stands the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100039#MM00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1429640100,"counter":445,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Minister could respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015042100039#MM00400","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1429640100,"counter":446,"content":"<p>It is Report Stage, so the Minister has concluded and you have just replied.
